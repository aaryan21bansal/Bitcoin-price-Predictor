Goto Energy goes bust amid rising gas prices,"Goto Energy has become the latest UK energy firm to cease trading amid a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices. The firm supplied gas and electricity to around 22,000 domestic customers who will now be moved to a new supplier. It joins a number of small firms that have gone bust following a global spike in gas prices. Energy regulator Ofgem will now find a new supplier for households, who are asked to do nothing until the transfer takes place in the coming weeks. Goto Energy's collapse takes the number of customers affected by the current wave of UK energy company failures to more than two million. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Ofgem said,externalthat the unprecedented increase in global gas prices - which have risen 250% since the start of the year - was putting financial pressure on suppliers. ""Ofgem's number one priority is to protect customers,"" said Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem. ""I want to reassure affected customers that they do not need to worry: under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies continue."" Mr Lawrence added that if customers have credit, the funds are protected, so customers will not lose the money that is owed to them. ""Goto Energy is now the 16th provider to exit the market since the beginning of 2021,"" said Justina Miltienyte, energy policy expert at Uswitch.com. She said it was important that Goto Energy customers did not do anything until they were moved to a new supplier, as trying to switch providers could create administrative delays in getting their credit balance returned. ""They should make a note of their meter readings now, and again when contacted by their new supplier, to ensure their bills are accurate."" Last week, Pure Planet, which was backed by oil giant BP, and Colorado Energy joined the growing list of small energy firms that have gone bust recently. Pure Planet said it had been caught between rising costs and the UK's energy price cap, which limits what companies can charge consumers. This had left its business ""unsustainable"", it said. Nine suppliers collapsed in September, but business and energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng ruled out supporting struggling energy firms, although he warned more companies could collapse. The regulator's price cap, which covers 15 million households across England, Wales and Scotland, protects customers on default tariffs by limiting charges including how much customers pay per unit of energy. Why are gas prices so high? PM expected to back loans for gas price-hit firms But providers say they cannot pass on rising wholesale gas prices to customers because of the cap. Suppliers that have recently gone bust include Avro Energy, People's Energy and Green Supplier Limited. Rising prices have had reverberations throughout the supply chain. Last week, gas shipping firm CNG wrote to its energy supplier customers saying that it would no longer supply the wholesale market. CNG supplies roughly 46,000 small businesses, including 10-15 small domestic energy suppliers, through its wholesale business. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?

Camera mistakes woman's sweater for number plate,"Paula and Dave Knight said they thought it was a joke when they received the fine A couple were sent a fine for driving in a bus lane when a camera mistook a word on a woman's clothing for their number plate. Dave and Paula Knight, from Surrey, received the fine for driving in a bus lane in Bath despite not being in the city at the time. A camera had registered the word 'knitter' on a pedestrian's clothing as Mr Knight's number plate KN19 TER. ""We thought one of our friends was stitching us up,"" said Mrs Knight. Bath and North East Somerset Council (BANES) confirmed the fine had been cancelled. Mrs Knight bought her husband the personalised number plate, which is meant to read as his nickname 'Knighter', for his birthday Mr Knight said they planned to frame the notice and put it on the mantelpiece. ""I was looking for my vehicle in it [the picture] and thinking to myself have I been to Bath? ""The poor lady walking down the bus lane has got a top on very similar to my number plate but her handbag is blocking one of the letters out so it assumed it was my number plate,"" he said. Mrs Knight said she thought it was a joke but when none of their friends came forward, they contacted the council. ""When we looked at the photo it was of a lady with 'knitter' on her sweatshirt and KN19 TER is my husband's number plate. ""I think it's bizarre and very funny, this poor lady has been changed over into a vehicle rather than a person overnight, "" she said. Mrs Knight said when she contacted the council, they initially told her the fine would need to be paid but when the staff member looked at the image she ""burst out laughing"". The automated bus lane camera in Bath mistakenly registered the word knitter on the woman's sweatshirt as Mr Knight's number plate ""I'm a bit worried about going to Bath again now. I don't know if we'll take the van, we might take the train,"" she added. BANES cabinet member for transport Manda Rigby said she was pleased that Mr and Mrs Knight had seen the funny side and that it had given the team ""a few giggles"". ""The camera picked up the logo and thought it was a number plate. It doesn't happen often and when we went back to look the fine was cancelled immediately. ""It did give us a smile particularly because Mr and Mrs Knight took it so well,"" she said. Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Households to get Â£5,000 to help buy heat pumps","It is hoped no new gas boilers will be sold after 2035 as part of government strategy Experts have criticised plans to subsidise low-carbon heat pumps in place of gas boilers for homeowners in England and Wales from next April. Households will be offered subsidies of Â£5,000 from next April to help them make the switch. Although up to 25 million UK homes have gas boilers, the grants will fund just 90,000 pumps over three years. The government says this will boost demand for the pumps, but critics say the plan does not go far enough. Homeowners will be encouraged to switch to a heat pump or other low-carbon technology when their current boiler needs replacing. An air-source heat pump costs between Â£6,000 and Â£18,000, depending on the type installed and the size of a property. Ministers say the subsidies will make heat pumps a comparable price to a new gas boiler. However, the Â£450m being allocated for the subsidies over three years has been criticised as insufficient. Experts also point to the need for costly new insulation and other home improvements to help households get the best out of the switch. ""Gas is in the news for price increases that are on the horizon,"" said Dr David Glew, head of energy efficiency and policy at the Leeds Sustainability Institute at Leeds Beckett University. ""But gas is actually relatively cheap to heat your home with,"" he added. ""Needing to insulate your house might cost you tens of thousands of pounds and you're only going to be saving several hundreds of pounds, so the economics of that doesn't really add up."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Green is good, green is right, green works"" Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said the number of heat pumps that the grants would cover ""just isn't very much"" and meant the UK would not meet its climate targets. ""These grants will only incentivise the best-off households,"" he said. Greenpeace UK's climate campaigner, Caroline Jones, said the government needed to provide more money to speed up the switch. ""A clearer signal would have been a phase-out of new boilers before 2035,"" she said. The government says it wants no new gas boilers to be sold after 2035, but it has not banned them outright. Writingin the Sun,external, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The Greenshirts of the Boiler Police are not going to kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet and seize, at carrot-point, your trusty old combi."" Downing Street later declined to say whether the government would ban gas boilers in the future, after international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said ""there will be a point"" when the voluntary approach would change. Read more about the UK's climate change targets. Tips on how to save energy at home and help the planet Jonny Marshall, senior economist the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on poverty, said the UK would struggle to meet its goal of cutting emissions from homes in half by 2035. The UK has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. But a group of experts that advises the government says Boris Johnson's government has credible policies in place to deliver only about a fifth of this cut. Helen Selman lives with her husband and two children in Chippenham. When they moved into a 1930s semi, they knew they wanted to undertake home improvements, an upgrade to the heating system and an extension. ""It was not cheap,"" she said. ""But because we were doing everything else, and because this was going to be our forever home, it made sense."" Helen chose an air-source heat pump but alongside it, they had a specifically designed insulation upgrade, new radiators and brand new underfloor heating. ""With a heat pump, the problem is that you have to make sure that your house is as well insulated as possible,"" she explained. ""We already had double or triple-glazing, we had insulated walls, we were upgrading the lofts."" To help with the project, Helen and her family used the old Renewable Heat Initiative funding: ""The RHI money will pay back quarterly over seven years and will go quite a long way to covering the costs."" She said: ""It's been definitely worth the bother."" But she admitted that without their own plans to extend and the added bonus of government cash, it might not have happened. ""Without an incentive, there are few people who have the cashflow or the passion to do this,"" she said. Heating buildings accounts for more than a fifth of the UK's overall greenhouse gas emissions, so there is pressure on the government's Heat and Buildings Strategy to deliver effective reductions. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the grants to support the adoption of heat pumps, available from next April, would help to bring down the cost of the relatively new technology by 2030. Heat pumps extract warmth from the air, the ground or water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse. They are powered by electricity, so if you have a low-carbon source of electricity, they provide greener heating. One energy firm, Octopus Energy, said it expected homeowners to pay about Â£2,500 to the cost of installing a heat pump, roughly equivalent to the cost of a new gas boiler. The government subsidy would cover the rest. But many houses will require an upgrade to their energy efficiency, including insulation, before installing one. A box of about one metre by one metre needs to be outside (close to or attached to the property) to draw in air. It should be at least one metre from your neighbour's property so they will not be able to hear it, although it shouldn't be much louder than your fridge. Read more: Should I get a heat pump and how much will it cost me? In total, Â£3.9bn funding is being provided, with most of that invested in decarbonising public buildings, insulating and installing new heating systems in social housing and for those on low incomes, and helping to provide clean heating networks for homes that are unsuitable for heat pumps. The plan also includes: Â£3.45bn to decarbonise buildings in England and Wales including social housing and district heating schemes Â£60m to drive technological innovation to develop clean heating systems that are smaller, easier to install and cheaper to run. This money will come from a previously announced innovation fund Independent climate think tank E3G said that setting the phase-out date for new fossil fuel boilers was ""a world-leading achievement"" and the pledge to reduce heat pump costs by 2030 was to be welcomed. However, the funding was insufficient to achieve the government's goals on reducing emissions, programme leader Pedro Guertler said. ""On energy efficiency alone, the public investment announced today falls Â£2bn short of what was pledged in the Conservative manifesto to 2025,"" he said. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, described the strategy as ""meagre, unambitious and wholly inadequate"", adding that Labour had pledged to spend Â£6bn a year on insulation and low carbon heating. The Liberal Democrats described the heating plan as ""a kick in the teeth for families across the country facing soaring energy bills this winter"". It's another piece in the Boris Johnson climate-calming jigsaw. First, he slots in a world-leading policy halting the sale of petrol cars by 2030. Now he lays down another piece - no new gas boilers after 2035. It's another trend-setting initiative that other nations will surely follow. There's a problem, though. Because by that date in the middle of the next decade, the PM has already pledged to cut emissions overall by 78% over 1990 levels. Energy experts say that simply won't happen unless he provides much wider incentives for people to insulate their homes and to buy heat pumps to replace their gas boilers. One group of researchers estimates that to meet his net zero targets he needs to invest nearly another Â£10bn over three years. They hope the chancellor will fill that piece of the jigsaw in his spending review next week. Industry sources welcomed the new strategy. The Confederation of British Industry said it would help members prepare for the changes ahead, but its chief policy director, Matthew Fell, called for ""a clear delivery plan for consumers, businesses and local authorities"". Scottish Power's chief executive, Keith Anderson, said it would kick-start demand for electric heating, ""allowing the industry to accelerate the delivery of electrification and quickly bring down upfront costs"".

Sir David wasstabbed to deathat Belfairs Methodist Church on Friday. He regularly championed Southend's case to be a city during his time in Parliament. Mr Johnson told the House of Commons he was ""happy"" to announce Southend ""will be accorded the city status it so clearly deserves"". The prime minister said: ""That Sir David spent almost 40 years in this House, but not one day in ministerial office, tells everything about where his priorities lay."" People in Leigh-on Sea have been remembering Sir David He added Sir David ""never once witnessed any achievement by any resident of Southend that could not somehow be cited in his bid to secure city status for that distinguished town"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he was ""so pleased"" by the announcement. Sir Keir said the news was ""a fitting tribute to Sir David's hard work"".

On its website,external, Southend-on-Sea Borough Council, which had campaigned with Sir David, previously said city status would bring not only ""prestige and standing, but an opportunity to lever further investment"". Southend is a tourist hotspot and has a thriving creative arts scene On the latest announcement, council leader Ian Gilbert said he felt a ""mixture of emotions"" after hearing the news. He said it was ""clearly what Sir David would have wanted"". ""While I don't want it to have come in these circumstances, I'm still pleased and proud that it is happening,"" he added.

I get abuse and threats online - why can't it be stopped?,"Online abuse against women is on the rise, but why aren't the police, the government and social media companies doing more to stop it? Warning: Story contains strong language I'm the BBC's first specialist disinformation reporter - and I receive abusive messages on social media daily. Most are too offensive to share unedited. The trigger? My coverage of the impact of online conspiracies and fake news. I expect to be challenged and criticised - but misogynistic hate directed at me has become a very regular occurrence. Messages are laden with slurs based on gender, and references to rape, beheading and sexual acts. Some are a mish-mash of conspiracy theories - that I'm ""Zionist-controlled"", that I, myself, am responsible for raping babies. The C-word and F-word are repeatedly used. It's not just me - from politicians around the world and Love Island stars to frontline doctors, I've been hearing from women subjected to the same kind of hate. New research, shared with the BBC, suggests women are more likely to receive this sort of abuse than men, it's getting worse - and it's often combined with racism and homophobia. I wanted to understand why this is happening, the threat it poses - and why social media sites, the police and the government aren't doing more about it. So, I set out to make a film for the BBC's Panorama programme. We set up a fake troll account across the five most popular social media platforms to see whether they are promoting misogynistic hate to such users. Using an AI-generated photograph, we designed our fake troll to be similar to the people who sent me abuse. Our troll engaged with content recommended by the social media platforms, but did not send out any hate. As part of the programme, think-tank Demos carried out a comprehensive deep dive into abuse received by reality TV contestants, analysing more than 90,000 posts and comments about them. It was perhaps a surprising place to start, but programmes like Love Island serve almost as a microcosm for society, allowing researchers to compare the abuse directed at men and women from different backgrounds. Their popularity also generates a lot of online conversation. Love Island contestants 2021 We discovered: Our troll account was recommended more and more anti-women content by Facebook and Instagram, some involving sexual violence. Female reality TV contestants - including those on this year's Love Island - are disproportionately targeted on social media, with abuse frequently rooted in misogyny and combined with racism. Draft proposals for the UN asking social media companies to better protect women have been shared exclusively with Panorama. Social media companies say they take online hate against women seriously - and they have rules to protect users from abuse. These include suspending, restricting or even shutting down accounts sending hate. But my experience suggests they often don't. I reported some of the worst messages I've ever received - including threats to come to my house to rape me and commit horrific sexual acts - to Facebook when I received them. But months later, the account remained on Facebook, along with dozens of other Instagram and Twitter accounts sending me abuse. It turns out my experience is part of a pattern. New research for this programme by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, shows how 97% of 330 accounts sending misogynistic abuse on Twitter and Instagram remained on the site after being reported. Twitter and Instagram say they take action when their rules are violated, and closing accounts isn't the only option. Find out more Watch Marianna Spring's Panorama - Online abuse: Why Do You Hate Me? on theBBC iPlayer(UK only) Curious about who was running accounts sending me - and other women - abuse, I started by looking into the profiles targeting me. Most were men and based in the UK. Everything from calling me a ""daft cow"" and telling me I needed to ""get laid"" to threatening to come and find me and violently or sexually attack me, they bombard me with gender-based slurs again and again. It turns out, they are real people - not bots. One is a Spurs fan, like me. Another likes vegan cooking. One, whose account was anonymous, even gave away his location by tweeting at delivery service Ocado complaining it didn't deliver to his postcode in Great Yarmouth. I reached out to them - and one called Steve, a van driver in his 60s from the Midlands, agreed to speak to me on the phone. The messages he'd sent me were less offensive than most of the abuse I receive - mainly gender-based slurs. Like lots of account holders who sent me hate, he is deep into online conspiracy theories. But like others, the abuse he sent me also attacked me for being a woman. At first he told me he didn't think his messages were that bad - but I explained they were just some of many punctuated with abuse streaming into my inbox. ""I probably made a mistake. I'm a pretty fair bloke,"" he eventually concluded. He pointed out that he actually receives hate himself online from ""people who believe in global warming and that 9/11 happened"". They are responding to conspiracy theories that he shares on social media. I had hoped this might help him see why hate wasn't the answer. And I think by the end of our conversation he was coming around to the idea. Marianna tries to find out more about the people sending you abuse Our conversation got me thinking about what my trolls might be seeing on their social media feeds. I wanted to see whether social media algorithms are pushing more misogyny to accounts similar to those that abuse women online. So I created a fake online persona called Barry and signed him up to the five most popular social media platforms in the UK. All the main social media companies say they don't promote hate on their platforms and take action to stop it. They each have algorithms that offer us content based on things we've posted, liked or watched in the past. But it's difficult to know what they push to each user. ""One of the onlyâ¯ways to do this is to manually create a profile and seeing the kind of rabbit hole that it might beâ¯ledâ¯down by theâ¯platform itself, once you start to follow certain groups or pages,"" explains social media expert Chloe Colliver, who advised me on the experiment. She works for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, looking into extremism and disinformation on social media. She has helped journalists before, and advises me on how I can set up the profiles in an ethical and realistic way - only doing what's necessary to test the algorithms. Barry's accounts were based on multiple accounts that had sent me abuse. Like my trolls, Barry was mainly interested in anti-vax content and conspiracy theories, and followed a small amount of anti-women content.  He also posted some abuse on his profile - so that the algorithms could detect from the start he had an account that used abusive language about women.  But unlike my trolls, he didn't message any women directly. Over two weeks, I logged in every couple of days and followed recommendations, posted to Barry's profiles, liked posts and watched videos. After just a week, the top recommended pages to follow on both Facebook and Instagram were almost all misogynistic. By the end of the experiment, Barry was pushed more and more anti-women content by these sites - a dramatic increase from when the account had been created. Some of this content involved sexual violence, sharing disturbing memes about sex acts, and content condoning rape, harassment and gendered violence. They also referenced extreme ideologies. That included the ""incel"" movement - an internetâ¯subculture that encourages men to blame women for problems in their lives. It's been linked to several acts of violence, includingrecent shootings in Plymouth, in the UK. ""If it were a real person, [Barry] would have been brought into a hateful community full of misogynistic content very, very quickly - within two weeks,"" says Colliver. Far from stopping Barry engaging with anti-women content, Facebook and Instagram appear to have promoted it to him. By contrast, there was no anti-women content on TikTok and very little on Twitter.  YouTube suggested some videos hostile to women. Government lays out plans to protect users online Facebook whistleblower reveals identity Facebook, which also owns Instagram, says it tries not to recommend content that breaks its rules and is improving its technology ""to find and remove abuse more quickly"". YouTube says it has ""strict policies"" on hate and ""quickly"" removes content that breaks its rules. That wasn't the only thing in the experiment that struck me. Barry's main interest was originally conspiracy theories and I had expected him to be inundated with that sort of content at the start. But he wasn't. Social media sites have come under increasing pressure not to promote misleading information about vaccines and the pandemic. But why hasn't that happened with misogynistic content on Facebook and Instagram? ""They are driving up their bottom line by keeping people's interest in horrible, violent, often misogynistic content,"" says Colliver. Nearly three billion people worldwide use Facebook - and last year it made on average $32 (Â£23) in advertising revenue per user. The longer people stay on the platform, the more ads it sells and the more money the tech giant makes. Facebook says ""protecting"" its community is ""more important than maximising profits"". It has announced new measures to tackle sexualised hate targeting journalists, politicians and celebrities on its sites. Kaz Kamwi - Love Island contestant and Instagram star For Panorama, researchers from think-tank Demos analysed messages of abuse directed at reality TV contestants on Love Island (ITV) and Married at First Sight (Channel 4). They found that female reality TV contestants are disproportionately targeted on social media with abuse frequently rooted in misogyny and combined with racism. While the contestants received mostly positive messages, fashion blogger Kaz Kamwi, 26, and 23-year-old medical student Priya Gopaldas, told Panorama they also got some disturbing hate-filled messages. ""The most difficult abuse to receive is any that is racially motivated. When you look at me, I am a dark skinned black woman, that's the first thing you see,"" says Kaz. ""And the fact that my family was exposed to that breaks my heart."" Ellen Judson, who led the research for Demos and focuses on social media policy, says reality TV is a great place to start looking at online hate because the genre is so popular with people expressing who they like or don't like. ""We also see that the contestants are a relatively equal mix of men and women - and from lots of different backgrounds - so it gives us an opportunity to analyse those differences in how the public are responding to them."" Demos looked at more than 90,000 online messages about Love Island and Married at First Sight contestants: On Twitter, 26% of posts about females were abusive versus 14% of those directed at men Abuse targeting women focused primarily on gender and sex (much more so than men), with messages littered with gender-based tropes and talk of sex acts Hate intensified when combined with racist language directed at black and Asian female contestants ""People were using explicitly gendered slurs - women being manipulative, women being sneaky, being sexual, women being evil or stupid. Whereas what we saw with men was them being attacked for seemingly not being masculine enough - for being too weak,"" says Judson. ""We also see that women of colour are receiving more pernicious attacks as well based on their race."" Love Island star got death threat from 13-year-old I wanted to see what impact this kind of abuse is having, so I spoke to politicians and frontline doctors who use social media to do their jobs. Like me they don't mind being criticised but they do mind when it gets personal. Former leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson fears that abuse targeting women online could turn back the clock when it comes to equality offline. ""The attacks that have come directly to me have been about my politics, some about my physical appearance, a lot has been about the fact that I am gay and a lot of it has been about the fact that I am a woman who has opinions."" There's also concern that online abuse could lead to real world harm. ""You look at your phone and you read somebody who is telling you as an NHS doctor that they want to rape you until you need one of your own ventilators,"" explains Dr Rachel Clarke, a frontline medic based in Oxford. She's been treating Covid patients during the pandemic and sees using social media as an extension of her duty as a doctor. Dr Rachel Clarke and Marianna Spring That means she has frequently posted warnings about the impact of coronavirus - and encouraged her followers to have a Covid vaccine. It's those tweets in particular that often sparked a wave of misogynistic hate from anti-vaccine activists, not dissimilar to the accounts sending me hate. ""Male doctors that I know will receive abuse online as well. But the volume of abuse is much less. If you're a female doctor, it'll be much more visceral, and it will target you as a woman."" I've been taking part in a major piece of research for the UN's cultural agency Unesco - which looks at the impact of online hate. Lead researcher Julie Posetti and her team asked more than 800 women, journalists like me, about their experiences of online hate. They then studied some of the accounts, including mine and that of Nobel Peace Prize winner, Maria Ressa. She's an investigative journalist from the Philippines who gets lots of online abuse and says she wears a bullet-proof vest because she fears being attacked. ""Online violence is really the new frontier of conflict that women face internationally,"" Posetti tells me. Twenty per cent of women who responded to the UN's survey, in collaboration with the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), said they had already experienced attacks in real-life, including stalking and physical assault. I'm especially worried about some of the hate I receive online, including from a man who appears to have a prior conviction for stalking women. But I've been left frustrated at the police response. After a wave of abuse at the end of April this year, I reported the most serious threats to the police, including about sexual violence. It's a criminal offence to send messages online that are grossly offensive or obscene in order to cause distress. An officer got in touch initially and I shared my evidence of the abuse - but I only heard back from her weeks later when she told me that she was moving teams, my case was being passed on and there had been no progress. I wasn't contacted by a new liaison officer until July - when it became clear that the evidence I'd shared originally with the police had been lost, something that was later admitted. I tried to report another batch of rape threats, death threats and abusive messages at the end of July to the new officer. When we met in person in the middle of August, the officer admitted he was not the right person to handle the case - and that it should have been passed on to a specialist team. Yet more delays - and although the seriousness of the messages was acknowledged, there was little in the way of victim support. By the end of August, I was on to my third police liaison officer - who asked me to review the portfolio of evidence I had already sent in, marking which messages were from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook as he wasn't sure how to use the platforms. My latest liaison officer has requested more information from the social media sites - but still no progress. According to data from several police forces, which Panorama obtained through Freedom of Information requests, over the past five years the number of people reporting online hate has more than doubled. But over the same period, there's only been a 32% increase in the number of arrests. The victims are mainly women. This is happening in the context of increasing pressure on the Met in particular to do more to tackle violence against women on our streets after the killings of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa. I raised concerns that people sending me abuse might turn up at my work - but I was just told to call 999 if I felt in danger. The Metropolitan Police say they take online hate very seriously and that my case is under active investigation. The National Police Chiefs Council says the police take all reports of malicious communications seriously and will investigate but must prioritise its finite resources. It says it can take action other than making arrests. Draft proposals from the UN to get the social media companies to better protect women have been shared exclusively with Panorama. They are calling for social media platforms to introduce labels for accounts that have previously sent misogynistic abuse.  They also want to see more human moderators taking the decisions about offensive material - and an early warning system for users if they think online abuse could escalate into real world harm. ""We would like to see gender-based online violence treated at least as seriously as disinformation has been during the pandemic by the platforms,"" explains Julie Posetti, who led the research that triggered these recommendations. ""I think we have to challenge,"" says Ruth Davidson. ""I don't think that it is in anybody's interests for women who are consistently abused in a way that a man wouldn't be to let other young women who are online and seeing that abuse think that's just the way things are."" For women of all ages - myself included - that means refusing to be bullied off social media. This video can not be played Ex-Love Islander Amy Hart: ""I delete things...

Camera mistakes woman's sweater for number plateA couple were sent a fine after a word on a woman's clothing was mistaken for their number plate.,"Paula and Dave Knight said they thought it was a joke when they received the fine A couple were sent a fine for driving in a bus lane when a camera mistook a word on a woman's clothing for their number plate. Dave and Paula Knight, from Surrey, received the fine for driving in a bus lane in Bath despite not being in the city at the time. A camera had registered the word 'knitter' on a pedestrian's clothing as Mr Knight's number plate KN19 TER. ""We thought one of our friends was stitching us up,"" said Mrs Knight. Bath and North East Somerset Council (BANES) confirmed the fine had been cancelled. Mrs Knight bought her husband the personalised number plate, which is meant to read as his nickname 'Knighter', for his birthday Mr Knight said they planned to frame the notice and put it on the mantelpiece. ""I was looking for my vehicle in it [the picture] and thinking to myself have I been to Bath? ""The poor lady walking down the bus lane has got a top on very similar to my number plate but her handbag is blocking one of the letters out so it assumed it was my number plate,"" he said. Mrs Knight said she thought it was a joke but when none of their friends came forward, they contacted the council. ""When we looked at the photo it was of a lady with 'knitter' on her sweatshirt and KN19 TER is my husband's number plate. ""I think it's bizarre and very funny, this poor lady has been changed over into a vehicle rather than a person overnight, "" she said. Mrs Knight said when she contacted the council, they initially told her the fine would need to be paid but when the staff member looked at the image she ""burst out laughing"". The automated bus lane camera in Bath mistakenly registered the word knitter on the woman's sweatshirt as Mr Knight's number plate ""I'm a bit worried about going to Bath again now. I don't know if we'll take the van, we might take the train,"" she added. BANES cabinet member for transport Manda Rigby said she was pleased that Mr and Mrs Knight had seen the funny side and that it had given the team ""a few giggles"". ""The camera picked up the logo and thought it was a number plate. It doesn't happen often and when we went back to look the fine was cancelled immediately. ""It did give us a smile particularly because Mr and Mrs Knight took it so well,"" she said. Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Â£5,000 grant for homeowners installing heat pumpsThe grants for England and Wales are part of a government strategy for low carbon heating - but critics say it is not ambitious enough.Business","It is hoped no new gas boilers will be sold after 2035 as part of government strategy Experts have criticised plans to subsidise low-carbon heat pumps in place of gas boilers for homeowners in England and Wales from next April. Households will be offered subsidies of Â£5,000 from next April to help them make the switch. Although up to 25 million UK homes have gas boilers, the grants will fund just 90,000 pumps over three years. The government says this will boost demand for the pumps, but critics say the plan does not go far enough. Homeowners will be encouraged to switch to a heat pump or other low-carbon technology when their current boiler needs replacing. An air-source heat pump costs between Â£6,000 and Â£18,000, depending on the type installed and the size of a property. Ministers say the subsidies will make heat pumps a comparable price to a new gas boiler. However, the Â£450m being allocated for the subsidies over three years has been criticised as insufficient. Experts also point to the need for costly new insulation and other home improvements to help households get the best out of the switch. ""Gas is in the news for price increases that are on the horizon,"" said Dr David Glew, head of energy efficiency and policy at the Leeds Sustainability Institute at Leeds Beckett University. ""But gas is actually relatively cheap to heat your home with,"" he added. ""Needing to insulate your house might cost you tens of thousands of pounds and you're only going to be saving several hundreds of pounds, so the economics of that doesn't really add up."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Green is good, green is right, green works"" Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said the number of heat pumps that the grants would cover ""just isn't very much"" and meant the UK would not meet its climate targets. ""These grants will only incentivise the best-off households,"" he said. Greenpeace UK's climate campaigner, Caroline Jones, said the government needed to provide more money to speed up the switch. ""A clearer signal would have been a phase-out of new boilers before 2035,"" she said. The government says it wants no new gas boilers to be sold after 2035, but it has not banned them outright. Writingin the Sun,external, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The Greenshirts of the Boiler Police are not going to kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet and seize, at carrot-point, your trusty old combi."" Downing Street later declined to say whether the government would ban gas boilers in the future, after international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said ""there will be a point"" when the voluntary approach would change. Read more about the UK's climate change targets. Tips on how to save energy at home and help the planet Jonny Marshall, senior economist the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on poverty, said the UK would struggle to meet its goal of cutting emissions from homes in half by 2035. The UK has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. But a group of experts that advises the government says Boris Johnson's government has credible policies in place to deliver only about a fifth of this cut. Helen Selman lives with her husband and two children in Chippenham. When they moved into a 1930s semi, they knew they wanted to undertake home improvements, an upgrade to the heating system and an extension. ""It was not cheap,"" she said. ""But because we were doing everything else, and because this was going to be our forever home, it made sense."" Helen chose an air-source heat pump but alongside it, they had a specifically designed insulation upgrade, new radiators and brand new underfloor heating. ""With a heat pump, the problem is that you have to make sure that your house is as well insulated as possible,"" she explained. ""We already had double or triple-glazing, we had insulated walls, we were upgrading the lofts."" To help with the project, Helen and her family used the old Renewable Heat Initiative funding: ""The RHI money will pay back quarterly over seven years and will go quite a long way to covering the costs."" She said: ""It's been definitely worth the bother."" But she admitted that without their own plans to extend and the added bonus of government cash, it might not have happened. ""Without an incentive, there are few people who have the cashflow or the passion to do this,"" she said. Heating buildings accounts for more than a fifth of the UK's overall greenhouse gas emissions, so there is pressure on the government's Heat and Buildings Strategy to deliver effective reductions. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the grants to support the adoption of heat pumps, available from next April, would help to bring down the cost of the relatively new technology by 2030. Heat pumps extract warmth from the air, the ground or water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse. They are powered by electricity, so if you have a low-carbon source of electricity, they provide greener heating. One energy firm, Octopus Energy, said it expected homeowners to pay about Â£2,500 to the cost of installing a heat pump, roughly equivalent to the cost of a new gas boiler. The government subsidy would cover the rest. But many houses will require an upgrade to their energy efficiency, including insulation, before installing one. A box of about one metre by one metre needs to be outside (close to or attached to the property) to draw in air. It should be at least one metre from your neighbour's property so they will not be able to hear it, although it shouldn't be much louder than your fridge. Read more: Should I get a heat pump and how much will it cost me? In total, Â£3.9bn funding is being provided, with most of that invested in decarbonising public buildings, insulating and installing new heating systems in social housing and for those on low incomes, and helping to provide clean heating networks for homes that are unsuitable for heat pumps. The plan also includes: Â£3.45bn to decarbonise buildings in England and Wales including social housing and district heating schemes Â£60m to drive technological innovation to develop clean heating systems that are smaller, easier to install and cheaper to run. This money will come from a previously announced innovation fund Independent climate think tank E3G said that setting the phase-out date for new fossil fuel boilers was ""a world-leading achievement"" and the pledge to reduce heat pump costs by 2030 was to be welcomed. However, the funding was insufficient to achieve the government's goals on reducing emissions, programme leader Pedro Guertler said. ""On energy efficiency alone, the public investment announced today falls Â£2bn short of what was pledged in the Conservative manifesto to 2025,"" he said. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, described the strategy as ""meagre, unambitious and wholly inadequate"", adding that Labour had pledged to spend Â£6bn a year on insulation and low carbon heating. The Liberal Democrats described the heating plan as ""a kick in the teeth for families across the country facing soaring energy bills this winter"". It's another piece in the Boris Johnson climate-calming jigsaw. First, he slots in a world-leading policy halting the sale of petrol cars by 2030. Now he lays down another piece - no new gas boilers after 2035. It's another trend-setting initiative that other nations will surely follow. There's a problem, though. Because by that date in the middle of the next decade, the PM has already pledged to cut emissions overall by 78% over 1990 levels. Energy experts say that simply won't happen unless he provides much wider incentives for people to insulate their homes and to buy heat pumps to replace their gas boilers. One group of researchers estimates that to meet his net zero targets he needs to invest nearly another Â£10bn over three years. They hope the chancellor will fill that piece of the jigsaw in his spending review next week. Industry sources welcomed the new strategy. The Confederation of British Industry said it would help members prepare for the changes ahead, but its chief policy director, Matthew Fell, called for ""a clear delivery plan for consumers, businesses and local authorities"". Scottish Power's chief executive, Keith Anderson, said it would kick-start demand for electric heating, ""allowing the industry to accelerate the delivery of electrification and quickly bring down upfront costs"".

Employers urged to review menopause procedures,"This video can not be played Menopause: 'There must be a supportive voice in workplace' Northern Ireland's employers could end up on the ""wrong side of the law"" unless they make strides to facilitate women going through the menopause. That is according to the Equality Commission's chief commissioner. With women making up nearly half of the working population, there is pressure for better awareness and for workplaces to support those experiencing symptoms. The commission's Geraldine McGahey said that ""many employers are doing really well - others are not"". ""I think every employer should be walking away thinking I need to check my practices and procedures, I need to check what the needs are of my female employees, both now and in the future,"" she told BBC News NI. The issue has reached parliament, where Westminster's women and equalities committee has begun an inquiry into the consequences of menopause in the workplace. It is estimated 900,000 women in the UK have left jobs as a result of menopausal symptoms. Geraldine McGahey says guidance drawn up by various bodies, including the Equality Commission, provides good practice examples The Equality Commission said positive strides are being made. Even with the pandemic, some employers have been making changes including the local health trusts. Belfast City Council is currently finalising a menopause policy developed through its women's steering group. PwC's Lynne Rainey says women over 40 are the fastest growing demographic in the workforce PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which has offices in Belfast, has implemented a number of changes, including changing insurance arrangements so women can access cover for menopause. Facilitating working from home and training career coaches about the issue is also on offer. PwC partner Lynne Rainey said it makes good business sense. ""It is a business-critical issue for us. Women over 40 are the fastest growing demographic in the workforce. ""They bring a huge amount of experience and expertise and, as a business, which is clearly a space of diversity and inclusion, we need a workforce that remains inclusive and diverse and we want to retain that talent. ""We also want to attract to us as well."" For those going through the menopause, such as Linzi Conway, a 51-year-old self-employed management consultant, the symptoms can be ""debilitating, especially the impact of insomnia"". ""As I have no one to pass the work on to, I sometimes muddle through and that lack of support is a challenge,"" she said. Linzi, who works from home, said a result for her would be being able to explain to a client that she is unable to work on a particular day due to menopause symptoms - but ""we aren't quite there yet"", she added. ""It's absolutely not an excuse, these are real symptoms, especially the tiredness, the pains and the brain fog - they all affect our ability to do a day's work. ""I think one of the benefits of the pandemic is forcing us to remodel and look at our work place differently and allowing that flexibility of working life, and that is going to help a lot of people whether it is menopause, mental health or anything else."" Earlier this year, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions' NI committee and the Labour Relations Agency produced new guidance to address equality issues in relation to women affected by the menopause in employment. It provides good practice examples and suggested tools for both employers and employees. Geraldine McGahey said the tools can be as simple as good ventilation, a fan on the desk, change in uniform or just providing a culture where people feel comfortable talking about it. ""We are finding a really positive interest in the subject,"" she said. ""Our first conference had 121 delegates and that is organisations not people. ""We are running more events and have had over 500 downloads of our guidance notes.""

UK firms will have to disclose climate impactChancellor Rishi Sunak will bring in new rules around environmental sustainability reporting.Business,"Some large UK businesses will have to start disclosing their environmental impact, under new rules set to be brought in by the Treasury. The requirements will also apply to investment products and pension schemes. It comes ahead of November's COP26 meeting in Glasgow, where world leaders will discuss their climate commitments. Experts say the UK, which is hosting the event, isnot currently on track to meet its own emissions targets. Boris Johnson has pledged to cut emissions by 78% by 2035, compared with 1990 levels. The Treasury said the new sustainability disclosure requirements (SDR) mean an investment product will now have to set out the environmental impact of the activities it finances. In addition, a company's sustainability claims will have to be justified ""clearly"", and their net zero transition plans properly set out. The aim is to combat ""greenwashing"", where firms make misleading claims about their environmental commitments. Why does a climate summit need 25,000 people? Scottish climate expert warns 'clock is ticking' How smart appliances can help fix the energy gap But the government said the information will ""only be impactful"" if customers and investors actually use it. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""We want sustainability to be a key component of investment decisions, and our plans will arm investors with the right information to make more environmentally-led decisions."" He said the rules will ""set new global standards for sustainability that will boost the economy, protect the planet and support our net zero goals"". It is unclear when the rules will come in, or what will happen to firms that do not comply. Details of the specific reporting requirements will only be developed after a public consultation. Mr Sunak first mentioned SDRs in July and has announced these next stages for the requirements in the report:""Greening Finance: A Roadmap to Sustainable Investing"",external. Sam Alvis, from the Green Alliance think tank, said it was a ""positive step in greening the private sector"". ""While new green finance is vital, stopping money going into environmentally destructive investments is key. The upcoming spending review is an opportunity for the chancellor to apply the same rules for public spending,"" he added. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said greater clarity on environmental impact ""will help investors channel finance into projects that are aligned with net zero targets and will reduce carbon emissions across our economy"". But Heather McKay from E3G, an independent climate change think tank, told the BBC the government would need to send clear signals about ""what is green and what is not"" to ensure companies really change how they operate. She said this would be a ""crucial step"" to tackling greenwashing. Without the right information available, Jessica Fries, chairman of Accounting for Sustainability said that investors and pension funds have made decisions ""in the dark"". ""As a global centre of finance, it will be important that the recommendations align with emerging requirements globally,"" Ms Fries added. Barbara Davidson, of think tank Carbon Tracker, said better enforcement of current accounting requirements was also required to combat greenwashing. ""Without this, investors do not have the requisite information about the effects of climate change for their decision-making,"" she said. Boris Johnson's government is currentlyon track to cut only about a fifth of UK emissionsby 2035, compared with 1990s levels, according to a group of experts that advises the government.

UK firms will have to disclose climate impactChancellor Rishi Sunak will bring in new rules around environmental sustainability reporting.,"Some large UK businesses will have to start disclosing their environmental impact, under new rules set to be brought in by the Treasury. The requirements will also apply to investment products and pension schemes. It comes ahead of November's COP26 meeting in Glasgow, where world leaders will discuss their climate commitments. Experts say the UK, which is hosting the event, isnot currently on track to meet its own emissions targets. Boris Johnson has pledged to cut emissions by 78% by 2035, compared with 1990 levels. The Treasury said the new sustainability disclosure requirements (SDR) mean an investment product will now have to set out the environmental impact of the activities it finances. In addition, a company's sustainability claims will have to be justified ""clearly"", and their net zero transition plans properly set out. The aim is to combat ""greenwashing"", where firms make misleading claims about their environmental commitments. Why does a climate summit need 25,000 people? Scottish climate expert warns 'clock is ticking' How smart appliances can help fix the energy gap But the government said the information will ""only be impactful"" if customers and investors actually use it. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""We want sustainability to be a key component of investment decisions, and our plans will arm investors with the right information to make more environmentally-led decisions."" He said the rules will ""set new global standards for sustainability that will boost the economy, protect the planet and support our net zero goals"". It is unclear when the rules will come in, or what will happen to firms that do not comply. Details of the specific reporting requirements will only be developed after a public consultation. Mr Sunak first mentioned SDRs in July and has announced these next stages for the requirements in the report:""Greening Finance: A Roadmap to Sustainable Investing"",external. Sam Alvis, from the Green Alliance think tank, said it was a ""positive step in greening the private sector"". ""While new green finance is vital, stopping money going into environmentally destructive investments is key. The upcoming spending review is an opportunity for the chancellor to apply the same rules for public spending,"" he added. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said greater clarity on environmental impact ""will help investors channel finance into projects that are aligned with net zero targets and will reduce carbon emissions across our economy"". But Heather McKay from E3G, an independent climate change think tank, told the BBC the government would need to send clear signals about ""what is green and what is not"" to ensure companies really change how they operate. She said this would be a ""crucial step"" to tackling greenwashing.

LiveLiveSouthend to become city as service held for Sir David Amess4 minutes ago,"A memorial service for Sir David Amess has been held at St Margaretâs Church in Westminster Addressing the congregation, which included around 800 of Sir David's colleagues, the Archbishop of Canterbury described him as ""of the best"" The Archbishop of York remembered his ""ability to listen"" and ""determination to help"" Earlier, Boris Johnson paid tribute in the Commons and announced Southend-on-Sea would become a city Sir David campaigned tirelessly to gain that recognition for the town MPs have been sharing memories of their former colleague in Parliament, with the PM describing him as a âsteadfast servantâ Sir David, 69, was meeting constituents in his Southend West seat when he was fatally stabbed on Friday A 25-year-old man was arrested at the scene and is being questioned by police Edited by Becky Morton That's all from our live coverage on a sombre day, which saw MPs gather to remember Sir David Amess, who was stabbed to death in his constituency on Friday. Here's a reminder of what has happened: Today's coverage has been edited by Hamish Mackay, Claire Heald and Becky Morton and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, Justin Parkinson, Sinead Wilson and Katie Wright. The choir sings Gabriel FaurÃ©âs
Requiem in D minor, which marks the end of the service. The choir and clergy depart, and then MPs and peers begin to file
out of the church. After the Lord's Prayer and the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, the Rev Anthony Ball thanks those who have helped organise the service at short notice. He then gives the blessing, telling people to ""go forth into the world in peace, be of good courage, hold fast that which is good, render to no one evil for evil"". He asks them to ""strengthen the fainthearted, support the weak, help the afflicted, honour all people"" and ""love and serve the Lord"". Canon Pat Browne, Roman Catholic duty priest to the House of
Commons, introduces the prayers. He starts by saying: âLet
us pray for the soul of David Amess, and for all who have died in the service
of Parliament.â Bishop of Durham Paul Butler says:âLet us pray for all who mourn Davidâs
passing: for those who are in shock and deep sadness, especially his family,
his friends, colleagues, and staff in his constituency, party, and across
Parliament.â The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, who was a friend of the late MP, says: ""Let us pray for
those causes closest to Davidâs heart: for the support of those living with
disability; for the humane treatment of animals; for decency in public life and
discourse. ""Let us give thanks for his care of individuals; his ability to
listen, and his determination to help."" The Speakerâs Chaplain says: ""Let us pray
for Parliament: for those who feel vulnerable in public service, and those
charged with their protection; for peace in our land and an end to rancour and
the threat of violence."" Canon
Browne finishes by saying: ""Let us pray
for ourselves, that we may be given strength, courage, and protection in our
public service."" The Archbishop goes on to say that Sir David will be remembered alongside MPs and others who have been killed in the course of public service. ""Public service in politics is a sacrifice that should be honoured and respected even when differences of opinion run very deep indeed - David showed that,"" he says. ""The light lit by public service, by you all and your colleagues, must never be put out even in the darkest moments,"" he says. He says for Sir David's family this time is ""as dark as it could be"". The Archbishop says Sir David's public service was ""inspired by his strong personal faith"" and says that light ""may flicker but it will not be extinguished"". He says that while we ""mourn and grieve"" we also thank those who serve in politics - ""we need them"". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, begins his address by saying that the ""noble calling of politicians in a democracy is to make all manner of sacrifices - seen and unseen"". He says that is why across the nation we should be thankful to everyone who is present ""who give so much despite the cynicism, abuse and cruelty they so often endure"". He says that often in great tragedies ""we conclude that the best are among the first to suffer"". ""In this great tragedy there is a unanimous conviction amongst all who knew him that Sir David was of the best,"" he adds. The Archbishop speaks of Sir David's wholehearted support of causes ""from the now achieved city status of Southend"" to ""great causes of the future of our nation around Brexit"", and says that all these came with a ""robust spirit and charity of heart"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer are among around 800 politicians attending the church service to remember their colleague, Sir David Amess. Politicians from all parties, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel and Lisa Nandy sat in the rows behind the PM, who sat on the front row alongside Starmer and SNP Westminster leader Sir Ian Blackford. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is among those to address the service After the choir leads the congregation in the hymn Abide With Me, the Lord Speaker, Lord McFall of Alcluith, reads Isaih 12. The choir, St Margaretâs Consort which is conducted by Greg Morris, then sings Psalm 112 before Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, reads from Thessalonians. He reads: ""We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. ""For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have died."" The Rev Anthony Ball opens the service by saying: ""We gather here in prayer
and remembrance, as have parliamentarians for hundreds of years, held in the
steadfast love of God. ""Here, in the Parliamentary Church, we come to mourn the
untimely death of Sir David Amess MP, to pray for Julia,
their family, and all who feel his loss so keenly, to remember the kindness and
commitment of a friend and colleague, and to console each other in our grief. ""Here we acknowledge a shared sense of vulnerability even as we express the
determination to maintain our public service. Here we seek Godâs protection and
the needful gifts of courage and strength for the days ahead."" The service of remembrance for Sir David Amess has begun at St Margaret's Church, beside Westminster Abbey. It is being led by the Rev Anthony Ball, Canon of Westminster and Rector of St Margaret's Church. Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent The
traffic was stopped, the street was silent for Sir David Amess's friends and
colleagues to make the short walk across the road from Parliament to St
Margaret's Church through the autumn afternoon. But though there
had been sadness and even tears as the Commons and Lords paid tribute to Sir
David - there was a surprising amount of laughter too. Everyone who knew
him seemed to have an anecdote about his irreverent joie de vivre alongside his
kindness and gentleness. Democracy may be about debate and division, but
even MPs who disagreed with him politically were united in this - that
they'd lost a good and decent man. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader SIr Keir Starmer and House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle are among the parliamentarians who have gathered for a service in memory of Sir David Amess. It is taking place across the road from Parliament at St Margaret's Church in the grounds of Westminster Abbey. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will take part in the service, due to begin at 18:00 BST. After two hours MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the House of Commons. Many shared stories of his humour and kindness as well as the hard work he put in for his constituents. MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the Commons and are now heading over to a church service in memory of him. It is being held at St Margaret's Church, in the grounds of Westminster Abbey, and the Archbishop of Canterbury will give an address. The service is due to start at 18:00 BST. ""Nobody could doubt [Sir] David [Amess's] wish to make the world a better place with his kindness,"" says fellow Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin. Sir Bernard says this quality - kindness - should be known in public life in future as ""the David Amess principle"". Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says people don't appreciate how much MPs work together, but ""they do and Sir David did"". This ""terrible, abhorrent death"" makes us remember that when we stand up for democracy we are standing up for civility, for good behaviour and for treating people properly, she says, adding: ""Violence must never be allowed to succeed again."" Labour's Stephen Timms - who himself was stabbed during his  constituency surgery in 2010 - says kindness was evident throughout Sir David's career. He recalls working with him on Newham Council in the 1970s and says he managed to win over everyone from across the political spectrum. ""He was accessible to his constituents and we must now reflect on what more we can do to stop that happening again,"" he says. ""I wonder if we might ask the police to review our appointment lists ahead of each surgery for example."" The Green Party has announced it will not put forward a candidate in the by-election set to take place in Southend West following the death of MP Sir David Amess last Friday. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have already said they will not take part. No date has yet been set for the contest. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater - sister of the murdered MP Jo Cox - offers ""love, support and solidarity"" to the family of Sir David Amess. She recalls ""physically trembling"" and feeling ""physical pain"" when she heard in 2016 that her sister had died, adding that there followed a ""rollercoaster of deep trauma that nobody should have to experience"". The House of Commons tributes to Sir David would be a ""morsel of comfort"" at their time of pain, Leadbeater says. She implores fellow MPs to offer his family support over the coming weeks and months, adding that ""they will need it"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper says that ""every one of us"" has a story of something they worked with Sir David on, and that so often ""kindness and compassion"" were at the heart of it. She says that, as her office was above his, often they would walk to the Commons together chatting about their families. She says that hanging on Sir David's office door is cardboard cutout of a knight in armour ""with the helmet tilted in a jaunty way"". ""And that knight in shining armour is what Sir David would have been for so many of his constituents,"" she says. She quotes Jo Cox saying ""we have more in common than that which divides us"" and says Sir David ""showed us how to do this"". Â© 2025 BBC.

UK firms must disclose climate impact - TreasuryChancellor Rishi Sunak will bring in new rules around environmental sustainability reporting.Business,"Some large UK businesses will have to start disclosing their environmental impact, under new rules set to be brought in by the Treasury. The requirements will also apply to investment products and pension schemes. It comes ahead of November's COP26 meeting in Glasgow, where world leaders will discuss their climate commitments. Experts say the UK, which is hosting the event, isnot currently on track to meet its own emissions targets. Boris Johnson has pledged to cut emissions by 78% by 2035, compared with 1990 levels. The Treasury said the new sustainability disclosure requirements (SDR) mean an investment product will now have to set out the environmental impact of the activities it finances. In addition, a company's sustainability claims will have to be justified ""clearly"", and their net zero transition plans properly set out. The aim is to combat ""greenwashing"", where firms make misleading claims about their environmental commitments. Why does a climate summit need 25,000 people? Scottish climate expert warns 'clock is ticking' How smart appliances can help fix the energy gap But the government said the information will ""only be impactful"" if customers and investors actually use it. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""We want sustainability to be a key component of investment decisions, and our plans will arm investors with the right information to make more environmentally-led decisions."" He said the rules will ""set new global standards for sustainability that will boost the economy, protect the planet and support our net zero goals"". It is unclear when the rules will come in, or what will happen to firms that do not comply. Details of the specific reporting requirements will only be developed after a public consultation. Mr Sunak first mentioned SDRs in July and has announced these next stages for the requirements in the report:""Greening Finance: A Roadmap to Sustainable Investing"",external. Sam Alvis, from the Green Alliance think tank, said it was a ""positive step in greening the private sector"". ""While new green finance is vital, stopping money going into environmentally destructive investments is key. The upcoming spending review is an opportunity for the chancellor to apply the same rules for public spending,"" he added. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said greater clarity on environmental impact ""will help investors channel finance into projects that are aligned with net zero targets and will reduce carbon emissions across our economy"". But Heather McKay from E3G, an independent climate change think tank, told the BBC the government would need to send clear signals about ""what is green and what is not"" to ensure companies really change how they operate. She said this would be a ""crucial step"" to tackling greenwashing. Without the right information available, Jessica Fries, chairman of Accounting for Sustainability said that investors and pension funds have made decisions ""in the dark"".

China denies testing rare hypersonic missile,"China showed a hypersonic missile platform at a recent military parade China has denied reports that it tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile earlier this year, insisting instead that it was a routine spacecraft check. The initial report in the Financial Times newspaper prompted concern in Washington, where US intelligence was reportedly caught by surprise. Hypersonic missiles can fly in the upper atmosphere at more than five times the speed of sound. Concern has been growing around China's nuclear capabilities. On Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing that a routine test had been carried out in July to verify different types of reusable spacecraft technology. ""This was not a missile, this was a spacecraft,"" he said. ""This is of great significance for reducing the cost of spacecraft use."" Mr Zhao added that many countries had carried out similar tests in the past. When asked if the Financial Times report was inaccurate, he replied ""yes"". The report on Saturday quoted five unnamed sources,externalwho said a hypersonic missile had been launched in the summer. It flew through low-orbit space before cruising down and narrowly missing its target, the report said. ""The test showed that China had made astounding progress on hypersonic weapons and was far more advanced than US officials realised,"" the report read. US deeply concerned over Taiwan-China tension North Korea says it fired new hypersonic missile On Monday, US disarmament ambassador Robert Wood said the US was ""very concerned"", adding that Washington ""had held back from pursuing military applications for this technology"". However, he said both China and Russia had been ""very actively"" pursuing military uses, which meant the US ""having to respond in kind"". ""We just don't know how we can defend against that technology, neither does China, neither does Russia,"" he told reporters in Geneva. Earlier, Mike Gallagher, a Republican member of the House Armed Services Committee, had warned that if Washington stuck to its current approach it would lose a new Cold War with China within a decade. Relations between the US and China are tense, with Beijing accusing President Joe Biden's administration of being hostile. A number of Western countries have also expressed concern at China's recent displays of military might. This video can not be played How powerful is China's military? Michael Shoebridge, the director of defence, strategy and national security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said if a hypersonic missile had been tested it would fit a ""pattern of escalation in nuclear and other strike weapons"". ""I don't think it's more significant than China's growing missile silos or air launch nuclear weapons or new submarine nuclear weapons,"" he said. ""But it fits a pattern of increasing capability [without] transparency."" ""Transparency is an alien concept for Beijing's strategic thinkers,"" he added. China displayed what appeared to be a hypersonic missile platform at a recent military display. Along with China, the US, Russia and at least five other countries are working on hypersonic missile technology. Last month, North Korea said it had successfully tested a new hypersonic missile. And in July, Russia made a similar announcement and said its missile had been launched from a frigate in the White Sea.

Positive trial results for Valneva Covid vaccine,"The Valneva Covid vaccine that the UK cancelled a 100m dose order for last month, works well at priming the immune system to fight coronavirus, phase three trial results suggest. Blood results from volunteers who received the jab had high levels of neutralising antibodies against the pandemic virus. It outperformed the AstraZeneca vaccine on this measure inhead-to-head tests,external. Valneva is seeking regulatory approval for its jab, manufactured in Scotland. It is an inactivated whole virus vaccine, meaning it contains a dead version of coronavirus that cannot cause disease. This is the same way that flu and polio vaccines are made. French pharmaceutical company Valneva said the vaccine had a ""neutralising antibody seroconversion rate above 95%"" and there were no severe cases of Covid seen in the trial despite variants, such as Delta, being in circulation. Lead investigator Prof Adam Finn, of the University of Bristol, said the results, shared in a press release, were both ""impressive and extremely encouraging"". ""These results suggest this vaccine candidate is on track to play an important role in overcoming the pandemic,"" he said. Valneva hopes to initially get the jab approved for those aged between 18 and 55, based on the age range of people in the trial. The company said it has begun the vaccine approval process with the UK's health regulator, and is preparing to submit a request with the European Medicines Agency. Valneva said the UK government had served a notice to the firm, over allegations of a breach of the agreement. The vaccine manufacturer ""strenuously"" denied any breach. Prof Penny Ward, a pharmaceutical expert at King's College London, said: ""As we know the UK government is in dispute with Valneva having cancelled the UKs order of up to 100million doses, placed by the Vaccines Taskforce in 2020, in September. ""The results today suggest that this decision might yet be regretted, but because of it Valneva might be able to provide an immediate supply of this vaccine for other countries struggling with the freezer shipping requirements of other, more expensive, vaccines. Good news for Covax and countries still awaiting supplies.""

"Amazon offers Â£3,000 bonuses to attract staff","Online retail giant Amazon is to offer one-off payments of up to Â£3,000 in order to attract staff in UK regions where there is high demand for labour. The online retailer is hiring for 20,000 positions across its UK network during the festive season. Fears over worker shortages have already prompted other firms to warn of problems in the run-up to Christmas. Amazon began offering a Â£1,000 signing-on bonus to recruit permanent staff in some regions in August. As first reported in the Guardian,external, the company's latest recruitment drive has included aÂ£3,000 bonus for full-time workers at sites such as its Exeter warehouse,external, while in Peterborough, new temporary and permanent workers are offered a sign-up bonus of Â£1,500. Pay for the temporary roles starts at a minimum of Â£10 per hour, rising to Â£11.10 in some parts of the UK. Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays How do I find a new job and who is hiring? Over the past few months, the shortage of workers in a range of sectors has led to delivery delays and waste. According to the latest official figures,external, the number of job vacancies hit 1.1 million between July and September - the highest level since records began in 2001. The largest increase in vacancies was in the retail sector and for motor mechanics, the Office for National Statistics said. Fashion chain Next and supermarket Iceland are among firms warning of potential pre-Christmas disruption because of staff shortages. Some overseas workers have left the UK during the pandemic and also following Brexit. The furlough scheme, which ends this month, has also kept some workers out of the jobs market. Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said he was ""concerned by the level of wage inflation and bonus payments being instigated by large companies such as Amazon"". Mr Goodacre explained that finding seasonal workers was ""proving difficult"" at the ""most important time of the year"" for many small businesses. ""This kind of action from Amazon will make it harder still for smaller companies who simply cannot afford such wages."" Mick Rix, national officer for the trade union GMB, said: ""Amazon has been a pandemic profiteer - raking in astronomical sums during the Covid crisis. ""It is only right that they listen to the union representatives of their workforce and ensure that Amazon workers share in the vast profits that the company are making."" In September, the firm announced it had paid Â£492m in direct taxation last year as its sales rose 50% to Â£20.63bn amid a Covid-driven surge in demand. What's in short supply and why? Amazon pays Â£492m in UK tax as sales hit Â£20.6bn In the past Amazon has faced accusations of poor working conditions both in the UK and the US, where it is the country's second largest employer. Speaking of the new bonuses, one warehouse worker who has worked at an Amazon site for several years told BBC News: ""It wouldn't be the first time the incentives have been offered. ""It leaves workers who have been there for years feeling rather undervalued and underappreciated, as they are training people who are making more money than them, which definitely ticks off the longer term employees."" In March, the Unite union launched a whistleblowing hotline for Amazon workers in the UK. It also called for Amazon to allow British workers to unionise and to have a greater share of the firm's profits.

LiveLiveSouthend to become city in memory of Sir David Amess4 minutes ago,"A memorial service for Sir David Amess has been held at St Margaretâs Church in Westminster Addressing the congregation, which included around 800 of Sir David's colleagues, the Archbishop of Canterbury described him as ""of the best"" The Archbishop of York remembered his ""ability to listen"" and ""determination to help"" Earlier, Boris Johnson paid tribute in the Commons and announced Southend-on-Sea would become a city Sir David campaigned tirelessly to gain that recognition for the town MPs have been sharing memories of their former colleague in Parliament, with the PM describing him as a âsteadfast servantâ Sir David, 69, was meeting constituents in his Southend West seat when he was fatally stabbed on Friday A 25-year-old man was arrested at the scene and is being questioned by police Edited by Becky Morton That's all from our live coverage on a sombre day, which saw MPs gather to remember Sir David Amess, who was stabbed to death in his constituency on Friday. Here's a reminder of what has happened: Today's coverage has been edited by Hamish Mackay, Claire Heald and Becky Morton and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, Justin Parkinson, Sinead Wilson and Katie Wright. The choir sings Gabriel FaurÃ©âs
Requiem in D minor, which marks the end of the service. The choir and clergy depart, and then MPs and peers begin to file
out of the church. After the Lord's Prayer and the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, the Rev Anthony Ball thanks those who have helped organise the service at short notice. He then gives the blessing, telling people to ""go forth into the world in peace, be of good courage, hold fast that which is good, render to no one evil for evil"". He asks them to ""strengthen the fainthearted, support the weak, help the afflicted, honour all people"" and ""love and serve the Lord"". Canon Pat Browne, Roman Catholic duty priest to the House of
Commons, introduces the prayers. He starts by saying: âLet
us pray for the soul of David Amess, and for all who have died in the service
of Parliament.â Bishop of Durham Paul Butler says:âLet us pray for all who mourn Davidâs
passing: for those who are in shock and deep sadness, especially his family,
his friends, colleagues, and staff in his constituency, party, and across
Parliament.â The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, who was a friend of the late MP, says: ""Let us pray for
those causes closest to Davidâs heart: for the support of those living with
disability; for the humane treatment of animals; for decency in public life and
discourse. ""Let us give thanks for his care of individuals; his ability to
listen, and his determination to help."" The Speakerâs Chaplain says: ""Let us pray
for Parliament: for those who feel vulnerable in public service, and those
charged with their protection; for peace in our land and an end to rancour and
the threat of violence."" Canon
Browne finishes by saying: ""Let us pray
for ourselves, that we may be given strength, courage, and protection in our
public service."" The Archbishop goes on to say that Sir David will be remembered alongside MPs and others who have been killed in the course of public service. ""Public service in politics is a sacrifice that should be honoured and respected even when differences of opinion run very deep indeed - David showed that,"" he says. ""The light lit by public service, by you all and your colleagues, must never be put out even in the darkest moments,"" he says. He says for Sir David's family this time is ""as dark as it could be"". The Archbishop says Sir David's public service was ""inspired by his strong personal faith"" and says that light ""may flicker but it will not be extinguished"". He says that while we ""mourn and grieve"" we also thank those who serve in politics - ""we need them"". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, begins his address by saying that the ""noble calling of politicians in a democracy is to make all manner of sacrifices - seen and unseen"". He says that is why across the nation we should be thankful to everyone who is present ""who give so much despite the cynicism, abuse and cruelty they so often endure"". He says that often in great tragedies ""we conclude that the best are among the first to suffer"". ""In this great tragedy there is a unanimous conviction amongst all who knew him that Sir David was of the best,"" he adds. The Archbishop speaks of Sir David's wholehearted support of causes ""from the now achieved city status of Southend"" to ""great causes of the future of our nation around Brexit"", and says that all these came with a ""robust spirit and charity of heart"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer are among around 800 politicians attending the church service to remember their colleague, Sir David Amess. Politicians from all parties, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel and Lisa Nandy sat in the rows behind the PM, who sat on the front row alongside Starmer and SNP Westminster leader Sir Ian Blackford. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is among those to address the service After the choir leads the congregation in the hymn Abide With Me, the Lord Speaker, Lord McFall of Alcluith, reads Isaih 12. The choir, St Margaretâs Consort which is conducted by Greg Morris, then sings Psalm 112 before Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, reads from Thessalonians. He reads: ""We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. ""For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have died."" The Rev Anthony Ball opens the service by saying: ""We gather here in prayer
and remembrance, as have parliamentarians for hundreds of years, held in the
steadfast love of God. ""Here, in the Parliamentary Church, we come to mourn the
untimely death of Sir David Amess MP, to pray for Julia,
their family, and all who feel his loss so keenly, to remember the kindness and
commitment of a friend and colleague, and to console each other in our grief. ""Here we acknowledge a shared sense of vulnerability even as we express the
determination to maintain our public service. Here we seek Godâs protection and
the needful gifts of courage and strength for the days ahead."" The service of remembrance for Sir David Amess has begun at St Margaret's Church, beside Westminster Abbey. It is being led by the Rev Anthony Ball, Canon of Westminster and Rector of St Margaret's Church. Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent The
traffic was stopped, the street was silent for Sir David Amess's friends and
colleagues to make the short walk across the road from Parliament to St
Margaret's Church through the autumn afternoon. But though there
had been sadness and even tears as the Commons and Lords paid tribute to Sir
David - there was a surprising amount of laughter too. Everyone who knew
him seemed to have an anecdote about his irreverent joie de vivre alongside his
kindness and gentleness. Democracy may be about debate and division, but
even MPs who disagreed with him politically were united in this - that
they'd lost a good and decent man. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader SIr Keir Starmer and House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle are among the parliamentarians who have gathered for a service in memory of Sir David Amess. It is taking place across the road from Parliament at St Margaret's Church in the grounds of Westminster Abbey. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will take part in the service, due to begin at 18:00 BST. After two hours MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the House of Commons. Many shared stories of his humour and kindness as well as the hard work he put in for his constituents. MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the Commons and are now heading over to a church service in memory of him. It is being held at St Margaret's Church, in the grounds of Westminster Abbey, and the Archbishop of Canterbury will give an address. The service is due to start at 18:00 BST. ""Nobody could doubt [Sir] David [Amess's] wish to make the world a better place with his kindness,"" says fellow Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin. Sir Bernard says this quality - kindness - should be known in public life in future as ""the David Amess principle"". Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says people don't appreciate how much MPs work together, but ""they do and Sir David did"". This ""terrible, abhorrent death"" makes us remember that when we stand up for democracy we are standing up for civility, for good behaviour and for treating people properly, she says, adding: ""Violence must never be allowed to succeed again."" Labour's Stephen Timms - who himself was stabbed during his  constituency surgery in 2010 - says kindness was evident throughout Sir David's career. He recalls working with him on Newham Council in the 1970s and says he managed to win over everyone from across the political spectrum. ""He was accessible to his constituents and we must now reflect on what more we can do to stop that happening again,"" he says. ""I wonder if we might ask the police to review our appointment lists ahead of each surgery for example."" The Green Party has announced it will not put forward a candidate in the by-election set to take place in Southend West following the death of MP Sir David Amess last Friday. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have already said they will not take part. No date has yet been set for the contest. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater - sister of the murdered MP Jo Cox - offers ""love, support and solidarity"" to the family of Sir David Amess. She recalls ""physically trembling"" and feeling ""physical pain"" when she heard in 2016 that her sister had died, adding that there followed a ""rollercoaster of deep trauma that nobody should have to experience"". The House of Commons tributes to Sir David would be a ""morsel of comfort"" at their time of pain, Leadbeater says. She implores fellow MPs to offer his family support over the coming weeks and months, adding that ""they will need it"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper says that ""every one of us"" has a story of something they worked with Sir David on, and that so often ""kindness and compassion"" were at the heart of it. She says that, as her office was above his, often they would walk to the Commons together chatting about their families. She says that hanging on Sir David's office door is cardboard cutout of a knight in armour ""with the helmet tilted in a jaunty way"". ""And that knight in shining armour is what Sir David would have been for so many of his constituents,"" she says. She quotes Jo Cox saying ""we have more in common than that which divides us"" and says Sir David ""showed us how to do this"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"I went into overdrive, says doctor who saved fan","This video can not be played 'It all happened so quickly' - doctor tells BBC Breakfast about saving fan's life A doctor has described the moment he went to the aid of an elderly Newcastle fan who collapsed near him during Sunday's Premier League match against Tottenham at St James' Park. The match was halted in the first half as supporters administered CPR to a man who had suffered cardiac arrest, and a defibrillator was also used. The man was later said to be""stable and responsive"" in hospital. ""It all happened so quickly,"" Dr Tom Prichard told BBC Breakfast. ""I was sat in the Gallowgate End and I could see that there was something going on. Fans were calling over stewards and first-aiders and there was a lady doing CPR on someone. ""As an A&E doctor I went to offer a hand to see how I could help."" Listen: The Sports Desk podcast - What can sport learn from Christian Eriksen's cardiac arrest? Dr Prichard works at the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton. He added: ""St John's were fairly quick and took over the CPR. Another friend of mine came over to help too. ""We gave the guy a shock through the defibrillator and he was very fortunate because very quickly an intensive care doctor arrived, the cardiologist arrived, and we were able to bring him back again."" Fans in the East Stand had alerted players and officials to the incident in the 40th minute. Tottenham player Sergio Reguilon spoke to referee Andre Marriner, before team-mate Eric Dier raced to the touchline to urge medical staff to attend with a defibrillator. Both teams left the pitch as Marriner suspended the game. ""I went into overdrive and focused purely on the matter in hand,"" said Dr Prichard, who also works for rugby league side Newcastle Thunder and part-time for Middlesbrough Academy. ""When I got back to my seat I had no idea that the game had even been stopped and we were still in the first half."" Prichard was given a standing ovation when he returned to his seat. ""It wasn't just me. I had another doctor friend helping me out. St John's were brilliant, the Newcastle club doctor was there helping, so it really wasn't just me,"" he said. ""But what I will say is when I was walking back to my seat and 10,000 fans were chanting 'hero' at me, that was one of the best moments of my life."" Allow Twitter content?

""I want to stress the importance of early CPR, early chest compressions and early defibrillation,"" he said.

Positive trial results for Valneva Covid vaccineBlood results show it gets the body to mount an immune response to fight coronavirus.,"The Valneva Covid vaccine that the UK cancelled a 100m dose order for last month, works well at priming the immune system to fight coronavirus, phase three trial results suggest. Blood results from volunteers who received the jab had high levels of neutralising antibodies against the pandemic virus. It outperformed the AstraZeneca vaccine on this measure inhead-to-head tests,external. Valneva is seeking regulatory approval for its jab, manufactured in Scotland. It is an inactivated whole virus vaccine, meaning it contains a dead version of coronavirus that cannot cause disease. This is the same way that flu and polio vaccines are made. French pharmaceutical company Valneva said the vaccine had a ""neutralising antibody seroconversion rate above 95%"" and there were no severe cases of Covid seen in the trial despite variants, such as Delta, being in circulation. Lead investigator Prof Adam Finn, of the University of Bristol, said the results, shared in a press release, were both ""impressive and extremely encouraging"". ""These results suggest this vaccine candidate is on track to play an important role in overcoming the pandemic,"" he said. Valneva hopes to initially get the jab approved for those aged between 18 and 55, based on the age range of people in the trial. The company said it has begun the vaccine approval process with the UK's health regulator, and is preparing to submit a request with the European Medicines Agency. Valneva said the UK government had served a notice to the firm, over allegations of a breach of the agreement. The vaccine manufacturer ""strenuously"" denied any breach. Prof Penny Ward, a pharmaceutical expert at King's College London, said: ""As we know the UK government is in dispute with Valneva having cancelled the UKs order of up to 100million doses, placed by the Vaccines Taskforce in 2020, in September. ""The results today suggest that this decision might yet be regretted, but because of it Valneva might be able to provide an immediate supply of this vaccine for other countries struggling with the freezer shipping requirements of other, more expensive, vaccines. Good news for Covax and countries still awaiting supplies.""

Uni told to refund students for online modules,"The university claimed the changes were made due to pandemic restrictions, but an independent regular has said this not the case A university has been told it should apologise and refund fees after claiming course changes were due to the Covid pandemic. A complaint by 13 University of Wales Trinity St David students has been upheld by an independent adjudicator. The university said it was committed to providing students with the right skills for their future careers. The proposed recommendations, seen by BBC Wales, will not be confirmed until feedback is assessed. The complaint was brought by a group of students who started their art and design courses in September 2020 after lessons on some courses were replaced by online modules. Students in election tuition fee reduction call Universities keep lectures online into autumn term University faces 'financial uncertainties' The students claimed they had not been given notice of changes which meant course-specific content had been replaced by more general modules focused on employability and digital skills. The students took the issue to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA) when their complaint was rejected by the university. The OIA is an independent body that reviews student complaints about higher education providers in Wales and England under the Higher Education Act 2004. One student said the process of challenging the university had been ""enormously stressful"". He said academic staff had done ""a brilliant job"" of adapting existing courses, but the concerns were about new online modules that were not specific to individual courses. One student said the new online modules had ""nothing to do"" with students' degrees ""We feel that we were betrayed by them to be honest,"" he said ""They've seized upon the Covid pandemic to put in place digital delivery and causing us to spend even more time stuck in front of a glowing screen. ""It was just enormously demoralising to have them do that to us, and then to be confronted with content that had nothing to do with what we'd signed up to do a degree for"". Trinity St David, which has three main campuses in south west Wales, in Carmarthen, Lampeter and Swansea, said it had to take stock of how teaching was delivered in view of the pandemic. But in a report seen by BBC Wales the OIA said that introducing the new modules was not due to pandemic restrictions, but driven by trying to ""re-imagine"" the curriculum. The watchdog raised concerns about the way the university had dealt with the students' complaint The OIA said that while changes were necessary during the pandemic ""the university chose to replace advertised modules with entirely different modules rather than adapting the teaching of the promised content"". The report also said the university did not give reasonable notice of changes in line with consumer protection rules and guidance from the Competition and Markets Authority. The OIA has said that students should receive a Â£1,050 refund for each of the two modules replaced in the 2020-21 academic year as well as an apology. It also proposed that the university should work with the students to find a way to offer something ""broadly equivalent"" to the opportunities expected when they signed up. Trinity St David said the university was unable to comment on the report, as the process was ongoing. But the university said the new online modules aimed to provide students with ""opportunities to develop their professional skills and competence alongside their academic subject knowledge"". ""These are the skills demanded by employers now and in the future, particularly as a result of the digital transformation exacerbated by the pandemic.""

LiveLiveJohnson to lead MPs' tributes to Sir David AmessLess than a minute ago,"A memorial service for Sir David Amess has been held at St Margaretâs Church in Westminster Addressing the congregation, which included around 800 of Sir David's colleagues, the Archbishop of Canterbury described him as ""of the best"" The Archbishop of York remembered his ""ability to listen"" and ""determination to help"" Earlier, Boris Johnson paid tribute in the Commons and announced Southend-on-Sea would become a city Sir David campaigned tirelessly to gain that recognition for the town MPs have been sharing memories of their former colleague in Parliament, with the PM describing him as a âsteadfast servantâ Sir David, 69, was meeting constituents in his Southend West seat when he was fatally stabbed on Friday A 25-year-old man was arrested at the scene and is being questioned by police Edited by Becky Morton That's all from our live coverage on a sombre day, which saw MPs gather to remember Sir David Amess, who was stabbed to death in his constituency on Friday. Here's a reminder of what has happened: Today's coverage has been edited by Hamish Mackay, Claire Heald and Becky Morton and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, Justin Parkinson, Sinead Wilson and Katie Wright. The choir sings Gabriel FaurÃ©âs
Requiem in D minor, which marks the end of the service. The choir and clergy depart, and then MPs and peers begin to file
out of the church. After the Lord's Prayer and the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, the Rev Anthony Ball thanks those who have helped organise the service at short notice. He then gives the blessing, telling people to ""go forth into the world in peace, be of good courage, hold fast that which is good, render to no one evil for evil"". He asks them to ""strengthen the fainthearted, support the weak, help the afflicted, honour all people"" and ""love and serve the Lord"". Canon Pat Browne, Roman Catholic duty priest to the House of
Commons, introduces the prayers. He starts by saying: âLet
us pray for the soul of David Amess, and for all who have died in the service
of Parliament.â Bishop of Durham Paul Butler says:âLet us pray for all who mourn Davidâs
passing: for those who are in shock and deep sadness, especially his family,
his friends, colleagues, and staff in his constituency, party, and across
Parliament.â The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, who was a friend of the late MP, says: ""Let us pray for
those causes closest to Davidâs heart: for the support of those living with
disability; for the humane treatment of animals; for decency in public life and
discourse. ""Let us give thanks for his care of individuals; his ability to
listen, and his determination to help."" The Speakerâs Chaplain says: ""Let us pray
for Parliament: for those who feel vulnerable in public service, and those
charged with their protection; for peace in our land and an end to rancour and
the threat of violence."" Canon
Browne finishes by saying: ""Let us pray
for ourselves, that we may be given strength, courage, and protection in our
public service."" The Archbishop goes on to say that Sir David will be remembered alongside MPs and others who have been killed in the course of public service. ""Public service in politics is a sacrifice that should be honoured and respected even when differences of opinion run very deep indeed - David showed that,"" he says. ""The light lit by public service, by you all and your colleagues, must never be put out even in the darkest moments,"" he says. He says for Sir David's family this time is ""as dark as it could be"". The Archbishop says Sir David's public service was ""inspired by his strong personal faith"" and says that light ""may flicker but it will not be extinguished"". He says that while we ""mourn and grieve"" we also thank those who serve in politics - ""we need them"". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, begins his address by saying that the ""noble calling of politicians in a democracy is to make all manner of sacrifices - seen and unseen"". He says that is why across the nation we should be thankful to everyone who is present ""who give so much despite the cynicism, abuse and cruelty they so often endure"". He says that often in great tragedies ""we conclude that the best are among the first to suffer"". ""In this great tragedy there is a unanimous conviction amongst all who knew him that Sir David was of the best,"" he adds. The Archbishop speaks of Sir David's wholehearted support of causes ""from the now achieved city status of Southend"" to ""great causes of the future of our nation around Brexit"", and says that all these came with a ""robust spirit and charity of heart"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer are among around 800 politicians attending the church service to remember their colleague, Sir David Amess. Politicians from all parties, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel and Lisa Nandy sat in the rows behind the PM, who sat on the front row alongside Starmer and SNP Westminster leader Sir Ian Blackford. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is among those to address the service After the choir leads the congregation in the hymn Abide With Me, the Lord Speaker, Lord McFall of Alcluith, reads Isaih 12. The choir, St Margaretâs Consort which is conducted by Greg Morris, then sings Psalm 112 before Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, reads from Thessalonians. He reads: ""We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. ""For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have died."" The Rev Anthony Ball opens the service by saying: ""We gather here in prayer
and remembrance, as have parliamentarians for hundreds of years, held in the
steadfast love of God. ""Here, in the Parliamentary Church, we come to mourn the
untimely death of Sir David Amess MP, to pray for Julia,
their family, and all who feel his loss so keenly, to remember the kindness and
commitment of a friend and colleague, and to console each other in our grief. ""Here we acknowledge a shared sense of vulnerability even as we express the
determination to maintain our public service. Here we seek Godâs protection and
the needful gifts of courage and strength for the days ahead."" The service of remembrance for Sir David Amess has begun at St Margaret's Church, beside Westminster Abbey. It is being led by the Rev Anthony Ball, Canon of Westminster and Rector of St Margaret's Church. Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent The
traffic was stopped, the street was silent for Sir David Amess's friends and
colleagues to make the short walk across the road from Parliament to St
Margaret's Church through the autumn afternoon. But though there
had been sadness and even tears as the Commons and Lords paid tribute to Sir
David - there was a surprising amount of laughter too. Everyone who knew
him seemed to have an anecdote about his irreverent joie de vivre alongside his
kindness and gentleness. Democracy may be about debate and division, but
even MPs who disagreed with him politically were united in this - that
they'd lost a good and decent man. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader SIr Keir Starmer and House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle are among the parliamentarians who have gathered for a service in memory of Sir David Amess. It is taking place across the road from Parliament at St Margaret's Church in the grounds of Westminster Abbey. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will take part in the service, due to begin at 18:00 BST. After two hours MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the House of Commons. Many shared stories of his humour and kindness as well as the hard work he put in for his constituents. MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the Commons and are now heading over to a church service in memory of him. It is being held at St Margaret's Church, in the grounds of Westminster Abbey, and the Archbishop of Canterbury will give an address. The service is due to start at 18:00 BST. ""Nobody could doubt [Sir] David [Amess's] wish to make the world a better place with his kindness,"" says fellow Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin. Sir Bernard says this quality - kindness - should be known in public life in future as ""the David Amess principle"". Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says people don't appreciate how much MPs work together, but ""they do and Sir David did"". This ""terrible, abhorrent death"" makes us remember that when we stand up for democracy we are standing up for civility, for good behaviour and for treating people properly, she says, adding: ""Violence must never be allowed to succeed again."" Labour's Stephen Timms - who himself was stabbed during his  constituency surgery in 2010 - says kindness was evident throughout Sir David's career. He recalls working with him on Newham Council in the 1970s and says he managed to win over everyone from across the political spectrum. ""He was accessible to his constituents and we must now reflect on what more we can do to stop that happening again,"" he says. ""I wonder if we might ask the police to review our appointment lists ahead of each surgery for example."" The Green Party has announced it will not put forward a candidate in the by-election set to take place in Southend West following the death of MP Sir David Amess last Friday. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have already said they will not take part. No date has yet been set for the contest. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater - sister of the murdered MP Jo Cox - offers ""love, support and solidarity"" to the family of Sir David Amess. She recalls ""physically trembling"" and feeling ""physical pain"" when she heard in 2016 that her sister had died, adding that there followed a ""rollercoaster of deep trauma that nobody should have to experience"". The House of Commons tributes to Sir David would be a ""morsel of comfort"" at their time of pain, Leadbeater says. She implores fellow MPs to offer his family support over the coming weeks and months, adding that ""they will need it"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper says that ""every one of us"" has a story of something they worked with Sir David on, and that so often ""kindness and compassion"" were at the heart of it. She says that, as her office was above his, often they would walk to the Commons together chatting about their families. She says that hanging on Sir David's office door is cardboard cutout of a knight in armour ""with the helmet tilted in a jaunty way"". ""And that knight in shining armour is what Sir David would have been for so many of his constituents,"" she says. She quotes Jo Cox saying ""we have more in common than that which divides us"" and says Sir David ""showed us how to do this"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Ford's Merseyside investment to secure 500 UK jobs,"Ford is to invest Â£230m in its Halewood plant on Merseyside to make electric car parts, helping safeguard 500 jobs. The investment will mean the plant will run for many years longer, said Stuart Rowley, president, Ford of Europe. There had been speculation about the future of the Halewood factory complex as Ford moves towards electrifying its vehicles. Part of the investment will come from the government's Automotive Transformation Fund. ""We're really pleased with the support from the UK government,"" Mr Rowley told the BBC. ""We're not disclosing the exact amount, but it was good support for what is a very significant investment in the UK."" He said the government support was ""a part of the decision"" to choose to invest in Halewood, ""but not the only element"". Ford's Halewood plant will begin manufacturing electric power units - which replace the engine and transmission in petrol cars - in 2024. Ford has said it is committed to the UK, but not all locations have been as fortunate. Its engine plant in Bridgend closed in September last year, with the loss of 1,700 jobs, after the company described it as ""economically unsustainable"". Ford blamed ""changing customer demand and cost"" for the closure plans and denied Brexit was a factor. Car registrations at lowest level for two decades Ford is latest firm to stop making cars in India Jaguar Land Rover manufacture tools in-house Ford is not the first manufacturer to receive financial help for electric vehicle production through the fund, set up to encourage investment in electric vehicle manufacturing in the UK. In July, Nissan announceda major expansion of electric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland, which will create 1,650 new jobs. The Japanese carmaker will build its new-generation all-electric model at the site as part of a Â£1bn investment that will also support thousands of jobs in the supply chain. And Nissan's partner, Envision AESC, will build an electric battery plant. Ford's Mr Rowley said its plans were ""a huge vote of confidence in [the] workforce"". ""Ford has been part of the industrial and social fabric of the UK for many decades,"" he said, adding that the plant would be a ""very important"" part of Ford's electrification plans in Europe. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the Ford decision was ""further proof that the UK remains one of the best locations in the world for high-quality automotive manufacturing"". ""In this highly competitive, global race to secure electric vehicle manufacturing, our priority is to ensure the UK reaps the benefits,"" he added. Ford's Halewood plant will manufacture electric power units Kevin Pearson of the Unite union said the Ford investment ""recognises the experience, commitment and competitiveness of our world class workforce and is a great source of pride for all of us working at Halewood Transmission Plant and for the wider community"". The announcement suggested the facility would be an important part of electric vehicle manufacturing in the UK, said Prof David Bailey of Birmingham Business School. He said that was ""especially great news"" because there had been ""a lot of speculation about the plant"", including that Ford might move parts manufacturing and car assembly abroad. Had Halewood closed, it would have had a knock-on effect on other parts of the UK car industry and the local economy, he said. Prof Bailey said that the UK's exit from the EU had been a ""huge concern"" initially, before the tariff-free trade deal was agreed between the EU and the UK. However, Ford said that it was not currently facing the kind of supply chain difficulties affecting some other UK businesses. Additional post-Brexit paperwork at ports, which has contributed to bottlenecks for some UK-based firms, has not been much of an obstacle for Ford as it has its own landing facilities at Dagenham, the firm said. Ford is concerned about any possible fallout from UK and EU negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol, a spokesperson said. The global car giant also recently announced a $1bn (Â£730m) investment in its vehicle assembly facility in Cologne, Germany, and an expansion of electric vehicle production in Turkey and Romania.

"Facebook to hire 10,000 in EU to work on metaverse","Mark Zuckerberg has been a leading voice on the metaverse Facebook is planning to hire 10,000 people in the European Union to develop a so-called metaverse. A metaverse is an online world where people can game, work and communicate in a virtual environment, often using VR headsets. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been a leading voice on the concept. The announcement comes as Facebook deals with the fallout of a damaging scandal and faces increased calls for regulation to curb its influence. What is the metaverse? ""The metaverse has the potential to help unlock access to new creative, social, and economic opportunities. And Europeans will be shaping it right from the start,"" Facebook said in a blog post. The new jobs being created over the next five years will include ""highly specialised engineers"". Investing in the EU offered many advantages, including access to a large consumer market, first-class universities and high-quality talent, Facebook said. Facebook has made building the metaverseone of its big priorities. Despite its history of buying up rivals, Facebook claims the metaverse ""won't be built overnight by a single company"" and has promised to collaborate. It recently invested $50m (Â£36.3m) in funding non-profit groups to help ""build the metaverse responsibly"". But it thinks the true metaverse idea will take another 10 to 15 years. Some critics say this latest announcement is designed to re-establish the company's reputation and divert attention, after a series of damaging scandals in recent months. This includedrevelations from whistleblower Frances Haugen, who worked as a product manager on the civic integrity team at Facebook. Internal research by Facebook found that Instagram, which it owns, was affecting the mental health of teenagers. But Facebook did not share its findings when they suggested that the platform was a ""toxic"" place for many youngsters. This video can not be played Frances Haugen: ""If Facebook change the algorithm to be safer... they'll make less money"" Apparently, it's the next big thing. What is the metaverse?

Sir David, 69, had been meeting constituents in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, when he was stabbed multiple times on Friday. A 25-year-old British man is being held under the Terrorism Act. The family of Sir David have said their hearts are shattered and called for people to ""set aside hatred and work towards togetherness"". They added that the ""wonderful"" tributes paid to the father-of-five had given them strength but that they are still trying to understand ""why this awful thing has occurred... nobody should die in that way"". They described him as strong and courageous, a patriot and a man of peace, adding: ""We ask people to set aside their differences and show kindness and love to all. Please let some good come from this tragedy. ""We are absolutely broken, but we will survive and carry on for the sake of a wonderful and inspiring man."" Live: Westminster to pay tribute Show kindness and love, say Sir David's family Obituary: Sir David Amess Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cox said when he heard the news about Sir David, he was immediately taken back to getting the phone call being told about what had happened to his wife. She was Labour MP for Batley and Spen when she was killed in Birstall, where a constituency surgery was due to take place, in 2016. Her sister Kim Leadbeateris now the MP for the area. Jo Cox was killed in 2016 ""Being back in that moment was very hard,"" Mr Cox said of when he learned Sir David, MP for Southend West since 1997, had been fatally stabbed on Friday. ""And then just a wave of emotion, of sadness, of sorrow for what his family would be going through having gone through something very similar, knowing those first moments where you hear about the attack but hope that it will be OK through to those moments when you get told and then you have to tell other people."" He also told BBC Breakfast that when he heard the news: ""I found it very hard to function. I picked the kids up from school and went away for the weekend, just to try and get away from it all."" Mr Cox said he felt ""terrible sadness for the family, knowing what they're going through"", with the realisation that ""the worst possible thing you could ever imagine in your life has just happened"". He said for his two children, ""hearing about this over the weekend does bring it all back"". They speak about their mother all the time, he added, and she is ""an ongoing force in our family"". Their children are ""very proud"" of her and he makes sure they ""keep her very human"" by remembering all aspects of her personality. This video can not be played Brendan Cox says public reaction to Sir David Amess' death will comfort family The outpouring of grief for Sir David will be a comfort for his family, said Mr Cox, as it was for him when his wife was killed. The public reaction ""really did make a difference to us"", he added, saying: ""It really did give us that sense of solidarity of kindness in a world which at that moment feels incredibly unkind."" Both the attack on his wife, and that on Sir David, were an ""attack on our democracy"", he added - but democracy is the very thing that ""binds us together - it is one of the things that is our strength"". Mr Cox added that the message of unity from Sir David's family was so important because society needs to change its response to terrorism. ""It's about denying terrorists what they want,"" he said. ""They want that division so let's give them togetherness. They want that infamy so let's give them neglect, let's not put their pictures on the front page of newspapers - we have to stop playing into the hands of being the inadvertent amplifiers of terrorism."" Labour MP Tulip Saddiq has told the BBC her mother feared for her safety More MPs have opened up about their own personal safety following the death of their colleague. Many have spoken of a toxic and increasingly polarised political culture where online trolling has become widespread, ranging from personal insults at one end of the spectrum to direct threats of violence and even death at the other. Labour MP Tulip Sadiq told BBC Breakfast all MPs, especially women, are subject to attack and that her mother feared for her doing the job. She said being an MP had had a ""constant effect"" on her family for years, especially her parents. Sir David's neighbouring MP in Southend, Conservative James Duddridge, said: ""No-one that loves me, none of my friends would want me to be a Member of Parliament. ""The only reason they support it is because they know that that's what I believe is an honourable thing to do, a worthwhile thing to do, something I'd always wanted to do, something that I have enjoyed. "" Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said he had received ""three threats to life and limb"" over the past two years - but he does not want to ""allow those who attack our democracy"" to win. And Labour's Chris Bryant saida man had been arrestedover a death threat he received over the weekend. Read more here. He also said it is right to look at MPs' security, but people should not ""pretend that's going to fix the problem"". Concerns have been raised about the safety of politicians following Sir David's death. Home Secretary Priti Patel and Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyleare working on measuresto protect MPs and police forces have been asked to review their security arrangements with immediate effect. A police search at a house in north London is thought to be linked to the inquiry Detectives are continuing to hold the 25-year-old man in connection with Sir David's death and have until Friday to question him. Whitehall officials confirmed the man's name as Ali Harbi Ali, and said he was a British man of Somali heritage. The BBC understands he was referred to the counter-terrorist Prevent scheme some years ago, but was never a formal subject of interest to MI5. It also understands that his father, Harbi Ali Kullane, who was previously an adviser to Somalia's prime minister, has been visited by police who have taken his phone for analysis. Police officers have spent the weekend searching three addresses in London. It is thought a converted Victorian property in Lady Somerset Road in north-west London is linked to the investigation. Neighbours said officers started searching it late on Friday night. Further searches, also believed to be part of the inquiry, have been taking place at a property in Bounds Green Road, north London, and another in Cranmer Road, Croydon, south London. The police cordon outside the church in Eastwood Road North, Leigh-on-Sea, where Sir David was stabbed to death has now been lifted. Flowers have been left outside Belfairs Methodist Church and uniformed police officers remain at the scene.

"I went into overdrive, says doctor who saved fanA doctor describes the moment he went to the aid of an elderly Newcastle United supporter who collapsed near him.BBC Sport","This video can not be played 'It all happened so quickly' - doctor tells BBC Breakfast about saving fan's life A doctor has described the moment he went to the aid of an elderly Newcastle fan who collapsed near him during Sunday's Premier League match against Tottenham at St James' Park. The match was halted in the first half as supporters administered CPR to a man who had suffered cardiac arrest, and a defibrillator was also used. The man was later said to be""stable and responsive"" in hospital. ""It all happened so quickly,"" Dr Tom Prichard told BBC Breakfast. ""I was sat in the Gallowgate End and I could see that there was something going on. Fans were calling over stewards and first-aiders and there was a lady doing CPR on someone. ""As an A&E doctor I went to offer a hand to see how I could help."" Listen: The Sports Desk podcast - What can sport learn from Christian Eriksen's cardiac arrest? Dr Prichard works at the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton. He added: ""St John's were fairly quick and took over the CPR. Another friend of mine came over to help too. ""We gave the guy a shock through the defibrillator and he was very fortunate because very quickly an intensive care doctor arrived, the cardiologist arrived, and we were able to bring him back again."" Fans in the East Stand had alerted players and officials to the incident in the 40th minute. Tottenham player Sergio Reguilon spoke to referee Andre Marriner, before team-mate Eric Dier raced to the touchline to urge medical staff to attend with a defibrillator. Both teams left the pitch as Marriner suspended the game. ""I went into overdrive and focused purely on the matter in hand,"" said Dr Prichard, who also works for rugby league side Newcastle Thunder and part-time for Middlesbrough Academy. ""When I got back to my seat I had no idea that the game had even been stopped and we were still in the first half."" Prichard was given a standing ovation when he returned to his seat. ""It wasn't just me. I had another doctor friend helping me out. St John's were brilliant, the Newcastle club doctor was there helping, so it really wasn't just me,"" he said. ""But what I will say is when I was walking back to my seat and 10,000 fans were chanting 'hero' at me, that was one of the best moments of my life."" Allow Twitter content?

Dr Prichard stressed the importance of early intervention and how such a quick response may have saved the fan's life. ""I want to stress the importance of early CPR, early chest compressions and early defibrillation,"" he said. ""That is what saved this man's life, so if anyone in the public were to see this happen to someone, chest compression and CPR is what needs to happen immediately.""

China denies it tested rare hypersonic missile,"China showed a hypersonic missile platform at a recent military parade China has denied reports that it tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile earlier this year, insisting instead that it was a routine spacecraft check. The initial report in the Financial Times newspaper prompted concern in Washington, where US intelligence was reportedly caught by surprise. Hypersonic missiles can fly in the upper atmosphere at more than five times the speed of sound. Concern has been growing around China's nuclear capabilities. On Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing that a routine test had been carried out in July to verify different types of reusable spacecraft technology. ""This was not a missile, this was a spacecraft,"" he said. ""This is of great significance for reducing the cost of spacecraft use."" Mr Zhao added that many countries had carried out similar tests in the past. When asked if the Financial Times report was inaccurate, he replied ""yes"". The report on Saturday quoted five unnamed sources,externalwho said a hypersonic missile had been launched in the summer. It flew through low-orbit space before cruising down and narrowly missing its target, the report said. ""The test showed that China had made astounding progress on hypersonic weapons and was far more advanced than US officials realised,"" the report read. US deeply concerned over Taiwan-China tension North Korea says it fired new hypersonic missile On Monday, US disarmament ambassador Robert Wood said the US was ""very concerned"", adding that Washington ""had held back from pursuing military applications for this technology"". However, he said both China and Russia had been ""very actively"" pursuing military uses, which meant the US ""having to respond in kind"". ""We just don't know how we can defend against that technology, neither does China, neither does Russia,"" he told reporters in Geneva. Earlier, Mike Gallagher, a Republican member of the House Armed Services Committee, had warned that if Washington stuck to its current approach it would lose a new Cold War with China within a decade. Relations between the US and China are tense, with Beijing accusing President Joe Biden's administration of being hostile. A number of Western countries have also expressed concern at China's recent displays of military might. This video can not be played How powerful is China's military? Michael Shoebridge, the director of defence, strategy and national security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said if a hypersonic missile had been tested it would fit a ""pattern of escalation in nuclear and other strike weapons"". ""I don't think it's more significant than China's growing missile silos or air launch nuclear weapons or new submarine nuclear weapons,"" he said. ""But it fits a pattern of increasing capability [without] transparency."" ""Transparency is an alien concept for Beijing's strategic thinkers,"" he added. China displayed what appeared to be a hypersonic missile platform at a recent military display. Along with China, the US, Russia and at least five other countries are working on hypersonic missile technology. Last month, North Korea said it had successfully tested a new hypersonic missile. And in July, Russia made a similar announcement and said its missile had been launched from a frigate in the White Sea. North Korea says it fired new 'hypersonic missile' Tensions with China worst in 40 years, says Taiwan China jets continue flights in Taiwan defence zone Why is everyone fighting over the South China Sea?

Klarna to offer pay now option ahead of crackdown,"Klarna has over 15 million customers in the UK and was recently valued at $46.5bn Buy now, pay later firm Klarna is planning changes ahead of an expected Treasury crackdown on the UK market. They include a ""pay now"" option, to let people pay for items in full, immediately. The boom in the use of buy now, pay later has fuelled fears that it encourages people into debt. Klarna's boss, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, told the BBC that retailers using its service see the average value of an order increase by 40%. The company said it wanted to ""drive up standards"" in the sector by improving the way it operates and communicates as well as introducing the choice of paying for items in full, immediately. Klarna said the ""pay now"" option and other changes it was making would give customers more clarity and control. It also said it would perform more thorough checks on how much users could afford to borrow, and use clearer language during the checkout process to ensure customers understood they were taking on debt. The ""pay now"" option for customers is already available in several of the 20 other countries where Klarna operates. Buy Now Pay Later: 'I'm stressed over debt' Klarna better than costly credit cards, says boss Charities sound alarm over buy-now-pay-later debt Like other buy now, pay later services, Klarna offers shoppers the opportunity of delaying or spreading the cost of a purchase without being charged fees or interest. Instead Klarna charges retailers a small percentage of the transaction cost in exchange for providing the payment service. The opportunity to pay in instalments appeals in particular to younger and low-income shoppers. It allows customers to order several sizes of a clothing item, for example, in the expectation that those which do not fit will have been returned and refunded before they are charged the full amount. But such schemes have been widely criticised for encouraging shoppers to buy more than they can afford, with charities warning it can be a ""slippery slope into debt"". Critics say customers are bombarded with messages urging them to use buy now, pay later credit without a clear enough explanation of what it involves. In particular, buy now, pay later firms have been accused of failing to explain that customers could be referred to debt collectors and that their credit scores could be affected if they miss payments. Consumer group Which? recently found that although Klarna and other firms shared their guidelines with retailers about how their service should be presented, some retailers did not adhere to those guidelines. Klarna is the largest buy now, pay later platform but many other firms offer a similar service, including Clearpay, LayBuy and Paypal. Buy now, pay later services were used by five million people in the UK for total sales of Â£2.7bn in 2020. However, one in 10 people using them already had debt arrears elsewhere, a review by the Financial Conduct Authority found. The review, led by Chris Woolard, found that three quarters of buy now, pay later users were under the age of 36 and the vast majority of transactions related to clothing purchases. The Citizens Advice charity said it had found shoppers did not view buy now, pay later services as ""proper borrowing"" and many did not understand fully what they were signing up for. The charity warned that four-in-10 of those who had used this type of credit in the previous 12 months were struggling to repay. Klarna's boss said he believed there was a place for this kind of affordable credit offering. ""We firmly believe that most of the time, people should pay with the money they have, but there are certain times where credit makes sense,"" Mr Siemiatkowski said. ""In those cases, our [buy now, pay later] products offer a sustainable and no-cost healthy form of credit - and a much needed alternative to high-cost credit cards."" Klarna said it had worked with consumer group Fairer Finance to ensure its terms and conditions were ""clear, simple and easy to understand"", and that the language during the checkout process made it ""absolutely clear"" there would be ""consequences for missed payments"". It had also improved its complaints procedure for dissatisfied customers, it said. In February, the government announced,externalthat buy now, pay later products would be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The Treasury's consultation on the sector is expected before the financial watchdog sets out its rules on regulation later. The government said that giving the FCA oversight of firms like Klarna, Clearpay or Laybuy would mean that customers would be able to complain to the Financial Ombudsman if they were not happy with the service.

LiveLiveMPs open up about abuse and threats after Amess killing4 minutes ago,"A memorial service for Sir David Amess has been held at St Margaretâs Church in Westminster Addressing the congregation, which included around 800 of Sir David's colleagues, the Archbishop of Canterbury described him as ""of the best"" The Archbishop of York remembered his ""ability to listen"" and ""determination to help"" Earlier, Boris Johnson paid tribute in the Commons and announced Southend-on-Sea would become a city Sir David campaigned tirelessly to gain that recognition for the town MPs have been sharing memories of their former colleague in Parliament, with the PM describing him as a âsteadfast servantâ Sir David, 69, was meeting constituents in his Southend West seat when he was fatally stabbed on Friday A 25-year-old man was arrested at the scene and is being questioned by police Edited by Becky Morton That's all from our live coverage on a sombre day, which saw MPs gather to remember Sir David Amess, who was stabbed to death in his constituency on Friday. Here's a reminder of what has happened: Today's coverage has been edited by Hamish Mackay, Claire Heald and Becky Morton and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, Justin Parkinson, Sinead Wilson and Katie Wright. The choir sings Gabriel FaurÃ©âs
Requiem in D minor, which marks the end of the service. The choir and clergy depart, and then MPs and peers begin to file
out of the church. After the Lord's Prayer and the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, the Rev Anthony Ball thanks those who have helped organise the service at short notice. He then gives the blessing, telling people to ""go forth into the world in peace, be of good courage, hold fast that which is good, render to no one evil for evil"". He asks them to ""strengthen the fainthearted, support the weak, help the afflicted, honour all people"" and ""love and serve the Lord"". Canon Pat Browne, Roman Catholic duty priest to the House of
Commons, introduces the prayers. He starts by saying: âLet
us pray for the soul of David Amess, and for all who have died in the service
of Parliament.â Bishop of Durham Paul Butler says:âLet us pray for all who mourn Davidâs
passing: for those who are in shock and deep sadness, especially his family,
his friends, colleagues, and staff in his constituency, party, and across
Parliament.â The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, who was a friend of the late MP, says: ""Let us pray for
those causes closest to Davidâs heart: for the support of those living with
disability; for the humane treatment of animals; for decency in public life and
discourse. ""Let us give thanks for his care of individuals; his ability to
listen, and his determination to help."" The Speakerâs Chaplain says: ""Let us pray
for Parliament: for those who feel vulnerable in public service, and those
charged with their protection; for peace in our land and an end to rancour and
the threat of violence."" Canon
Browne finishes by saying: ""Let us pray
for ourselves, that we may be given strength, courage, and protection in our
public service."" The Archbishop goes on to say that Sir David will be remembered alongside MPs and others who have been killed in the course of public service. ""Public service in politics is a sacrifice that should be honoured and respected even when differences of opinion run very deep indeed - David showed that,"" he says. ""The light lit by public service, by you all and your colleagues, must never be put out even in the darkest moments,"" he says. He says for Sir David's family this time is ""as dark as it could be"". The Archbishop says Sir David's public service was ""inspired by his strong personal faith"" and says that light ""may flicker but it will not be extinguished"". He says that while we ""mourn and grieve"" we also thank those who serve in politics - ""we need them"". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, begins his address by saying that the ""noble calling of politicians in a democracy is to make all manner of sacrifices - seen and unseen"". He says that is why across the nation we should be thankful to everyone who is present ""who give so much despite the cynicism, abuse and cruelty they so often endure"". He says that often in great tragedies ""we conclude that the best are among the first to suffer"". ""In this great tragedy there is a unanimous conviction amongst all who knew him that Sir David was of the best,"" he adds. The Archbishop speaks of Sir David's wholehearted support of causes ""from the now achieved city status of Southend"" to ""great causes of the future of our nation around Brexit"", and says that all these came with a ""robust spirit and charity of heart"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer are among around 800 politicians attending the church service to remember their colleague, Sir David Amess. Politicians from all parties, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel and Lisa Nandy sat in the rows behind the PM, who sat on the front row alongside Starmer and SNP Westminster leader Sir Ian Blackford. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is among those to address the service After the choir leads the congregation in the hymn Abide With Me, the Lord Speaker, Lord McFall of Alcluith, reads Isaih 12. The choir, St Margaretâs Consort which is conducted by Greg Morris, then sings Psalm 112 before Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, reads from Thessalonians. He reads: ""We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. ""For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have died."" The Rev Anthony Ball opens the service by saying: ""We gather here in prayer
and remembrance, as have parliamentarians for hundreds of years, held in the
steadfast love of God. ""Here, in the Parliamentary Church, we come to mourn the
untimely death of Sir David Amess MP, to pray for Julia,
their family, and all who feel his loss so keenly, to remember the kindness and
commitment of a friend and colleague, and to console each other in our grief. ""Here we acknowledge a shared sense of vulnerability even as we express the
determination to maintain our public service. Here we seek Godâs protection and
the needful gifts of courage and strength for the days ahead."" The service of remembrance for Sir David Amess has begun at St Margaret's Church, beside Westminster Abbey. It is being led by the Rev Anthony Ball, Canon of Westminster and Rector of St Margaret's Church. Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent The
traffic was stopped, the street was silent for Sir David Amess's friends and
colleagues to make the short walk across the road from Parliament to St
Margaret's Church through the autumn afternoon. But though there
had been sadness and even tears as the Commons and Lords paid tribute to Sir
David - there was a surprising amount of laughter too. Everyone who knew
him seemed to have an anecdote about his irreverent joie de vivre alongside his
kindness and gentleness. Democracy may be about debate and division, but
even MPs who disagreed with him politically were united in this - that
they'd lost a good and decent man. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader SIr Keir Starmer and House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle are among the parliamentarians who have gathered for a service in memory of Sir David Amess. It is taking place across the road from Parliament at St Margaret's Church in the grounds of Westminster Abbey. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will take part in the service, due to begin at 18:00 BST. After two hours MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the House of Commons. Many shared stories of his humour and kindness as well as the hard work he put in for his constituents. MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the Commons and are now heading over to a church service in memory of him. It is being held at St Margaret's Church, in the grounds of Westminster Abbey, and the Archbishop of Canterbury will give an address. The service is due to start at 18:00 BST. ""Nobody could doubt [Sir] David [Amess's] wish to make the world a better place with his kindness,"" says fellow Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin. Sir Bernard says this quality - kindness - should be known in public life in future as ""the David Amess principle"". Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says people don't appreciate how much MPs work together, but ""they do and Sir David did"". This ""terrible, abhorrent death"" makes us remember that when we stand up for democracy we are standing up for civility, for good behaviour and for treating people properly, she says, adding: ""Violence must never be allowed to succeed again."" Labour's Stephen Timms - who himself was stabbed during his  constituency surgery in 2010 - says kindness was evident throughout Sir David's career. He recalls working with him on Newham Council in the 1970s and says he managed to win over everyone from across the political spectrum. ""He was accessible to his constituents and we must now reflect on what more we can do to stop that happening again,"" he says. ""I wonder if we might ask the police to review our appointment lists ahead of each surgery for example."" The Green Party has announced it will not put forward a candidate in the by-election set to take place in Southend West following the death of MP Sir David Amess last Friday. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have already said they will not take part. No date has yet been set for the contest. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater - sister of the murdered MP Jo Cox - offers ""love, support and solidarity"" to the family of Sir David Amess. She recalls ""physically trembling"" and feeling ""physical pain"" when she heard in 2016 that her sister had died, adding that there followed a ""rollercoaster of deep trauma that nobody should have to experience"". The House of Commons tributes to Sir David would be a ""morsel of comfort"" at their time of pain, Leadbeater says. She implores fellow MPs to offer his family support over the coming weeks and months, adding that ""they will need it"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper says that ""every one of us"" has a story of something they worked with Sir David on, and that so often ""kindness and compassion"" were at the heart of it. She says that, as her office was above his, often they would walk to the Commons together chatting about their families. She says that hanging on Sir David's office door is cardboard cutout of a knight in armour ""with the helmet tilted in a jaunty way"". ""And that knight in shining armour is what Sir David would have been for so many of his constituents,"" she says. She quotes Jo Cox saying ""we have more in common than that which divides us"" and says Sir David ""showed us how to do this"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Death of MP brings it all back, says Jo Cox familyBrendan Cox, whose wife was killed in 2016, had a ""physical reaction"" to Sir David Amess' death.","The widower of murdered MP Jo Cox has spoken of his ""very physical reaction"" to the killing of Sir David Amess. Brendan Cox said he was put back ""in that moment five years ago"" when he learned his wife had been killed by a right-wing extremist in West Yorkshire. He said he felt ""a wave of emotion"" for Sir David's family and applauded their statementcalling for togetherness. MPs are due to pay tribute to Sir David, Conservative MP for Southend West, in Parliament later. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will lead MPs as they pay their respects and share memories from 15:30 BST, after prayers and a minute's silence. There will then be a service at St Margaret's Church, next to Parliament, at which the Archbishop of Canterbury will give an address. Sir David, 69, had been meeting constituents in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, when he was stabbed multiple times on Friday. A 25-year-old British man is being held under the Terrorism Act. The family of Sir David have said their hearts are shattered and called for people to ""set aside hatred and work towards togetherness"". They added that the ""wonderful"" tributes paid to the father-of-five had given them strength but that they are still trying to understand ""why this awful thing has occurred... nobody should die in that way"". They described him as strong and courageous, a patriot and a man of peace, adding: ""We ask people to set aside their differences and show kindness and love to all. Please let some good come from this tragedy. ""We are absolutely broken, but we will survive and carry on for the sake of a wonderful and inspiring man."" Live: Westminster to pay tribute Show kindness and love, say Sir David's family Obituary: Sir David Amess Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cox said when he heard the news about Sir David, he was immediately taken back to getting the phone call being told about what had happened to his wife. She was Labour MP for Batley and Spen when she was killed in Birstall, where a constituency surgery was due to take place, in 2016. Her sister Kim Leadbeateris now the MP for the area. Jo Cox was killed in 2016 ""Being back in that moment was very hard,"" Mr Cox said of when he learned Sir David, MP for Southend West since 1997, had been fatally stabbed on Friday. ""And then just a wave of emotion, of sadness, of sorrow for what his family would be going through having gone through something very similar, knowing those first moments where you hear about the attack but hope that it will be OK through to those moments when you get told and then you have to tell other people."" He also told BBC Breakfast that when he heard the news: ""I found it very hard to function. I picked the kids up from school and went away for the weekend, just to try and get away from it all."" Mr Cox said he felt ""terrible sadness for the family, knowing what they're going through"", with the realisation that ""the worst possible thing you could ever imagine in your life has just happened"". He said for his two children, ""hearing about this over the weekend does bring it all back"". They speak about their mother all the time, he added, and she is ""an ongoing force in our family"". Their children are ""very proud"" of her and he makes sure they ""keep her very human"" by remembering all aspects of her personality. This video can not be played Brendan Cox says public reaction to Sir David Amess' death will comfort family The outpouring of grief for Sir David will be a comfort for his family, said Mr Cox, as it was for him when his wife was killed. The public reaction ""really did make a difference to us"", he added, saying: ""It really did give us that sense of solidarity of kindness in a world which at that moment feels incredibly unkind."" Both the attack on his wife, and that on Sir David, were an ""attack on our democracy"", he added - but democracy is the very thing that ""binds us together - it is one of the things that is our strength"". Mr Cox added that the message of unity from Sir David's family was so important because society needs to change its response to terrorism. ""It's about denying terrorists what they want,"" he said. ""They want that division so let's give them togetherness. They want that infamy so let's give them neglect, let's not put their pictures on the front page of newspapers - we have to stop playing into the hands of being the inadvertent amplifiers of terrorism."" Labour MP Tulip Saddiq has told the BBC her mother feared for her safety More MPs have opened up about their own personal safety following the death of their colleague. Many have spoken of a toxic and increasingly polarised political culture where online trolling has become widespread, ranging from personal insults at one end of the spectrum to direct threats of violence and even death at the other. Labour MP Tulip Sadiq told BBC Breakfast all MPs, especially women, are subject to attack and that her mother feared for her doing the job. She said being an MP had had a ""constant effect"" on her family for years, especially her parents. Sir David's neighbouring MP in Southend, Conservative James Duddridge, said: ""No-one that loves me, none of my friends would want me to be a Member of Parliament. ""The only reason they support it is because they know that that's what I believe is an honourable thing to do, a worthwhile thing to do, something I'd always wanted to do, something that I have enjoyed. "" Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said he had received ""three threats to life and limb"" over the past two years - but he does not want to ""allow those who attack our democracy"" to win. And Labour's Chris Bryant saida man had been arrestedover a death threat he received over the weekend. Read more here. He also said it is right to look at MPs' security, but people should not ""pretend that's going to fix the problem"". Concerns have been raised about the safety of politicians following Sir David's death. Home Secretary Priti Patel and Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyleare working on measuresto protect MPs and police forces have been asked to review their security arrangements with immediate effect. A police search at a house in north London is thought to be linked to the inquiry Detectives are continuing to hold the 25-year-old man in connection with Sir David's death and have until Friday to question him. Whitehall officials confirmed the man's name as Ali Harbi Ali, and said he was a British man of Somali heritage. The BBC understands he was referred to the counter-terrorist Prevent scheme some years ago, but was never a formal subject of interest to MI5. It also understands that his father, Harbi Ali Kullane, who was previously an adviser to Somalia's prime minister, has been visited by police who have taken his phone for analysis. Police officers have spent the weekend searching three addresses in London. It is thought a converted Victorian property in Lady Somerset Road in north-west London is linked to the investigation. Neighbours said officers started searching it late on Friday night. Further searches, also believed to be part of the inquiry, have been taking place at a property in Bounds Green Road, north London, and another in Cranmer Road, Croydon, south London. The police cordon outside the church in Eastwood Road North, Leigh-on-Sea, where Sir David was stabbed to death has now been lifted. Flowers have been left outside Belfairs Methodist Church and uniformed police officers remain at the scene.

Impact of scams on wellbeing calculated as Â£9bn,"The cost to scam victims' wellbeing can be calculated at a monetary total of Â£9.3bn a year, according to the consumer group Which?. That is the equivalent of Â£2,509 a year for each victim, but the impact can be higher for someone hit by online fraud. People targeted by fraudsters have spoken of suffering from anxiety and ill-health after being scammed. Which? says the cost to well-being is higher than the typical financial hit of Â£600. The consumers' association appointed consultants to study data including 17,000 responses to the Office for National Statistics' Crime Survey for England and Wales. The results were then applied to an approach to assessing social impacts approved by the Treasury earlier this year. The model allows researchers to value changes in wellbeing in monetary terms. The research suggested scam victims faced a drop in life satisfaction, significantly higher levels of anxiety, and lower levels of happiness. It was also associated with people self-reporting worse general health, although to a much smaller degree. Jennifer Runham burst into tears in her local bank branch, on her way to the school run, after being told she was a victim of a scam. A cycle of events began when she received an email claiming that she needed to renew her TV licence. She entered her details on what proved to be a fake website, before receiving a call from criminals claiming to be from her bank's fraud department. They had even spoofed her bank's phone number. She transferred Â£1,500 before realising she had been tricked. Jennifer Runham says the impact of being scammed was more than financial ""The impact was massive. I was so upset, scared and anxious,"" said Mrs Runham, who is in her 40s. ""My severe level of anxiety meant I had a lot of help from Victim Support."" It took a year of battling before her bank reimbursed the money. ""It takes a lot of courage to go through the complaints process. I felt they were blaming me,"" she said. ""I went to the ombudsman. When I got my money back, I felt I had some freedom to get on with my life."" Charity Age UK hasinformation and advice about TV Licence scams,external Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: ""This brings home the scale of the emotional and psychological harm that victims suffer when they are defrauded.Â ""The government must not ignore the huge impact an epidemic of fraud is having on our society."" She is presenting the findings to MPs on the Draft Online Safety Bill Joint Committee on Monday. Fraudsters steal Â£4m a day as crime surges 'We lost nearly Â£10k to TV licence scammers' New 159 fraud hotline launched to counter threat The draft Bill includes measures to tackle user-generated fraud like romance scams, but omits the scam adverts leading to other types of fraud such as investment scams. The consumer group, alongside campaigners such as Moneysavingexpert's Martin Lewis, are calling for more comprehensive and urgent action regarding online scams. It is calling on the government to include scam adverts in the Online Safety Bill as the first step towards new laws and regulations placing more content policing responsibility on online platforms. Home Secretary Priti Patel has said that the scam provisions in the Online Safety Bill would help fight ""ruthless criminals who defraud millions of people"".

Ford to make electric car parts on Merseyside,"Ford is to invest Â£230m in its Halewood plant on Merseyside to make electric car parts, helping safeguard 500 jobs. The investment will mean the plant will run for many years longer, said Stuart Rowley, president, Ford of Europe. There had been speculation about the future of the Halewood factory complex as Ford moves towards electrifying its vehicles. Part of the investment will come from the government's Automotive Transformation Fund. ""We're really pleased with the support from the UK government,"" Mr Rowley told the BBC. ""We're not disclosing the exact amount, but it was good support for what is a very significant investment in the UK."" He said the government support was ""a part of the decision"" to choose to invest in Halewood, ""but not the only element"". Ford's Halewood plant will begin manufacturing electric power units - which replace the engine and transmission in petrol cars - in 2024. Ford has said it is committed to the UK, but not all locations have been as fortunate. Its engine plant in Bridgend closed in September last year, with the loss of 1,700 jobs, after the company described it as ""economically unsustainable"". Ford blamed ""changing customer demand and cost"" for the closure plans and denied Brexit was a factor. Car registrations at lowest level for two decades Ford is latest firm to stop making cars in India Jaguar Land Rover manufacture tools in-house Ford is not the first manufacturer to receive financial help for electric vehicle production through the fund, set up to encourage investment in electric vehicle manufacturing in the UK. In July, Nissan announceda major expansion of electric vehicle production at its car plant in Sunderland, which will create 1,650 new jobs. The Japanese carmaker will build its new-generation all-electric model at the site as part of a Â£1bn investment that will also support thousands of jobs in the supply chain. And Nissan's partner, Envision AESC, will build an electric battery plant. Ford's Mr Rowley said its plans were ""a huge vote of confidence in [the] workforce"". ""Ford has been part of the industrial and social fabric of the UK for many decades,"" he said, adding that the plant would be a ""very important"" part of Ford's electrification plans in Europe. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the Ford decision was ""further proof that the UK remains one of the best locations in the world for high-quality automotive manufacturing"". ""In this highly competitive, global race to secure electric vehicle manufacturing, our priority is to ensure the UK reaps the benefits,"" he added. Ford's Halewood plant will manufacture electric power units Kevin Pearson of the Unite union said the Ford investment ""recognises the experience, commitment and competitiveness of our world class workforce and is a great source of pride for all of us working at Halewood Transmission Plant and for the wider community"". The announcement suggested the facility would be an important part of electric vehicle manufacturing in the UK, said Prof David Bailey of Birmingham Business School. He said that was ""especially great news"" because there had been ""a lot of speculation about the plant"", including that Ford might move parts manufacturing and car assembly abroad. Had Halewood closed, it would have had a knock-on effect on other parts of the UK car industry and the local economy, he said. Prof Bailey said that the UK's exit from the EU had been a ""huge concern"" initially, before the tariff-free trade deal was agreed between the EU and the UK. However, Ford said that it was not currently facing the kind of supply chain difficulties affecting some other UK businesses. Additional post-Brexit paperwork at ports, which has contributed to bottlenecks for some UK-based firms, has not been much of an obstacle for Ford as it has its own landing facilities at Dagenham, the firm said. Ford is concerned about any possible fallout from UK and EU negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol, a spokesperson said. The global car giant also recently announced a $1bn (Â£730m) investment in its vehicle assembly facility in Cologne, Germany, and an expansion of electric vehicle production in Turkey and Romania.

LiveWestminster to pay tribute to Sir David Amess,"A memorial service for Sir David Amess has been held at St Margaretâs Church in Westminster Addressing the congregation, which included around 800 of Sir David's colleagues, the Archbishop of Canterbury described him as ""of the best"" The Archbishop of York remembered his ""ability to listen"" and ""determination to help"" Earlier, Boris Johnson paid tribute in the Commons and announced Southend-on-Sea would become a city Sir David campaigned tirelessly to gain that recognition for the town MPs have been sharing memories of their former colleague in Parliament, with the PM describing him as a âsteadfast servantâ Sir David, 69, was meeting constituents in his Southend West seat when he was fatally stabbed on Friday A 25-year-old man was arrested at the scene and is being questioned by police Edited by Becky Morton That's all from our live coverage on a sombre day, which saw MPs gather to remember Sir David Amess, who was stabbed to death in his constituency on Friday. Here's a reminder of what has happened: Today's coverage has been edited by Hamish Mackay, Claire Heald and Becky Morton and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, Justin Parkinson, Sinead Wilson and Katie Wright. The choir sings Gabriel FaurÃ©âs
Requiem in D minor, which marks the end of the service. The choir and clergy depart, and then MPs and peers begin to file
out of the church. After the Lord's Prayer and the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, the Rev Anthony Ball thanks those who have helped organise the service at short notice. He then gives the blessing, telling people to ""go forth into the world in peace, be of good courage, hold fast that which is good, render to no one evil for evil"". He asks them to ""strengthen the fainthearted, support the weak, help the afflicted, honour all people"" and ""love and serve the Lord"". Canon Pat Browne, Roman Catholic duty priest to the House of
Commons, introduces the prayers. He starts by saying: âLet
us pray for the soul of David Amess, and for all who have died in the service
of Parliament.â Bishop of Durham Paul Butler says:âLet us pray for all who mourn Davidâs
passing: for those who are in shock and deep sadness, especially his family,
his friends, colleagues, and staff in his constituency, party, and across
Parliament.â The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, who was a friend of the late MP, says: ""Let us pray for
those causes closest to Davidâs heart: for the support of those living with
disability; for the humane treatment of animals; for decency in public life and
discourse. ""Let us give thanks for his care of individuals; his ability to
listen, and his determination to help."" The Speakerâs Chaplain says: ""Let us pray
for Parliament: for those who feel vulnerable in public service, and those
charged with their protection; for peace in our land and an end to rancour and
the threat of violence."" Canon
Browne finishes by saying: ""Let us pray
for ourselves, that we may be given strength, courage, and protection in our
public service."" The Archbishop goes on to say that Sir David will be remembered alongside MPs and others who have been killed in the course of public service. ""Public service in politics is a sacrifice that should be honoured and respected even when differences of opinion run very deep indeed - David showed that,"" he says. ""The light lit by public service, by you all and your colleagues, must never be put out even in the darkest moments,"" he says. He says for Sir David's family this time is ""as dark as it could be"". The Archbishop says Sir David's public service was ""inspired by his strong personal faith"" and says that light ""may flicker but it will not be extinguished"". He says that while we ""mourn and grieve"" we also thank those who serve in politics - ""we need them"". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, begins his address by saying that the ""noble calling of politicians in a democracy is to make all manner of sacrifices - seen and unseen"". He says that is why across the nation we should be thankful to everyone who is present ""who give so much despite the cynicism, abuse and cruelty they so often endure"". He says that often in great tragedies ""we conclude that the best are among the first to suffer"". ""In this great tragedy there is a unanimous conviction amongst all who knew him that Sir David was of the best,"" he adds. The Archbishop speaks of Sir David's wholehearted support of causes ""from the now achieved city status of Southend"" to ""great causes of the future of our nation around Brexit"", and says that all these came with a ""robust spirit and charity of heart"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer are among around 800 politicians attending the church service to remember their colleague, Sir David Amess. Politicians from all parties, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel and Lisa Nandy sat in the rows behind the PM, who sat on the front row alongside Starmer and SNP Westminster leader Sir Ian Blackford. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is among those to address the service After the choir leads the congregation in the hymn Abide With Me, the Lord Speaker, Lord McFall of Alcluith, reads Isaih 12. The choir, St Margaretâs Consort which is conducted by Greg Morris, then sings Psalm 112 before Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, reads from Thessalonians. He reads: ""We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. ""For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have died."" The Rev Anthony Ball opens the service by saying: ""We gather here in prayer
and remembrance, as have parliamentarians for hundreds of years, held in the
steadfast love of God. ""Here, in the Parliamentary Church, we come to mourn the
untimely death of Sir David Amess MP, to pray for Julia,
their family, and all who feel his loss so keenly, to remember the kindness and
commitment of a friend and colleague, and to console each other in our grief. ""Here we acknowledge a shared sense of vulnerability even as we express the
determination to maintain our public service. Here we seek Godâs protection and
the needful gifts of courage and strength for the days ahead."" The service of remembrance for Sir David Amess has begun at St Margaret's Church, beside Westminster Abbey.

""I wonder if we might ask the police to review our appointment lists ahead of each surgery for example."" The Green Party has announced it will not put forward a candidate in the by-election set to take place in Southend West following the death of MP Sir David Amess last Friday. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have already said they will not take part. No date has yet been set for the contest. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater - sister of the murdered MP Jo Cox - offers ""love, support and solidarity"" to the family of Sir David Amess. She recalls ""physically trembling"" and feeling ""physical pain"" when she heard in 2016 that her sister had died, adding that there followed a ""rollercoaster of deep trauma that nobody should have to experience"". The House of Commons tributes to Sir David would be a ""morsel of comfort"" at their time of pain, Leadbeater says. She implores fellow MPs to offer his family support over the coming weeks and months, adding that ""they will need it"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper says that ""every one of us"" has a story of something they worked with Sir David on, and that so often ""kindness and compassion"" were at the heart of it. She says that, as her office was above his, often they would walk to the Commons together chatting about their families. She says that hanging on Sir David's office door is cardboard cutout of a knight in armour ""with the helmet tilted in a jaunty way"". ""And that knight in shining armour is what Sir David would have been for so many of his constituents,"" she says. She quotes Jo Cox saying ""we have more in common than that which divides us"" and says Sir David ""showed us how to do this"". Â© 2025 BBC.

GB's Norrie wins Indian Wells title,"Cameron Norrie (right) won his second title of the year and the biggest of his career Cameron Norrie became the first Briton to win the Indian Wells title when he fought back from a set and a break down to beat Nikoloz Basilashvili. Norrie, 26, won 3-6 6-4 6-1 against the Georgian to seal one of the biggest titles in tennis. ""I'm so happy, I can't even describe it,"" he said on court. His exploits in California have propelled Norrie to British number one and he is in the running to reach the elite season-ending ATP Finals. Norrie will rise to a career-high 16th in the world, having started the year ranked 74th, after a stunning season where he has reached six finals and won 47 matches. Norrie had led in the first set with an early break but was pegged back as the big-hitting Basilashvili took charge. But the Briton, whose resilience and fitness have been the hallmark of his successful year, broke to love to level and force a deciding set. The left-hander broke early in the third and saved three break points on his serve to take a 3-0 lead as unforced errors began to mount for the Georgian world number 36, who eventually sent a forehand long on championship point to hand Norrie the biggest title of his career. ""I can't really believe it. If you'd have told me I'd have won before the tournament started I wouldn't have believed you, so it's amazing,"" said Norrie, who is the first British player to reach the final at one of the elite Masters 1,000 events since Andy Murray won in Paris in 2016. Who 'threw away' Norrie's shoes before final? Badosa wins Indian Wells on debut Raducanu to train with Konta's ex-coach Norrie's win comes just a month after compatriot Emma Raducanu's stunning US Open victory as British tennis enjoys something of a resurgence. While Raducanu's rise to British number one was sudden and dramatic, Norrie's path to the top has been more understated and built on consistency. Only world number one Novak Djokovic has been in as many finals this year as Norrie, whose versatility has taken him to finals on hard, clay and grass courts. His maiden ATP singles trophy came in July when he won the Los Cabos Open in Mexico and he has now backed that up with one of the most prestigious tour titles outside the four Grand Slams. He has also achieved something that no other Briton has, with Murray, Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski all having reached the Indian Wells final but finishing as runners-up in California. He is 10th in the race to qualify for next month's eight-man ATP Finals in Turin and with eighth-placed Rafael Nadal missing the rest of the season, Norrie is within touching distance of overtaking ninth-placed Hubert Hurkacz and booking a spot. He is scheduled to compete in events in Vienna and Paris next as he seeks to gather enough points to complete what would have been considered an unlikely feat at the start of the season. The very best of Norrie's game was on display at 5-4 in the second set when the Briton produced a delightful drop-shot and lob combination, as well as an inside out forehand volley, to set up a break to love and a total swing in momentum. After breaking early in the third he then had to fend off three break points to go 3-0 up and he then never looked back as Basilashvili came back from a bathroom break to put in a poor service game that left Norrie serving for the match. The Briton needed only one of his two championship points to secure the win as the errors kept coming off Basilashvili's racquet. ""For a stage he went through and hit so many winners. It was tough for me to get some confidence. The rallies were really short and he was just blasting winners,"" said Norrie, ""When I made a couple of big shots in the 5-4 game in the second set it gave me a lot of confidence, and I was able to find my feet again, start moving again, and make the rallies physical like I've been doing all tournament and it worked in my favour."" Norrie, whose only struggle of the day was when he was trying to lift the heavy glass trophy, dedicated his victory to his parents. Born in South Africa, Norrie has a Scottish dad and Welsh mum, and was brought up in New Zealand before playing college tennis in the United States. While many of his peers took the more conventional route from junior tennis to the professional Futures circuit, Norrie chose to combine his sport with studying for a sociology degree, in order to have a more ""normal life"". BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Basilashvili is known for his ferocious power, and Norrie was in danger of being overwhelmed when he dropped serve early in the second set. But the 26-year-old knuckled down, broke to win the set with some attacking brilliance and then drove the Georgian to distraction with some breathtaking defence in the decider. All the more impressive when you learn the shoes he had left on top of his locker disappeared overnight, leaving him to break in a new pair in the biggest match of his life. The greatest triumph of Norrie's career leaves him within 160 points of the man currently in the final qualifying spot for the ATP Finals. It is a lot to ask him to continue in the same vein after switching continents, and with no time for rest, but he is entered in tournaments in Vienna, Paris and Stockholm before the season is out.

"Show kindness and love, say family of killed MP","People in Leigh-on Sea have been remembering Sir David The family of MP Sir David Amess have said their hearts are shattered as they called on people to ""set aside hatred and work towards togetherness"". The Conservative MP was stabbed multiple times during a meeting with his constituents in Essex on Friday. A 25-year-old British man is being held under the Terrorism Act. In a statement, his family said they were trying to understand ""why this awful thing has occurred... nobody should die in that way. Nobody"". Sir David, 69, was married with four daughters and a son. The family said the ""wonderful"" tributes paid to him by friends, constituents and the public had given them strength. ""We have realised from tributes paid that there was far, far more to David than even we, those closest to him, knew,"" they added. ""We are enormously proud of him. Our hearts are shattered."" On Monday afternoon, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will lead MPs in paying tribute to their late colleague in the House of Commons. Politicians will have at least two hours from 15:30 BST to share their memories of Sir David, after prayers and a minute's silence. The tributes will be followed by a service at St Margaret's Church, next to Parliament. Obituary: Sir David Amess How a tragic day unfolded in Leigh-on-Sea A Conservative MP since 1983 - first in Basildon and, from 1997, in Southend West - he was a champion for the town he represented, particularly in his long-running campaign to make Southend a city. His family have asked people to support campaigns that he was involved in, including fundraising for a memorial to Dame Vera Lynn, who he thought ""epitomised the strength of the nation"" - and to help Southend gain city status. They described Sir David as strong and courageous, a patriot and a man of peace. ""We ask people to set aside their differences and show kindness and love to all. Please let some good come from this tragedy. ""We are absolutely broken, but we will survive and carry on for the sake of a wonderful and inspiring man."" Raised as a Roman Catholic, Sir David was known politically as a social conservative and a prominent campaigner against abortion. He was also a committed campaigner on animal welfare issues, and supported a ban on fox hunting. David and his wife Julia, pictured in 1990, with three of their five children Tributes to Sir David have been pouring in from politicians and constituents, with Home Secretary Priti Patel saying his ""infectious personality"" meant he ""touched so many lives"". Over the weekend, people gathered for candlelit vigils in Leigh-on-Sea to mark Sir David's life and attended a church service to share their memories of him. Many constituents have reflected on his gentle nature and willingness to listen and to help. A police search at a house in north London is thought to be linked to the inquiry Detectives are continuing to hold the 25-year-old man at a London police station and have until Friday to question him. Whitehall officials confirmed the man's name as Ali Harbi Ali, and said he was a British man of Somali heritage. The BBC understands he was referred to the counter-terrorist Prevent scheme some years ago, but was never a formal subject of interest to MI5. It also understands that his father, Harbi Ali Kullane, who was previously an adviser to Somalia's prime minister, has been visited by police who have taken his phone for analysis. Police officers have spent the weekend searching three addresses in London. It is thought a converted Victorian property in Lady Somerset Road in north-west London is linked to the investigation. Neighbours said officers started searching it late on Friday night. Further searches, also believed to be part of the inquiry, have been taking place at a property in Bounds Green Road, north London, and another in Cranmer Road, Croydon, south London.

Death of MP 'brings it all back' for Jo Cox family,"The widower of murdered MP Jo Cox has spoken of his ""very physical reaction"" to the killing of Sir David Amess. Brendan Cox said he was put back ""in that moment five years ago"" when he learned his wife had been killed by a right-wing extremist in West Yorkshire. He said he felt ""a wave of emotion"" for Sir David's family and applauded their statementcalling for togetherness. MPs are due to pay tribute to Sir David, Conservative MP for Southend West, in Parliament later. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will lead MPs as they pay their respects and share memories from 15:30 BST, after prayers and a minute's silence. There will then be a service at St Margaret's Church, next to Parliament, at which the Archbishop of Canterbury will give an address. Sir David, 69, had been meeting constituents in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, when he was stabbed multiple times on Friday. A 25-year-old British man is being held under the Terrorism Act. The family of Sir David have said their hearts are shattered and called for people to ""set aside hatred and work towards togetherness"". They added that the ""wonderful"" tributes paid to the father-of-five had given them strength but that they are still trying to understand ""why this awful thing has occurred... nobody should die in that way"". They described him as strong and courageous, a patriot and a man of peace, adding: ""We ask people to set aside their differences and show kindness and love to all. Please let some good come from this tragedy. ""We are absolutely broken, but we will survive and carry on for the sake of a wonderful and inspiring man."" Live: Westminster to pay tribute Show kindness and love, say Sir David's family Obituary: Sir David Amess Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cox said when he heard the news about Sir David, he was immediately taken back to getting the phone call being told about what had happened to his wife. She was Labour MP for Batley and Spen when she was killed in Birstall, where a constituency surgery was due to take place, in 2016. Her sister Kim Leadbeateris now the MP for the area. Jo Cox was killed in 2016 ""Being back in that moment was very hard,"" Mr Cox said of when he learned Sir David, MP for Southend West since 1997, had been fatally stabbed on Friday. ""And then just a wave of emotion, of sadness, of sorrow for what his family would be going through having gone through something very similar, knowing those first moments where you hear about the attack but hope that it will be OK through to those moments when you get told and then you have to tell other people."" He also told BBC Breakfast that when he heard the news: ""I found it very hard to function. I picked the kids up from school and went away for the weekend, just to try and get away from it all."" Mr Cox said he felt ""terrible sadness for the family, knowing what they're going through"", with the realisation that ""the worst possible thing you could ever imagine in your life has just happened"". He said for his two children, ""hearing about this over the weekend does bring it all back"". They speak about their mother all the time, he added, and she is ""an ongoing force in our family"". Their children are ""very proud"" of her and he makes sure they ""keep her very human"" by remembering all aspects of her personality. This video can not be played Brendan Cox says public reaction to Sir David Amess' death will comfort family The outpouring of grief for Sir David will be a comfort for his family, said Mr Cox, as it was for him when his wife was killed. The public reaction ""really did make a difference to us"", he added, saying: ""It really did give us that sense of solidarity of kindness in a world which at that moment feels incredibly unkind."" Both the attack on his wife, and that on Sir David, were an ""attack on our democracy"", he added - but democracy is the very thing that ""binds us together - it is one of the things that is our strength"". Mr Cox added that the message of unity from Sir David's family was so important because society needs to change its response to terrorism. ""It's about denying terrorists what they want,"" he said. ""They want that division so let's give them togetherness. They want that infamy so let's give them neglect, let's not put their pictures on the front page of newspapers - we have to stop playing into the hands of being the inadvertent amplifiers of terrorism."" Labour MP Tulip Saddiq has told the BBC her mother feared for her safety More MPs have opened up about their own personal safety following the death of their colleague. Many have spoken of a toxic and increasingly polarised political culture where online trolling has become widespread, ranging from personal insults at one end of the spectrum to direct threats of violence and even death at the other. Labour MP Tulip Sadiq told BBC Breakfast all MPs, especially women, are subject to attack and that her mother feared for her doing the job. She said being an MP had had a ""constant effect"" on her family for years, especially her parents. Sir David's neighbouring MP in Southend, Conservative James Duddridge, said: ""No-one that loves me, none of my friends would want me to be a Member of Parliament. ""The only reason they support it is because they know that that's what I believe is an honourable thing to do, a worthwhile thing to do, something I'd always wanted to do, something that I have enjoyed. "" Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said he had received ""three threats to life and limb"" over the past two years - but he does not want to ""allow those who attack our democracy"" to win. And Labour's Chris Bryant saida man had been arrestedover a death threat he received over the weekend. Read more here. He also said it is right to look at MPs' security, but people should not ""pretend that's going to fix the problem"". Concerns have been raised about the safety of politicians following Sir David's death. Home Secretary Priti Patel and Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyleare working on measuresto protect MPs and police forces have been asked to review their security arrangements with immediate effect. A police search at a house in north London is thought to be linked to the inquiry Detectives are continuing to hold the 25-year-old man in connection with Sir David's death and have until Friday to question him.

Tourism voucher scheme 'needs more funding'Stormont officials are still considering the suitability of a holiday-at-home voucher scheme.Northern Ireland,"The voucher scheme would give people discounts when visiting tourist attractions such as the Titanic Belfast Museum A holiday-at-home voucher scheme will need more money behind it to stop people from missing out, a tourism body has said. Under the proposal, vouchers will be issued on a first-come, first-served basis. Unlikethe high street scheme, there will be a limited number available. The Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance (NITA) said the draft Â£2m budget would need to be increased to avoid disappointment. The Department for the Economy said officials were still considering the scheme's suitability. Plans for the schemewere first revealed by BBC News NI in September 2020. High street and holiday voucher schemes announced Â£50 household voucher scheme in draft tourism plan It will allow households to claim back 50% off a stay of two nights or more in certified accommodation, up to the value of Â£100. Vouchers will also be issued, offering 50% off visits to attractions or tourism experience providers, up to the value of Â£20. Every household can apply for one of each type of voucher. The Dark Hedges in north Antrim received a tourism boost due to the popularity of HBO series Game of Thrones. NITA chief executive Joanne Stuart said a lot of people would be disappointed. ""Â£2m has been allocated to this scheme and we do believe the demand will be high and a lot of people will be disappointed, so we would ask the minister to consider the funding he has and whether there is more available to the scheme,"" she said. ""This is not just support for the accommodation sector and tourism attractions. When people stay in a destination, they spend money in hospitality or retail so there would be much more in terms of a wider economic benefit. ""We believe this is a really important intervention for the accommodation and attraction sector and we are working with the department and the minister with regards to when this needs to be launched. ""Given the funding needs to be spent by the end of the financial year we would like to see it launched as soon as possible to see the maximum return on investment,"" she said. Asked if the scheme would be beneficial if launched in January or February, Ms Stuart said she believe it would provide a boost. ""January to March is traditionally the slowest period of the year so if we were able to get a scheme that starts in January, we would get the chance to get the benefit in those slow months,"" she said. ""From 1 April, we are going to see significant cost increases with the rates holiday ending and VAT returning to 20%. ""The majority of tourism businesses have had to take loans and in 2022 the repayments are going to be starting, so anything we can do to help those businesses have a better January to March period would be really good before moving into the high season. We are not out of the woods."" The Giant's Causeway is one of Northern Ireland's best known tourist attractions Northern Ireland's tourism industry has been severely affected by coronavirus restrictions, with lockdowns closing most of the sector. The industry does not expect to welcome international visitors until spring 2022. Under the proposed scheme, money is claimed back by uploading a receipt and voucher details online. A spokesperson for the Department for the Economy told BBC News NI the scheme was one of a number of steps being taken to support the tourism sector. ""The department is currently considering the suitability of the intervention in the context of the levels of consumer demand that were experienced over the summer and the impact of the high street scheme,"" they said. ""This consideration includes working with the industry to decide on the most opportune time to launch any scheme."" Ms Stuart said while there had been support from the domestic market in August and September, the expectation was that demand would begin to fall. ""What we need to remember is the sector has only been able to open for about 50% during 2020 and 50% during 2021,"" she said. ""Year-to-date occupancy figures for hotels are 44% and we are now moving into the low season and there are real financial viability concerns within the industry. ""We are still not out of the woods, so this scheme is really important especially at this time of the year.""

Here's a reminder of what has happened: Today's coverage has been edited by Hamish Mackay, Claire Heald and Becky Morton and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, Justin Parkinson, Sinead Wilson and Katie Wright. The choir sings Gabriel FaurÃ©âs
Requiem in D minor, which marks the end of the service. The choir and clergy depart, and then MPs and peers begin to file
out of the church. After the Lord's Prayer and the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, the Rev Anthony Ball thanks those who have helped organise the service at short notice. He then gives the blessing, telling people to ""go forth into the world in peace, be of good courage, hold fast that which is good, render to no one evil for evil"". He asks them to ""strengthen the fainthearted, support the weak, help the afflicted, honour all people"" and ""love and serve the Lord"". Canon Pat Browne, Roman Catholic duty priest to the House of
Commons, introduces the prayers. He starts by saying: âLet
us pray for the soul of David Amess, and for all who have died in the service
of Parliament.â Bishop of Durham Paul Butler says:âLet us pray for all who mourn Davidâs
passing: for those who are in shock and deep sadness, especially his family,
his friends, colleagues, and staff in his constituency, party, and across
Parliament.â The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, who was a friend of the late MP, says: ""Let us pray for
those causes closest to Davidâs heart: for the support of those living with
disability; for the humane treatment of animals; for decency in public life and
discourse. ""Let us give thanks for his care of individuals; his ability to
listen, and his determination to help."" The Speakerâs Chaplain says: ""Let us pray
for Parliament: for those who feel vulnerable in public service, and those
charged with their protection; for peace in our land and an end to rancour and
the threat of violence."" Canon
Browne finishes by saying: ""Let us pray
for ourselves, that we may be given strength, courage, and protection in our
public service."" The Archbishop goes on to say that Sir David will be remembered alongside MPs and others who have been killed in the course of public service. ""Public service in politics is a sacrifice that should be honoured and respected even when differences of opinion run very deep indeed - David showed that,"" he says. ""The light lit by public service, by you all and your colleagues, must never be put out even in the darkest moments,"" he says. He says for Sir David's family this time is ""as dark as it could be"". The Archbishop says Sir David's public service was ""inspired by his strong personal faith"" and says that light ""may flicker but it will not be extinguished"". He says that while we ""mourn and grieve"" we also thank those who serve in politics - ""we need them"". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, begins his address by saying that the ""noble calling of politicians in a democracy is to make all manner of sacrifices - seen and unseen"". He says that is why across the nation we should be thankful to everyone who is present ""who give so much despite the cynicism, abuse and cruelty they so often endure"". He says that often in great tragedies ""we conclude that the best are among the first to suffer"". ""In this great tragedy there is a unanimous conviction amongst all who knew him that Sir David was of the best,"" he adds. The Archbishop speaks of Sir David's wholehearted support of causes ""from the now achieved city status of Southend"" to ""great causes of the future of our nation around Brexit"", and says that all these came with a ""robust spirit and charity of heart"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer are among around 800 politicians attending the church service to remember their colleague, Sir David Amess. Politicians from all parties, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel and Lisa Nandy sat in the rows behind the PM, who sat on the front row alongside Starmer and SNP Westminster leader Sir Ian Blackford. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is among those to address the service After the choir leads the congregation in the hymn Abide With Me, the Lord Speaker, Lord McFall of Alcluith, reads Isaih 12. The choir, St Margaretâs Consort which is conducted by Greg Morris, then sings Psalm 112 before Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, reads from Thessalonians. He reads: ""We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. ""For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have died."" The Rev Anthony Ball opens the service by saying: ""We gather here in prayer
and remembrance, as have parliamentarians for hundreds of years, held in the
steadfast love of God. ""Here, in the Parliamentary Church, we come to mourn the
untimely death of Sir David Amess MP, to pray for Julia,
their family, and all who feel his loss so keenly, to remember the kindness and
commitment of a friend and colleague, and to console each other in our grief. ""Here we acknowledge a shared sense of vulnerability even as we express the
determination to maintain our public service. Here we seek Godâs protection and
the needful gifts of courage and strength for the days ahead."" The service of remembrance for Sir David Amess has begun at St Margaret's Church, beside Westminster Abbey. It is being led by the Rev Anthony Ball, Canon of Westminster and Rector of St Margaret's Church. Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent The
traffic was stopped, the street was silent for Sir David Amess's friends and
colleagues to make the short walk across the road from Parliament to St
Margaret's Church through the autumn afternoon. But though there
had been sadness and even tears as the Commons and Lords paid tribute to Sir
David - there was a surprising amount of laughter too. Everyone who knew
him seemed to have an anecdote about his irreverent joie de vivre alongside his
kindness and gentleness. Democracy may be about debate and division, but
even MPs who disagreed with him politically were united in this - that
they'd lost a good and decent man. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader SIr Keir Starmer and House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle are among the parliamentarians who have gathered for a service in memory of Sir David Amess. It is taking place across the road from Parliament at St Margaret's Church in the grounds of Westminster Abbey. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will take part in the service, due to begin at 18:00 BST. After two hours MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the House of Commons. Many shared stories of his humour and kindness as well as the hard work he put in for his constituents. MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the Commons and are now heading over to a church service in memory of him. It is being held at St Margaret's Church, in the grounds of Westminster Abbey, and the Archbishop of Canterbury will give an address. The service is due to start at 18:00 BST. ""Nobody could doubt [Sir] David [Amess's] wish to make the world a better place with his kindness,"" says fellow Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin. Sir Bernard says this quality - kindness - should be known in public life in future as ""the David Amess principle"". Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says people don't appreciate how much MPs work together, but ""they do and Sir David did"". This ""terrible, abhorrent death"" makes us remember that when we stand up for democracy we are standing up for civility, for good behaviour and for treating people properly, she says, adding: ""Violence must never be allowed to succeed again."" Labour's Stephen Timms - who himself was stabbed during his  constituency surgery in 2010 - says kindness was evident throughout Sir David's career. He recalls working with him on Newham Council in the 1970s and says he managed to win over everyone from across the political spectrum. ""He was accessible to his constituents and we must now reflect on what more we can do to stop that happening again,"" he says. ""I wonder if we might ask the police to review our appointment lists ahead of each surgery for example."" The Green Party has announced it will not put forward a candidate in the by-election set to take place in Southend West following the death of MP Sir David Amess last Friday. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have already said they will not take part. No date has yet been set for the contest. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater - sister of the murdered MP Jo Cox - offers ""love, support and solidarity"" to the family of Sir David Amess. She recalls ""physically trembling"" and feeling ""physical pain"" when she heard in 2016 that her sister had died, adding that there followed a ""rollercoaster of deep trauma that nobody should have to experience"". The House of Commons tributes to Sir David would be a ""morsel of comfort"" at their time of pain, Leadbeater says. She implores fellow MPs to offer his family support over the coming weeks and months, adding that ""they will need it"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper says that ""every one of us"" has a story of something they worked with Sir David on, and that so often ""kindness and compassion"" were at the heart of it. She says that, as her office was above his, often they would walk to the Commons together chatting about their families. She says that hanging on Sir David's office door is cardboard cutout of a knight in armour ""with the helmet tilted in a jaunty way"". ""And that knight in shining armour is what Sir David would have been for so many of his constituents,"" she says. She quotes Jo Cox saying ""we have more in common than that which divides us"" and says Sir David ""showed us how to do this"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Further strikes looming at universities this termUK university staff are being balloted on fresh strike action over pay, pensions and conditions.","Staff at University of Leicester joined the strike in 2019 Students could face more strike action at universities this term after the academics' union opened a ballot over pay, pensions and conditions. University and College Union (UCU) general secretary Jo Grady said the UK's flagship university sector was built on the ""exploitation of staff"". They had experienced a decade of pension cuts, collapsing pay and insecure contracts, she said. University employers said the prospect of disruption was ""disappointing"". University staff strike over pensions and pay 'We want our lecturers to be there and be happy' University workers vote for eight-day strike 2018: Strike action suspended in pension truce The union is demanding: a Â£2,500 pay increase across all pay points an end to race, gender and disability pay injustice a framework to eliminate zero-hours and other precarious contracts meaningful action to tackle unmanageable workloads withdrawal of pension cuts The ballot represents a ramping up of the long-running dispute between UCU members and university employers, with staff at 152 institutions being balloted. A total of 78 of these are being consulted during the next three weeks over pay and working conditions, with another 68 facing two ballots - over pay and conditions, plus the USS pensions scheme. The dispute over pensions has been rumbling on for nearly a decade, and has been kicked into action again after what the UCU describes as a ""flawed valuation of the USS pension fund"" wiped ""an estimated 35% off the value of a typical pension"". The pay dispute has led to numerous strike days over the past two years, and was only paused during the pandemic. Ms Grady said: ""There is a sense that we are at a breaking point and a sense that this is a sector that needs saving. I don't think I can over-articulate that enough. ""The idea that staff would want to go out on strike again could not be further from the truth."" She accused institutions of spending their increased fee and research income on extravagant building projects, advertising and advice from consultants, rather than the staff who are teaching young people. And she added that ""exploitative contracts"" were the ""dirty secret"" of a higher education sector which requires students to pay Â£9,000-plus fees a year for tuition. The union estimates that there are some 74,000 staff working on such temporary contracts. The UCU says pay for university staff fell by 17.6% relative to inflation between 2009 and 2019. Since then employers made further below-inflation offers, despite university income from tuition fees growing by a third in the last five years, it said. TheUniversity and Colleges Employers Association,externalhas offered guaranteed increases of at least 1.5% to the pay spine. Higher percentage rises were pledged for lower-paid staff, up to a maximum of 3.6%. Chief executive Raj Jethwa said: ""We are disappointed that UCU is encouraging its members to ballot for action which is specifically designed to disrupt teaching and learning for students who have endured so many recent upheavals."" Mr Jethwa continued: ""The final offer from employers was fair and meaningful in the context of the sector's ongoing delicate financial situation. ""We very much hope the trade union members understand the considerable pressures which continue to face their HE [higher education] institutions. The financial impact of Covid-19 continues to affect these HE institutions, alongside declines in other income sources."" He added that most staff understood the ""financial realities facing their institutions"".

out of the church. After the Lord's Prayer and the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, the Rev Anthony Ball thanks those who have helped organise the service at short notice.

He asks them to ""strengthen the fainthearted, support the weak, help the afflicted, honour all people"" and ""love and serve the Lord"". Canon Pat Browne, Roman Catholic duty priest to the House of

passing: for those who are in shock and deep sadness, especially his family,

Browne finishes by saying: ""Let us pray

""Public service in politics is a sacrifice that should be honoured and respected even when differences of opinion run very deep indeed - David showed that,"" he says. ""The light lit by public service, by you all and your colleagues, must never be put out even in the darkest moments,"" he says. He says for Sir David's family this time is ""as dark as it could be"". The Archbishop says Sir David's public service was ""inspired by his strong personal faith"" and says that light ""may flicker but it will not be extinguished"". He says that while we ""mourn and grieve"" we also thank those who serve in politics - ""we need them"". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, begins his address by saying that the ""noble calling of politicians in a democracy is to make all manner of sacrifices - seen and unseen"". He says that is why across the nation we should be thankful to everyone who is present ""who give so much despite the cynicism, abuse and cruelty they so often endure"". He says that often in great tragedies ""we conclude that the best are among the first to suffer"". ""In this great tragedy there is a unanimous conviction amongst all who knew him that Sir David was of the best,"" he adds. The Archbishop speaks of Sir David's wholehearted support of causes ""from the now achieved city status of Southend"" to ""great causes of the future of our nation around Brexit"", and says that all these came with a ""robust spirit and charity of heart"".

GB's Norrie wins Indian Wells titleCameron Norrie wins one of the biggest titles in tennis when he fights back to beat Nikoloz Basilashvili at Indian Wells.,"Cameron Norrie (right) won his second title of the year and the biggest of his career Cameron Norrie became the first Briton to win the Indian Wells title when he fought back from a set and a break down to beat Nikoloz Basilashvili. Norrie, 26, won 3-6 6-4 6-1 against the Georgian to seal one of the biggest titles in tennis. ""I'm so happy, I can't even describe it,"" he said on court. His exploits in California have propelled Norrie to British number one and he is in the running to reach the elite season-ending ATP Finals. Norrie will rise to a career-high 16th in the world, having started the year ranked 74th, after a stunning season where he has reached six finals and won 47 matches. Norrie had led in the first set with an early break but was pegged back as the big-hitting Basilashvili took charge. But the Briton, whose resilience and fitness have been the hallmark of his successful year, broke to love to level and force a deciding set. The left-hander broke early in the third and saved three break points on his serve to take a 3-0 lead as unforced errors began to mount for the Georgian world number 36, who eventually sent a forehand long on championship point to hand Norrie the biggest title of his career. ""I can't really believe it. If you'd have told me I'd have won before the tournament started I wouldn't have believed you, so it's amazing,"" said Norrie, who is the first British player to reach the final at one of the elite Masters 1,000 events since Andy Murray won in Paris in 2016. Who 'threw away' Norrie's shoes before final? Badosa wins Indian Wells on debut Raducanu to train with Konta's ex-coach Norrie's win comes just a month after compatriot Emma Raducanu's stunning US Open victory as British tennis enjoys something of a resurgence. While Raducanu's rise to British number one was sudden and dramatic, Norrie's path to the top has been more understated and built on consistency. Only world number one Novak Djokovic has been in as many finals this year as Norrie, whose versatility has taken him to finals on hard, clay and grass courts. His maiden ATP singles trophy came in July when he won the Los Cabos Open in Mexico and he has now backed that up with one of the most prestigious tour titles outside the four Grand Slams. He has also achieved something that no other Briton has, with Murray, Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski all having reached the Indian Wells final but finishing as runners-up in California. He is 10th in the race to qualify for next month's eight-man ATP Finals in Turin and with eighth-placed Rafael Nadal missing the rest of the season, Norrie is within touching distance of overtaking ninth-placed Hubert Hurkacz and booking a spot. He is scheduled to compete in events in Vienna and Paris next as he seeks to gather enough points to complete what would have been considered an unlikely feat at the start of the season. The very best of Norrie's game was on display at 5-4 in the second set when the Briton produced a delightful drop-shot and lob combination, as well as an inside out forehand volley, to set up a break to love and a total swing in momentum. After breaking early in the third he then had to fend off three break points to go 3-0 up and he then never looked back as Basilashvili came back from a bathroom break to put in a poor service game that left Norrie serving for the match. The Briton needed only one of his two championship points to secure the win as the errors kept coming off Basilashvili's racquet. ""For a stage he went through and hit so many winners. It was tough for me to get some confidence. The rallies were really short and he was just blasting winners,"" said Norrie, ""When I made a couple of big shots in the 5-4 game in the second set it gave me a lot of confidence, and I was able to find my feet again, start moving again, and make the rallies physical like I've been doing all tournament and it worked in my favour."" Norrie, whose only struggle of the day was when he was trying to lift the heavy glass trophy, dedicated his victory to his parents. Born in South Africa, Norrie has a Scottish dad and Welsh mum, and was brought up in New Zealand before playing college tennis in the United States. While many of his peers took the more conventional route from junior tennis to the professional Futures circuit, Norrie chose to combine his sport with studying for a sociology degree, in order to have a more ""normal life"". BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Basilashvili is known for his ferocious power, and Norrie was in danger of being overwhelmed when he dropped serve early in the second set. But the 26-year-old knuckled down, broke to win the set with some attacking brilliance and then drove the Georgian to distraction with some breathtaking defence in the decider. All the more impressive when you learn the shoes he had left on top of his locker disappeared overnight, leaving him to break in a new pair in the biggest match of his life. The greatest triumph of Norrie's career leaves him within 160 points of the man currently in the final qualifying spot for the ATP Finals. It is a lot to ask him to continue in the same vein after switching continents, and with no time for rest, but he is entered in tournaments in Vienna, Paris and Stockholm before the season is out.

Politicians from all parties, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel and Lisa Nandy sat in the rows behind the PM, who sat on the front row alongside Starmer and SNP Westminster leader Sir Ian Blackford. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is among those to address the service After the choir leads the congregation in the hymn Abide With Me, the Lord Speaker, Lord McFall of Alcluith, reads Isaih 12. The choir, St Margaretâs Consort which is conducted by Greg Morris, then sings Psalm 112 before Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, reads from Thessalonians. He reads: ""We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. ""For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have died."" The Rev Anthony Ball opens the service by saying: ""We gather here in prayer
and remembrance, as have parliamentarians for hundreds of years, held in the
steadfast love of God. ""Here, in the Parliamentary Church, we come to mourn the
untimely death of Sir David Amess MP, to pray for Julia,
their family, and all who feel his loss so keenly, to remember the kindness and
commitment of a friend and colleague, and to console each other in our grief. ""Here we acknowledge a shared sense of vulnerability even as we express the
determination to maintain our public service. Here we seek Godâs protection and
the needful gifts of courage and strength for the days ahead."" The service of remembrance for Sir David Amess has begun at St Margaret's Church, beside Westminster Abbey. It is being led by the Rev Anthony Ball, Canon of Westminster and Rector of St Margaret's Church. Susan HulmeParliamentary correspondent The
traffic was stopped, the street was silent for Sir David Amess's friends and
colleagues to make the short walk across the road from Parliament to St
Margaret's Church through the autumn afternoon. But though there
had been sadness and even tears as the Commons and Lords paid tribute to Sir
David - there was a surprising amount of laughter too. Everyone who knew
him seemed to have an anecdote about his irreverent joie de vivre alongside his
kindness and gentleness. Democracy may be about debate and division, but
even MPs who disagreed with him politically were united in this - that
they'd lost a good and decent man. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Labour leader SIr Keir Starmer and House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle are among the parliamentarians who have gathered for a service in memory of Sir David Amess. It is taking place across the road from Parliament at St Margaret's Church in the grounds of Westminster Abbey. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will take part in the service, due to begin at 18:00 BST. After two hours MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the House of Commons. Many shared stories of his humour and kindness as well as the hard work he put in for his constituents. MPs have finished paying tribute to Sir David Amess in the Commons and are now heading over to a church service in memory of him. It is being held at St Margaret's Church, in the grounds of Westminster Abbey, and the Archbishop of Canterbury will give an address. The service is due to start at 18:00 BST. ""Nobody could doubt [Sir] David [Amess's] wish to make the world a better place with his kindness,"" says fellow Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin. Sir Bernard says this quality - kindness - should be known in public life in future as ""the David Amess principle"". Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, says people don't appreciate how much MPs work together, but ""they do and Sir David did"". This ""terrible, abhorrent death"" makes us remember that when we stand up for democracy we are standing up for civility, for good behaviour and for treating people properly, she says, adding: ""Violence must never be allowed to succeed again."" Labour's Stephen Timms - who himself was stabbed during his  constituency surgery in 2010 - says kindness was evident throughout Sir David's career. He recalls working with him on Newham Council in the 1970s and says he managed to win over everyone from across the political spectrum. ""He was accessible to his constituents and we must now reflect on what more we can do to stop that happening again,"" he says. ""I wonder if we might ask the police to review our appointment lists ahead of each surgery for example."" The Green Party has announced it will not put forward a candidate in the by-election set to take place in Southend West following the death of MP Sir David Amess last Friday. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have already said they will not take part. No date has yet been set for the contest. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater - sister of the murdered MP Jo Cox - offers ""love, support and solidarity"" to the family of Sir David Amess. She recalls ""physically trembling"" and feeling ""physical pain"" when she heard in 2016 that her sister had died, adding that there followed a ""rollercoaster of deep trauma that nobody should have to experience"". The House of Commons tributes to Sir David would be a ""morsel of comfort"" at their time of pain, Leadbeater says. She implores fellow MPs to offer his family support over the coming weeks and months, adding that ""they will need it"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper says that ""every one of us"" has a story of something they worked with Sir David on, and that so often ""kindness and compassion"" were at the heart of it. She says that, as her office was above his, often they would walk to the Commons together chatting about their families. She says that hanging on Sir David's office door is cardboard cutout of a knight in armour ""with the helmet tilted in a jaunty way"". ""And that knight in shining armour is what Sir David would have been for so many of his constituents,"" she says. She quotes Jo Cox saying ""we have more in common than that which divides us"" and says Sir David ""showed us how to do this"". Â© 2025 BBC.

GB's Norrie wins Indian Wells titleCameron Norrie wins one of the biggest titles in tennis when he fights back to beat Nikoloz Basilashvili at Indian Wells.BBC Sport,"Cameron Norrie (right) won his second title of the year and the biggest of his career Cameron Norrie became the first Briton to win the Indian Wells title when he fought back from a set and a break down to beat Nikoloz Basilashvili. Norrie, 26, won 3-6 6-4 6-1 against the Georgian to seal one of the biggest titles in tennis. ""I'm so happy, I can't even describe it,"" he said on court. His exploits in California have propelled Norrie to British number one and he is in the running to reach the elite season-ending ATP Finals. Norrie will rise to a career-high 16th in the world, having started the year ranked 74th, after a stunning season where he has reached six finals and won 47 matches. Norrie had led in the first set with an early break but was pegged back as the big-hitting Basilashvili took charge. But the Briton, whose resilience and fitness have been the hallmark of his successful year, broke to love to level and force a deciding set. The left-hander broke early in the third and saved three break points on his serve to take a 3-0 lead as unforced errors began to mount for the Georgian world number 36, who eventually sent a forehand long on championship point to hand Norrie the biggest title of his career. ""I can't really believe it. If you'd have told me I'd have won before the tournament started I wouldn't have believed you, so it's amazing,"" said Norrie, who is the first British player to reach the final at one of the elite Masters 1,000 events since Andy Murray won in Paris in 2016. Who 'threw away' Norrie's shoes before final? Badosa wins Indian Wells on debut Raducanu to train with Konta's ex-coach Norrie's win comes just a month after compatriot Emma Raducanu's stunning US Open victory as British tennis enjoys something of a resurgence. While Raducanu's rise to British number one was sudden and dramatic, Norrie's path to the top has been more understated and built on consistency. Only world number one Novak Djokovic has been in as many finals this year as Norrie, whose versatility has taken him to finals on hard, clay and grass courts. His maiden ATP singles trophy came in July when he won the Los Cabos Open in Mexico and he has now backed that up with one of the most prestigious tour titles outside the four Grand Slams. He has also achieved something that no other Briton has, with Murray, Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski all having reached the Indian Wells final but finishing as runners-up in California. He is 10th in the race to qualify for next month's eight-man ATP Finals in Turin and with eighth-placed Rafael Nadal missing the rest of the season, Norrie is within touching distance of overtaking ninth-placed Hubert Hurkacz and booking a spot. He is scheduled to compete in events in Vienna and Paris next as he seeks to gather enough points to complete what would have been considered an unlikely feat at the start of the season. The very best of Norrie's game was on display at 5-4 in the second set when the Briton produced a delightful drop-shot and lob combination, as well as an inside out forehand volley, to set up a break to love and a total swing in momentum. After breaking early in the third he then had to fend off three break points to go 3-0 up and he then never looked back as Basilashvili came back from a bathroom break to put in a poor service game that left Norrie serving for the match. The Briton needed only one of his two championship points to secure the win as the errors kept coming off Basilashvili's racquet. ""For a stage he went through and hit so many winners. It was tough for me to get some confidence. The rallies were really short and he was just blasting winners,"" said Norrie, ""When I made a couple of big shots in the 5-4 game in the second set it gave me a lot of confidence, and I was able to find my feet again, start moving again, and make the rallies physical like I've been doing all tournament and it worked in my favour."" Norrie, whose only struggle of the day was when he was trying to lift the heavy glass trophy, dedicated his victory to his parents. Born in South Africa, Norrie has a Scottish dad and Welsh mum, and was brought up in New Zealand before playing college tennis in the United States. While many of his peers took the more conventional route from junior tennis to the professional Futures circuit, Norrie chose to combine his sport with studying for a sociology degree, in order to have a more ""normal life"". BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Basilashvili is known for his ferocious power, and Norrie was in danger of being overwhelmed when he dropped serve early in the second set. But the 26-year-old knuckled down, broke to win the set with some attacking brilliance and then drove the Georgian to distraction with some breathtaking defence in the decider. All the more impressive when you learn the shoes he had left on top of his locker disappeared overnight, leaving him to break in a new pair in the biggest match of his life. The greatest triumph of Norrie's career leaves him within 160 points of the man currently in the final qualifying spot for the ATP Finals. It is a lot to ask him to continue in the same vein after switching continents, and with no time for rest, but he is entered in tournaments in Vienna, Paris and Stockholm before the season is out.

Spanish PM vows to outlaw prostitution,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez was addressing his party conference in Valencia. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez pledged on Sunday to criminalise prostitution in the country. Speaking to supporters at the end of his Socialist Party's three-day congress in Valencia, Mr SÃ¡nchez said that the practice ""enslaves"" women. Prostitution was decriminalised in Spain in 1995 and in 2016 the UN estimated the country's sex industry was worth â¬3.7bn (Â£3.1bn, $4.2bn). A 2009 survey found that up to one in three Spanish men had paid for sex. However, another report published in 2009 suggested that the figure may be as high as 39% and a 2011 UN study cited Spain as the third biggest centre for prostitution in the world, behind Thailand and Puerto Rico. Prostitution is currently unregulated in Spain, and there is no punishment for those who offer paid sexual services of their own will, as long as it does not take place in public spaces. However, pimping or acting as a proxy between a sex worker and a potential client is illegal. The industry has boomed since its decriminalisation and it is commonly estimated that around 300,000 women work as prostitutes in Spain. The Spanish police freed 896 women being exploited as sex workers in 2019 and estimate that over 80% of those working as prostitutes are victims of mafias. ""Prostitution is not an expression of women's sexual freedom,"" said APRAMP, an association which campaigns to prevent and eradicate sexual exploitation. ""It is almost always linked to violence, marginalisation, economic difficulties and a sexist, patriarchal culture."" This Socialist Party (PSOE) proposal comes at a time when issues such as gender violence and sexual consent have been taking centre stage in Spanish public debate. However, CATS, a charity which provides support to sex workers in southeastern Spain, warned that policies aimed at abolition are unlikely to work, instead sending the sex industry further underground. ""If you throw people engaged in prostitution out of the establishments and flats where they work, then they're going to end up on the street,"" said Nacho Pardo of CATS. ""And that is sad, it's dangerous and it makes them vulnerable to mafias."" CÃ©sar Jara, a Spanish journalist who has researched the sex industry, told Efe news agency that ""95% of prostitution in Spain is not free, it's forced in one way or another, whether because of socio-economic conditions, threats or other pressures"". Sex trafficking generates â¬7-8m daily in Spain, he says, describing the country as Europe's second-biggest prostitution market in Europe after Germany, and as ""a paradise for international mafias"". ""The worst thing is that some young people see it as normal to pay so that a woman gives them pleasure however they want."" In 2019, Mr SÃ¡nchez's PSOE published a pledge in its election manifesto to outlaw prostitution, in what was seen as a move to attract more female voters. The manifesto called prostitution ""one of the cruellest aspects of the feminisation of poverty and one of the worst forms of violence against women"". However two years on from the election, no legislation has yet been tabled. Spanish media report that the PSOE would need to agree on a draft with their left-wing Podemos coalition partners before presenting a bill to parliament, so there is still a long way to go. PSOE equality secretary Carmen Calvo, quoted by Efe, said ""we've passed other laws which were much more difficult, so we'll get this one done"", though she warned of ""ridiculous traps"" frequently placed in the path of feminists. Supporters of Spain's current system say that it has brought huge benefits to the women working in the trade and made life safer for them. However in recent years significant concerns have grown around the potential for women to be trafficked into sex work.
