Abramovich 'eligible to become Israeli',"Mr Abramovich will be the richest person in Israel The Russian-Jewish billionaire owner of Chelsea football club, Roman Abramovich, has flown to Tel Aviv after being found eligible for Israeli citizenship. Immigration officials told the BBC that he was interviewed last week at the Israeli embassy in Moscow. He has faced delays in renewing his UK visa. His spokesman would not comment on reports citizenship had been granted. Mr Abramovich, 51, would be the richest person in Israel. His UK investor visa reportedly expired some weeks ago but the British government has refused to comment on his individual case. The delay in issuing him a new one comes amid increased diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in southern England. Abramovich faces UK visa 'delay' Reality Check: What's an investor visa? Mr Abramovich did not attend the FA cup final at Wembley earlier this month when Chelsea beat Manchester United. Israeli media reports say he has been given an identity card in Israel under the Law of Return, which allows Jews to become citizens of Israel. The Times of Israel said the interior ministry had confirmed Mr Abramovich arrived in Israel on Monday and that he had emigrated to the country. He is a frequent visitor to Israel and bought a hotel in Tel Aviv in 2015 that reports say he has turned into a residence. Israel passport holders are allowed to enter Britain without a visa for short stays. Mr Abramovich is worth $11.5bn (Â£8.6bn), according to Forbes magazine. The move could pay off financially as new Israeli citizens are exempt from paying tax on foreign income for 10 years. Mr Abramovich (right) has often been spotted at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground One of Russia's richest people, he bought Chelsea FC in 2003 He reportedly sold dolls before making his fortune in oil in the 1990s after the collapse of the former Soviet Union Mr Abramovich was a one-time business partner of the late tycoon Boris Berezovky, an associate of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin Critics say the two businessmen used their Kremlin ""family"" ties to acquire key state companies for below market value Mr Abramovich served as governor of Russia's Chukotka region He is believed to be close to current Russian President Vladimir Putin Abramovich faces UK visa 'delay' Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Police probed as woman punched in arrest,"This video can not be played Wildwood Police is conducting an investigation following the widely shared video Police in the US state of New Jersey have opened an inquiry after a video emerged showing an officer punching a woman in the head during an arrest. The footage, posted on social media on Saturday, shows three officers from the Wildwood Police Department attempting to detain Emily Weinman, 20. Ms Weinman was later charged with illegal possession of alcohol on the beach and for resisting arrest. Two of the officers have been placed on administrative duty, officials said. The incident, which occurred on a beach on Memorial Day weekend in the US, shows Ms Weinman being wrestled to the ground in a swimsuit and shorts. With one officer on top of her, she kicks out at another, who then holds her legs down by gripping her ankles. One officer is then seen punching her in the head with his fist before placing her in a headlock and pinning her to the ground. Watch: NBA star stun-gunned in police video US officer's bodycam records him clinging to speeding car Eyewitnesses can be heard in the recorded footage urging Ms Weinman, who is from Philadelphia, to stop resisting the police officers. The video was captured by Alexis Hewitt, 19, of Williamstown, New Jersey. She said she was with friends when she was startled awake by the commotion. ""When she fell that's basically when it caught my eye because everyone was yelling and I woke up, and I got my camera out right when she went down,"" Ms Hewitt told ABC News. Ms Weinman was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after she was found in possession of alcohol on the beach, police said. She was also charged with resisting arrest and aggravated assault on a police officer ""by spitting bodily fluids"". The Wildwood Police Department said it had opened an internal investigation over the actions of its officers after it was made aware of the reports. Allow Facebook content?

Italy president names stop-gap PM,"Carlo Cottarelli met President Mattarella on Monday morning Italian President Sergio Mattarella has asked an ex-IMF economist to form a government as the country faces fresh political turmoil. Carlo Cottarelli became known as ""Mr Scissors"" for his cuts to public spending in Italy. His appointment came after efforts by Italy's two populist parties to form a coalition government collapsed. But the move is a temporary measure and the PM-in-waiting says he will hold new elections by early next year. The prospect of elections as early as September hit European financial markets on Monday with analysts suggesting the move might simply delay a future populist government that wants to renegotiate key eurozone debt agreements. Should Europe be scared? What is Italy's political crisis all about? Italy, the EU's fourth-biggest economy, has been without a government since elections in March because no political group can form a majority. Two of the big winners from the vote - Five Star and the League - attempted to join forces but abandoned efforts after the president vetoed their choice of finance minister. Mr Mattarella said he could not appoint the Eurosceptic Paolo Savona to the post, citing concern from investors at home and abroad. The rare move by the president sparked fury from both parties, who say they will reject Mr Cottarelli's nomination in parliament. After the president blocked Mr Savona's appointment, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio called on parliament to impeach the president. ""Why don't we just say that in this country it's pointless that we vote, as the ratings agencies, financial lobbies decide the governments?"" he asked in a video on Facebook. Mr Di Maio later called for peaceful protests and urged his supporters to unite and ""make some noise"". ""It is important that we do so all together,"" he said. Italy populists: What you should know Italy's economy in charts He said walks and rallies would be organised in Italian cities, including an event in Rome on 2 June - a national holiday celebrating when the country became a republic in 1946. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio (L) and Lega leader Matteo Salvini Meanwhile the League's chief Matteo Salvini also criticised the president's decision, calling for mass protests and accusing Brussels and Germany of meddling. Although the president's role is largely ceremonial, he enjoys powers such as appointing heads of government and the ability to dissolve parliament that have proven key with Italy seeing frequent political instability and numerous changes of government. After meeting the president, Mr Cottarelli said he would present a programme to parliament, including a budget, to take Italy into new elections ""at the beginning of 2019"". If he was unable to pass a programme, which appears likely at this stage, ""the government would resign immediately... until elections are held after the month of August"", he added. The BBC's James Reynolds in Rome says early elections are exactly what the two populist parties want, giving them a chance to rally support behind their claim that the Italian and the wider European establishments are getting in the way of the will of the people. A source from Five Star told Reuters the party could campaign with the League in a fresh vote. What is Italy's crisis all about?

Solo Star Wars film debut underwhelming,"Solo sees its title character (Ehrenreich, centre, blue shirt) meet Chewbacca for the first time Solo: A Star Wars Story, the latest prequel in the huge film franchise, has failed to make the impact Disney had hoped in North America. Analysts had predicted Ron Howard's film about a young Han Solo would take between $130m (Â£97.6m) and $150m (Â£112.7m) on its debut weekend. But it had to settle for $103m (Â£77.4m), which was still enough to knock Deadpool 2 off the top spot. Solo, starring Alden Ehrenreich, took an estimated $168m (Â£126.2m) overseas. Has Star Wars reached peak prequel? Boba Fett set for next spin-off movie Solo brings Star Wars back to Cannes TheHollywood Reporter's Pamela McClintock,externaldescribed this figure as ""grim"". Felicity Jones starred in last year's Rogue One However, the film wasgenerally praised by critics when reviews first came out. The Hollywood Reporter reckons that most box-office analysts blame Solo's underwhelming performance on the fact that it debuted just five months after Star Wars: The Last Jedi was released,suggesting audience fatigue.,external ""There's a question of frequency, and how many times people will go to the movies. Is this too much and too soon for a third time in a five-week period?"" Disney distribution chief Dave Hollis told the film news website. ""Let's measure how we feel about this until more time passes,"" he added. The Han Solo origin film fared less well than its fellow standalone, 2016's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which opened to $155m in the US and Canada. In fact, it had the lowest opening for a Star Wars film since Disney took over the franchise, starting with 2015's The Force Awakens - the first of a trilogy - which took $248m over its first three days.

The bodies of Laura Mortimer, 31, and her daughter Ella Dalby were found when police were called to Dexter Way, Gloucester, at about 04:50 BST. Officers were called to reports of two people with serious injuries but the pair were declared dead at the scene. A 28-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, Gloucestershire Police said. Police cordons are in place at locations linked to the investigation, a spokesman for the force said Dexter Way is a quiet residential street close to the centre of Gloucester sited between the River Severn and a large retail park. Resident Ruth Kedward said she was ""dumb-struck"" when she found out about the deaths. ""I couldn't believe it,"" she said. It is understood the Ms Mortimer ran her own business, Sweet Beginnings, offering bespoke bridal gowns and wedding planning services. A wedding photographer based in Gloucestershire, who asked not to be named, said: ""Laura was a lovely lady with a kind word for everyone. ""An inspiration to many people not only personally but in the wedding industry too. ""She worked so hard to get where she did and was extremely well respected throughout Gloucestershire and beyond."" Forensics officers were at the scene Tributes have been paid on Facebook, with one person writing: ""Been in so much shock all day and still have no words, I'm absolutely heart broken and keep thinking someone is going to say they got it wrong."" Another said: ""Laura and I were good friends and I'm in extreme shock. ""I tell you what I cannot, cannot, cannot believe this. Gutted does not even come close and that beautiful daughter Ella she was Laura's rock..."" Another friend posted: ""Fly high you two beautiful angels thoughts are with your family and friends at this awful time.""

YouTube stars' fury over algorithm tests,"Some of YouTube's most popular stars have criticised the website for ""experimenting"" with how their videos are delivered to their fans. Unannounced, YouTube started testing an algorithm that changed the order videos appeared in users' subscription feeds. The experiment came to light when some users complained on social media. One YouTube star said it was the worst decision the website had made for years. But YouTube defended its experiment. Manipulating the subscription feed using algorithms could make it more difficult for smaller channels to get their content seen. Originally, the YouTube subscription feed was a chronological list of videos from all the channels that a person had chosen to ""subscribe"" to.  The system let people curate a personalised feed full of content from their favourite video-makers. However, many video-makers have previously complained that some of their videos have not appeared in the subscription feed, and have questioned whether YouTube manipulates the list to boost viewer retention and advertising revenue. YouTube deletes half of 'violent' music videos YouTube stars 'might encourage kids to eat more calories' YouTube unveils new music streaming service YouTube's latest experiment - which it said appeared for a ""small number"" of users - changed the order of videos in the feed.  Instead of showing the most recent videos at the top, YouTube said the manipulated feed showed people ""the videos they want to watch"". ""When I click subscribe on a Youtube channel, that's me saying: 'More of this, please,'"" explained video-maker Gary C. ""I don't expect to be force fed things YouTube 'thinks' I should see. I have nearly 47,000 people who said 'yes', yet I'm regularly asked if I still post videos."" Technology vlogger Marques Brownlee - who has more than six million subscribers - said prioritising videos ""they think we want to see"" was a ""business move"". But he added: ""It's a subscription box. Users chose to subscribe. They want to see it all. If they don't, they'll unsubscribe."" Marques Brownlee has more than six million subscribers ""People use the subscription tab to mainly avoid this sort of algorithmic behaviour on the platform,"" said games reviewer Sean McLoughlin, who produces videos as Jacksepticeye. ""Please keep that to the home page and recommendations."" Lifestyle vlogger Alfie Deyes, who has more than five million subscribers on the platform, said it was ""the worst decision YouTube has made in the past nine years I've been making videos"". YouTube said the experiment only appeared for a ""small number"" of people. It stressed the ""personalised"" feed was optional and that it was not planning to remove the chronological feed. However, YouTube told the BBC that people with the ""personalised"" feed were watching videos for longer. YouTube has shifted its focus away from the number of ""views"" that a video attracts to overall ""watch time"". Video-makers are now encouraged to produce longer videos that keep viewers on the platform for longer. The change explains why previously short videos, such as DIY demonstrations or ""how-to"" tutorials, are now often dragged out over 10 minutes or more. YouTuber Grace Helbig begged the site: ""Please don't do this"" ""We're testing a setting that allows users to sort the subscriptions feed based on the content a user usually engages with the most,"" the company said in a statement. ""This is one of many small experiments we run all the time on YouTube."" One video editor suggested YouTube needed to improve its communication about algorithm experiments. ""Just tell us or email before you roll out an 'experiment',"" said Seth Brown. ""It's not that hard guys.""

Sturgeon takes Brexit concerns to Brussels,"Nicola Sturgeon met Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier at the EU Commission headquarters Nicola Sturgeon has raised Scottish concerns over Brexit in a meeting with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier. The first minister said they held a ""constructive and positive discussion"" during her trip to Brussels. She said she told Mr Barnier that the Scottish government believed the UK should remain within the customs union and single market after leaving the EU. And she emphasised her ""strong view"" that ""time is running out for the UK"" to strike a deal over Brexit. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland: ""The clock is ticking and the longer it takes for the UK to reach a sensible position, the greater the risk of a no deal outcome to this which is in absolutely nobody's interest."" The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019 and negotiators have said they want a deal in place by the end of the year. What is left to agree in the Brexit Treaty? Brexit: All you need to know The first minister accused the UK government of ""floundering around"" in its bid to secure a deal. She added: ""With every week that passes without the UK being clear and focused and realistic about what it wants to achieve, that prospect of a damaging no deal seems to me to get greater and that's in nobody's interest. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says remaining in the customs union and single market would help progress talks with the EU over Brexit ""I don't think there's support for it in the UK and there's certainly no preparedness for it in the UK so sooner or later reality is going to bite for the UK government and my view is that we should try to make that sooner rather than later. The meeting came afterMr Barnier expressed frustration at the state of the negotiations, claiming that the UK was playing ""hide-and-seek"" by refusing to spell out exactly what it wants. In a strongly-worded speech in Lisbon last week, Mr Barnier stressed that ""time is and will remain tight"", and called for progress to ""speed up"" if details of the future relationship are to be agreed before the Brexit date. The Scottish and UK governments have been in dispute over what should happen to powers currently held by Brussels after MSPs refused to give their consent to the EU Withdrawal Bill. Ms Sturgeon held the meeting while in Brussels for the official opening of the expanded Scotland House, a hub for Scottish businesses in Europe. The Scottish Conservatives' constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said of the first minister's visit: ""Rather than working with the UK government to do a deal on Brexit, she's chosen to take a pointless trip to Brussels. ""It's becoming ever more obvious that Nicola Sturgeon wants to create a political crisis to justify her continued push for independence."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""I hope that Nicola Sturgeon uses her visit to Brussels to reflect on the damage caused by breaking up political unions."" Neil Findlay, Scottish Labour's Brexit spokesman, said: ""Brexit simply shows how difficult it is to leave a political union - even one less integrated than the UK.""

Britain's 'most scenic' bus route revealed,"This video can not be played The 840 Leeds to Whitby service takes in historic York before crossing the North York Moors National Park A double-decker serving the North York Moors has been crowned the ""most scenic"" bus route in Britain. The 840 Coastliner runs from Leeds to the coastal town of Whitby. But it's the leg that crosses the moorland, from Pickering via Goathland and Sleights, that has earned the service the prize. At the wheel, driver Adam Davis knows why: ""You can get some misty days when you come out on top but on a clear day the colours up here are forever changing. ""People do come from all over the world to ride this route. Every day is a joy."" The award was devised by campaigner and bus enthusiast Paul Kirby and has been run by Bus Users UK. ""I've been travelling up and down the country by bus for many years and on fantastic routes like this one the scenery is just spectacular,"" he says. Paul Kirby (right) presents the award to Transdev's Colin Booth ""Rural communities do need bus services and they are a lifeline for many people. So I felt they deserved a little publicity to attract new passengers."" Mr Kirby did not just want to encourage people out of their cars but also to cherish services when funding has been squeezed. Britain's most scenic bus route? The 840 runs four times a day, is completely commercial and run by Transdev. But it relies on subsidies in winter time and reimbursement by the local authority for the many users with a bus pass. Les and Janet use it to get to their caravan in Thornton-le-Dale: ""We've been using it for a long time, all on our bus pass. If we did not have the bus we would not get out because fuel is so dear."" Kate has epilepsy so cannot drive: ""It's important for me to get to places I've been visiting all my life - I would not be able to get to the outdoors, which I love very much."" The bus route passes through Goathland village, where the ITV series Heartbeat was filmed One pensioner always makes it up to the top deck so she can enjoy the best views from the front seat. Another even said her dog refuses to hop on any other bus. But as loved as it is, services like this one are under threat. Last year more than 500 routes in England and Wales were reduced or completely withdrawn and now fewer than half of people living in villages have access to a bus service, according to the Campaign for Better Transport. About Â£30m was cut from local authority subsidies in 2016-17 - with shire councils in rural England the hardest hit. The campaign group says those cuts have continued this year too. ""Tragically once these routes are lost they are usually lost forever, leaving whole communities looking like 'transport deserts',"" says Steve Chambers, the group's public transport campaigner. ""We hear frequently from older people who are struggling to access shops and doctors' surgeries and young people cut off from colleges and jobs. Buses are a lifeline and must be preserved."" The Department for Transport says it provides Â£250m a year for bus services, which supports free off-peak bus travel for 10m older people and the disabled. ""Long-term social and economic factors are affecting levels of bus usage but it is for local authorities to decide which bus operations to support in their areas,"" it says. 840 Coastliner: Leeds to York/Pickering/Whitby via North York Moors - Transdev Blazefield 914/915/916:  Glasgow/Fort William/Skye via Loch Lomond, Rannoch, Glencoe and Great Glen - Scottish Citylink 50: Bournemouth to Swanage via Sandbanks, Shell Bay and Studland -  Morebus (Go Ahead) Source:Bus Users UK,external In another part of North Yorkshire, volunteers have stepped in to provide services between villages and across the National Park, where some local people feel abandoned. ""We rattled a cap until we found enough money to keep a service running,"" says Eden Blyth, from Moors Bus, which  runs a handful of services over weekends. The 840 may be a popular rural route, but the service relies on subsidies during the winter ""We take people where they want and they have to come first. I think they'll always be needed and we are happy to do it."" His team are now hoping to tap into the hiking community to boost passenger numbers and keep the wheels turning.

Solo Star Wars film underperforms,"Solo sees its title character (Ehrenreich, centre, blue shirt) meet Chewbacca for the first time Solo: A Star Wars Story, the latest prequel in the huge film franchise, has failed to make the impact Disney had hoped in North America. Analysts had predicted Ron Howard's film about a young Han Solo would take between $130m (Â£97.6m) and $150m (Â£112.7m) on its debut weekend. But it had to settle for $103m (Â£77.4m), which was still enough to knock Deadpool 2 off the top spot. Solo, starring Alden Ehrenreich, took an estimated $168m (Â£126.2m) overseas. Has Star Wars reached peak prequel? Boba Fett set for next spin-off movie Solo brings Star Wars back to Cannes TheHollywood Reporter's Pamela McClintock,externaldescribed this figure as ""grim"". Felicity Jones starred in last year's Rogue One However, the film wasgenerally praised by critics when reviews first came out. The Hollywood Reporter reckons that most box-office analysts blame Solo's underwhelming performance on the fact that it debuted just five months after Star Wars: The Last Jedi was released,suggesting audience fatigue.,external ""There's a question of frequency, and how many times people will go to the movies. Is this too much and too soon for a third time in a five-week period?"" Disney distribution chief Dave Hollis told the film news website. ""Let's measure how we feel about this until more time passes,"" he added. The Han Solo origin film fared less well than its fellow standalone, 2016's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which opened to $155m in the US and Canada. In fact, it had the lowest opening for a Star Wars film since Disney took over the franchise, starting with 2015's The Force Awakens - the first of a trilogy - which took $248m over its first three days.

Coventry promoted with League Two play-off final victory,"Coventry scored three second-half goals to clinch an immediate return to League One Jordan Willis scored from 20 yards and Jordan Shipley added deflected second for Coventry Full-back Jack Grimmer curled in a third from edge of box Kyle Edwards fired in superb late consolation for Exeter Jay Freeman FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Four absolute pearlers of goals, a huge attendance for a fourth-tier play-off final and blistering heat. It's been quite an afternoon, and it ends with Coventry City are on their way back to League One. Commiserations for Exeter - who fought valiantly in the first half - but for the second year in a row they've come up just short at Wembley. For Coventry, however, it's party time and a much-needed boost for a club that's endured a tough few years or so. And so that ends the 2017-18 English Football League season. The World Cup starts in a few weeks, thank heavens for that. Don't think I can be away from football for too much longer. We'll be back with more live text coverage of the EFL in August. Thanks for joining us this season. FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Dave BennettFormer FA Cup winner with Coventry City on BBC Coventry and Warwickshire We knew if Marc McNulty got the ball down and ran at Coventry, he could cause problems for them - and he did. He's a worthy man of the match. He's been instrumental in the goals today. The city centre will be buzzing tonight and these players deserve it. They came out and took the game to Exeter, destroying them. You could sense in the atmosphere at half-time: if Coventry came out and scored early on, it would pull the seats forward. And that's what happened. It will be a party atmosphere for the next few weeks now. FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Pat BaldwinFormer Exeter City defender on BBC Devon 1-0 down, on an occasion like this, is always going to be tough. 2-0 makes it even worse. Going into this game, I felt Exeter came in on better form than they did last year, after a semi-final that took less out of them. I'm slightly disappointed now at how some players have performed and how they've set up. FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Philip:I am so pleased to see Coventry on the up after what they have been through over the years. Good luck to you and your great fans! Andy:If those goals had been scored by Ronaldo or Messi... FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Rob GurneyBBC Sport at Wembley Exeter were simply blown away by Coventryâs fast start to the
second half. When your centre-half curls one in from 20 yards and your right-back scores with his left peg, you know itâs your day. The celebrations will go on long into the night. After all, a first promotion in 51 years is certainly one for Coventry fans to savour into the summer. FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Coventry City defender Jack Grimmer told Sky Sports: ""You can't ask the fans to come out in numbers more than that. To give us this experience and push us on, it's something I'll remember forever. ""I went in and saw Sparky [Marc McNulty] laid it off to me and I thought if I take a touch and shape it towards the back stick. ""Luckily I found the top corner!"" FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Coventry City defender Jordan Willis told Sky Sports: ""It means everything, especially with the season we had last year. To come back first time, I'm buzzing. ""I've not scored many and they all came last season but this one is definitely up there,. ""We won the Checkatrade Trophy last year which was positive and now this is massive. Hopefully we can give the fans something to cheer for."" FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Coventry City boss Mark Robins told Sky Sports: ""This was really important for the club from where it's been. ""We've played at a level no one expected us to and the pressure that comes with that is immense. The players have been magnificent. ""You could see in the second half people's legs going [due to the heat] and we were lucky we didn't lose anyone to injury. ""This is for the supporters, they've been magnificent for the club and it's for them."" FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Clive EakinBBC Coventry & Warwickshire Sport The Sky Blues players look exhausted but delighted as Mark Robins hugs his backroom staff. Tom Bayliss is clenching both fists and can barely believe it as he hugs Michael Doyle. The Exeter players look distraught - two successive play-off final defeats for them. FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Pat BaldwinFormer Exeter City defender on BBC Devon You cannot come to a game of this magnitude and not show up. I think even one individual being off-key can affect you in a game like this - and I think there were too many players not at their maximum today. FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter It's all over at Wembley and Coventry are promoted to the third tier! Coventry 3-1 Exeter Jayden Stockley nods low towards goal but Coventry keeper Lee Burge dives in to scoop his effort. Moments later, Stockley tries again and chests down a long cross before firing inches wide of the post. Coventry 3-1 Exeter Clive EakinBBC Coventry & Warwickshire Sport Sky Blues fans are quiet for the first time in a while. They're not there yet... Coventry 3-1 Exeter Pat BaldwinFormer Exeter City defender on BBC Devon There are some quality players on this pitch and that was the fourth of four amazing goals we've seen today. This has been a great advert for League Two football. It's too little, too late for Exeter, though. Kyle Edwards Cor blimey! This game's not had a bad goal scored. Kyle Edwardsscores what is surely a consolation for Exeter City with a stunning curled effort that beats Coventry keeper Lee Burge. Just after the goal goes in, we're told there is to be five minutes of added time at Wembley. Could be a nervous ending if Exeter can find another goal. Coventry 3-0 Exeter Jonson Clarke-Harris skips and mazes his way through the Exeter City half and decides to fire from long range but it sails well out of play. Why not eh? Might as well when your team's 3-0 up. Coventry 3-0 Exeter James LawBBC Sport at Wembley Wondering why you might recognise the names Jordan Willis and Jack Grimmer? Well both defenders also scored in their shock FA Cup third round win over Premier League Stoke in January. The Sky Blues pair seem to love the big occasion. Coventry 3-0 Exeter Matt Jay has almost bagged a consolation for Exeter - and in style! But Lee Burge dives to deny his long-range effort. Meanwhile, Marc McNulty comes off for Coventry and is replaced by Jordan Ponticelli. Just the 28 goals for the Sky Blues this season, but McNulty's not added to that tally today. Still, a fine performance from the Coventry striker this afternoon. Coventry 3-0 Exeter Pat BaldwinFormer Exeter City defender on BBC Devon It's about pride now, for me - Exeter have to come out now and fight to make sure it's not four or five. They need to use all of their experience. At the moment, whatever Exeter have tried has not worked. 3-0 down means it's a roll of the dice to see what works. Kyle Edwards is a direct player and he might produce something. Coventry 3-0 Exeter Cheers of OLE ring around Wembley from the Coventry fans every time they complete a pass. Tom Bayliss has had enough of this showboating, though. He wants a fourth Sky Blues goal and he almost gets himself on the scoresheet with a lovely solo effort in the box before curling towards the corner, forcing Christy Pym into a fine save.

NI women 'in limbo' over abortion lawHigh-profile campaigner Sarah Ewart urges the government to help liberalise NI abortion laws.3h3 hours agoNorthern Ireland,"This video can not be played 'Women need help and support' Theresa May has been urged to help liberalise Northern Ireland's abortion law by a woman whose experience brought the issue back before the courts. Sarah Ewart went to England in 2013 for a termination after doctors said her unborn child would not survive outside of the womb. Such a diagnosis, known as fatal foetal abnormality, is not grounds for a legal abortion in Northern Ireland. Following Ireland's historic vote, she said NI women were in ""limbo"". Landslide vote overturns Irish abortion ban What next for Northern Ireland? Foster says abortion vote no impact on NI Report recommends NI abortion law change The Irish Republicoverwhelmingly voted to overturn the country's abortion banin a landmark referendum on Friday. Attention has now shifted to Northern Ireland and the prime minister is facing a growing number of calls to bring the laws in line with the rest of the UK. Ms Ewart has been involved in a high-profile campaign to legalise abortion in Northern Ireland in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Sarah Ewart has been involved in a high-profile campaign to legalise abortion in NI in cases of fatal foetal abnormality She said that in the absence of a devolved government in Northern Ireland, the prime minister and MPs should step in to help change the law. ""If we had an assembly here, we would be literally at their doors begging, but we don't so we are really hoping that we can have help from Westminster and Theresa May to give us the access we need here in Northern Ireland,"" Ms Ewart told BBC News NI. ""It's a relief that women like me are going to be able to travel down to Dublin to access this procedure, but really we are wanting the help here to have it within our own hospitals in Northern Ireland"". This video can not be played After Ireland's abortion referendum, BBC News NI gauges opinion north of the border She described her experience five years ago as ""devastating"". ""We had no information at the time, the consultants and midwives here wanted to help but they couldn't give us any information,"" she said. ""Literally, yellow pages was what we went through and family planning popped up and that's where we went to make the appointment."" She said she would have preferred to have had the procedure in Northern Ireland, where doctors knew her history and all her family were around. A Supreme Court judgment considering whether abortion law in Northern Ireland is incompatible with international human rightsis expected later this year. Unlike the rest of the UK, abortion is only permitted if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health. The leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster, has said that the result of Ireland's abortion referendumhas no impact on the law in Northern Ireland. Nearly two in three Irish voters opted to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Irish constitution, which effectively banned abortion. Speaking on Sunday, Mrs Foster said: ""The legislation governing abortion is a devolved matter and it is for the Northern Ireland Assembly to debate and decide such issues."" Downing Street is understood to believe that any reform""is an issue for Northern Ireland"". But a Downing Street source said it showed ""one of the important reasons we need a functioning executive back up and running"". Northern Ireland has been without a government since January 2017, after a power-sharing deal between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which an abortion can be performed legally. A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth. However, anti-abortion campaigners argue that doctors cannot accurately predict death, saying that terminally-ill babies ""can and do defy the odds"". There is no restriction on travelling outside Northern Ireland to seek a legal termination in another jurisdiction. Last year, the Westminster government introduced measures to help women from Northern Ireland access free NHS abortions in England. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Foster says abortion vote no impact on NI Abortion law by end of year - Irish PM What next for abortion in NI?

FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Dave BennettFormer FA Cup winner with Coventry City on BBC Coventry and Warwickshire We knew if Marc McNulty got the ball down and ran at Coventry, he could cause problems for them - and he did. He's a worthy man of the match. He's been instrumental in the goals today. The city centre will be buzzing tonight and these players deserve it. They came out and took the game to Exeter, destroying them. You could sense in the atmosphere at half-time: if Coventry came out and scored early on, it would pull the seats forward. And that's what happened. It will be a party atmosphere for the next few weeks now. FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Pat BaldwinFormer Exeter City defender on BBC Devon 1-0 down, on an occasion like this, is always going to be tough. 2-0 makes it even worse. Going into this game, I felt Exeter came in on better form than they did last year, after a semi-final that took less out of them. I'm slightly disappointed now at how some players have performed and how they've set up. FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Philip:I am so pleased to see Coventry on the up after what they have been through over the years. Good luck to you and your great fans! Andy:If those goals had been scored by Ronaldo or Messi... FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Rob GurneyBBC Sport at Wembley Exeter were simply blown away by Coventryâs fast start to the
second half. When your centre-half curls one in from 20 yards and your right-back scores with his left peg, you know itâs your day. The celebrations will go on long into the night. After all, a first promotion in 51 years is certainly one for Coventry fans to savour into the summer. FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Coventry City defender Jack Grimmer told Sky Sports: ""You can't ask the fans to come out in numbers more than that. To give us this experience and push us on, it's something I'll remember forever. ""I went in and saw Sparky [Marc McNulty] laid it off to me and I thought if I take a touch and shape it towards the back stick. ""Luckily I found the top corner!"" FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Coventry City defender Jordan Willis told Sky Sports: ""It means everything, especially with the season we had last year. To come back first time, I'm buzzing. ""I've not scored many and they all came last season but this one is definitely up there,. ""We won the Checkatrade Trophy last year which was positive and now this is massive. Hopefully we can give the fans something to cheer for."" FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Coventry City boss Mark Robins told Sky Sports: ""This was really important for the club from where it's been. ""We've played at a level no one expected us to and the pressure that comes with that is immense. The players have been magnificent. ""You could see in the second half people's legs going [due to the heat] and we were lucky we didn't lose anyone to injury. ""This is for the supporters, they've been magnificent for the club and it's for them."" FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Clive EakinBBC Coventry & Warwickshire Sport The Sky Blues players look exhausted but delighted as Mark Robins hugs his backroom staff. Tom Bayliss is clenching both fists and can barely believe it as he hugs Michael Doyle. The Exeter players look distraught - two successive play-off final defeats for them. FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter Pat BaldwinFormer Exeter City defender on BBC Devon You cannot come to a game of this magnitude and not show up. I think even one individual being off-key can affect you in a game like this - and I think there were too many players not at their maximum today. FT: Coventry 3-1 Exeter It's all over at Wembley and Coventry are promoted to the third tier! Coventry 3-1 Exeter Jayden Stockley nods low towards goal but Coventry keeper Lee Burge dives in to scoop his effort. Moments later, Stockley tries again and chests down a long cross before firing inches wide of the post. Coventry 3-1 Exeter Clive EakinBBC Coventry & Warwickshire Sport Sky Blues fans are quiet for the first time in a while. They're not there yet... Coventry 3-1 Exeter Pat BaldwinFormer Exeter City defender on BBC Devon There are some quality players on this pitch and that was the fourth of four amazing goals we've seen today. This has been a great advert for League Two football. It's too little, too late for Exeter, though. Kyle Edwards Cor blimey! This game's not had a bad goal scored. Kyle Edwardsscores what is surely a consolation for Exeter City with a stunning curled effort that beats Coventry keeper Lee Burge. Just after the goal goes in, we're told there is to be five minutes of added time at Wembley. Could be a nervous ending if Exeter can find another goal. Coventry 3-0 Exeter Jonson Clarke-Harris skips and mazes his way through the Exeter City half and decides to fire from long range but it sails well out of play. Why not eh? Might as well when your team's 3-0 up. Coventry 3-0 Exeter James LawBBC Sport at Wembley Wondering why you might recognise the names Jordan Willis and Jack Grimmer? Well both defenders also scored in their shock FA Cup third round win over Premier League Stoke in January. The Sky Blues pair seem to love the big occasion. Coventry 3-0 Exeter Matt Jay has almost bagged a consolation for Exeter - and in style! But Lee Burge dives to deny his long-range effort. Meanwhile, Marc McNulty comes off for Coventry and is replaced by Jordan Ponticelli. Just the 28 goals for the Sky Blues this season, but McNulty's not added to that tally today. Still, a fine performance from the Coventry striker this afternoon. Coventry 3-0 Exeter Pat BaldwinFormer Exeter City defender on BBC Devon It's about pride now, for me - Exeter have to come out now and fight to make sure it's not four or five. They need to use all of their experience. At the moment, whatever Exeter have tried has not worked. 3-0 down means it's a roll of the dice to see what works. Kyle Edwards is a direct player and he might produce something. Coventry 3-0 Exeter Cheers of OLE ring around Wembley from the Coventry fans every time they complete a pass. Tom Bayliss has had enough of this showboating, though. He wants a fourth Sky Blues goal and he almost gets himself on the scoresheet with a lovely solo effort in the box before curling towards the corner, forcing Christy Pym into a fine save.

NI women 'in limbo' over abortion law,"This video can not be played 'Women need help and support' Theresa May has been urged to help liberalise Northern Ireland's abortion law by a woman whose experience brought the issue back before the courts. Sarah Ewart went to England in 2013 for a termination after doctors said her unborn child would not survive outside of the womb. Such a diagnosis, known as fatal foetal abnormality, is not grounds for a legal abortion in Northern Ireland. Following Ireland's historic vote, she said NI women were in ""limbo"". Landslide vote overturns Irish abortion ban What next for Northern Ireland? Foster says abortion vote no impact on NI Report recommends NI abortion law change The Irish Republicoverwhelmingly voted to overturn the country's abortion banin a landmark referendum on Friday. Attention has now shifted to Northern Ireland and the prime minister is facing a growing number of calls to bring the laws in line with the rest of the UK. Ms Ewart has been involved in a high-profile campaign to legalise abortion in Northern Ireland in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Sarah Ewart has been involved in a high-profile campaign to legalise abortion in NI in cases of fatal foetal abnormality She said that in the absence of a devolved government in Northern Ireland, the prime minister and MPs should step in to help change the law. ""If we had an assembly here, we would be literally at their doors begging, but we don't so we are really hoping that we can have help from Westminster and Theresa May to give us the access we need here in Northern Ireland,"" Ms Ewart told BBC News NI. ""It's a relief that women like me are going to be able to travel down to Dublin to access this procedure, but really we are wanting the help here to have it within our own hospitals in Northern Ireland"". This video can not be played After Ireland's abortion referendum, BBC News NI gauges opinion north of the border She described her experience five years ago as ""devastating"". ""We had no information at the time, the consultants and midwives here wanted to help but they couldn't give us any information,"" she said. ""Literally, yellow pages was what we went through and family planning popped up and that's where we went to make the appointment."" She said she would have preferred to have had the procedure in Northern Ireland, where doctors knew her history and all her family were around. A Supreme Court judgment considering whether abortion law in Northern Ireland is incompatible with international human rightsis expected later this year. Unlike the rest of the UK, abortion is only permitted if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health. The leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster, has said that the result of Ireland's abortion referendumhas no impact on the law in Northern Ireland. Nearly two in three Irish voters opted to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Irish constitution, which effectively banned abortion. Speaking on Sunday, Mrs Foster said: ""The legislation governing abortion is a devolved matter and it is for the Northern Ireland Assembly to debate and decide such issues."" Downing Street is understood to believe that any reform""is an issue for Northern Ireland"". But a Downing Street source said it showed ""one of the important reasons we need a functioning executive back up and running"". Northern Ireland has been without a government since January 2017, after a power-sharing deal between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed. Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which an abortion can be performed legally. A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth. However, anti-abortion campaigners argue that doctors cannot accurately predict death, saying that terminally-ill babies ""can and do defy the odds"". There is no restriction on travelling outside Northern Ireland to seek a legal termination in another jurisdiction. Last year, the Westminster government introduced measures to help women from Northern Ireland access free NHS abortions in England. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different?

"Three drug arrests after festival deathsGeorgia Jones, 18, and Tommy Bakeer, 20, died in separate incidents at Portsmouth's Mutiny Festival.6m6 minutes agoHampshire & Isle of Wight","Georgia Jones, 18, and Tommy Cowan, 20, died after being taken to hospital The father of a man who died after collapsing at a dance music festival has described holding his dying son's hand. Tommy Cowan, 20, was found collapsed shortly after Georgia Jones, 18, fell ill at Saturday's Mutiny Festival in Portsmouth.Both died in hospital. Mr Cowan's father Damian Cowan urged others considering using drugs to ""take on board"" what had happened to his son. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs. Speaking during a visit to the festival site at King George V Playing Fields in Cosham, Mr Cowan described his son's last moments. This video can not be played Tommy Cowan's father speaks to the BBC about his ""brilliant"" son ""I was in the hospital when he was fighting, I held his hand and he died. So I guess he wasn't alone,"" he said. ""It's no good saying 'don't do drugs', all I can say is 'take this on board, look what's happened, if you want to end up that way, carry on'. ""If you don't, don't even think about it."" He described his son as ""brilliant, full of life and energetic"", and said the father-of-one had gone to a concert but made ""one wrong decision"". Georgia Jones fell ill at the event at shortly after 19:00 BST on Saturday. Mr Cowan - also known as Tommy Bakeer - was found collapsed about 20 minutes later. A third person remains in a critical, but stable, condition at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. Ms Jones's mother wrote of hergrief at losing ""her little girl""on Facebook.

Italian president faces impeachment call,"President Sergio Mattarella said he agreed to all the nominations - except that of finance minister Italy is mired in fresh political turmoil, with the president facing impeachment calls after he vetoed a choice for finance minister. In a rare move, President Sergio Mattarella said he could not appoint the Eurosceptic Paolo Savona, citing concerns by investors. The decision ended a bid by Italy's two populist parties to form a coalition. Mr Mattarella may now appoint a stop-gap prime minster with early elections looking increasingly likely. He has summoned Carlo Cottarelli, a former executive director of the International Monetary Fund, who could form an interim administration. Italy, the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy, has been without a government since elections in March because no political group can form a majority. The Five Star Party had been trying to form a government with another populist party, the right-wing League. The BBC's James Reynolds in Rome says a temporary prime minister is unlikely to last long and early elections may have to be called. There is now a real argument between the president and the populists about Italy's position in the EU, he adds. A political novice, Giuseppe Conte, was proposed by the two populist parties as prime minister in an attempt to break Italy's 11-week political deadlock. He went to meet Mr Mattarella to put forward choices for his cabinet but the president vetoed Mr Savona as finance minister, citing his fierce opposition to membership of the eurozone. Italy's economy in charts Italy populists: What you should know Should Europe be scared of Italy's coalition? Justifying his move, he said ""uncertainty about our position in the euro has alarmed Italian and foreign investors"", and argued that Mr Savona's stance clashed with the two parties' own position on Europe. ""I asked for... an authoritative person from the parliamentary majority who is consistent with the government programme... who isn't seen as a supporter of a line that could probably, or even inevitably, provoke Italy's exit from the euro,"" Mr Mattarella said. He added that Mr Conte had refused to support ""any other solution"" and then surrendered his mandate to be PM. Under Italian law, the president has the right to reject the appointment of a cabinet member but the power is rarely used. According to the AFP news agency, it has happened at least three times before, including in 1994 when then-President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro blocked attempts by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to appoint his personal lawyer Cesare Previti as Minister of Justice. The president's role is largely ceremonial but he does have some key powers, such as appointing heads of government and the ability to dissolve parliament. With Italy seeing frequent instability - there have been dozens of governments since 1946 - the president has often stepped in during a crisis. Five Star's leader Luigi Di Maio called for impeachment under article 90 of the constitution, which allows parliament to demand a president step down based on a simple majority vote. If the vote is in favour, the country's constitutional court then decides whether to impeach or not. Giuseppe Conte has handed back his mandate to form a government ""I want this institutional crisis to be taken to parliament... and the president tried,"" Mr Di Maio said. ""Why don't we just say that in this country it's pointless that we vote, as the ratings agencies, financial lobbies decide the governments?"" he asked in a video on Facebook. League leader Matteo Salvini called for fresh elections. ""In a democracy, if we are still in democracy, there's only one thing to do, let the Italians have their say,"" he told supporters in a speech in central Italy. Mr Mattarella said he would wait before deciding whether to call fresh elections, and summoned Mr Cottarelli for talks on Monday. Mr Cottarelli, 64, worked at the IMF from 2008 to 2013, gaining the nickname ""Mr Scissors"" for making cuts to public spending in Italy. President Mattarella warned on Sunday that the prospect of a populist government had worsened the ""spread"" - the gap between Italian and German 10-year government bond yields, seen as a key measure of risk. Paolo Savona has a reputation as a strong Eurosceptic The spread rose to 215 basis points on Friday - the widest in four years. Ratings agency Moody's warned that it might downgrade Italy's sovereign debt rating to ""Baa3"" - one notch above the junk rating. Mr Savona, who served as industry minister during the 1990s, has been an outspoken critic of the EU and an opponent of austerity programmes. That has prompted concern over the proposed coalition's commitment to the EU and its ability to rein in the country's massive national debt - equal to 1.3 times its annual output.

Jennings in for Stoneman at Headingley,"Keaton Jennings has scored three centuries for Lancashire this season England v Pakistan, second Test Date:1-5 JuneTime:11:00 BSTVenue:Headingley Coverage:Ball-by-ball Test Match Special commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, Radio 4 LW and the BBC Sport website. Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app.Full tour details Lancashire opener Keaton Jennings has replaced Mark Stoneman in England's squad for the second Test against Pakistan at Headingley on Friday. Surrey batsman Stoneman scored 13 runs in two innings as England lost the first Test at Lord's bynine wickets. Jennings, 25, returns for the first time since August, when he played in theseries victory over South Africa. He is averaging 43.79 in the County Championship this season, with two centuries in his 314 runs. The left-hander also scored a hundred in Lancashire's One-Day Cup loss to Nottinghamshire earlier this month. ""Keaton Jennings showed a strong temperament in scoring a hundred on his Test match debut against India in December 2016,"" said national selector Ed Smith. ""Keaton has found good form in county cricket this season, including three centuries in his past seven innings. ""Mark Stoneman misses out at Headingley. Mark has experienced a disappointing start to the 2018 season and had a difficult Test match at Lord's."" 'When England lose, they get hammered' - listen to the TMS podcast Alastair Cook, Keaton Jennings, Dawid Malan, Joe Root (capt), Jonny Bairstow (wk), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Dom Bess. The squad is Smith's second since replacing James Whitaker as national selector in April. England recalled batsman Jos Buttler and called up uncapped off-spinner Dom Bess for the first Test. The pair helped England avoid an innings defeat after coming together toshare an unbroken stand of 125when the hosts still needed 69 to make Pakistan bat again at the end of the third day. However, any hopes of an unlikely victory ended at the start of day four as England lost four wickets for six runs. Pakistan comfortably chased down the64 runs required for victory,with the fourth day lasting just 90 minutes despite James Anderson bowling Azhar Ali in the third over.

Jennings, 25, returns for the first time since August, when he played in theseries victory over South Africa. He is averaging 43.79 in the County Championship this season, with two centuries in his 314 runs. The left-hander also scored a hundred in Lancashire's One-Day Cup loss to Nottinghamshire earlier this month. ""Keaton Jennings showed a strong temperament in scoring a hundred on his Test match debut against India in December 2016,"" said national selector Ed Smith. ""Keaton has found good form in county cricket this season, including three centuries in his past seven innings. ""Mark Stoneman misses out at Headingley.

"Moon 'may attend Trump-Kim summit'If the summit goes ahead, which remains uncertain, it could also feature the South Korean president.5h5 hours agoAsia","Mr Moon first brought up the idea of a three-way summit last month South Korean officials have said President Moon Jae-in could attend a possible summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. Any attendance by Mr Moon would be dependent on the progress of pre-summit talks between the US and North Korean leaders, said the Blue House. The historic meeting is scheduled to take place on 12 June in Singapore. It has been thrown into uncertainty, after Mr Trump said he would no longer be attending. But both sides have since been working to get it back on track. It would be the first ever meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting US president. This video can not be played Trump and Kim's on/off bromance The details of the potential US-North Korea meeting remain unclear, but discussions would focus on ways of denuclearising the Korean peninsula and reducing tensions. The US and North Korea have differed over the exact details of what ""denuclearisation"" would mean. Last week, Mr Trump said he was pulling out, blaming the North's ""open hostility"".It came after a senior North Korean official accused US Vice-President Mike Pence of making ""stupid"" comments.. Mr Pence had warned that North Korea ""may end like Libya"" - where then-leader Muammar Gaddafi was killed by rebels in 2011 after renouncing nuclear weapons eight years earlier. But Mr Trump later said the US was still talking to North Korea and the meeting could yet go ahead. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. On Sunday, Mr Trump said a team from the US had arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the summit, which he said would help the North achieve its ""brilliant potential"". This video can not be played South Korea released a Hollywood-style video of the meeting, accompanied by stirring music Blue House officials said on Monday that discussions on Mr Moon's potential involvement were at an early stage. ""We are still waiting to see how they come out, but depending on their outcome, the president could join [Trump and Kim] in Singapore,"" the official told news outlet Yonhap. Separately, Mr Kim and Mr Moon held a previously unannounced meeting on Saturday,following their groundbreaking meeting in April. ""Both leaders exchanged opinions... for the successful holding of the North Korea-US summit,"" said Mr Moon's office of the talks, which were held in the demilitarised zone, the border area between both countries.

"Britain's 'most scenic' bus route revealedA double-decker serving the North Yorkshire Moors has been named Britain's ""most scenic"" bus route.9h9 hours agoBusiness","This video can not be played The 840 Leeds to Whitby service takes in historic York before crossing the North York Moors National Park A double-decker serving the North York Moors has been crowned the ""most scenic"" bus route in Britain. The 840 Coastliner runs from Leeds to the coastal town of Whitby. But it's the leg that crosses the moorland, from Pickering via Goathland and Sleights, that has earned the service the prize. At the wheel, driver Adam Davis knows why: ""You can get some misty days when you come out on top but on a clear day the colours up here are forever changing. ""People do come from all over the world to ride this route. Every day is a joy."" The award was devised by campaigner and bus enthusiast Paul Kirby and has been run by Bus Users UK. ""I've been travelling up and down the country by bus for many years and on fantastic routes like this one the scenery is just spectacular,"" he says. Paul Kirby (right) presents the award to Transdev's Colin Booth ""Rural communities do need bus services and they are a lifeline for many people. So I felt they deserved a little publicity to attract new passengers."" Mr Kirby did not just want to encourage people out of their cars but also to cherish services when funding has been squeezed. Britain's most scenic bus route? The 840 runs four times a day, is completely commercial and run by Transdev. But it relies on subsidies in winter time and reimbursement by the local authority for the many users with a bus pass. Les and Janet use it to get to their caravan in Thornton-le-Dale: ""We've been using it for a long time, all on our bus pass. If we did not have the bus we would not get out because fuel is so dear."" Kate has epilepsy so cannot drive: ""It's important for me to get to places I've been visiting all my life - I would not be able to get to the outdoors, which I love very much."" The bus route passes through Goathland village, where the ITV series Heartbeat was filmed One pensioner always makes it up to the top deck so she can enjoy the best views from the front seat. Another even said her dog refuses to hop on any other bus. But as loved as it is, services like this one are under threat. Last year more than 500 routes in England and Wales were reduced or completely withdrawn and now fewer than half of people living in villages have access to a bus service, according to the Campaign for Better Transport. About Â£30m was cut from local authority subsidies in 2016-17 - with shire councils in rural England the hardest hit. The campaign group says those cuts have continued this year too. ""Tragically once these routes are lost they are usually lost forever, leaving whole communities looking like 'transport deserts',"" says Steve Chambers, the group's public transport campaigner. ""We hear frequently from older people who are struggling to access shops and doctors' surgeries and young people cut off from colleges and jobs. Buses are a lifeline and must be preserved."" The Department for Transport says it provides Â£250m a year for bus services, which supports free off-peak bus travel for 10m older people and the disabled. ""Long-term social and economic factors are affecting levels of bus usage but it is for local authorities to decide which bus operations to support in their areas,"" it says. 840 Coastliner: Leeds to York/Pickering/Whitby via North York Moors - Transdev Blazefield 914/915/916:  Glasgow/Fort William/Skye via Loch Lomond, Rannoch, Glencoe and Great Glen - Scottish Citylink 50: Bournemouth to Swanage via Sandbanks, Shell Bay and Studland -  Morebus (Go Ahead) Source:Bus Users UK,external In another part of North Yorkshire, volunteers have stepped in to provide services between villages and across the National Park, where some local people feel abandoned. ""We rattled a cap until we found enough money to keep a service running,"" says Eden Blyth, from Moors Bus, which  runs a handful of services over weekends. The 840 may be a popular rural route, but the service relies on subsidies during the winter ""We take people where they want and they have to come first. I think they'll always be needed and we are happy to do it."" His team are now hoping to tap into the hiking community to boost passenger numbers and keep the wheels turning. But the volunteers and paid driver Adam Davis both agree - there's no other routes they'd rather ride. So a prize that celebrates those services can only be a boost.

"Festival death teen's mum speaks of lossJanine Milburn hopes the death of her ""little girl"" at a festival will deter others from taking drugs.13h13 hours agoHampshire & Isle of Wight","Georgia Jones, 18, has been named locally as one of those who died at Mutiny Festival The mother of a teenager who died after ""taking two pills"" at a dance music festival in Portsmouth has spoken of her grief at losing ""her little girl"". Georgia Jones, 18, and a man named locally as Tommy Bakeer, 20,died in separate incidents at Mutiny Festival. Writing on Facebook, her mother Janine Milburn said she hoped her daughter's death would deter others from ""taking anything ever"". Police have not confirmed whether drugs were involved in either of the deaths. A Queen Alexandra Hospital spokesman said some of the people treated presented with ""drug-related"" symptoms. It could not confirm if all 15 illnesses were related to drugs. This video can not be played Mutiny Festival safety adviser Ian Baird said organisers were liaising with police following two deaths at its site in Portsmouth A statement on Facebook from festival organisers read: ""The safety of our amazing customers has always been paramount to us and so to keep everyone safe and in respect to those who have passed, we have taken the decision not to open today."" Earlier, the festival at King George V Playing Fields in Cosham had issued a ""harm prevention alert"" apparently warning about the use of drugs. The message to festivalgoers described a ""dangerous high-strength or bad-batch substance on site"". Organisers said on social media they were ""devastated"" about the deaths. Liam Blair said he was shocked to hear about the deaths Festivalgoer Liam Blair, from Southampton, was one of thousands of revellers making their way home early after the event's cancellation. He said closing the festival early was a ""respectful"" decision and that there was an atmosphere of ""shock"" as news of the deaths spread. ""You just don't expect that to happen to people so young,"" he said. Police were alerted to Ms Jones falling ill at 19:10 BST on Saturday, and the man was found collapsed about 20 minutes later. Both were taken to the Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, where they later died. Organisers announced on Facebook that the festival had been cancelled on Sunday ""as a safety precaution"" Ms Milburn posted a warning on Facebook about the dangers of drugs following the death of her daughter. ""If nothing else I hope what has happened to her will deter you from taking anything ever,"" she said. ""My little girl was 18 and full of life."" In a statement, Hampshire Police said: ""The deaths are being treated as separate incidents at this stage. ""They are not being treated as suspicious but inquiries are being made to determine the circumstances of what happened in each case."" Many revellers at the Mutiny Festival had been camping The two-day festival featured artists performing electronic music including drum 'n' bass, garage and hip hop.

Italian economy in charts,"Italy goes to the polls on Sunday in one of its most contentious votes in years. The economy has become a key battleground for the main parties' campaigns. Italy's economy has started to expand once again, but is still one of the worst performers of the countries in the eurozone. The election battle is proving to be very close, with the latest polls suggesting no political coalition will win a clear majority. Italy vote: Who's who and why it matters The parties are battling to prove they can take Italy's economy, industry and job market back to pre-crisis levels. However, despite all the pre-election rhetoric, few Italians can really see what has improved since the economic crisis. The road to full recovery has been much harder than many expected. Economic growth - in terms of GDP per head - has been picking up since 2014. However, the pace of growth appears weak compared with other major European economies. Forecasts suggest it would take between five and six years to achieve the rates seen in 2007. Meanwhile some other eurozone nations are experiencing their best growth in the past decade. Italian debt is now the second worst in Europe after Greece and has reached 132% of GDP. In the field of fashion, food and cars, Italy has had a reputation for excellence and it has exported these all over the world. The ""Made in Italy"" brand has been rejuvenated thanks to an increase in exports and international interest. In 2014, Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party started its job reforms, which have been credited with  creating almost one million jobs. However, the latest Italian Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) figures show that nearly 60% of them are part-time roles. The level of part-time work means much lower job security compared with other European countries. In Italy, this seems to have deepened the problem of unemployment - particularly in the southern regions where jobless rates are as high as 29%. Although Italy presents itself as one of the top three European economies, high rates of unemployment have caused a steep rise in poverty. The number of Italians at risk of poverty rose from three million in 2006 to 18 million - nearly a third of the entire population - in 2016. The top rate of income tax in Italy is one of the highest in Europe, well above the 39% average for top rates across the 28-members of the Union. That's why Silvio Berlusconi has started his own personal battle against high taxation levels and has promised to create a 23% ""Flat Tax"" for everyone Italy vote: Who's who and why it matters Immigration dominates Italian election Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

What you should know,"Populists poised to govern: Five Star Movement's Luigi Di Maio (L) and League's Matteo Salvini Italy's new populist government has been sworn in, ending months of political uncertainty. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right-wing League have gone into coalition, preparing to set the eurozone's third biggest economy on a path of tax cuts, a guaranteed basic income for the poor and deportations of 500,000 migrants. They reject years of EU austerity and want to renegotiate Italy's debt. So what will this government, led by law professor Giuseppe Conte, mean for Italy and the rest of Europe? Neither Five Star nor The League are fans of the single currency. League leader Matteo Salvini said not long ago that the euro was ""a mistake"" for Italy's economy, while Five Star had wanted a referendum on Italy's future membership. But they have dropped their initial ambition of exit from the euro and now talk of trying to reform it from within. Not everyone is convinced by their change of heart. France's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire earned a rebuke from the leader of The League by warning the populist parties to respect Italy's budget commitments. The markets are wary, too. Italy's borrowing costs have touched levels not seen since 2016. Italy was ravaged by the 2008 financial crisis that left the economy some 6% smaller and three million more people in poverty. The answer for The League and Five Star is to move Italians out of poverty. But their policies will cost tens of billions of euros, for a country with the second biggest public debt in the EU after Greece. It stands at 132% of national output. Poor families will get a â¬780 (Â£682; $919) basic monthly income, provided recipients actively seek work, the parties say. It is a popular idea but one that will cost an estimated â¬17bn to implement. Its most expensive policy is the idea of two ""flat tax"" rates set at 15% and 20%. Families would receive a â¬3,000 annual tax deduction based on household income. Sales and excise tax increases next year, worth â¬12.5bn, will be scrapped. The 58-page joint pact, or ""contract"", does not explain how all the extra spending will be financed,external. But economists estimate it could cost some â¬50bn in lost revenue. The minimum monthly pension is to be set at â¬780. The plan abolishes the current pension reform that raises the retirement age in phases. Instead, a new points system would combine people's total years of social security contributions with their age. The total must be at least 100, meaning that someone who has paid into the system for 41 years, for example, could retire at 59. Italy's new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is a political novice The populist parties say they want revisions to the EU's Stability and Growth Pact, which sets a tough budget deficit limit of 3% of GDP. The plan aims to reduce debt through ""the revival of internal demand"", not by continuing austerity. Italy's populists are not just aiming to reset the economy and revisit the EU's rules on debt. The League is strongly anti-immigration and their joint plan reflects that. It demands more EU help for Italy - the main destination for migrants arriving from North Africa - and it insists that the estimated 500,000 undocumented migrants in Italy must be deported ""as a priority"". Italian election: Its economy in charts What exactly is populism? That would require the creation of ""temporary stay facilities"" throughout Italy for migrants earmarked for expulsion, the parties say. Italy's capacity to house migrants has been stretched to the limits The plan calls for effective relocation of asylum-seekers EU-wide - a scheme already rejected by some EU states. And it demands stronger co-operation to fight people-smuggling gangs. The populist leaders disagree with the EU sanctions on Russia and want them lifted. They do not see Russia as a military threat, but as ""a potential partner for the EU and Nato"". They want to work with Russia against the smuggling of migrants across the Mediterranean and the continuing influence of violent Islamists. They also see Russia as a key player in ending the wars in the Middle East. The EU and US accuse Russia of hostile anti-Western activities and relations became icy after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Should Europe be scared?,"Could Italy leave the EU? There should be a health warning attached to all debate, guesswork, predictions and evaluations being made right now about the anti-establishment government being put together in Rome. Yes, this is very much part of the populist nationalist wave that has been sweeping across Europe from Austria, to Hungary, France and the UK but at the same time you really have to view this drama through a pair of Italian opera glasses to get a better sense of what's going on. This, we must remember, is Italy. A country known for high drama. A nation that flirted with modern-day populism ahead of the US and the rest of Europe - with the first Berlusconi government back in 1994. This is also a country that threatened to (but ultimately did not) bring the eurozone crashing down before - in 2011 during the European debt crisis. A technocrat government ran Italy in 2011-13 implementing unpopular austerity measures in response to the country's financial crisis Also important to note is that Italy's political system was redesigned after its fascist dictatorship and World War Two to avoid any one politician or party getting too much power ever again. So even if this marriage of The League and the Five Star movement does take off, and if they manage to contain the very big ideological differences that exist between them (and that's a big if), getting dramatic reforms passed rapidly through the Italian parliament will be an uphill struggle for them. What you need to know about Italy's populists Populists' PM candidate Conte faces scrutiny over CV So should Europe stop worrying, sit back and simply observe this latest Italian drama unfold? Italy has seen the rise of two rival populist leaders, Luigi di Maio (L) and Matteo Salvini, as seen in this Rome mural In fact, despite the caveats I've listed above, what Five Star and The League are proposing would shake Italian and European politics to the core. Brussels is spooked. As are the financial markets and investors. They don't like unpredictability. They don't like rule breaking. Italy result sends shockwaves to Brussels Italy election: What does the result mean? But that's exactly what Italy's government-in-waiting has promised voters: to turn the status quo on its head. They've declared a ""People's Republic"" and ""Italians First!"" is one of their slogans. Supporters of the populist Five Star movement brandish letters spelling out their government ambitions Their message: the interests of ordinary Italians - not of the rich or well connected or of ""the bureaucrats in Brussels"" should now be prioritised. A seductive proposal to corruption and recession-weary Italians. Italy used to be a hugely EU-enthusiastic nation. Italians viewed the club as a safeguard against their often corrupt or inept national governments. They believed the euro would bring stability compared to the boom and bust cycles associated with their national currency, the lira. But nowadays Italy is one of the most Eurosceptic countries in the EU. Migration is one reason. The economy is another. Hundreds of thousands of migrants have arrived in Italy in recent years Europe's migration crisis has washed hundreds of thousands of irregular migrants on to Italian shores. Most come to Europe with a plan to head to richer northern countries like Germany or Sweden but they get stuck in Italy due to EU regulations declaring that they have to stay and be processed in the country where they are first finger-printed. Italians feel they (alongside Greece) have been left alone to shoulder a crisis that is in fact a wider European issue. Which is why many welcome The League's tough line on migration. Italian election: Its economy in charts EU migration: Crisis in seven charts Schengen: EU free movement deal explained Italians are also bitterly resentful about the euro. They believe the currency's rules and regulations favour Germany, not Italy. They smoulder resentfully over Germany's current account surplus and low unemployment rate while Italy is crippled by weak growth, a stagnant labour market and massive national debt. The euro is seen across Europe to favour Germany over other countries Clearly not all of Italy's financial woes can be laid at Brussels' door. Italy's former centre-left government proposed structural reforms to tackle a number of issues but Five Star and the League want to spend their way out of this slump - introducing a flat tax system, a basic income for the poor and reversing pension reforms. This will smash EU budgetary regulations and put Italy on a collision course with Brussels. And what happens in Italy matters. This is not Greece we're talking about. Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone. And although both Five Star and The League have backed away from earlier promises to hold a referendum on withdrawing Italy from the single currency, they could put the proposal back on the table at any time. The threat of that referendum would hang in the air as long as they remained in government. Off-putting for investors. Destabilising for the whole eurozone. And the EU as a whole. Frustrated though they are with Brussels, there is no appetite amongst Italians for anItalexit- where they would walk out the EU for good. But having such a Eurosceptic (and also Moscow-sympathising) government in the heart of Europe - Italy is one of the EU's founding members, don't forget - would be a huge blow to the project of ""ever-closer union"" championed by French President Emmanuel Macron, for example. The EU is not nearly as popular as it once was in Italy Concerned about the damage a Five Star-League government could inflict on Italy and the EU, Italy's president stalled for some time before giving Giuseppe Conte the go-ahead to form a government. President Mattarella knows he must tread carefully. The majority of Italians say they want to give this government a chance. So, those in Brussels and beyond should think twice before wishing for new elections. If Italians feel ""the establishment"" is trying to silence their loud call for change, they're likely to vote for those who say they represent the voice of ordinary people - the populists - in even bigger numbers.

'Spiderman' balcony rescue wows France,"This video can not be played Malian ""Spiderman"" rescues Paris child - then meets French president A Malian migrant, hailed as a hero after mounting a daring rescue to save a small boy dangling from a balcony in Paris, is to be made a French citizen. Mamoudou Gassama won widespread praise after climbing the outside of the building to save the four-year-old. Video showed him being cheered on by spectators,externalas he pulled himself from balcony to balcony to the fourth floor. After meeting him at the Elysee Palace, President Emmanuel Macron said he would be made a naturalised citizen. He personally thanked Mr Gassama, gave him a medal for courage and said he would also be offered a role in the fire service. Travelling a rite of passage for many Malians Mr Gassama is said to have arrived in France last year, taking the long and dangerous journey to Europe via a boat over the Mediterranean to Italy. The drama that thrust him to fame unfolded on Saturday evening on a street in the north of the city. Mr Gassama said he had been walking past when he saw a crowd gathered in front of the building. He told Mr Macron: ""I just didn't have time to think, I ran across the road to go and save him. Firefighters rescue man stuck for hours in swing 'Wolf-like' creature puzzles experts Busking goes cashless in 'world first' for London ""I just climbed up and thank God, God helped me. The more I climbed the more I had the courage to climb up higher, that's it,"" he added. He said that the boy was crying when he hauled him to safety and had also suffered an injured foot. Firefighters arrived to find the child had already been rescued. ""Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child,"" a spokesperson said. Mr Gassama met French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday Outside the presidential palace he showed off a certificate he was given Local authorities quoted by French media said the boy's parents were not at home at the time. The father has been questioned by police on suspicion of leaving his child unattended, judicial sources say. The mother was not in Paris at the time, it is believed. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was among those to praise the 22-year-old's heroism and said she had called him to thank him. She referred to him as the ""Spiderman of the 18th"", referring to the Paris district where the rescue took place, calling him an ""example for all citizens"". Allow Twitter content?

Alex Duval Smith, West Africa correspondent, BBC News Mr Gassama's four-storey dash is a reminder of another Malian hero who gained national prominence in January 2015 during an extremist attack on a Jewish supermarket in Paris. A young Malian employee, Lassana Bathily, was credited with saving the lives of six hostages including a baby when he led them to a safe hiding place, escaped, then directed gendarmes to their rescue. Two weeks later - after six years of struggling to secure legal residency in France - Mr Bathily was given a medal and a French passport by then President FranÃ§ois Hollande. In 2016, he wrote a book ''Je ne suis pas un heros'' (I am no hero) and created a charity whose first project was to provide irrigation for his home village in western Mali. Like Mr Bathily's selfless leadership to save the hostages, Mr Gassama's heroic climb to save the boy cements the image of Mali as a country with a culture of old-fashioned public spiritedness.

Moon 'may attend Trump-Kim summit',"Mr Moon first brought up the idea of a three-way summit last month South Korean officials have said President Moon Jae-in could attend a possible summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. Any attendance by Mr Moon would be dependent on the progress of pre-summit talks between the US and North Korean leaders, said the Blue House. The historic meeting is scheduled to take place on 12 June in Singapore. It has been thrown into uncertainty, after Mr Trump said he would no longer be attending. But both sides have since been working to get it back on track. It would be the first ever meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting US president. This video can not be played Trump and Kim's on/off bromance The details of the potential US-North Korea meeting remain unclear, but discussions would focus on ways of denuclearising the Korean peninsula and reducing tensions. The US and North Korea have differed over the exact details of what ""denuclearisation"" would mean. Last week, Mr Trump said he was pulling out, blaming the North's ""open hostility"".It came after a senior North Korean official accused US Vice-President Mike Pence of making ""stupid"" comments.. Mr Pence had warned that North Korea ""may end like Libya"" - where then-leader Muammar Gaddafi was killed by rebels in 2011 after renouncing nuclear weapons eight years earlier. But Mr Trump later said the US was still talking to North Korea and the meeting could yet go ahead. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. On Sunday, Mr Trump said a team from the US had arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the summit, which he said would help the North achieve its ""brilliant potential"". This video can not be played South Korea released a Hollywood-style video of the meeting, accompanied by stirring music Blue House officials said on Monday that discussions on Mr Moon's potential involvement were at an early stage. ""We are still waiting to see how they come out, but depending on their outcome, the president could join [Trump and Kim] in Singapore,"" the official told news outlet Yonhap. Separately, Mr Kim and Mr Moon held a previously unannounced meeting on Saturday,following their groundbreaking meeting in April. ""Both leaders exchanged opinions... for the successful holding of the North Korea-US summit,"" said Mr Moon's office of the talks, which were held in the demilitarised zone, the border area between both countries.

"Taylor Swift's hits-and-run set in SwanseaThe US pop star plays a brief, but hit-packed, show at the BBC Music Biggest Weekend festival.","Taylor Swift stayed true to her name, playing a brief, but flawless, set at the BBC's Biggest Weekend in Swansea. Effectively a stripped-back supercut of her current world tour, the six-song performance largely focused on the star's 2017 album Reputation. She opened with the pummelling goth-pop of Ready For It, before racing through songs like Gorgeous and Delicate. Fans were forced to wait to the end to hear the classics Blank Space and Shake It Off - and then it was all over. But if the 26,000-strong audience who'd crammed into Swansea's Singleton Park felt short-changed, they didn't show it, shimmying along with Swift and her tightly-drilled dancers. ""You're not just singing along but you're screaming along... which is the best,"" said Taylor, as she took stock of the crowd. ""It kind of took my breath away a little bit when I first came out here."" The star also worked in two plugs for her UK tour dates, as she played live on BBC TV and radio. Swift by name, swift by nature... the star was on stage for 28 minutes The star introduced her dancers to the crowd between songs But if her set was ruthless in its efficiency, it was nonetheless a masterclass in pop - from Swift's effortless vocals and shape-throwing choreography to her adorkable between-song banter. ""Oh wait, this is in the wrong key!"" she laughed as she fumbled the start of Delicate, sliding a capo up the neck of her guitar to find the right note. ""She was fantastic. She's amazing. She's unique,"" said Lauren, who was happy to see the star in her hometown. ""You don't often get to see Taylor Swift in Swansea, let's be fair."" Swift's Reputation was one of 2017's biggest-selling albums ""It was briefer than I thought it was going to be,"" added Chantelle from Miskin, Rhondda Cynon Taff. ""I was expecting a little bit more Swifty but she looked good."" Charis Lee, from Abergavenny, commented: ""I'd have liked to hear some of the older stuff - the country stuff - but she was amazing."" After performing, Swift admitted backstage that she had been ""a tiny bit nervous"". ""We pretty much had no time to rehearse for this. This was kind of like, on the fly,"" she told Radio 1's Greg James. The star also declared ""I'm not worth it!"" when she was told her performance bumped Antiques Roadshow off the Sunday night TV schedule. This video can not be played Florence Welch anoints the crowd Swift was followed by headliner, Florence + The Machine, who gave a spirited, spiritual performance, as she whirled across the stage like a barefoot shamanic warrior. After clasping a fan's head in her hands during What Kind Of Man, she closed her set with a promise about the restorative powers of her hit single Shake It Out. ""I've been to a lot of festivals, and I know how it feels at the end of the second day,"" she said. ""If you sing this song, I promise you will not have a hangover tomorrow. ""I wrote it with a hangover... but that's beside the point."" Camila Cabello said she'd enjoyed her first experience of Wales Earlier in the day, Camila Cabello - who is supporting Swift on her current world tour - gave a spectacular performance on Swansea's main stage, playing her own hits Havana and Never Be The Same alongside snippets of Prince's Purple Rain and Can't Help Falling In Love. The 21-year-old's pin-sharp choreography and exuberant charisma made her one of the day's stand-out performers - a feat that was all the more impressive given that she was battling the heat, while jet-lagged, in a skin-tight black catsuit. ""Why did I do that?"" she laughed, as she spoke to BBC News after the show. ""It was so hot up there, I thought I was going to pass out at one point but I was like, 'I'm going to give everything to Swansea. They'll have to carry me out of here!'"" The singer, who arrived in Wales on Saturday night after playing a show on Swift's world tour in Denver, said she'd been impressed by her first encounter with the country. ""I was in Cardiff last night and we were walking outside. It was like 11pm and there was a lady that was... drunk. She was wasted. ""She was approaching this guy [who was] playing guitar. And she was like, 'Play Havana!' and she started singing the chorus. ""I got out my phone to record it, and she just stumbled away!"" This video can not be played Rita Ora made Avicii's song the centrepiece of her set Other performers in Swansea on Sunday included Rita Ora, who opened the main stage with a clutch of her own hits, and a tribute to dance star Avicii, who died last month. Biggest Weekend: The power of a singalong Ed Sheeran 'warms up' Biggest Weekend George Ezra: 'It's like school backstage' Manics play 'Wireless' Biggest Weekend set One Direction star Niall Horan led a mass singalong to his solo tracks Slow Hands and This Town, as well as a slowed-down reggae version of the 1D hit Drag Me Down. Demi Lovato, Stefflon Don, Thirty Seconds To Mars and Jason Derulo also kept the crowd entertained as they waited for Swift and Florence + The Machine, who will close the event. Shawn Mendes drew one of the day's biggest crowds to the stage in Swansea's Singleton Park Meanwhile, Coventry's War Memorial Park saw Radio 2 continue its contribution to the Biggest Weekend, with sets from Snow Patrol, UB40 and headliner Liam Gallagher. Wearing his traditional uniform of a zipped-up cagoule and an Elvis sneer, he played a tried-and-tested festival set that kicked off with the Oasis classics Rock And Roll Star and Morning Glory. ""Alright Coventry, don't listen to what people say about you, you are a proper city,"" he announced at as he took the stage. It might have seemed like an odd way to win over the crowd - but he was aware they'd braved a rainstorm to watch him perform. ""Thanks for sticking round I know the weather ain't been nice,"" he acknowledged. Though his voice is clearly not what it was, the 45-year-old still carries himself like a rock star, belting out defiant lyrics, and closing his set with an emotional Live Forever - which he memorably sang at the One Love Manchester show last year. Liam Gallagher concentrated on Oasis songs, and his recent solo album Earlier, Coventry's main stage had been launched by Welsh rockers Stereophonics - a  band who aren't used to such an early morning slot. ""Let me think how it was sold to us,"" singer Kelly Jones told the BBC. ""Remember that time that U2 and Paul McCartney opened up Live 8? ""And we could be back in the pub by five. So yeah, we took it."" One artist who brought some Caribbean sunshine to Coventry was Billy Ocean, whose crowd-pleasing set included the Bob Marley classic No Woman, No Cry as well as Love Really Hurts, Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car and, of course, Caribbean Queen. Billy Ocean said he was thrilled by the response to his set in Coventry ""I saw lots of people enjoying themselves,"" he said after coming off the stage. ""The energy from them comes back to you. We keep doing what we do because we make people happy. There's nothing like it."" Full coverage of the four-day music festival is available on BBC TV, radio and the dedicatedBiggest Weekend website. The event wraps up in Coventry on Monday, with a day dedicated to classical music, including sets by Nigel Kennedy, Eliza Carthy and a ""Strictly Spectacular"" featuring the show's professional dancers and the BBC Concert Orchestra.

What next for abortion in NI?,"Alliance for Choice use #TrustWomen slogan to advocate a change for women in Northern Ireland The Republic of Ireland voted on Friday to repeal part of its constitution that effectively outlawed abortion. That change will soon leave Northern Ireland as the only part of either the UK or Ireland where abortion is illegal unless there is a serious risk to a woman's life or health. Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland. A Supreme Court judgment considering whether abortion law in Northern Ireland is incompatible with international human rights is expected later this year. Why are NI's abortion laws so different? UK 'breaches NI' women's rights - UN Irish abortion result 'a seismic shift' Ruth Foster, a Belfast-born student in her final year at the University of Edinburgh, thinks many people in the rest of the UK are unaware of the legal position in Northern Ireland. Ruth says at school she was exposed to pro-life sex education that left her and her friends misinformed She was one of many who spoke out about what she says was misinformation and misconceptions online, and says that momentum must not be lost from the #RepealTheEighth movement. Saturday's overwhelming Yes result in the Republic of Ireland has galvanised pro-choice groups and activists. Many have said they plan to turn their attention to Northern Ireland's laws. Several Westminster politicianssuggested that the government should bring Northern Ireland in line with the rest of the UK. AfterSaturday's Yes vote, one young woman from Northern Ireland decided to speak up about her experience of having an illegal, self-medicated abortion at home several years ago. As a student recovering from mental health issues, Amy found herself pregnant when her contraception failed. Unable to afford to travel to Britain for a procedure, she ordered abortion pills online. She said the abortion was ""horrifyingly painful"" to go through without medical help or pain relief. Since Amy had her crisis pregnancy,measures have been implemented to help fund women travelling to Britain for NHS abortions. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O Neill and Mary Lou McDonald are campaigning for change Politicians from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have hit back at calls to extend abortion services in Northern Ireland. MP Ian Paisley Jnr tweeted on Saturday that Northern Ireland ""should not be bullied into accepting abortion on demand"". Another politician from the party, Jim Wells, a former Northern Ireland health minister, said that the result in Ireland was ""an extremely worrying development for the protection of the unborn child in Northern Ireland"". Mr Wells called on Northern Ireland's anti-abortion movement to ""redouble its efforts"" to prevent any change of the law there. Emma Campbell, co-chair of abortion rights group Alliance for Choice, said the DUP's political stance is out-of-step with the will of most people in Northern Ireland. ""Poll after poll has shown in the north, much like it did in the south, that between 62-72% people in every one of the polls is in favour of a change to the law,"" she said. ""We are being denied our human rights, and especially in the realm of healthcare. It has real mental and physical consequences."" Abortions are only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her physical or mental health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not reasons for legal procedures. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anna, who lives in Londonderry, found out when she was 20 weeks pregnant in 2010 that her unborn son would die almost immediately after birth. She then had to carry him for a further 12 weeks because of Northern Ireland's restrictive laws. ""Obviously immediate friends, family and colleagues knew. But other people would ask: 'When's the baby due or what are you having?' All the normal questions,"" she told the BBC. She said she was forced to stop telling the ""uncomfortable truth"" after struggling with people's responses. ""The hardest thing was knowing your baby was there but you wouldn't get the happy times at the end. ""I just think it's unfair to expect you to go through all this, and you know, prolong the agony really. It's really not humane."" Allow Twitter content?

After almost a year and a half without devolved government at Stormont, Grainne Teggart, Northern Ireland campaign manager at Amnesty International, has urged Westminster stop turning a ""blind-eye"" to the situation. ""The UK government needs to ensure that no woman on the island of Ireland is left behind, and that women in Northern Ireland can access free, safe and legal abortion at home,"" she told the BBC. Grainne Teggart says women in Northern Ireland ""can only look on"" as other women's rights progress However, Marion Woods, from the anti-abortion group Both Lives Matter, said she was ""saddened"" by the result in the Republic of Ireland referendum. ""The [Northern Ireland] secretary of state has already stated that this is a devolved issue and it should be left to us,"" she said. ""I think that rather than pushing for the cheaper option of abortion there should be a focus on restoring local government at Stormont and then our local government immediately committing to addressing support and care for all during pregnancy."" She said more should be done by others to help homeless, pregnant women when ""they are in crisis"" in the UK. Ben O'Flynn, a barrister who campaigned in favour of retaining the Eighth Amendment, said he accepted the results of the referendum. However, he added: ""Ireland is a changed place, but it's changed in way I think is in a negative way."" He said he did not wish to ""minimise the hurt or the difficulties that women find themselves in"" but said the focus had not been on ""two people, not on the fact that there is a life"".

"Doctors' gender pay gap 'to be eliminated'Female doctors are paid on average Â£10,000 less than male doctors in England, figures show.2h2 hours agoHealth","Female medical staff are paid 15% less than their male counterparts The NHS in England is to review how much it pays male and female doctors in an effort to eliminate a gender pay gap of 15%. A review announced by the health secretary will look at why male doctors are paid on average Â£10,000 more than female doctors,as the BBC reported. Across the whole NHS, women are paid 23% less than men despite far more women being employed. A leading female doctor is to lead the review into the reasons behind the gap. Prof Jane Dacre, president of the Royal College of Physicians, will lead the independent review into gender pay inequality. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, she said women made ""brilliant doctors"" and had ""contributed hugely to the health service"", and the review would look to ""sort out a level of inequality that's been going on for many years"". She added that as more than 50% of medical school entrants were women, the problem ""needs to be fixed"". Male doctors are paid on average Â£67,788 in basic pay, compared with Â£57,569 for female doctors. Prof Dacre said the review would look at why some women's career trajectories might be slower than their male counterparts, adding ""societal expectations on women"" mean they are more likely to take time out to care for children, or relatives. Top women doctors lose out in NHS pay stakes Final gender pay gap figures revealed Top women doctors earn less than men NHS pay: Unions agree deal for 1.3 million staff Jeremy Hunt, the health and social care secretary in England, said it was unacceptable that staff still faced gender inequality and he was ""determined"" to eliminate the pay gap. The pay gap exists because there are more higher-paid male doctors than female doctors in senior positions, although women make up more than half of junior doctors. Taking time out to have children can affect pay progression, particularly for female consultants. They are also much less likely to given reward payments for work done over-and-above their core roles. The review will look at a number of issues which can stop a woman progressing in her career, including: working patterns and their impact on those in the medical profession impact of motherhood on careers and progression care arrangements and their affordability, and issues around being a carer access to flexible working shared parental leave, identify factors that are resulting in a slow uptake the predominance of men in senior roles the impact of rewards payments geographical issues Dr Anthea Mowat, from the British Medical Association, said women still faced all kinds of barriers in their careers and she hoped the review would lead to policy changes. ""We know that the gender pay gap in medicine is heavily linked to part-time working, an unequal share of childcare responsibilities as well as bias and discrimination which still exists in the profession."" The review, which should finish by the end of 2018, is expected to have wider implications for the rest of the NHS and other staff groups.
