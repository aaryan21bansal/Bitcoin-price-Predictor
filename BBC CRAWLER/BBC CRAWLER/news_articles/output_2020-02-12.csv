'Depraved' ex-monk jailed for child sex abuse,"A judge said Peter Turner had ""brought evil into this world"" A former monk at a Catholic boarding school who sexually abused three boys aged under 13 has been jailed for more than 20 years. Peter Turner, 80, of Redcar, admitted 14 charges including indecent assault, gross indecency and another serious sexual offence. The offences took place at Ampleforth College, North Yorkshire, and a parish in Cumbria between 1984 and 1990. North Yorkshire Police said Turner was ""clearly a very depraved individual"". Sentencing him at York Crown Court, Judge Sean Morris said: ""You have brought evil into this world when, by your calling, you should have brought hope, help and succour."" More stories from Yorkshire The court heard parents sent their children to Ampleforth to be cared for by ""men of God"" but Turner was ""a man of evil"" Turner, formerly known as Father Gregory Carroll, targeted the first boy at Ampleforth. Then after he confessed to the church authorities about sexual contact with a boy he was sent to a parish in Workington. He went on to indecently assault a boy in the Cumbrian town and committed indecent assault and gross indecency against a third victim. The court heard victim impact statements in which the men spoke about the impact Turner's abuse had had on their lives. He was recalled and confined to the monastery at Ampleforth after theNolan Report,externalon the problem of clerical child abuse was published in 2001. Turner was previously jailed for four years in 2005 after admitting offences against 10 pupils at the school between 1979 and 1987. The sentence was later reduced by 12 months. On Tuesday he pleaded guilty to 11 counts of indecent assault, two counts of a serious sexual assault and one count of gross indecency with a child. Pauline McCullagh, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Turner committed a truly sickening breach of trust, sexually abusing young boys who innocently placed their trust in him as a monk and priest.""

Motorists stranded in heavy snow thank rescuersThey were among 12 people helped to safety by a mountain rescue team after their vehicles became stuck.South Scotland,"Jarek Grudowski and Piotr Bukolt were rescued in severe weather on Tuesday night. Two Polish businessmen who became stuck in heavy snow in southern Scotland have thanked their rescuers. The men encountered the severe conditions as they travelled from Edinburgh to Dumfries, via the A702 in Dumfries and Galloway on Tuesday night. They were among 12 people who were rescued after vehicles including a tanker, bus and several cars were abandoned on the Dalveen Pass. Rescue teams said they encountered 18 inches (45cm) of snow and strong winds. Jarek Grudowski and Piotr Bukolt were about 30 miles from their destination when their car became stuck in snow near Durisdeer. The rescue operation at Dalveen Pass came after days of wintry conditions in Scotland ""There was extremely heavy snow,"" Mr Grudowski told BBC Scotland. ""We were stuck, the car couldn't move. In front of us there were a few trucks and some other cars which were also abandoned already."" Fortunately, a rescue team soon appeared and took the men to their hotel. Mr Grudowski said: ""I would like to thank the mountain rescue team because they helped us immediately and took us to the hotel so we were on time."" Mr Bukolt was also relieved. ""Yes I was happy,"" he said. ""This is the best business trip with Jarek in my life."" A large swathe of the south of Scotland was covered by a Met Office amber weather warning of snow while the rescue operation took place on Tuesday. Charlie McCreedie was one of the four members of theMoffat Mountain Rescue Team,externalwho were on standby. He said they got the call to go to the Dalveen Pass on the A702, between the M74 and A76, after 21:00. ""The A76 was completely clear, but when you got to the higher ground it was snowing quite heavily,"" he said. ""The road was completely blocked then by vehicles and snow."" Drivers and passengers were taken to safety by members of Moffat Mountain Rescue Team Mr McCreedie and his team brought two off-road vehicles, but had to wait a further hour for a snow plough to clear the path to safety. He said the 12 people they helped - including a bus passenger - were ""starting to look cold and weary"". ""They were pleased to get into the Land Rover,"" he added. With weather warnings in place and forecasts predicting further wintry weather over the coming days, Mr McCreedie urged drivers to plan ahead and not make unnecessary journeys. He said: ""It's just Scotland in the winter, you really need to be prepared. ""It is always worth having something in your car in case you do get stuck. Try and listen to the police and weather forecast. ""If you can avoid your journey, avoid your journey.""

"Food giant to stop advertising ice cream to kidsUnilever, which owns brands such as Twister and Cornetto, says it is responding to rising obesity rates.Business","Food giant Unilever has vowed to stop marketing its products to children in order to tackle rising obesity rates. The firm, which owns brands such as Twister ice cream and Popsicle ice lollies, said it would limit the use of cartoon characters in its advertising. It also promised to stop using social media stars or celebrities ""who primarily appeal"" to children under 12. Ads for Unilever ice creams have been pulled in the past over complaints they marketed unhealthy food to children. The new rules,externalwill apply to all of the firm's products by the end of 2020, kicking off with its Wall's ice cream brands. Wall's will also launch a range of ""responsibly made"" products for children that contain ""no more than 110 calories and a maximum of 12g of sugar per portion"". Wall's brands popular with children include Max, Paddle Pop and Twister. ""Our promise is a genuine commitment to make and market products to children responsibly,"" said Matt Close, executive vice president of the firm's global ice cream business. Allow Twitter content?

Italy's far-right leader Salvini to face trial,"This video can not be played Matteo Salvini: ""I want someone to put an end to this surreal debate"" Italy's Senate has voted to allow prosecutors to put far-right leader Matteo Salvini on trial over charges of holding migrants at sea. Mr Salvini, who previously served as Italy's interior minister, is accused of illegally keeping people on a boat off Sicily for days in August 2019. Some 116 migrants remained aboard the Gregoretti for close to a week. On Wednesday, a majority of senators voted for the trial of the anti-immigration League leader to go ahead. Mr Salvini has repeatedly said he wants to go to court. He told the chamber he wanted ""to tell the world"" that his migration policies ""saved tens of thousands of lives."" ""I am absolutely calm and proud of what I have done. And I'll do it again as soon as I get back into government,"" he said later. Senators from his League party left the chamber rather than take part in Wednesday's vote. Can Italy's populist leader return to power? The right-wing nationalists shaking up Europe Under Italian law, ministers have parliamentary immunity for actions taken while they were in office. But a committee voted last month to strip Mr Salvini of his immunity - leaving the final decision in the hands of the Senate on Wednesday. Mr Salvini's supporters clapped his speech The upper house Senate voted 152-76 in favour of lifting the immunity. After the tally was announced, Mr Salvini compared himself to US President Donald Trump, who was impeached in December and accused opponents of undermining his electoral success through the courts. ""I, like Trump? He has a few more billions and a few more years, but it's a bad little habit of the left, going around in the world, to try to win by judicial means,"" he wrote on Twitter. If successfully prosecuted at trial, Mr Salvini could face up to 15 years in jail. By Mark Lowen, BBC News, Rome The response of most politicians when the hand of the judiciary comes knocking is to deny, evade, or flee. The response of Matteo Salvini: bring it on. For a man who has built his political success on a hard anti-migrant line, the decision to try him for blocking migrants from Italy feeds the image he presents of himself as defender of the Italian nation. Italy's populist-in-chief will revel in a move that depicts the man of the people as being targeted by the establishment. This video can not be played How Italy's far right is hoping to cause a political earthquake And although eventual conviction could potentially end Matteo Salvini's political career, he won't be too worried for now. The wheels of justice move slowly in Italy: even if he were convicted, he'd have the right to two appeals, which could take years. And he'll take solace from his predecessor as Italy's lead populist, Silvio Berlusconi, who was convicted for fraud, his sentence then commuted - and returned as an Italian MEP. A political comeback, Italian-style. For years, some in Italy have complained that the country has taken in a large number of migrants fleeing across the Mediterranean, and has called for other EU nations to take their share. Mr Salvini in particular took a hard stance on migrant boats while he was in office, implementing a closed ports policy. This video can not be played Thousands of migrants are still losing their lives trying to reach Europe by boat On 25 July 2019, Italian coastguard ship the Gregoretti picked up about 140 migrants trying to travel to Italy from Libya. While the Gregoretti allowed several people off the ship for medical attention, some 116 people remained on board for days while Mr Salvini demanded other EU countries take them in. Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? Are migrants who cross the Channel sent back? The decision drew an immediate backlash. Prosecutors opened an investigation into conditions aboard after reports that migrants only had one toilet between them. After the Catholic Church and a number of states agreed to care for those on board, in a deal which then EU commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos helped to broker, Mr Salvini eventually consented to let them dock on 31 July.

The League leader insists the decision to keep the migrants offshore had the support of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and the rest of the government. But prosecutors believe he acted alone, ignoring repeated requests from Mr Conte to release them. Italy's Populist Five Star Movement - at the time in coalition with the League - had backed Mr Salvini in previous cases, such as when140 migrants on board the Diciotti vessel were not allowed to embark in Sicily for six daysin the summer of 2018. But the party says that in the case of the Gregoretti he acted alone. Later in February Mr Salvini also faces losing his immunity over another migrant case. He is accused of keepingthe Open Arms migrant vessel offshore for daysin August last year. At the time,Prime Minister Conte called Mr Salvini ""obsessed"" with keeping migrants outof Italy.

The volunteers putting themselves at risk,"Many of Wuhan's streets are deserted As Wuhan - the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak - remains under lockdown, groups of volunteers have stepped in to help by taking patients to hospital and acting as taxis for health workers who have no transport. The BBC spoke to one such volunteer, a man surnamed Zhou, who described how the network of volunteers emerged as normal life in the city shut down. Everything happened so suddenly. Life was normal until the lockdown and we were all caught off guard. At the beginning of the outbreak, the frontline health workers were working intensively from 06:00 to 23:00 and some of them don't have cars. Public transport has been stopped so sometimes they had to cycle for up to two hours to get to work. It's very tough in the winter. So people started to set up WeChat [a popular Chinese messaging app] groups to recruit and organise volunteers. China and the virus that threatens everything The Chinese doctor who tried to warn about coronavirus Car owners like me joined those groups and volunteered to ferry them about. My main jobs are to take medical staff to and from work and to deliver medical supplies to hospitals. We also deliver meals to them from restaurants that have been providing free food throughout the outbreak. Those who do venture out wear as much protective clothing as they can It's possible [that we are transporting infected people] because they are potentially exposed to the virus and may fall ill as well. But we do have guidelines: there are volunteers in the groups who are professionals and who have trained us how to protect ourselves. Super-spreaders: Why are they important? How worried should we be? They have also given us protective clothing. I used to just wear raincoats and goggles and two surgical masks, one on top of the other, when it had just started, but now I have a protective suit. I disinfect my car every time after I've dropped someone off, and when there's a gap between two assignments, I go home to have a shower and change my clothes. Sometimes I have three or four showers a day. This video can not be played Coronavirus quarantine: 'I haven't had freedom for a month' I'm doing it because I was born and bred in Wuhan and my family has lived here for three generations. I love this city, as simple as that. Also I think I'm cut out for this work because I'm on my own, I'm healthy and strong, and I have the ability. So I signed myself up. I think many people from Wuhan are like me, we're warm-hearted, and we're people with courage. In this difficult time, we have to unite and look after each other, so there's hope. Public transport in and out of Wuhan has been suspended It's an emergency situation that none of us expected. Yes, the local authorities were lacking resources at the beginning. For them, it was beyond their ability to deal with such a sudden outbreak. They had to ask for help from the central government and this takes time. So, ordinary people like us felt that we had a responsibility to do something to protect our people and our hometown, and to support the government while we're waiting for help. People are trying to be optimistic. And I believe we'll eventually get through this. Video shows medical staff and patients dancing at a makeshift hospital in Wuhan I've spoken to many doctors. They didn't have the right experience to deal with the emergency either. Some of them are very young - just starting their careers. It's true that there were limited resources at the beginning, a lack of masks and protective suits. Sometimes one protective suit had to be shared by many health workers, so they were under huge pressure. A&E doctor one of UK coronavirus cases Coronavirus disease named Covid-19 But the situation is gradually getting better and I think they have the basic supplies they need - much to their relief. Conference centres and other venues have been turned into makeshift medical centres Sometimes, when I pick them up in the middle of the night, I honestly think they're great; I have respect for them. They have their own families too, but they're putting patients first. So we should do something as well to support them. I think we should all do our best: if you can protect yourself well while helping  others, then do it. Otherwise, staying at home is also a form of support.

China and the virus that threatens everything,"A message written in the snow alongside the Tonghui river reads ""Goodbye Li Wenliang!"" On a cold Beijing morning, on an uninspiring, urban stretch of the Tonghui river, a lone figure could be seen writing giant Chinese characters in the snow. The message taking shape on the sloping concrete embankment was to a dead doctor. ""Goodbye Li Wenliang!"" it read, with the author using their own body to make the imprint of that final exclamation mark. Five weeks earlier, Dr Li had been punished by the police for trying to warn colleagues about the dangers of a strange new virus infecting patients in his hospital in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Now he'd succumbed to the illness himself and pictures of that frozen tribute spread fast on the Chinese internet, capturing in physical form a deep moment of national shock and anger. A worker in a Chinese factory wears a protective mask There's still a great deal we don't know about Covid-19,to give the disease caused by the virus its official name.Before it took its final fatal leap across the species barrier to infect its first human, it is likely to have been lurking inside the biochemistry of an - as yet unidentified - animal. That animal, probably infected after the virus made an earlier zoological jump from a bat, is thought to have been kept in a Wuhan market, where wildlife was traded illegally. Beyond that, the scientists trying to map its deadly trajectory from origin to epidemic can say little more with any certainty.

But while they continue their urgent, vital work to determine the speed at which it spreads and the risks it poses, one thing is beyond doubt. A month or so on from its discovery, Covid-19 has shaken Chinese society and politics to the core. That tiny piece of genetic material, measured in ten-thousandths of a millimetre, has set in train a humanitarian and economic catastrophe counted in more than 1,000 Chinese lives and tens of billions of Chinese yuan. It has closed off whole cities, placing an estimated 70 million residents in effective quarantine, shutting down transport links and restricting their ability to leave their homes. And it has exposed the limits of a political system for which social control is the highest value, breaching the rigid layers of censorship with a tsunami of grief and rage. The risk for the ruling elite is obvious. It can be seen in their response, ordering into action the military, the media and every level of government from the very top to the lowliest village committee. The consequences are now entirely dependent on questions no one knows the answers to; can they pull off the complex task of bringing a runaway epidemic under control, and if so, how long might it take? Across the world, people seem unsure how to respond to the small number of cases being detected in their own countries. The public mood can swing between panic - driven by the pictures of medical workers in hazmat suits - to complacency, brought on byheadlines that suggest the risk is no worse than flu,external. The evidence from China suggests that both responses are misguided. Seasonal flu may well have a low fatality rate, measured in fractions of 1%, but it's a problem because it affects so many people around the world. Why much of the 'world's factory' remains shut How worried should we be about Coronavirus? Your coronavirus questions answered The tiny proportion killed out of the many, many millions who catch it each year still numbers in the hundreds of thousands - individually tragic, collectively a major healthcare burden. Very early estimates suggested the new virus may be at least as deadly as flu - precisely why so much effort is now going into stopping it becoming another global pandemic. Butone new estimate suggests it could prove even deadlier yet,external, killing as many as 1% of those who contract it. For any individual, that risk is still relatively small, although it's worth noting such estimates are averages - just like flu, the risks fall more heavily on the elderly and already infirm. Despite the death toll, an increasing number of patients are recovering But China's experience of this epidemic demonstrates two things. Firstly, it offers a terrifying glimpse of the potential effect on a healthcare system when you scale up infections of this kind of virus across massive populations. Two new hospitals have had to be built in Wuhan in a matter of days, with beds for 2,600 patients, and giant stadiums and hotels are being used as quarantine centres, for almost 10,000 more. Despite these efforts, many have still struggled to find treatment, withreports of people dying at home, unregistered in the official figures. Secondly, it highlights the importance of taking the task of containing outbreaks of new viruses extremely seriously. The best approach, most experts agree, is one based on transparency and trust, with good public information and proportionate, timely government action. How can China build a hospital so quickly? Wuhan diary: Living alone in a city gone quiet But in an authoritarian system, with strict censorship and an emphasis on political stability above all else, transparency and trust are in short supply. This video can not be played Aerial time-lapse shows Wuhan hospital construction China's response may have sometimes looked like panic - withwhat's been called the ""biggest quarantine in history"",externalandharsh enforcement,externalagainst those who disobey. But those measures have become necessary only because its initial response looked like the very definition of complacency. There's ample evidence that the warning signs were missed by the authorities, and worse, ignored. By late December, medical staff in Wuhan were beginning to notice unusual symptoms of viral pneumonia, with a cluster linked to the market trading in illegal wildlife. On 30 December, Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist working in Wuhan's Central Hospital, posted his concerns in a private medical chat group, advising colleagues to take measures to protect themselves. He'd seen seven patients who appeared to be suffering with an illness similar to Sars - another coronavirus that began in an illegal Chinese wildlife market in 2002 and went on to kill 774 people worldwide. A few days later, he was summoned by the police. Dr Li was made to signa confession, denouncing the messages he'd posted as ""illegal behaviour"",external. The case received national media attention, with a high-profile state-run TV report announcing that in total, eight people in Wuhan were being investigated for ""spreading rumours"". The authorities, though, were well aware of the outbreak of illness. The day after Dr Li posted his message, China notified the World Health Organization, and the day after that, the suspected source - the market - was closed down. But despite the multiplying cases and the concerns among medics that human-to-human transmission was taking place, the authorities did little to protect the public.Doctors were already setting up quarantine rooms,externaland anticipating extra admissions when Wuhan held its important annual political gathering, the city's People's Congress. In their speeches, the Communist Party leaders made no mention of the virus. China's National Health Commissioncontinued to report that the number of infections was limited and that there was no clear evidence that the disease could spread between humans,external. And on 18 January the Wuhan authorities allowed a massive community banquet to take place, involving more than 40,000 families. The aim was to set a record for the most dishes served at an event. Two days later,China finally confirmed that human-to-human transmission was indeed taking place,external. Images from Chinese state TV show the large banquet in Wuhan Most remarkable of all perhaps, the following day, Wuhan held a Lunar New Year dance performance, attended by senior officials from across the surrounding province of Hubei. A state media report of the event, since hurriedly deleted butcaptured here,external, says the performers, some with runny noses and feeling unwell, ""overcame the fear of pneumonia... winning praise from the leaders"". By the time the national authorities had woken up to the impending disaster, and closed the city down on 23 January, it was too late - the epidemic was out of control. Before Wuhan's transport links were cut, an estimated five million people had left the city for the Lunar New Year break, travelling across China and the world. Some have begun calling the disaster""China's Chernobyl"",external. The parallels in failures to pass bad news up the chain of command and the incentives to put the short-term interests of political stability ahead of public safety, seem all too apparent. Li Wenliang, who'd gone back to work after being warned to keep quiet, soon discovered he'd also been infected. He died earlier this month, leaving a five-year-old son and a pregnant wife. The doctor who tried to warn others about coronavirus Anger was already simmering over the authorities' failure to issue timely warnings, with the crisis now being aired in full view.Wuhan's politicians were blaming senior officials,externalfor failing to authorise the release of the information; senior officials appeared to be preparing to hang Wuhan's politicians out to dry. But the death of a man, silenced for simply trying to protect his colleagues, burst open the dam with a wave of online fury directed not just at individuals, but at the system itself. So great was the public outrage, China's censors appeared unsure what to censor and what to let through. The hashtag #Iwantfreedomofspeech was viewed almost two million times before it was blocked. Aware of the tide of emotion, the Party began paying its own tributes to Dr Li. It quicklyhailed him a national hero,external. Doctor Li Wenliang tried to warn authorities about the new virus and died after contracting it China's rulers, untroubled by the inconveniences of the ballot box, have far deeper and older fears of what might sweep them from office. The wars, famines and diseases that shook the dynasties of old have given them their inheritance; an acute historical sense of the danger of the unforeseen crisis. They will also know well what Chernobyl did for the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party in the former USSR. ""It's impossible to know if Li Wenliang's death will serve as the catalyst for something bigger,"" Jude Blanchette, an expert on Chinese politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, tells me. ""But the raw emotion that surged when news of his condition broke indicates deep levels of frustration and anger exist within the country."" Precisely because it feels the weight of history, however, the Communist Party has made holding onto power a living obsession, and it has an ever more formidable domestic security apparatus to help it to do so. Over the past few decades it has proven nothing if not resilient, enduring through political chaos, devastating earthquakes and man-made disasters. But one sign that might hint at an awareness of just how great the current risks are comes in the role being played by China's President Xi Jinping. This week - for the first time since the crisis began - he ventured out to meet health workers involved in the fight, visiting a hospital and a virus control centre in Beijing. In contrast, his premier, Li Keqiang, has been sent to the front lines in Wuhan and appointed head of a special working group to tackle the epidemic. While it is common for the premier to be the face of reassurance during national disasters, some observers see another reason why Mr Xi might be wise to be seen to delegate. China's president has kept a low profile since the outbreak began ""Xi's absence from this crisis is yet another demonstration that he doesn't so much lead as he does command,"" Mr Blanchette says. ""He's clearly worried that this crisis will blow up in his face, and so he's pushed out underlings to be the public face of the CCP's response."" Already there are signs that the censorship is being ratcheted up once again, with Mr Xi ordering senior officials to ""strengthen the control over online media"". A few days ago, I spoke by phone to the lawyer and blogger, Chen Qiushi, who'd travelled to Wuhan in an attempt to provide independent reporting about the situation. Videos fromMr Chen,external, anda fellow activist, Fang Bin,external, have been widely watched, showing not the ranks of patriotic soldier-medics and the building of hospitals that fill state media coverage, but overcrowded waiting rooms and body bags. He told me he was unsure how long he'd be able to carry on. ""The censorship is very strict and people's accounts are being closed down if they share my content,"" he said. Mr Chen has since gone missing. Friends and family believe he's been forced into Wuhan's quarantine system, in an attempt to silence him. China's leaders now find their fate linked to thedaily charts of infection rates,external, published city by city, province by province. There are some signs that the extraordinary quarantine measures may be having an effect - outside of Hubei Province, the worst affected area, the number of new daily infections is falling. But with the need to try to restart the economy - all but frozen now for over a week - the country has begun a slow return to work. This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city Strict quarantine measures will remain in force in the worst affected areas, but workers from other parts of the country are trickling back to the cities, with the task of monitoring and managing their movements being handed to local neighbourhood committees. It will be a difficult balancing act. Too tough an approach risks further choking off business activity, commerce and travel in a consumer environment already suffocating under the deep psychological fear of contagion. Too lax, and any one of the many potential reservoirs of infection, now scattered across the country, could explode into another, separate epidemic. That would require further harsh action, knocking domestic confidence and prolonging the international border closures and flight restrictions put in place at such enormous economic cost. China is insisting that it is a fight well on the way to being won with ""unconquerable will"",externaland that lessons have been learned and ""shortcomings in preparedness"" identified. Questions about the systemic failings behind the disaster are dismissed as foreign ""prejudice"", as the propaganda machine cranks into overdrive, channelling the narrative and muting the criticisms. But the devastating scale and scope of China's world-threatening catastrophe have already revealed something important. The thousands who have lost family members, the millions living under the quarantine measures and the workers and businesses bearing the financial costs have been asking those difficult questions too. A tribute in snow to doctor Li Wenliang On the snowy banks of the Tonghui river, the giant tribute to Li Wenliang remains intact. When we visited, a few locals were taking photos and talking quietly to each other. A police car crawled slowly by. Soon, with the warming weather, the characters will be gone. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thousands facing days without water after storm,"Water tankers have been trying to keep supplies on Thousands of homes and businesses in Cumbria are facing days without water after a mains pipe was damaged during Storm Ciara on Sunday. A major incident was declared after the damaged pipe near Kendal threatened supplies to about 8,000 properties. United Utilities said many people would continue to be without water, despite millions of litres being pumped into the damaged system. The firm said ""horrendous"" weather conditions were hampering repairs. More on this and other Cumbria stories A large area of the county, including Appleby, Shap, Orton, Ravenstonedale, Ivegill, Low Braithwaite, Threlkeld and Glenridding is affected. United Utilities said it could be Thursday or Friday before the main was fixed, but stressed it would depend on weather conditions. Allow Twitter content?

Dr Martin Padley said the company had brought in extra equipment and tankers from the Midlands and Scotland. ""We're throwing absolutely everything we can at this problem but the weather is so bad that it's affecting our ability to even weld pipes,"" he said. The area normally uses about 11 million litres of water a day and engineers are pumping in seven million litres a day. ""So we have a shortfall of about four millions litres, so unfortunately people will see low pressure and ultimately no water at all,"" Dr Padley said. ""Even after we get the pipe fixed it will take time to refill what is a huge system."" Millions of litres are being pumped into the damaged water system Two GP practices - Shap Medical Practice and Glenridding Health Centre - cancelled appointments on Wednesday because of problems with their water supply. United Utilities said it was also in contact with 70 farmers in the affected area about getting supplies to livestock. Alan Fox, who runs the Troutbeck Inn, near Penrith, said he had been forced to close. He said: ""We've already had to turn guests away and we have people staying in our holiday cottages with no water. ""We're having to close tonight because without water people can't use toilets and we can't cook in the restaurant."" United Utilities said it had free water bottle stations across the area Louise Donnelly, head teacher at Morland Primary School, near Appleby, said: ""We won't be open today and probably not tomorrow either. ""Parents have been very supportive, but I understand this will cause them a headache."" Free bottled water is available for those affected at: Glenridding Village Hall, Penrith The Crown Inn, Ivegill Shap Memorial Hall, Shap Market Square, Kirkby Stephen Moot Hall, Boroughgate, Appleby-in-Westmorland Pooley Bridge Village Hall, Pooley Bridge Greystoke Village Greystoke Tebay Services (Northbound) United Utilities has issued a telephone number for those who are elderly, vulnerable or sick who are unable to get their own bottled water - it is 0345 672 3723.

EU Parliament makes tough demands for Brexit talks,"The UK officially left the EU on 31 January but until the end of 2020 they are following a Withdrawal Agreement The European Parliament has approved a tough opening position for talks with the UK on its future relationship with the EU. MEPs called on the UK to follow EU policies in a host of areas as the price for an ambitious free trade deal. These range from chemicals regulation to climate change, food labelling and subsidies for companies. This should be with ""a view to dynamic alignment"" - code for the UK adopting European rules as they are introduced. The wide-ranging resolution also called for measures to ensure that Brexit does not cause gender discrimination, for a crackdown on tax havens with links to the UK, and for a joint UK-EU position at the upcoming UN climate conference in Glasgow in November. It's an attempt to influence the detailed instructions for the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier - ""the mandate"" - currently being discussed by the European Commission and the governments of the EU's 27 member states. EU Commission boss seeks 'unique' UK trade deal What happens after Brexit? It's also the latest example of the mandate being toughened up as it passes from institution to institution in the EU. This video can not be played EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen says any deal would require obligations as well as rights When Mr Barnier published a first draft in early February, there was no mention of alignment and definitely not the automatic kind. Then a new version emerged that had been tweaked by diplomats from national governments. It had extra references to the need for a level playing field - commitments by the UK to fair economic competition to prevent European businesses being undercut by their British rivals. And those commitments would have to evolve over time. This video can not be played Chancellor: 'UK trade will be better outside EU' A reference to ""building on"" existing access to British waters for European fishing boats was upgraded to ""upholding"" it. The UK's participation in the Galileo satellite positioning system was downgraded from ""should"" to ""could."" And now MEPs have gone further than all of them. ""It means we can be bad cop,"" said a senior MEP from the European Parliament's new UK Co-ordination Group. ""Michel Barnier can say to London that he can't do certain things because the Parliament won't accept them."" That's a tactic Mr Barnier is virtually guaranteed to use. And he will have to take the European Parliament's views into account because it is likely to have a vote on whatever deal emerges from the talks with the UK. Border delays 'could cause fresh food problems' UK trade will thrive despite border checks - Javid MEPs were not willing to oppose the divorce deal, but will they be tougher when it's a free trade agreement that touches on Europe's values and social model? For now the focus is on agreeing the EU's opening position to be finalised at a meeting of European ministers on 25 February. This is about the ambitions at the start, not the compromises at the end. It's also about shaping the terms of the discussion with the UK before it's even begun. MEPs and the entire EU know: if you don't ask, you don't get. What happens after Brexit?

'Way too early' to predict end of coronavirus,"The WHO has said a vaccine will likely be found but it will take time Some 242 deaths from the new coronavirus were recorded in the Chinese province of Hubei on Wednesday, the deadliest day of the outbreak. There was also a huge increase in the number of cases, with 14,840 people diagnosed withCovid-19. Hubei has started using a broader definition to diagnose people, which accounts for most of the rise in cases. China sacked two top officials in Hubei province hours after the new figures were revealed. Until Wednesday's increases, the number of people with the virus in Hubei, where the outbreak emerged, was stabilising. But the new cases and deaths in the province have pushed the national death toll above 1,350 with almost 60,000 infections in total. Meanwhile Japan has announced its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s who lived in Kanagawa, south-west of Tokyo. It is the third death outside mainland China, following one each in the Philippines and Hong Kong. The woman's diagnosis was confirmed after her death and she had no obvious link to China's Hubei province, Japanese media reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is seeking ""further clarity"" from China about the changes to how cases of the virus are being confirmed. China has been accused of suppressing the full extent of the outbreak in the past, says the BBC's Nick Beake in Hong Kong. David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""What has happened in China is that they have changed the definition of what the disease really is - now they are taking people who have lesser symptoms. ""The deaths are quite worrisome, there is an increased number of deaths reported, but if you look overall at the total number of deaths and the total number of cases, the fatality ratio is about the same as it has been - but it is still high, as high as the death rate in influenza."" Only Hubei province - which accounts for more than 80% of overall Chinese infections - is using the new definition to diagnose new cases. Just about everyone who's been following China's official coronavirus numbers has been able to see that they have been incomplete. Government officials know this too. There's no way they've accounted for everybody infected. How could they? But at least we had what appeared to be a trend. We could observe the pattern to try and estimate the trajectory of outbreak. Now that's gone too. You can understand why it has been decided that people who have virus symptoms, plus a CT scan showing chest infection, are now being counted in the ""definitely infected"" column. However, this has thrown the trend mapping into chaos. Over the past 24 hours in Hubei alone, nearly 15,000 people were moved into the infected column. This would have sent shockwaves around the world, but actually, if you consider Wednesday's cases by the old definition, the rate could well mean another day of decline: a completely different picture. So now, we're scratching our heads: do we start looking at the pattern all over again from Thursday onwards? This has also left many wondering what the real death rate must have been over recent weeks and the extent to which we should be treating the overall figures seriously anyway. Meanwhile, the Communist Party secretary in Hubei, Jiang Chaoliang, has been replaced by the Shanghai party chief, Ying Yong, according to state media. The party chief of the capital city, Wuhan, has also been relieved of his duties. It is the first major change of Hubei party officials since the outbreak began. Earlier this week, a number of health officials were""removed"" from their jobs. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? Why a global city is so vulnerable to virus spread The Valentine messages to coronavirus medics The province now includes ""clinically diagnosed cases"" in the number of confirmed cases. This means it includes those showing symptoms, and having a CT scan showing an infected lung, rather than relying only on the standard nucleic acid tests. Of the 242 new deaths in Wuhan, 135 are such ""clinically diagnosed"" cases. That means, even without the new definition, the number of deaths in Hubei on Wednesday was 107 - a new high for the province. The province's 14,840 new infections include 13,332 clinically diagnosed cases. Overall, the province now has 48,206 confirmed infections. A cruise ship carrying more than 2,000 people has docked in Cambodia after it was turned away by five ports over fears that some passengers might be infected with the virus. The MS Westerdam arrived on Thursday morning after Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand had all refused to accept the ship despite having no sick patients on board. Cruise ship rejected by five ports docks at last Are cruise ships really 'floating petri dishes'? Meanwhile, another 44 cases have been confirmed on the Diamond Princess, which is in quarantine in Yokohama, Japan. The increase means 218 people of the 3,700 people on board the ship have caught the virus. Not everyone has been tested yet. People with the virus are taken to hospitals on land to be treated, while those on board are largely confined to their cabins. However on Thursday Japan said it would allow those aged 80 or over who have tested negative for the coronavirus to disembark. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said they could be allowed off the ship as early as Friday but would have to stay in accommodation provided by the government, the Japan Times reported.

The virus threatening China,"A message written in the snow alongside the Tonghui river reads ""Goodbye Li Wenliang!"" On a cold Beijing morning, on an uninspiring, urban stretch of the Tonghui river, a lone figure could be seen writing giant Chinese characters in the snow. The message taking shape on the sloping concrete embankment was to a dead doctor. ""Goodbye Li Wenliang!"" it read, with the author using their own body to make the imprint of that final exclamation mark. Five weeks earlier, Dr Li had been punished by the police for trying to warn colleagues about the dangers of a strange new virus infecting patients in his hospital in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Now he'd succumbed to the illness himself and pictures of that frozen tribute spread fast on the Chinese internet, capturing in physical form a deep moment of national shock and anger. A worker in a Chinese factory wears a protective mask There's still a great deal we don't know about Covid-19,to give the disease caused by the virus its official name.Before it took its final fatal leap across the species barrier to infect its first human, it is likely to have been lurking inside the biochemistry of an - as yet unidentified - animal. That animal, probably infected after the virus made an earlier zoological jump from a bat, is thought to have been kept in a Wuhan market, where wildlife was traded illegally. Beyond that, the scientists trying to map its deadly trajectory from origin to epidemic can say little more with any certainty.

Firstly, it offers a terrifying glimpse of the potential effect on a healthcare system when you scale up infections of this kind of virus across massive populations. Two new hospitals have had to be built in Wuhan in a matter of days, with beds for 2,600 patients, and giant stadiums and hotels are being used as quarantine centres, for almost 10,000 more. Despite these efforts, many have still struggled to find treatment, withreports of people dying at home, unregistered in the official figures. Secondly, it highlights the importance of taking the task of containing outbreaks of new viruses extremely seriously. The best approach, most experts agree, is one based on transparency and trust, with good public information and proportionate, timely government action. How can China build a hospital so quickly? Wuhan diary: Living alone in a city gone quiet But in an authoritarian system, with strict censorship and an emphasis on political stability above all else, transparency and trust are in short supply. This video can not be played Aerial time-lapse shows Wuhan hospital construction China's response may have sometimes looked like panic - withwhat's been called the ""biggest quarantine in history"",externalandharsh enforcement,externalagainst those who disobey. But those measures have become necessary only because its initial response looked like the very definition of complacency. There's ample evidence that the warning signs were missed by the authorities, and worse, ignored. By late December, medical staff in Wuhan were beginning to notice unusual symptoms of viral pneumonia, with a cluster linked to the market trading in illegal wildlife. On 30 December, Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist working in Wuhan's Central Hospital, posted his concerns in a private medical chat group, advising colleagues to take measures to protect themselves. He'd seen seven patients who appeared to be suffering with an illness similar to Sars - another coronavirus that began in an illegal Chinese wildlife market in 2002 and went on to kill 774 people worldwide. A few days later, he was summoned by the police. Dr Li was made to signa confession, denouncing the messages he'd posted as ""illegal behaviour"",external. The case received national media attention, with a high-profile state-run TV report announcing that in total, eight people in Wuhan were being investigated for ""spreading rumours"". The authorities, though, were well aware of the outbreak of illness. The day after Dr Li posted his message, China notified the World Health Organization, and the day after that, the suspected source - the market - was closed down. But despite the multiplying cases and the concerns among medics that human-to-human transmission was taking place, the authorities did little to protect the public.Doctors were already setting up quarantine rooms,externaland anticipating extra admissions when Wuhan held its important annual political gathering, the city's People's Congress. In their speeches, the Communist Party leaders made no mention of the virus. China's National Health Commissioncontinued to report that the number of infections was limited and that there was no clear evidence that the disease could spread between humans,external. And on 18 January the Wuhan authorities allowed a massive community banquet to take place, involving more than 40,000 families. The aim was to set a record for the most dishes served at an event. Two days later,China finally confirmed that human-to-human transmission was indeed taking place,external. Images from Chinese state TV show the large banquet in Wuhan Most remarkable of all perhaps, the following day, Wuhan held a Lunar New Year dance performance, attended by senior officials from across the surrounding province of Hubei. A state media report of the event, since hurriedly deleted butcaptured here,external, says the performers, some with runny noses and feeling unwell, ""overcame the fear of pneumonia... winning praise from the leaders"". By the time the national authorities had woken up to the impending disaster, and closed the city down on 23 January, it was too late - the epidemic was out of control. Before Wuhan's transport links were cut, an estimated five million people had left the city for the Lunar New Year break, travelling across China and the world. Some have begun calling the disaster""China's Chernobyl"",external. The parallels in failures to pass bad news up the chain of command and the incentives to put the short-term interests of political stability ahead of public safety, seem all too apparent. Li Wenliang, who'd gone back to work after being warned to keep quiet, soon discovered he'd also been infected. He died earlier this month, leaving a five-year-old son and a pregnant wife. The doctor who tried to warn others about coronavirus Anger was already simmering over the authorities' failure to issue timely warnings, with the crisis now being aired in full view.Wuhan's politicians were blaming senior officials,externalfor failing to authorise the release of the information; senior officials appeared to be preparing to hang Wuhan's politicians out to dry. But the death of a man, silenced for simply trying to protect his colleagues, burst open the dam with a wave of online fury directed not just at individuals, but at the system itself. So great was the public outrage, China's censors appeared unsure what to censor and what to let through. The hashtag #Iwantfreedomofspeech was viewed almost two million times before it was blocked. Aware of the tide of emotion, the Party began paying its own tributes to Dr Li. It quicklyhailed him a national hero,external. Doctor Li Wenliang tried to warn authorities about the new virus and died after contracting it China's rulers, untroubled by the inconveniences of the ballot box, have far deeper and older fears of what might sweep them from office. The wars, famines and diseases that shook the dynasties of old have given them their inheritance; an acute historical sense of the danger of the unforeseen crisis. They will also know well what Chernobyl did for the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party in the former USSR. ""It's impossible to know if Li Wenliang's death will serve as the catalyst for something bigger,"" Jude Blanchette, an expert on Chinese politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, tells me. ""But the raw emotion that surged when news of his condition broke indicates deep levels of frustration and anger exist within the country."" Precisely because it feels the weight of history, however, the Communist Party has made holding onto power a living obsession, and it has an ever more formidable domestic security apparatus to help it to do so. Over the past few decades it has proven nothing if not resilient, enduring through political chaos, devastating earthquakes and man-made disasters. But one sign that might hint at an awareness of just how great the current risks are comes in the role being played by China's President Xi Jinping. This week - for the first time since the crisis began - he ventured out to meet health workers involved in the fight, visiting a hospital and a virus control centre in Beijing. In contrast, his premier, Li Keqiang, has been sent to the front lines in Wuhan and appointed head of a special working group to tackle the epidemic. While it is common for the premier to be the face of reassurance during national disasters, some observers see another reason why Mr Xi might be wise to be seen to delegate. China's president has kept a low profile since the outbreak began ""Xi's absence from this crisis is yet another demonstration that he doesn't so much lead as he does command,"" Mr Blanchette says. ""He's clearly worried that this crisis will blow up in his face, and so he's pushed out underlings to be the public face of the CCP's response."" Already there are signs that the censorship is being ratcheted up once again, with Mr Xi ordering senior officials to ""strengthen the control over online media"". A few days ago, I spoke by phone to the lawyer and blogger, Chen Qiushi, who'd travelled to Wuhan in an attempt to provide independent reporting about the situation. Videos fromMr Chen,external, anda fellow activist, Fang Bin,external, have been widely watched, showing not the ranks of patriotic soldier-medics and the building of hospitals that fill state media coverage, but overcrowded waiting rooms and body bags. He told me he was unsure how long he'd be able to carry on. ""The censorship is very strict and people's accounts are being closed down if they share my content,"" he said. Mr Chen has since gone missing. Friends and family believe he's been forced into Wuhan's quarantine system, in an attempt to silence him. China's leaders now find their fate linked to thedaily charts of infection rates,external, published city by city, province by province. There are some signs that the extraordinary quarantine measures may be having an effect - outside of Hubei Province, the worst affected area, the number of new daily infections is falling. But with the need to try to restart the economy - all but frozen now for over a week - the country has begun a slow return to work. This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city Strict quarantine measures will remain in force in the worst affected areas, but workers from other parts of the country are trickling back to the cities, with the task of monitoring and managing their movements being handed to local neighbourhood committees. It will be a difficult balancing act. Too tough an approach risks further choking off business activity, commerce and travel in a consumer environment already suffocating under the deep psychological fear of contagion. Too lax, and any one of the many potential reservoirs of infection, now scattered across the country, could explode into another, separate epidemic. That would require further harsh action, knocking domestic confidence and prolonging the international border closures and flight restrictions put in place at such enormous economic cost. China is insisting that it is a fight well on the way to being won with ""unconquerable will"",externaland that lessons have been learned and ""shortcomings in preparedness"" identified. Questions about the systemic failings behind the disaster are dismissed as foreign ""prejudice"", as the propaganda machine cranks into overdrive, channelling the narrative and muting the criticisms. But the devastating scale and scope of China's world-threatening catastrophe have already revealed something important. The thousands who have lost family members, the millions living under the quarantine measures and the workers and businesses bearing the financial costs have been asking those difficult questions too. A tribute in snow to doctor Li Wenliang On the snowy banks of the Tonghui river, the giant tribute to Li Wenliang remains intact. When we visited, a few locals were taking photos and talking quietly to each other. A police car crawled slowly by. Soon, with the warming weather, the characters will be gone. Â© 2025 BBC.

'Coughing makes me nervous',"A GP practice in Brighton is temporarily closed after a staff member tested positive for coronavirus Five of the eight confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK have been linked to Brighton. But while authorities have told people to carry on their daily routines, on the streets uncertainty is building. Steve Walsh, a businessman from Hove who recently returned from Singapore, is thought to have infected 11 people - five of whom live in the city. A Brighton GP and an A&E doctor at nearby Worthing, West Sussex, are among those already identified as carriers. Brighton Council said residents shouldn't panic, but Maddy Lewis, 19, a student at Brighton University, said she was ""really worried"" by the latest developments. ""I've been over-thinking it. I was planning on not coming out today,"" she said, adding that she had ordered some masks which were ""turning up tomorrow"". She said she would be wearing them when she went home to Suffolk to see her family as she didn't want to pass the virus on to them if she had it. Student Maddy Lewis (right) said she was worried about taking the virus home to Suffolk ""It's a two week incubation period. How do I know if I have got it or not?"" she said. Her friend Alex Fitzgerald-Starr, also 19, laughed at this suggestion.  She said she was ""pretty chilled"" about it all but said she was worried it might have ""got into to the university"". The University of Sussex has confirmed a student that had recently returned from overseas had been admitted to hospital for tests.  The results are not yet known. Alex said that while the pair were at Brighton University, ""we all socialise together"". ""We live in large halls of residence. Get on the same buses. Come into town. It would spread so easily,"" she said. How worried should we be? A visual guide to the coronavirus outbreak Can the virus be transmitted by door handles? And other questions Cassidy Seaborne, from Whitehawk, in Brighton, was out with her one-year-old daughter in a buggy. ""I want to put a mask on her,"" she said. Ms Seaborne said she was ""scared"" by reports the virus had a worse effect on ""people with low immune systems or young children"", and she really just wanted to stay at home. ""If someone coughs, it makes me nervous,"" she said, adding that she had seen ""about five people in masks on one bus"" in one day. Cassidy Seaborne was ""scared"" for her one-year-old daughter In contrast, Frank Hayden, 45, from Eastbourne, who works at Timpson's in Brighton, shrugged off such concerns. ""I'm not bothered.  I come into contact with the general public on a daily basis. It's just like the flu, isn't it? I'm not one for scare-mongering,"" he said. However, he said he didn't ""watch the news or read much"". ""If I catch it, I'd just do what I'm told to do, self-isolate,"" he said. Shop-worker Frank Hayden said he was ""not bothered"" Meanwhile, parents of pupils at Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School in Brighton were told two people from the school have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate for 14 days after coming into contact with a coronavirus case. Parents were told: ""If you wish to keep your child off of school at this time, then we will authorise this absence."" Journalist Sarah Lewis has a daughter at Cottesmore.  She said she ""initially had a moment"" when she got the message, but was ""trying not to panic"". She said: ""Judging by my Whatsapp groups, a lot of people are choosing to keep their children at home."" But she would be sending her daughter to school on Wednesday and was reassured that the school was being informative and taking action. ""They have done a lot of work with the children on prevention, even before today, with hand-washing and so on,"" she said. ""The head teacher is lovely - a mum herself, and very careful.""

'Extreme caution' urged over China virus slowdown,"The WHO has said a vaccine will likely be found but it will take time Some 242 deaths from the new coronavirus were recorded in the Chinese province of Hubei on Wednesday, the deadliest day of the outbreak. There was also a huge increase in the number of cases, with 14,840 people diagnosed withCovid-19. Hubei has started using a broader definition to diagnose people, which accounts for most of the rise in cases. China sacked two top officials in Hubei province hours after the new figures were revealed. Until Wednesday's increases, the number of people with the virus in Hubei, where the outbreak emerged, was stabilising. But the new cases and deaths in the province have pushed the national death toll above 1,350 with almost 60,000 infections in total. Meanwhile Japan has announced its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s who lived in Kanagawa, south-west of Tokyo. It is the third death outside mainland China, following one each in the Philippines and Hong Kong. The woman's diagnosis was confirmed after her death and she had no obvious link to China's Hubei province, Japanese media reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is seeking ""further clarity"" from China about the changes to how cases of the virus are being confirmed. China has been accused of suppressing the full extent of the outbreak in the past, says the BBC's Nick Beake in Hong Kong. David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""What has happened in China is that they have changed the definition of what the disease really is - now they are taking people who have lesser symptoms. ""The deaths are quite worrisome, there is an increased number of deaths reported, but if you look overall at the total number of deaths and the total number of cases, the fatality ratio is about the same as it has been - but it is still high, as high as the death rate in influenza."" Only Hubei province - which accounts for more than 80% of overall Chinese infections - is using the new definition to diagnose new cases. Just about everyone who's been following China's official coronavirus numbers has been able to see that they have been incomplete. Government officials know this too. There's no way they've accounted for everybody infected. How could they? But at least we had what appeared to be a trend. We could observe the pattern to try and estimate the trajectory of outbreak. Now that's gone too. You can understand why it has been decided that people who have virus symptoms, plus a CT scan showing chest infection, are now being counted in the ""definitely infected"" column. However, this has thrown the trend mapping into chaos. Over the past 24 hours in Hubei alone, nearly 15,000 people were moved into the infected column. This would have sent shockwaves around the world, but actually, if you consider Wednesday's cases by the old definition, the rate could well mean another day of decline: a completely different picture. So now, we're scratching our heads: do we start looking at the pattern all over again from Thursday onwards? This has also left many wondering what the real death rate must have been over recent weeks and the extent to which we should be treating the overall figures seriously anyway. Meanwhile, the Communist Party secretary in Hubei, Jiang Chaoliang, has been replaced by the Shanghai party chief, Ying Yong, according to state media. The party chief of the capital city, Wuhan, has also been relieved of his duties. It is the first major change of Hubei party officials since the outbreak began. Earlier this week, a number of health officials were""removed"" from their jobs. What are the symptoms of coronavirus? Why a global city is so vulnerable to virus spread The Valentine messages to coronavirus medics The province now includes ""clinically diagnosed cases"" in the number of confirmed cases. This means it includes those showing symptoms, and having a CT scan showing an infected lung, rather than relying only on the standard nucleic acid tests. Of the 242 new deaths in Wuhan, 135 are such ""clinically diagnosed"" cases. That means, even without the new definition, the number of deaths in Hubei on Wednesday was 107 - a new high for the province. The province's 14,840 new infections include 13,332 clinically diagnosed cases. Overall, the province now has 48,206 confirmed infections. A cruise ship carrying more than 2,000 people has docked in Cambodia after it was turned away by five ports over fears that some passengers might be infected with the virus. The MS Westerdam arrived on Thursday morning after Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand had all refused to accept the ship despite having no sick patients on board. Cruise ship rejected by five ports docks at last Are cruise ships really 'floating petri dishes'? Meanwhile, another 44 cases have been confirmed on the Diamond Princess, which is in quarantine in Yokohama, Japan. The increase means 218 people of the 3,700 people on board the ship have caught the virus. Not everyone has been tested yet. People with the virus are taken to hospitals on land to be treated, while those on board are largely confined to their cabins. However on Thursday Japan said it would allow those aged 80 or over who have tested negative for the coronavirus to disembark. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said they could be allowed off the ship as early as Friday but would have to stay in accommodation provided by the government, the Japan Times reported. This video can not be played The Westerdam was finally able to dock in Sihanoukville, Cambodia In the UK, officials are attempting to trace the contacts of the latest person to be diagnosed with coronavirus.

"Businessman pays Â£15,000 towards PM's holiday","Mr Johnson took a holiday on the island of Mustique with partner Carrie Symonds after Christmas Labour has called on Boris Johnson to clarify who paid for his Caribbean holiday over the New Year. According to theMPs' register of interests,,externalthe accommodation - has a ""value"" of Â£15,000 - and was covered by David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse. A spokesman for Mr Ross said the register ""is correct"" and he ""facilitated accommodation"" for the PM. Downing Street said the trip had been properly registered. The register also shows earnings Mr Johnson received last year before becoming PM, including more than Â£327,000 for seven speaking engagements, one of which was a three-hour speech where he was paid Â£122,899.74. The prime minister took the holiday to St Vincent and the Grenadines with girlfriend Carrie Symonds between Boxing Day 2019 and 5 January 2020. Labour's shadow minister for the cabinet office, Jon Trickett, said Mr Johnson ""must come clean"" about the holiday accommodation, adding that if he does not, Parliament's standards watchdog ""should step in"". ""The public deserves to know who is paying for their prime minister's jaunts,"" Mr Trickett added. The entry in Mr Johnson's register of interests says Mr Ross donated accommodation ""for a private holiday for my partner and me, value Â£15,000"". But a spokesman for Mr Rosstold the Daily Mail:,external""Boris wanted some help to find somewhere in Mustique, David called the company who run all the villas and somebody had dropped out. ""So Boris got the use of a villa that was worth Â£15,000, but David Ross did not pay any monies whatsoever for this."" A later statement from the spokesman added: ""Mr Ross facilitated accommodation for Mr Johnson on Mustique valued at Â£15,000. ""Therefore this is a benefit in kind from Mr Ross to Mr Johnson, and Mr Johnson's declaration to the House of Commons is correct."" Mr Ross has not provided any further details as to what he means, in this context, by a 'benefit in kind.' But sources in Westminster have suggested to me that this could refer to some sort of swap whereby David Ross agreed to give up his property - at a later date - in order to facilitate the prime minister's stay elsewhere on the island. And that there was no kind of cash donation. David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, at a photography exhibition in 2011 Mr Ross was one of Mr Johnson's aides in City Hall and was appointed to the Olympics organising committee. But he resigned from the roles, and his company, over a share scandal in 2008. It emerged Mr Ross had used millions of pounds' worth of Carphone Warehouse shares as collateral against personal loans without informing the company's other directors - a potential breach of City rules at the time. Mr Ross has been a long-standing donor to the Conservative Party, pledging Â£250,000 in the last election campaign. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""All transparency requirements have been followed, as set out in the Register of Members' Financial Interests"". Brexit will mark 'new chapter' for UK, says PM Conservatives ahead in race for donations Carphone's Ross quits Olympic role,external Mr Johnson faced criticism over his holiday for not returning sooner,after the US killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimaniraised tensions in the Middle East. It is the first trip abroad that Mr Johnson has declared since going to Saudi Arabia in September 2018. Only one other MP has declared a free holiday in the last year. Mr Johnson also declared payments he had received prior to becoming prime minister, including book royalties and hundreds of thousands of pounds for speaking engagements. In the first six months of 2019, Mr Johnson earned more than Â£327,000 for the seven speaking engagements, which lasted a total of 17.5 hours. He was also paid Â£22,916.66 a month for his column in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, which was published weekly.

Food giant to stop advertising ice cream to kids,"Food giant Unilever has vowed to stop marketing its products to children in order to tackle rising obesity rates. The firm, which owns brands such as Twister ice cream and Popsicle ice lollies, said it would limit the use of cartoon characters in its advertising. It also promised to stop using social media stars or celebrities ""who primarily appeal"" to children under 12. Ads for Unilever ice creams have been pulled in the past over complaints they marketed unhealthy food to children. The new rules,externalwill apply to all of the firm's products by the end of 2020, kicking off with its Wall's ice cream brands. Wall's will also launch a range of ""responsibly made"" products for children that contain ""no more than 110 calories and a maximum of 12g of sugar per portion"". Wall's brands popular with children include Max, Paddle Pop and Twister. ""Our promise is a genuine commitment to make and market products to children responsibly,"" said Matt Close, executive vice president of the firm's global ice cream business. Allow Twitter content?

Sexual assault claims 'gagged' by universities,"UK universities are using ""gagging"" clauses to stop students from going public with complaints of sexual assault, bullying and poor teaching. Students said they felt pressured to sign non-disclosure agreements and one was told she would be expelled if she broke her contract. Nearly a third of universities have used NDAs for student grievances since 2016, data obtained by BBC News shows. Universities UK said NDAs should not be used to silence students. Non-disclosure agreements, which were designed to protect business secrets, are legal contracts that stop people from sharing private information. What are non-disclosure agreements? UK universities in 'gagging order' row Sexual harassment claims 'should not be silenced' NDAs were also used in settling complaints of false advertising of courses, lack of disability support and accommodation issues, according to the data obtained under Freedom of Information laws byThe Next Episodepodcast. The government said it was ""unacceptable"" to use NDAs for student complaints and it is legislating to stop such agreements being misused across all areas of society.  300used since 2016 to resolve student complaints 45universities Â£1.3mpaid out Â£250-Â£40,000individual payout amounts Charlotte - not her real name - said she reported being sexually assaulted by another student while an undergraduate at the University of West London (UWL). She reported it to the university and the police. Officers interviewed the arts student for five hours before telling her that there was not enough physical evidence to prosecute because she had ""blacked out"". Charlotte said she was ""plunged into emotional chaos"" and overdosed shortly afterwards. She took three weeks sick leave to recover, but felt unsupported when she returned to university and her academic work suffered. This video can not be played ""They essentially said you make any more of a fuss, or even cry, you're out"" Charlotte said a staff member thanked her in a private meeting for not ruining her alleged attacker's life. They later said she would be expelled if she made a fuss, she added. ""They literally thanked me,"" she said. ""I can't believe someone would say that when it happened to me. Not him."" In a recording, shared with BBC News, staff can also be heard telling her classmates she had ""got herself into a very bad place"" and discouraging them from contacting her. ""It was hell on earth,"" Charlotte said. ""How they treated me was worse than the assault itself. I felt so alone."" NDAs: Why do non-disclosure agreements matter? She submitted a formal complaint and took legal action, after which she received Â£1,000 in compensation. As part of the settlement, she signed an NDA preventing her from discussing the terms. The University of West London said it disputed the allegations and had provided Charlotte with all the support it could, adding that it could not comment further because of its confidentiality duties. In a statement, it said it had reviewed its policies in light of national recommendations for responding to sexual harassment in universities, adding: ""We have implemented those and have a team of staff who are trained to support students who find themselves the victim of sexual assault."" Olivia signed an agreement that says she will be ""expelled"" if she talks publicly about her allegations Olivia, a student at a different university, says she was violently sexually assaulted by a fellow student during her undergraduate degree and reported the attack to police, but the case was dropped because of insufficient evidence. As a result of the decision by police, her university refused to investigate, according to documents seen by BBC News. Following the attack, Olivia signed an agreement that says she will be ""expelled"" if she talks or posts publicly about her allegations or the university's safeguarding procedures. Olivia, also not her real name, says she signed the document because she was afraid for her safety and it contained an agreement that prevented her attacker from contacting her, but she feels it does not go far enough. She was not offered any money or given any legal advice before signing it. Her university has also threatened to sue her if she speaks out, she claims. ""It terrified me,"" she said. ""They told me to not tell my parents, to not tell my friends, to basically just be quiet about itâ¦ it made it feel like it was my fault."" Georgina Calvert-Lee, a lawyer specialising in sexual assault cases, said most uses of NDAs on students with these types of allegations were ""unethical"" and likely to be legally unenforceable. Tiziana Scaramuzza, now 36, a former PhD student, was paid by Oriel College, Oxford, to support student welfare alongside her law degree in 2013. She says she repeatedly raised concerns with senior staff about what she thought were failures in suicide prevention measures and about alleged breaches of confidentiality when supporting at risk students. She told the BBC a staff member had been discouraging depressed students from going to the doctor in favour of one-on-one support sessions with them, despite not being qualified to do so. ""I was bullied into keeping quiet and all my concerns were dismissed or shouted down,"" she said. ""They treated me like dirt."" After Tiziana submitted suggestions to improve safeguarding measures, Oriel college offered her a Â£5,000 settlement with an NDA to sever ties, which she accepted. ""It was completely inappropriate,"" she said.  ""They treated me like an inconvenience, like I was the problem, instead of dealing with the problem. ""Once I moved to a different college to finish my PhD, I learnt they hadn't made any changes, which was concerning because a lot of students were vulnerable."" Oriel College said it could not comment on Ms Scaramuzza's claims but confirmed that a ""thorough investigation"" into welfare provision in 2013 had been conducted. It added: ""The college takes the welfare of students and staff very seriously. We currently have several members of staff, external doctors and counsellors providing welfare support."" BBC News sent Freedom of Information requests to almost all of the UK's universities asking how many students had signed non-disclosure agreements in the past four years after bringing a complaint and how much, if any, money had been paid out. All but two of the 136 universities contacted responded, with varying degrees of transparency owing to data protection concerns or claims of confidentiality. Of these, 45 universities said they had used NDAs but not all of them disclosed full details, meaning it is hard to determine the true scale and this is an underestimate. The data shows about 300 students have signed NDAs after complaints since 2016, with the total cost paid out being more than Â£1.3m - equivalent to about 50 undergraduate degrees. Individual payouts ranged from Â£250 to nearly Â£40,000. However, the data also showed not every student who filed a complaint received a payout - sometimes just an NDA - and it is not clear why this is. It comes after theBBC found universities had spent Â£87m on pay-offs with staff since 2017. The student complaints regulator, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, said the use of NDAs was ""not appropriate"" and advised against the practice. It receives more than 1,500 complaints a year and said it was important grievances were ""handled fairly and transparently"" so universities learnt from them. In a statement, the government said: ""Harassment of any sort is abhorrent and higher education providers have a responsibility to ensure they provide a safe and inclusive environment."" Universities UK, which represents 136 institutions, added: ""Every student should feel safe and supported through their time at university and this includes feeling empowered to speak out if they have concerns.""

'Someone coughing makes me nervous',"A GP practice in Brighton is temporarily closed after a staff member tested positive for coronavirus Five of the eight confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK have been linked to Brighton. But while authorities have told people to carry on their daily routines, on the streets uncertainty is building. Steve Walsh, a businessman from Hove who recently returned from Singapore, is thought to have infected 11 people - five of whom live in the city. A Brighton GP and an A&E doctor at nearby Worthing, West Sussex, are among those already identified as carriers. Brighton Council said residents shouldn't panic, but Maddy Lewis, 19, a student at Brighton University, said she was ""really worried"" by the latest developments. ""I've been over-thinking it. I was planning on not coming out today,"" she said, adding that she had ordered some masks which were ""turning up tomorrow"". She said she would be wearing them when she went home to Suffolk to see her family as she didn't want to pass the virus on to them if she had it. Student Maddy Lewis (right) said she was worried about taking the virus home to Suffolk ""It's a two week incubation period. How do I know if I have got it or not?"" she said. Her friend Alex Fitzgerald-Starr, also 19, laughed at this suggestion.  She said she was ""pretty chilled"" about it all but said she was worried it might have ""got into to the university"". The University of Sussex has confirmed a student that had recently returned from overseas had been admitted to hospital for tests.  The results are not yet known. Alex said that while the pair were at Brighton University, ""we all socialise together"". ""We live in large halls of residence. Get on the same buses. Come into town. It would spread so easily,"" she said. How worried should we be? A visual guide to the coronavirus outbreak Can the virus be transmitted by door handles? And other questions Cassidy Seaborne, from Whitehawk, in Brighton, was out with her one-year-old daughter in a buggy. ""I want to put a mask on her,"" she said. Ms Seaborne said she was ""scared"" by reports the virus had a worse effect on ""people with low immune systems or young children"", and she really just wanted to stay at home. ""If someone coughs, it makes me nervous,"" she said, adding that she had seen ""about five people in masks on one bus"" in one day. Cassidy Seaborne was ""scared"" for her one-year-old daughter In contrast, Frank Hayden, 45, from Eastbourne, who works at Timpson's in Brighton, shrugged off such concerns. ""I'm not bothered.  I come into contact with the general public on a daily basis. It's just like the flu, isn't it? I'm not one for scare-mongering,"" he said. However, he said he didn't ""watch the news or read much"". ""If I catch it, I'd just do what I'm told to do, self-isolate,"" he said. Shop-worker Frank Hayden said he was ""not bothered"" Meanwhile, parents of pupils at Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School in Brighton were told two people from the school have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate for 14 days after coming into contact with a coronavirus case. Parents were told: ""If you wish to keep your child off of school at this time, then we will authorise this absence."" Journalist Sarah Lewis has a daughter at Cottesmore.  She said she ""initially had a moment"" when she got the message, but was ""trying not to panic"". She said: ""Judging by my Whatsapp groups, a lot of people are choosing to keep their children at home."" But she would be sending her daughter to school on Wednesday and was reassured that the school was being informative and taking action. ""They have done a lot of work with the children on prevention, even before today, with hand-washing and so on,"" she said. ""The head teacher is lovely - a mum herself, and very careful.""

Petrol and diesel car ban 'could start in 12 years',"The UK's planned ban on sales of new petrol, diesel or hybrid cars could start as early as 2032, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. Last week, the government sparked industry concern after bringing the date forward from 2040 to 2035 in a bid to hit zero-carbon emission targets. But Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 5 live it would happen by 2035, ""or even 2032,"" adding there would be consultation. The SMMT car trade body had previously said the 2035 figure was ""concerning"". The government is setting out its proposals in the run-up toa United Nations climate summit in November. How will the petrol and diesel car ban work? The summit, known as COP26, is being hosted in Glasgow. It is an annual UN-led gathering set up to assess progress on tackling climate change. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who announced the 2035 date, said at the time thatthe ban would come even earlier if possible. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We are consulting on a range of possible dates to bring forward the end to the sale of petrol and diesel cars and vans. ""The consultation proposal for this is 2035 - or earlier if a faster transition appears feasible - as well as including hybrids for the first time."" The UK has set a target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050. Experts warned thatthe original target date of 2040would still leave old conventional cars on the roads 10 years later. Once the ban comes into effect, only electric or hydrogen cars and vans will be available. Hybrid vehicles are now included in the proposals, which were originally announced in July 2017. Despite this, RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: ""While the government appears to be constantly moving the goalposts forward for ending the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles, drivers should not be worried about opting for a plug-in hybrid now. ""They are potentially the perfect stepping stone for those who want to go electric, but who have concerns about range, as they aren't as expensive as a battery electric vehicle.  At the moment, they give drivers the best of both worlds."" The Scottish government does not have the power to ban new petrol and diesel cars but has alreadypledged to ""phase out the need""for them by 2032 with measures such as an expansion of the charging network for electric cars. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it was not commenting for the moment. Last week, after the ban was brought forward to 2035, SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said the move was ""extremely concerning"". He said: ""Manufacturers are fully invested in a zero emissions future... However, with current demand for this still expensive technology still just a fraction of sales, it's clear that accelerating an already very challenging ambition will take more than industry investment."" News that the UK end date may shunt forward to 2032 comes as no surprise. Norway has set a 2025 deadline for a ban on new petrol and diesel cars.  Some Chinese cities are discussing a date around 2030. At some point market dynamics will over-ride government policy anyway. Bloomberg forecasts that the purchase price of electric vehicles will reach rough parity with fossil fuel cars by the middle of the decade. That looks like a potential tipping point, as the costs for maintaining and running electric vehicles will be so much lower (until the chancellor finds a way of taxing electricity, that is). But some experts are sounding a note of caution over the electric dream. They say the only sure way of hitting the UK's emissions targets is to actually reduce the need for driving in the first place.   They say the best short-term policy is to stop so many drivers buying SUVs.

"Food giant to stop advertising ice cream to kidsUnilever, which owns brands such as Twister and Cornetto, says it is responding to rising obesity rates.","Food giant Unilever has vowed to stop marketing its products to children in order to tackle rising obesity rates. The firm, which owns brands such as Twister ice cream and Popsicle ice lollies, said it would limit the use of cartoon characters in its advertising. It also promised to stop using social media stars or celebrities ""who primarily appeal"" to children under 12. Ads for Unilever ice creams have been pulled in the past over complaints they marketed unhealthy food to children. The new rules,externalwill apply to all of the firm's products by the end of 2020, kicking off with its Wall's ice cream brands. Wall's will also launch a range of ""responsibly made"" products for children that contain ""no more than 110 calories and a maximum of 12g of sugar per portion"". Wall's brands popular with children include Max, Paddle Pop and Twister.

Motorists stranded in heavy snow thank rescuers,"Jarek Grudowski and Piotr Bukolt were rescued in severe weather on Tuesday night. Two Polish businessmen who became stuck in heavy snow in southern Scotland have thanked their rescuers. The men encountered the severe conditions as they travelled from Edinburgh to Dumfries, via the A702 in Dumfries and Galloway on Tuesday night. They were among 12 people who were rescued after vehicles including a tanker, bus and several cars were abandoned on the Dalveen Pass. Rescue teams said they encountered 18 inches (45cm) of snow and strong winds. Jarek Grudowski and Piotr Bukolt were about 30 miles from their destination when their car became stuck in snow near Durisdeer. The rescue operation at Dalveen Pass came after days of wintry conditions in Scotland ""There was extremely heavy snow,"" Mr Grudowski told BBC Scotland. ""We were stuck, the car couldn't move. In front of us there were a few trucks and some other cars which were also abandoned already."" Fortunately, a rescue team soon appeared and took the men to their hotel. Mr Grudowski said: ""I would like to thank the mountain rescue team because they helped us immediately and took us to the hotel so we were on time."" Mr Bukolt was also relieved. ""Yes I was happy,"" he said. ""This is the best business trip with Jarek in my life."" A large swathe of the south of Scotland was covered by a Met Office amber weather warning of snow while the rescue operation took place on Tuesday. Charlie McCreedie was one of the four members of theMoffat Mountain Rescue Team,externalwho were on standby. He said they got the call to go to the Dalveen Pass on the A702, between the M74 and A76, after 21:00. ""The A76 was completely clear, but when you got to the higher ground it was snowing quite heavily,"" he said. ""The road was completely blocked then by vehicles and snow."" Drivers and passengers were taken to safety by members of Moffat Mountain Rescue Team Mr McCreedie and his team brought two off-road vehicles, but had to wait a further hour for a snow plough to clear the path to safety. He said the 12 people they helped - including a bus passenger - were ""starting to look cold and weary"". ""They were pleased to get into the Land Rover,"" he added. With weather warnings in place and forecasts predicting further wintry weather over the coming days, Mr McCreedie urged drivers to plan ahead and not make unnecessary journeys. He said: ""It's just Scotland in the winter, you really need to be prepared. ""It is always worth having something in your car in case you do get stuck. Try and listen to the police and weather forecast. ""If you can avoid your journey, avoid your journey.""

Are cruise ships really 'floating Petri dishes'?,"This video can not be played David Abel, one of 3,700 people in quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess, speaking soon after the quarantine began The largest coronavirus outbreak outside mainland China is not in a country, but on a cruise ship. It's been more than a week since the Diamond Princess went into lockdown, after a previous passenger tested positive for the virus after disembarking. With almost 500 out of 3,700 people on board tested, 174 people have now tested positive for coronavirus. Those still on board are in quarantine for another week. But it's not just the Diamond Princess. Dozens more catch virus on quarantined cruise ship On another cruise ship in Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers people were quarantined because of fears that people on board might have the virus. They were only allowed to disembark after tests came back negative. And a cruise ship carrying more than 1,450 passengers, which left Hong Kong on 1 February, was turned away from ports in Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines, despite having no infections on board. It has now been told it can dock in Cambodia. Cruise ships have for years been referred to as ""floating Petri dishes"" - places ripe for the exchange of germs, and the spreading of illness. But is the accusation true? A passenger peers out from the Diamond Princess. The company is providing extra TV, films, games, and newspapers for quarantined passengers, plus room service food There is an increased risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases on ships, says Prof Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious diseases specialist at the Australian National University. ""In general, you've got passengers and crew members from different parts of the world mixing intimately and intensely for a short period of time,"" Dr Senanayake says. ""They've all got varying levels of immunity and so that does set things up for an infection outbreak."" With coronavirus, which is believed to spread through droplets - such as from mucus or saliva - people could be infected without direct contact with a carrier. ""Say if someone sneezed on to a table, and then someone else immediately touches that table, that could lead to infection,"" Dr Senanayake says. ""People might not all be talking to each other - but they are in shared spaces like swimming pools, spas, dining rooms and auditoriums."" However, Stewart Chiron, a cruise expert, says ""the reality onboard a cruise is very different to the perception of it"". ""So for example, people think that when you're queuing up at buffet lines that there's a lot of interaction and contact between passengers,"" says Mr Chiron, who has been on board more than 250 cruise ships. ""For the major cruise lines, that's not true. There are stations - if you want eggs you go to the egg station, a gloved crew member will do that for you. ""The point is that you're rarely waiting in a line, and not everyone passes by every piece of food - what that does is minimise the interaction between people."" This video can not be played Sea urchins and Swiss rolls: Quarantine around the world If passenger interaction is minimised, crew interaction is another story. On the Diamond Princess, at least 10 crew members are among the infected. According to the New York Times, more than 1,000 crew members ""live and work elbow-to-elbow"". ""It's likely crew members will be in very close contact with each other, perhaps even sharing facilities,"" says Dr Senanayake. ""People will disembark the ship but the crew members often may not change. So if there is ongoing transmission from the crew, when the next set of passengers come on that may continue."" According to Mr Chiron, cruises have extremely stringent cleaning and screening processes. ""Cruises are always taking thorough readings of passengers. If you look ill then you are subject to a secondary medical screening."" Probably the disease most associated with cruise ships is norovirus, a vomiting illness caught via contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces. ""Cruises have various protocols that are enabled when a norovirus case is reported,"" says Mr Chiron. ""There's extensive scrubbing that goes on, all the surfaces are continuously cleaned. During the buffets there will be no food like bread baskets. The crew are specially trained for this."" Infected passengers are taken off the ship to be treated in hospitals He adds that things have become more stringent since the outbreak of the coronavirus. ""You can tell now they're much more observant of passengers' appearances. If you look at how well ships are cleaned and maintained - they are extremely thorough."" According to Dr Senanayake, there is an official Vessel Sanitation Program at the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that advises ships on how to prevent and control the spread of illnesses. ""I believe cruise ships now have got a lot of disinfection stations, and are also advising patients or crew members who are sick not to come on board,"" he says. ""There is that risk of going on a cruise ship but everything in life comes with risks. [People just have to] practice simple [precautionary] measures."" China and the virus that threatens everything Singapore bank evacuated over coronavirus case For the Diamond Princess, Dr Senanayake says the ship is employing ""good isolation measures"" by keeping people in their rooms (passengers are allowed onto the outdoor decks at certain times). However, he adds: ""[The ship] needs to make sure people understand why this is happening and understand their concerns. ""You've gone from having the time of your life to being isolated in your room feeling very scared. The quarantine should always be done in a very humane and compassionate way."" The cruise industry will definitely take a ""financial hit"" - but these cases aren't going to stop people from taking cruises, says Mr Chiron. ""The damage they're going to take specifically is from the cruises around China and South East Asia. The lines themselves are cancelling routes.

Italy's far-right leader Salvini to face trialEx-interior minister Matteo Salvini loses his immunity and faces trial over holding migrants at sea.Europe,"This video can not be played Matteo Salvini: ""I want someone to put an end to this surreal debate"" Italy's Senate has voted to allow prosecutors to put far-right leader Matteo Salvini on trial over charges of holding migrants at sea. Mr Salvini, who previously served as Italy's interior minister, is accused of illegally keeping people on a boat off Sicily for days in August 2019. Some 116 migrants remained aboard the Gregoretti for close to a week. On Wednesday, a majority of senators voted for the trial of the anti-immigration League leader to go ahead. Mr Salvini has repeatedly said he wants to go to court. He told the chamber he wanted ""to tell the world"" that his migration policies ""saved tens of thousands of lives."" ""I am absolutely calm and proud of what I have done. And I'll do it again as soon as I get back into government,"" he said later. Senators from his League party left the chamber rather than take part in Wednesday's vote. Can Italy's populist leader return to power? The right-wing nationalists shaking up Europe Under Italian law, ministers have parliamentary immunity for actions taken while they were in office. But a committee voted last month to strip Mr Salvini of his immunity - leaving the final decision in the hands of the Senate on Wednesday. Mr Salvini's supporters clapped his speech The upper house Senate voted 152-76 in favour of lifting the immunity. After the tally was announced, Mr Salvini compared himself to US President Donald Trump, who was impeached in December and accused opponents of undermining his electoral success through the courts. ""I, like Trump? He has a few more billions and a few more years, but it's a bad little habit of the left, going around in the world, to try to win by judicial means,"" he wrote on Twitter. If successfully prosecuted at trial, Mr Salvini could face up to 15 years in jail. By Mark Lowen, BBC News, Rome The response of most politicians when the hand of the judiciary comes knocking is to deny, evade, or flee. The response of Matteo Salvini: bring it on. For a man who has built his political success on a hard anti-migrant line, the decision to try him for blocking migrants from Italy feeds the image he presents of himself as defender of the Italian nation. Italy's populist-in-chief will revel in a move that depicts the man of the people as being targeted by the establishment. This video can not be played How Italy's far right is hoping to cause a political earthquake And although eventual conviction could potentially end Matteo Salvini's political career, he won't be too worried for now. The wheels of justice move slowly in Italy: even if he were convicted, he'd have the right to two appeals, which could take years. And he'll take solace from his predecessor as Italy's lead populist, Silvio Berlusconi, who was convicted for fraud, his sentence then commuted - and returned as an Italian MEP. A political comeback, Italian-style. For years, some in Italy have complained that the country has taken in a large number of migrants fleeing across the Mediterranean, and has called for other EU nations to take their share. Mr Salvini in particular took a hard stance on migrant boats while he was in office, implementing a closed ports policy. This video can not be played Thousands of migrants are still losing their lives trying to reach Europe by boat On 25 July 2019, Italian coastguard ship the Gregoretti picked up about 140 migrants trying to travel to Italy from Libya. While the Gregoretti allowed several people off the ship for medical attention, some 116 people remained on board for days while Mr Salvini demanded other EU countries take them in. Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? Are migrants who cross the Channel sent back? The decision drew an immediate backlash. Prosecutors opened an investigation into conditions aboard after reports that migrants only had one toilet between them. After the Catholic Church and a number of states agreed to care for those on board, in a deal which then EU commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos helped to broker, Mr Salvini eventually consented to let them dock on 31 July.

The League leader insists the decision to keep the migrants offshore had the support of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and the rest of the government. But prosecutors believe he acted alone, ignoring repeated requests from Mr Conte to release them. Italy's Populist Five Star Movement - at the time in coalition with the League - had backed Mr Salvini in previous cases, such as when140 migrants on board the Diciotti vessel were not allowed to embark in Sicily for six daysin the summer of 2018. But the party says that in the case of the Gregoretti he acted alone. Later in February Mr Salvini also faces losing his immunity over another migrant case. He is accused of keepingthe Open Arms migrant vessel offshore for daysin August last year. At the time,Prime Minister Conte called Mr Salvini ""obsessed"" with keeping migrants outof Italy.

Universities 'gagging' sexual assault complaints,"UK universities are using ""gagging"" clauses to stop students from going public with complaints of sexual assault, bullying and poor teaching. Students said they felt pressured to sign non-disclosure agreements and one was told she would be expelled if she broke her contract. Nearly a third of universities have used NDAs for student grievances since 2016, data obtained by BBC News shows. Universities UK said NDAs should not be used to silence students. Non-disclosure agreements, which were designed to protect business secrets, are legal contracts that stop people from sharing private information. What are non-disclosure agreements? UK universities in 'gagging order' row Sexual harassment claims 'should not be silenced' NDAs were also used in settling complaints of false advertising of courses, lack of disability support and accommodation issues, according to the data obtained under Freedom of Information laws byThe Next Episodepodcast. The government said it was ""unacceptable"" to use NDAs for student complaints and it is legislating to stop such agreements being misused across all areas of society.  300used since 2016 to resolve student complaints 45universities Â£1.3mpaid out Â£250-Â£40,000individual payout amounts Charlotte - not her real name - said she reported being sexually assaulted by another student while an undergraduate at the University of West London (UWL). She reported it to the university and the police. Officers interviewed the arts student for five hours before telling her that there was not enough physical evidence to prosecute because she had ""blacked out"". Charlotte said she was ""plunged into emotional chaos"" and overdosed shortly afterwards. She took three weeks sick leave to recover, but felt unsupported when she returned to university and her academic work suffered. This video can not be played ""They essentially said you make any more of a fuss, or even cry, you're out"" Charlotte said a staff member thanked her in a private meeting for not ruining her alleged attacker's life. They later said she would be expelled if she made a fuss, she added. ""They literally thanked me,"" she said. ""I can't believe someone would say that when it happened to me. Not him."" In a recording, shared with BBC News, staff can also be heard telling her classmates she had ""got herself into a very bad place"" and discouraging them from contacting her. ""It was hell on earth,"" Charlotte said. ""How they treated me was worse than the assault itself. I felt so alone."" NDAs: Why do non-disclosure agreements matter? She submitted a formal complaint and took legal action, after which she received Â£1,000 in compensation. As part of the settlement, she signed an NDA preventing her from discussing the terms. The University of West London said it disputed the allegations and had provided Charlotte with all the support it could, adding that it could not comment further because of its confidentiality duties. In a statement, it said it had reviewed its policies in light of national recommendations for responding to sexual harassment in universities, adding: ""We have implemented those and have a team of staff who are trained to support students who find themselves the victim of sexual assault."" Olivia signed an agreement that says she will be ""expelled"" if she talks publicly about her allegations Olivia, a student at a different university, says she was violently sexually assaulted by a fellow student during her undergraduate degree and reported the attack to police, but the case was dropped because of insufficient evidence. As a result of the decision by police, her university refused to investigate, according to documents seen by BBC News. Following the attack, Olivia signed an agreement that says she will be ""expelled"" if she talks or posts publicly about her allegations or the university's safeguarding procedures. Olivia, also not her real name, says she signed the document because she was afraid for her safety and it contained an agreement that prevented her attacker from contacting her, but she feels it does not go far enough. She was not offered any money or given any legal advice before signing it. Her university has also threatened to sue her if she speaks out, she claims. ""It terrified me,"" she said. ""They told me to not tell my parents, to not tell my friends, to basically just be quiet about itâ¦ it made it feel like it was my fault."" Georgina Calvert-Lee, a lawyer specialising in sexual assault cases, said most uses of NDAs on students with these types of allegations were ""unethical"" and likely to be legally unenforceable. Tiziana Scaramuzza, now 36, a former PhD student, was paid by Oriel College, Oxford, to support student welfare alongside her law degree in 2013. She says she repeatedly raised concerns with senior staff about what she thought were failures in suicide prevention measures and about alleged breaches of confidentiality when supporting at risk students. She told the BBC a staff member had been discouraging depressed students from going to the doctor in favour of one-on-one support sessions with them, despite not being qualified to do so. ""I was bullied into keeping quiet and all my concerns were dismissed or shouted down,"" she said. ""They treated me like dirt."" After Tiziana submitted suggestions to improve safeguarding measures, Oriel college offered her a Â£5,000 settlement with an NDA to sever ties, which she accepted. ""It was completely inappropriate,"" she said.  ""They treated me like an inconvenience, like I was the problem, instead of dealing with the problem. ""Once I moved to a different college to finish my PhD, I learnt they hadn't made any changes, which was concerning because a lot of students were vulnerable."" Oriel College said it could not comment on Ms Scaramuzza's claims but confirmed that a ""thorough investigation"" into welfare provision in 2013 had been conducted. It added: ""The college takes the welfare of students and staff very seriously. We currently have several members of staff, external doctors and counsellors providing welfare support."" BBC News sent Freedom of Information requests to almost all of the UK's universities asking how many students had signed non-disclosure agreements in the past four years after bringing a complaint and how much, if any, money had been paid out. All but two of the 136 universities contacted responded, with varying degrees of transparency owing to data protection concerns or claims of confidentiality. Of these, 45 universities said they had used NDAs but not all of them disclosed full details, meaning it is hard to determine the true scale and this is an underestimate. The data shows about 300 students have signed NDAs after complaints since 2016, with the total cost paid out being more than Â£1.3m - equivalent to about 50 undergraduate degrees. Individual payouts ranged from Â£250 to nearly Â£40,000. However, the data also showed not every student who filed a complaint received a payout - sometimes just an NDA - and it is not clear why this is. It comes after theBBC found universities had spent Â£87m on pay-offs with staff since 2017. The student complaints regulator, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, said the use of NDAs was ""not appropriate"" and advised against the practice. It receives more than 1,500 complaints a year and said it was important grievances were ""handled fairly and transparently"" so universities learnt from them. In a statement, the government said: ""Harassment of any sort is abhorrent and higher education providers have a responsibility to ensure they provide a safe and inclusive environment."" Universities UK, which represents 136 institutions, added: ""Every student should feel safe and supported through their time at university and this includes feeling empowered to speak out if they have concerns.""

BP boss plans to 'reinvent' oil giant for green era,"BP chief executive Bernard Looney has set out a vision to reduce the oil giant's carbon footprint New BP boss Bernard Looney has said he wants the company to sharply cut net carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner. Mr Looney said the 111-year-old company needed to ""reinvent"" itself, a strategy that will eventually include more investment in alternative energy. BP will have to fundamentally reorganise itself to help make those changes, said Mr Looney, who took over as chief executive last week. It follows similar moves by rivals, including Royal Dutch Shell and Total. Mr Looney said: ""The world's carbon budget is finite and running out fast; we need a rapid transition to net zero. ""Trillions of dollars will need to be invested in re-plumbing and rewiring the world's energy system."" ""This will certainly be a challenge, but also a tremendous opportunity. It is clear to me, and to our stakeholders, that for BP to play our part and serve our purpose, we have to change. And we want to change - this is the right thing for the world and for BP."" He outlined his plans in a keynote speech on Wednesday. ""Providing the world with clean, reliable affordable energy will require nothing less than reimagining energy, and today that becomes BP's new purpose,"" he said. ""Reimagining energy for people and our planet."" ""We'll still be an energy company, but a very different kind of energy company: leaner, faster moving, lower carbon, and more valuable."" BP's announcement that it intends to become a zero carbon emissions company by 2050 was not short of fanfare. It's new boss, 49-year-old Irishman Bernard Looney, delivered what the company described as a landmark speech in front of hundreds of journalists and investors. But while he was clear what he wanted and why, he was less clear on how and when. There was a commitment to reduce the company's investments in oil and gas exploration, and increase investment in zero and low-carbon energy over time. But there were no commitments to specific targets in the intervening 30 years. Indeed he said that BP would still be in the oil and gas business three decades from now but in a sustainable way. Ultimately, it will fall to his successors to make good on promises made today. But Mr Looney said in order to start a journey you need a destination. His critics would say you need a more detailed map on how to get there. On Instagram, which Mr Looney recently signed up to, he said: ""Rest assured - a lot of time - and listening - has gone into this."" ""All of the anxiety and frustration of the world at the pace of change is a big deal. I want you to know we are listening. Both as a company - and myself as an individual.""In the longer term, BP's plans will involve less investment in oil and gas, and more investment in low carbon businesses. The company said it wanted to be ""net zero"" by 2050 - that is, it wants the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations, and from the oil and gas it produces, to make no addition to the amount of greenhouse gases in the world's atmosphere by that date. It also wants to halve the amount of carbon in its products by 2050. Mr Looney did not set out in detail how it intended to reach its ""net zero"" target, something that drew criticism from environmental campaign organisation Greenpeace. Charlie Kronick, oil advisor from Greenpeace UK, said there were many unanswered questions. ""How will they reach net zero? Will it be through offsetting? When will they stop wasting billions on drilling for new oil and gas we can't burn? Would you follow this man on Instagram? BP agrees Â£474m North Sea assets sell-off to Premier Oil ""What is the scale and schedule for the renewables investment they barely mention? And what are they going to do this decade, when the battle to protect our climate will be won or lost?"" Mr Looney addressed this criticism after his speech, saying: ""We want a rapid transition. A transition that is delayed, and then suddenly is a right-angle change that disrupts the world, would be destructive to our company."" ""We're starting with a destination. The details will come,"" he said. A BP oil refinery When asked whether that meant it's oil and gas business would cease to grow, Mr Looney said: ""BP is going to be in the oil and gas business for a very long time. That's a fact. We pay an $8bn in dividends [to shareholders] every year. Not paying that is one way to make sure that we're not around to enable the transition that we want."" However, he said the existing oil and gas business would shrink over time. Any remaining carbon produced by the use of BP products would have to be captured or offset, he said. Climate Action 100+, a group of large investors that is trying to put pressure on major greenhouse gas emitters to clean up their act, said the BP announcement was ""welcome"". ""We need to see a wholesale shift to a net zero economy by 2050,"" said Stephanie Pfeifer, a member of the action group's steering committee. ""This must include oil and gas companies if we are to have any chance of successfully tackling the climate crisis,"" said Ms Pfeifer, who is also chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change. She said that Climate Action 100+ investors, which have already been putting pressure on BP, will continue to look for progress from the company in addressing climate change. ""This includes how it will invest more in non-oil and gas businesses, and ensuring its lobbying activity supports delivery of the Paris Agreement,"" she said. Would you follow this man on Instagram?

"Thousands facing days without water after stormA water firm says it is ""throwing everything we can at this problem"" but weather is hampering repairs.Cumbria","Water tankers have been trying to keep supplies on Thousands of homes and businesses in Cumbria are facing days without water after a mains pipe was damaged during Storm Ciara on Sunday. A major incident was declared after the damaged pipe near Kendal threatened supplies to about 8,000 properties. United Utilities said many people would continue to be without water, despite millions of litres being pumped into the damaged system. The firm said ""horrendous"" weather conditions were hampering repairs. More on this and other Cumbria stories A large area of the county, including Appleby, Shap, Orton, Ravenstonedale, Ivegill, Low Braithwaite, Threlkeld and Glenridding is affected. United Utilities said it could be Thursday or Friday before the main was fixed, but stressed it would depend on weather conditions. Allow Twitter content?

Dr Martin Padley said the company had brought in extra equipment and tankers from the Midlands and Scotland. ""We're throwing absolutely everything we can at this problem but the weather is so bad that it's affecting our ability to even weld pipes,"" he said. The area normally uses about 11 million litres of water a day and engineers are pumping in seven million litres a day. ""So we have a shortfall of about four millions litres, so unfortunately people will see low pressure and ultimately no water at all,"" Dr Padley said. ""Even after we get the pipe fixed it will take time to refill what is a huge system."" Millions of litres are being pumped into the damaged water system Two GP practices - Shap Medical Practice and Glenridding Health Centre - cancelled appointments on Wednesday because of problems with their water supply. United Utilities said it was also in contact with 70 farmers in the affected area about getting supplies to livestock. Alan Fox, who runs the Troutbeck Inn, near Penrith, said he had been forced to close. He said: ""We've already had to turn guests away and we have people staying in our holiday cottages with no water. ""We're having to close tonight because without water people can't use toilets and we can't cook in the restaurant.""

Are cruise ships really 'floating petri dishes'?,"This video can not be played David Abel, one of 3,700 people in quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess, speaking soon after the quarantine began The largest coronavirus outbreak outside mainland China is not in a country, but on a cruise ship. It's been more than a week since the Diamond Princess went into lockdown, after a previous passenger tested positive for the virus after disembarking. With almost 500 out of 3,700 people on board tested, 174 people have now tested positive for coronavirus. Those still on board are in quarantine for another week. But it's not just the Diamond Princess. Dozens more catch virus on quarantined cruise ship On another cruise ship in Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers people were quarantined because of fears that people on board might have the virus. They were only allowed to disembark after tests came back negative. And a cruise ship carrying more than 1,450 passengers, which left Hong Kong on 1 February, was turned away from ports in Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines, despite having no infections on board. It has now been told it can dock in Cambodia. Cruise ships have for years been referred to as ""floating Petri dishes"" - places ripe for the exchange of germs, and the spreading of illness. But is the accusation true? A passenger peers out from the Diamond Princess. The company is providing extra TV, films, games, and newspapers for quarantined passengers, plus room service food There is an increased risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases on ships, says Prof Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious diseases specialist at the Australian National University. ""In general, you've got passengers and crew members from different parts of the world mixing intimately and intensely for a short period of time,"" Dr Senanayake says. ""They've all got varying levels of immunity and so that does set things up for an infection outbreak."" With coronavirus, which is believed to spread through droplets - such as from mucus or saliva - people could be infected without direct contact with a carrier. ""Say if someone sneezed on to a table, and then someone else immediately touches that table, that could lead to infection,"" Dr Senanayake says. ""People might not all be talking to each other - but they are in shared spaces like swimming pools, spas, dining rooms and auditoriums."" However, Stewart Chiron, a cruise expert, says ""the reality onboard a cruise is very different to the perception of it"". ""So for example, people think that when you're queuing up at buffet lines that there's a lot of interaction and contact between passengers,"" says Mr Chiron, who has been on board more than 250 cruise ships. ""For the major cruise lines, that's not true. There are stations - if you want eggs you go to the egg station, a gloved crew member will do that for you. ""The point is that you're rarely waiting in a line, and not everyone passes by every piece of food - what that does is minimise the interaction between people."" This video can not be played Sea urchins and Swiss rolls: Quarantine around the world If passenger interaction is minimised, crew interaction is another story. On the Diamond Princess, at least 10 crew members are among the infected. According to the New York Times, more than 1,000 crew members ""live and work elbow-to-elbow"". ""It's likely crew members will be in very close contact with each other, perhaps even sharing facilities,"" says Dr Senanayake. ""People will disembark the ship but the crew members often may not change. So if there is ongoing transmission from the crew, when the next set of passengers come on that may continue."" According to Mr Chiron, cruises have extremely stringent cleaning and screening processes. ""Cruises are always taking thorough readings of passengers. If you look ill then you are subject to a secondary medical screening."" Probably the disease most associated with cruise ships is norovirus, a vomiting illness caught via contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces. ""Cruises have various protocols that are enabled when a norovirus case is reported,"" says Mr Chiron. ""There's extensive scrubbing that goes on, all the surfaces are continuously cleaned. During the buffets there will be no food like bread baskets. The crew are specially trained for this."" Infected passengers are taken off the ship to be treated in hospitals He adds that things have become more stringent since the outbreak of the coronavirus. ""You can tell now they're much more observant of passengers' appearances. If you look at how well ships are cleaned and maintained - they are extremely thorough."" According to Dr Senanayake, there is an official Vessel Sanitation Program at the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that advises ships on how to prevent and control the spread of illnesses. ""I believe cruise ships now have got a lot of disinfection stations, and are also advising patients or crew members who are sick not to come on board,"" he says. ""There is that risk of going on a cruise ship but everything in life comes with risks. [People just have to] practice simple [precautionary] measures."" China and the virus that threatens everything Singapore bank evacuated over coronavirus case For the Diamond Princess, Dr Senanayake says the ship is employing ""good isolation measures"" by keeping people in their rooms (passengers are allowed onto the outdoor decks at certain times). However, he adds: ""[The ship] needs to make sure people understand why this is happening and understand their concerns. ""You've gone from having the time of your life to being isolated in your room feeling very scared. The quarantine should always be done in a very humane and compassionate way."" The cruise industry will definitely take a ""financial hit"" - but these cases aren't going to stop people from taking cruises, says Mr Chiron. ""The damage they're going to take specifically is from the cruises around China and South East Asia. The lines themselves are cancelling routes. ""Cruise Norwegian, for example, are cancelling all their Asia sailings. They are going to have to issue refunds, credits - we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars. ""But when you look at the rest of the world, Europe, Alaska, the US - people are still travelling. Royal Caribbean revealed that just 1.5% of enquiries they received were about people asking the virus. ""People are concerned, yes, but they are still travelling. Elsewhere in the world the ships are full and they are going to continue to be full."" SHOULD WE WORRY?Our health correspondent explains YOUR QUESTIONS:Can you get it more than once?

The virus that threatens everything in China,"A message written in the snow alongside the Tonghui river reads ""Goodbye Li Wenliang!"" On a cold Beijing morning, on an uninspiring, urban stretch of the Tonghui river, a lone figure could be seen writing giant Chinese characters in the snow. The message taking shape on the sloping concrete embankment was to a dead doctor. ""Goodbye Li Wenliang!"" it read, with the author using their own body to make the imprint of that final exclamation mark. Five weeks earlier, Dr Li had been punished by the police for trying to warn colleagues about the dangers of a strange new virus infecting patients in his hospital in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Now he'd succumbed to the illness himself and pictures of that frozen tribute spread fast on the Chinese internet, capturing in physical form a deep moment of national shock and anger. A worker in a Chinese factory wears a protective mask There's still a great deal we don't know about Covid-19,to give the disease caused by the virus its official name.Before it took its final fatal leap across the species barrier to infect its first human, it is likely to have been lurking inside the biochemistry of an - as yet unidentified - animal. That animal, probably infected after the virus made an earlier zoological jump from a bat, is thought to have been kept in a Wuhan market, where wildlife was traded illegally. Beyond that, the scientists trying to map its deadly trajectory from origin to epidemic can say little more with any certainty. China's Xi visits hospital in rare appearance amid health crisis A visual guide to the Coronavirus outbreak Coronavirus super-spreaders - why are they important? But while they continue their urgent, vital work to determine the speed at which it spreads and the risks it poses, one thing is beyond doubt. A month or so on from its discovery, Covid-19 has shaken Chinese society and politics to the core. That tiny piece of genetic material, measured in ten-thousandths of a millimetre, has set in train a humanitarian and economic catastrophe counted in more than 1,000 Chinese lives and tens of billions of Chinese yuan. It has closed off whole cities, placing an estimated 70 million residents in effective quarantine, shutting down transport links and restricting their ability to leave their homes. And it has exposed the limits of a political system for which social control is the highest value, breaching the rigid layers of censorship with a tsunami of grief and rage. The risk for the ruling elite is obvious. It can be seen in their response, ordering into action the military, the media and every level of government from the very top to the lowliest village committee. The consequences are now entirely dependent on questions no one knows the answers to; can they pull off the complex task of bringing a runaway epidemic under control, and if so, how long might it take? Across the world, people seem unsure how to respond to the small number of cases being detected in their own countries. The public mood can swing between panic - driven by the pictures of medical workers in hazmat suits - to complacency, brought on byheadlines that suggest the risk is no worse than flu,external. The evidence from China suggests that both responses are misguided. Seasonal flu may well have a low fatality rate, measured in fractions of 1%, but it's a problem because it affects so many people around the world. Why much of the 'world's factory' remains shut How worried should we be about Coronavirus? Your coronavirus questions answered The tiny proportion killed out of the many, many millions who catch it each year still numbers in the hundreds of thousands - individually tragic, collectively a major healthcare burden. Very early estimates suggested the new virus may be at least as deadly as flu - precisely why so much effort is now going into stopping it becoming another global pandemic. Butone new estimate suggests it could prove even deadlier yet,external, killing as many as 1% of those who contract it. For any individual, that risk is still relatively small, although it's worth noting such estimates are averages - just like flu, the risks fall more heavily on the elderly and already infirm. Despite the death toll, an increasing number of patients are recovering But China's experience of this epidemic demonstrates two things. Firstly, it offers a terrifying glimpse of the potential effect on a healthcare system when you scale up infections of this kind of virus across massive populations. Two new hospitals have had to be built in Wuhan in a matter of days, with beds for 2,600 patients, and giant stadiums and hotels are being used as quarantine centres, for almost 10,000 more. Despite these efforts, many have still struggled to find treatment, withreports of people dying at home, unregistered in the official figures. Secondly, it highlights the importance of taking the task of containing outbreaks of new viruses extremely seriously. The best approach, most experts agree, is one based on transparency and trust, with good public information and proportionate, timely government action. How can China build a hospital so quickly? Wuhan diary: Living alone in a city gone quiet But in an authoritarian system, with strict censorship and an emphasis on political stability above all else, transparency and trust are in short supply. This video can not be played Aerial time-lapse shows Wuhan hospital construction China's response may have sometimes looked like panic - withwhat's been called the ""biggest quarantine in history"",externalandharsh enforcement,externalagainst those who disobey. But those measures have become necessary only because its initial response looked like the very definition of complacency. There's ample evidence that the warning signs were missed by the authorities, and worse, ignored. By late December, medical staff in Wuhan were beginning to notice unusual symptoms of viral pneumonia, with a cluster linked to the market trading in illegal wildlife. On 30 December, Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist working in Wuhan's Central Hospital, posted his concerns in a private medical chat group, advising colleagues to take measures to protect themselves. He'd seen seven patients who appeared to be suffering with an illness similar to Sars - another coronavirus that began in an illegal Chinese wildlife market in 2002 and went on to kill 774 people worldwide. A few days later, he was summoned by the police. Dr Li was made to signa confession, denouncing the messages he'd posted as ""illegal behaviour"",external. The case received national media attention, with a high-profile state-run TV report announcing that in total, eight people in Wuhan were being investigated for ""spreading rumours"". The authorities, though, were well aware of the outbreak of illness. The day after Dr Li posted his message, China notified the World Health Organization, and the day after that, the suspected source - the market - was closed down. But despite the multiplying cases and the concerns among medics that human-to-human transmission was taking place, the authorities did little to protect the public.Doctors were already setting up quarantine rooms,externaland anticipating extra admissions when Wuhan held its important annual political gathering, the city's People's Congress. In their speeches, the Communist Party leaders made no mention of the virus. China's National Health Commissioncontinued to report that the number of infections was limited and that there was no clear evidence that the disease could spread between humans,external. And on 18 January the Wuhan authorities allowed a massive community banquet to take place, involving more than 40,000 families. The aim was to set a record for the most dishes served at an event. Two days later,China finally confirmed that human-to-human transmission was indeed taking place,external. Images from Chinese state TV show the large banquet in Wuhan Most remarkable of all perhaps, the following day, Wuhan held a Lunar New Year dance performance, attended by senior officials from across the surrounding province of Hubei. A state media report of the event, since hurriedly deleted butcaptured here,external, says the performers, some with runny noses and feeling unwell, ""overcame the fear of pneumonia... winning praise from the leaders"". By the time the national authorities had woken up to the impending disaster, and closed the city down on 23 January, it was too late - the epidemic was out of control. Before Wuhan's transport links were cut, an estimated five million people had left the city for the Lunar New Year break, travelling across China and the world. Some have begun calling the disaster""China's Chernobyl"",external. The parallels in failures to pass bad news up the chain of command and the incentives to put the short-term interests of political stability ahead of public safety, seem all too apparent. Li Wenliang, who'd gone back to work after being warned to keep quiet, soon discovered he'd also been infected. He died earlier this month, leaving a five-year-old son and a pregnant wife. The doctor who tried to warn others about coronavirus Anger was already simmering over the authorities' failure to issue timely warnings, with the crisis now being aired in full view.Wuhan's politicians were blaming senior officials,externalfor failing to authorise the release of the information; senior officials appeared to be preparing to hang Wuhan's politicians out to dry. But the death of a man, silenced for simply trying to protect his colleagues, burst open the dam with a wave of online fury directed not just at individuals, but at the system itself. So great was the public outrage, China's censors appeared unsure what to censor and what to let through. The hashtag #Iwantfreedomofspeech was viewed almost two million times before it was blocked. Aware of the tide of emotion, the Party began paying its own tributes to Dr Li. It quicklyhailed him a national hero,external. Doctor Li Wenliang tried to warn authorities about the new virus and died after contracting it China's rulers, untroubled by the inconveniences of the ballot box, have far deeper and older fears of what might sweep them from office. The wars, famines and diseases that shook the dynasties of old have given them their inheritance; an acute historical sense of the danger of the unforeseen crisis. They will also know well what Chernobyl did for the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party in the former USSR. ""It's impossible to know if Li Wenliang's death will serve as the catalyst for something bigger,"" Jude Blanchette, an expert on Chinese politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, tells me. ""But the raw emotion that surged when news of his condition broke indicates deep levels of frustration and anger exist within the country."" Precisely because it feels the weight of history, however, the Communist Party has made holding onto power a living obsession, and it has an ever more formidable domestic security apparatus to help it to do so. Over the past few decades it has proven nothing if not resilient, enduring through political chaos, devastating earthquakes and man-made disasters. But one sign that might hint at an awareness of just how great the current risks are comes in the role being played by China's President Xi Jinping. This week - for the first time since the crisis began - he ventured out to meet health workers involved in the fight, visiting a hospital and a virus control centre in Beijing. In contrast, his premier, Li Keqiang, has been sent to the front lines in Wuhan and appointed head of a special working group to tackle the epidemic. While it is common for the premier to be the face of reassurance during national disasters, some observers see another reason why Mr Xi might be wise to be seen to delegate. China's president has kept a low profile since the outbreak began ""Xi's absence from this crisis is yet another demonstration that he doesn't so much lead as he does command,"" Mr Blanchette says. ""He's clearly worried that this crisis will blow up in his face, and so he's pushed out underlings to be the public face of the CCP's response."" Already there are signs that the censorship is being ratcheted up once again, with Mr Xi ordering senior officials to ""strengthen the control over online media"". A few days ago, I spoke by phone to the lawyer and blogger, Chen Qiushi, who'd travelled to Wuhan in an attempt to provide independent reporting about the situation. Videos fromMr Chen,external, anda fellow activist, Fang Bin,external, have been widely watched, showing not the ranks of patriotic soldier-medics and the building of hospitals that fill state media coverage, but overcrowded waiting rooms and body bags. He told me he was unsure how long he'd be able to carry on. ""The censorship is very strict and people's accounts are being closed down if they share my content,"" he said. Mr Chen has since gone missing. Friends and family believe he's been forced into Wuhan's quarantine system, in an attempt to silence him. China's leaders now find their fate linked to thedaily charts of infection rates,external, published city by city, province by province. There are some signs that the extraordinary quarantine measures may be having an effect - outside of Hubei Province, the worst affected area, the number of new daily infections is falling. But with the need to try to restart the economy - all but frozen now for over a week - the country has begun a slow return to work. This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city Strict quarantine measures will remain in force in the worst affected areas, but workers from other parts of the country are trickling back to the cities, with the task of monitoring and managing their movements being handed to local neighbourhood committees. It will be a difficult balancing act. Too tough an approach risks further choking off business activity, commerce and travel in a consumer environment already suffocating under the deep psychological fear of contagion. Too lax, and any one of the many potential reservoirs of infection, now scattered across the country, could explode into another, separate epidemic. That would require further harsh action, knocking domestic confidence and prolonging the international border closures and flight restrictions put in place at such enormous economic cost. China is insisting that it is a fight well on the way to being won with ""unconquerable will"",externaland that lessons have been learned and ""shortcomings in preparedness"" identified. Questions about the systemic failings behind the disaster are dismissed as foreign ""prejudice"", as the propaganda machine cranks into overdrive, channelling the narrative and muting the criticisms. But the devastating scale and scope of China's world-threatening catastrophe have already revealed something important. The thousands who have lost family members, the millions living under the quarantine measures and the workers and businesses bearing the financial costs have been asking those difficult questions too. A tribute in snow to doctor Li Wenliang On the snowy banks of the Tonghui river, the giant tribute to Li Wenliang remains intact. When we visited, a few locals were taking photos and talking quietly to each other. A police car crawled slowly by. Soon, with the warming weather, the characters will be gone. Â© 2025 BBC.

Universities 'gagging' sexual assault complaintsNearly a third of universities have used non-disclosure contracts for student grievances since 2016.,"UK universities are using ""gagging"" clauses to stop students from going public with complaints of sexual assault, bullying and poor teaching. Students said they felt pressured to sign non-disclosure agreements and one was told she would be expelled if she broke her contract. Nearly a third of universities have used NDAs for student grievances since 2016, data obtained by BBC News shows. Universities UK said NDAs should not be used to silence students. Non-disclosure agreements, which were designed to protect business secrets, are legal contracts that stop people from sharing private information. What are non-disclosure agreements? UK universities in 'gagging order' row Sexual harassment claims 'should not be silenced' NDAs were also used in settling complaints of false advertising of courses, lack of disability support and accommodation issues, according to the data obtained under Freedom of Information laws byThe Next Episodepodcast. The government said it was ""unacceptable"" to use NDAs for student complaints and it is legislating to stop such agreements being misused across all areas of society.  300used since 2016 to resolve student complaints 45universities Â£1.3mpaid out Â£250-Â£40,000individual payout amounts Charlotte - not her real name - said she reported being sexually assaulted by another student while an undergraduate at the University of West London (UWL).

Universities 'gagging' sexual assault complaintsNearly a third of universities have used non-disclosure contracts for student grievances since 2016.UK,"UK universities are using ""gagging"" clauses to stop students from going public with complaints of sexual assault, bullying and poor teaching. Students said they felt pressured to sign non-disclosure agreements and one was told she would be expelled if she broke her contract. Nearly a third of universities have used NDAs for student grievances since 2016, data obtained by BBC News shows. Universities UK said NDAs should not be used to silence students. Non-disclosure agreements, which were designed to protect business secrets, are legal contracts that stop people from sharing private information. What are non-disclosure agreements? UK universities in 'gagging order' row Sexual harassment claims 'should not be silenced' NDAs were also used in settling complaints of false advertising of courses, lack of disability support and accommodation issues, according to the data obtained under Freedom of Information laws byThe Next Episodepodcast. The government said it was ""unacceptable"" to use NDAs for student complaints and it is legislating to stop such agreements being misused across all areas of society.  300used since 2016 to resolve student complaints 45universities Â£1.3mpaid out Â£250-Â£40,000individual payout amounts Charlotte - not her real name - said she reported being sexually assaulted by another student while an undergraduate at the University of West London (UWL).

More powers for Ofcom to police social media firms,"New powers will be given to the watchdog Ofcom to force social media firms to act over harmful content. Until now, firms like Facebook, Tiktok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have largely been self-regulating. The companies have defended their own rules about taking down unacceptable content, but critics say independent rules are needed to keep people safe. It is unclear what penalties Ofcom will be able to enforce to target violence, cyber-bullying and child abuse. There have been widespread calls for social media firms to take more responsibility for their content, especially afterthe death of Molly Russellwho took her own life after viewing graphic content on Instagram. The government has now announced it is ""minded""  to grant new powers to Ofcom - which currently only regulates the media and the telecoms industry, not internet safety. How can governments regulate social media? Doctors demand social media firms hand over data Molly Russell: Instagram bans self-harm drawings Ofcom will have the power to make tech firms responsible for protecting people from harmful content such as violence, terrorism, cyber-bullying and child abuse - and platforms will need to ensure that content is removed quickly. They will also be expected to ""minimise the risks"" of it appearing at all. The regulator has just announced the appointment of a new chief executive, Dame Melanie Dawes, who will take up the role in March. Molly Russell's family found she had been accessing distressing material about depression and suicide on Instagram ""There are many platforms who ideally would not have wanted regulation, but I think that's changing,"" said Digital Secretary Baroness Nicky Morgan. ""I think they understand now that actually regulation is coming."" Julian Knight, chair elect of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee which scrutinises social media companies, called for ""a muscular approach"" to regulation. ""That means more than a hefty fine - it means having the clout to disrupt the activities of businesses that fail to comply, and ultimately, the threat of a prison sentence for breaking the law,"" he said. In a statement, Facebook said it had ""long called"" for new regulation, and said it was ""looking forward to carrying on the discussion"" with the government and wider industry. Communication watchdog Ofcom already regulates television and radio broadcasters, including the BBC, and deals with complaints about them. This is the government's first response to the Online Harms consultation it carried out in the UK in 2019, which received 2,500 replies. The new rules will apply to firms hosting user-generated content, including comments, forums and video-sharing - that is likely to include Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. The intention is that government sets the direction of the policy but gives Ofcom the freedom to draw up and adapt the details. By doing this, the watchdog should have the ability to tackle new online threats as they emerge without the need for further legislation. A full response will be published in the spring. Children's charity the NSPCC welcomed the news. ""Too many times social media companies have said: 'We don't like the idea of children being abused on our sites, we'll do something, leave it to us,'"" said chief executive Peter Wanless. ""Thirteen self-regulatory attempts to keep children safe online have failed. ""Statutory regulation is essential."" Seyi Akiwowo set up the campaign group Glitch after experiencing online harassment. Seyi Akiwowo set up the online abuse awareness group Glitch after experiencing sexist and racist harassment online after a video of her giving a talk in her role as a councillor was posted on a neo-Nazi forum. ""When I first suffered abuse the response of the tech companies was below [what I'd hoped],"" she said. ""I am excited by the Online Harms Bill - it places the duty of care on these multi-billion pound tech companies."" UK plans social media and internet watchdog In many countries, social media platforms are permitted to regulate themselves, as long as they adhere to local laws on illegal material. Germany introduced the NetzDG Law in 2018, which states that social media platforms with more than two million registered German users have to review and remove illegal content within 24 hours of being posted or face fines of up to â¬50m (Â£42m). Australia passed the Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material Act in April 2019, introducing criminal penalties for social media companies, possible jail sentences for tech executives for up to three years and financial penalties worth up to 10% of a company's global turnover. China blocks many western tech giants including Twitter, Google and Facebook, and the state monitors Chinese social apps for politically sensitive content.

"'If someone coughs, it makes me nervous'","A GP practice in Brighton is temporarily closed after a staff member tested positive for coronavirus Five of the eight confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK have been linked to Brighton. But while authorities have told people to carry on their daily routines, on the streets uncertainty is building. Steve Walsh, a businessman from Hove who recently returned from Singapore, is thought to have infected 11 people - five of whom live in the city. A Brighton GP and an A&E doctor at nearby Worthing, West Sussex, are among those already identified as carriers. Brighton Council said residents shouldn't panic, but Maddy Lewis, 19, a student at Brighton University, said she was ""really worried"" by the latest developments. ""I've been over-thinking it. I was planning on not coming out today,"" she said, adding that she had ordered some masks which were ""turning up tomorrow"". She said she would be wearing them when she went home to Suffolk to see her family as she didn't want to pass the virus on to them if she had it. Student Maddy Lewis (right) said she was worried about taking the virus home to Suffolk ""It's a two week incubation period. How do I know if I have got it or not?"" she said. Her friend Alex Fitzgerald-Starr, also 19, laughed at this suggestion.  She said she was ""pretty chilled"" about it all but said she was worried it might have ""got into to the university"". The University of Sussex has confirmed a student that had recently returned from overseas had been admitted to hospital for tests.  The results are not yet known. Alex said that while the pair were at Brighton University, ""we all socialise together"". ""We live in large halls of residence. Get on the same buses. Come into town. It would spread so easily,"" she said. How worried should we be? A visual guide to the coronavirus outbreak Can the virus be transmitted by door handles? And other questions Cassidy Seaborne, from Whitehawk, in Brighton, was out with her one-year-old daughter in a buggy. ""I want to put a mask on her,"" she said. Ms Seaborne said she was ""scared"" by reports the virus had a worse effect on ""people with low immune systems or young children"", and she really just wanted to stay at home. ""If someone coughs, it makes me nervous,"" she said, adding that she had seen ""about five people in masks on one bus"" in one day. Cassidy Seaborne was ""scared"" for her one-year-old daughter In contrast, Frank Hayden, 45, from Eastbourne, who works at Timpson's in Brighton, shrugged off such concerns. ""I'm not bothered.  I come into contact with the general public on a daily basis. It's just like the flu, isn't it? I'm not one for scare-mongering,"" he said. However, he said he didn't ""watch the news or read much"". ""If I catch it, I'd just do what I'm told to do, self-isolate,"" he said. Shop-worker Frank Hayden said he was ""not bothered"" Meanwhile, parents of pupils at Cottesmore St Mary's Catholic School in Brighton were told two people from the school have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate for 14 days after coming into contact with a coronavirus case. Parents were told: ""If you wish to keep your child off of school at this time, then we will authorise this absence."" Journalist Sarah Lewis has a daughter at Cottesmore.  She said she ""initially had a moment"" when she got the message, but was ""trying not to panic"". She said: ""Judging by my Whatsapp groups, a lot of people are choosing to keep their children at home."" But she would be sending her daughter to school on Wednesday and was reassured that the school was being informative and taking action. ""They have done a lot of work with the children on prevention, even before today, with hand-washing and so on,"" she said. ""The head teacher is lovely - a mum herself, and very careful.""

"Hockney's The Splash fetches Â£23.1m at auctionThe British artist's painting, depicting the moment after a diver hits the water, is sold at Sotheby's.","The Splash has been in private ownership since 2006 One of British artist David Hockney's most famous works, The Splash, has been sold for Â£23.1m at Sotheby's in London. The buyer is not known. It had been estimated to sell for Â£20m-Â£30m - and ended up going for Â£23,117,000. The painting, in Hockney's minimalist style, depicts the moment after a diver hits the water in an LA swimming pool. It is considered one of the stand-out pop art images of the 20th Century and is one of a trio of works alongside A Little Splash and A Bigger Splash. The bewitching allure of Hockney's swimming pools A Bigger Splash is housed in London's Tate Britain while A Little Splash remains in a private collection and has never appeared on the public market. ""Not only is this a landmark work within David Hockney's oeuvre, it's an icon of Pop that defined an era and also gave a visual identity to LA,"" Emma Baker, head of Sotheby's contemporary art evening sale, said in a statement. When it was previously sold to a private owner in 2006 it went for Â£2.9m - a then record price for a Hockney work - and it has remained with that buyer until now. Prior to that, the Â£1.9m sale of A Neat Lawn, also in 2006, had set a precedent for a Hockney. David Hockney was inspired to create his Splash series by his early years in Los Angeles Since then, the growinginterest among the most wealthy in the value-holding investment benefits of high-end contemporary art,externalhave seen auction prices climb. This was illustrated at a 2018 auction at Christie's in New York where Hockney's Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) sold for just over $90m (Â£70m) - an auction record at the time for a work by a living artist. It's since been beatenby the $91.1m (Â£70.3m) sale in 2019 of a sculpture by US pop artist Jeff Koons. In May 2018, Hockney's Pacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica sold for $28.5m (Â£22m) - which was more than double the previous auction record for the artist. The Splash captures the brief moment just seconds after a swimmer has broken the calm surface of a pool. The painting's protagonist is present, yet absent, hidden by the displaced water. The work is a classic example of Hockney's lifelong fascination with the texture, appearance and depth of water. The Splash series was inspired by the time Hockney spent in Los Angeles following his graduation from art school. He first visited the Californian city in 1964. On returning to London later that year, he began to work on his first pool painting, Picture of a Hollywood Swimming Pool, which fetched $7.2m (Â£5.6m) at an auction at Sotheby's New York in November 2019. In 1966, he went back to Los Angeles and moved into an apartment in the city. It was there that Hockney, in his new sun-soaked environment, created the Splash paintings between 1966 and 1967.

David Hockney was inspired to create his Splash series by his early years in Los Angeles Since then, the growinginterest among the most wealthy in the value-holding investment benefits of high-end contemporary art,externalhave seen auction prices climb. This was illustrated at a 2018 auction at Christie's in New York where Hockney's Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) sold for just over $90m (Â£70m) - an auction record at the time for a work by a living artist. It's since been beatenby the $91.1m (Â£70.3m) sale in 2019 of a sculpture by US pop artist Jeff Koons. In May 2018, Hockney's Pacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica sold for $28.5m (Â£22m) - which was more than double the previous auction record for the artist. The Splash captures the brief moment just seconds after a swimmer has broken the calm surface of a pool. The painting's protagonist is present, yet absent, hidden by the displaced water. The work is a classic example of Hockney's lifelong fascination with the texture, appearance and depth of water. The Splash series was inspired by the time Hockney spent in Los Angeles following his graduation from art school. He first visited the Californian city in 1964. On returning to London later that year, he began to work on his first pool painting, Picture of a Hollywood Swimming Pool, which fetched $7.2m (Â£5.6m) at an auction at Sotheby's New York in November 2019. In 1966, he went back to Los Angeles and moved into an apartment in the city. It was there that Hockney, in his new sun-soaked environment, created the Splash paintings between 1966 and 1967.

Google starts appeal against Â£2bn shopping fine,"Google has changed how shopping results appear so shoppers can now see goods from price comparison sites as well as its own results Google's appeal against a huge fine imposed by the European Commission over its alleged abuse of power in promoting its own shopping comparison service will be heard over the next three days. The hearing will take place at the General Court in Luxembourg. The â¬2.4bn ($2.6bn; Â£2bn) fine was handed out in 2017 and the search giant has always vowed to fight it. It argues that the case has no legal or economic merit. In a statement to the BBC, Google said: ""We're appealing [against] the European Commission's 2017 Google Shopping decision because it is wrong on the law, the facts, and the economics. Shopping ads have always helped people find the products they are looking for quickly and easily, and helped merchants to reach potential customers. ""We look forward to making our case in court and demonstrating that we have improved quality and increased choice for consumers."" The BBC understands the tech giant will argue that it fulfilled its legal obligations to allow rivals access to its products. It will also argue that the EC excluded key players such as Amazon from its investigation. It will claim the online role of comparison shopping services has diminished, largely because platforms such as Amazon have become the preferred place to look for products and compare prices. In order to comply with the EC's ruling, Google changed the shopping box displayed at the top of search results. It now shows its own ad results but also gives space to other shopping comparison services, which can bid for advertising slots. The European Commission will be supported in its case by shopping comparison sites Kelkoo, Twenga and Foundem, among others. Foundem, the lead complainant in the case,  filed its complaint against Google back in 2009. In a statement, Kelkoo told the BBC it stood ""ready to support the European Commission during the hearings"". ""We believe in the merits of the shopping decision and its potential to deliver a fairer market for European consumers and businesses. At the same time, we continue to call for a remedy which tackles the harm caused by Google's abuse and we will endeavour to work closely with the Commission in the coming months to make this happen."" Google has amassed fines of â¬8.2bn from the EC in the last three years, all relating to alleged abuses of power. in 2017,â¬2.4bn over shopping results in 2018,â¬4.3bn fine over claims it used Android software to unfairlypromote its own apps in 2019, â¬1.5bn fine for blocking adverts from rival search engines Along with other tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Apple, it also now faces anti-trust investigations in the US. If its appeal is upheld it will be a big blow for the EC's competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has taken a tough stance on the Silicon Valley tech firms and what she sees as their monopolistic grip on the digital landscape. It is expected that the court will deliver its judgement in the second half of the year.

Here are the key takeaways:  So what happens next?Nevadahas its caucuses on22 February, followed bySouth Carolina's primaries on29 February. Want more? Not time for bed yet? You canfollow updates to the story hereandfind out who had a good night (and who didn't) here. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the two current frontrunners, have an age difference of four decades - Sanders is more than double his rival's age. In his speech in the past hour, Buttigieg mentioned admiring Sanders while he was in high school. Buttigieg was born in 1982. At that time, Sanders was the mayor of Burlington, Vermont - a post he'd hold from 1981 to 1989. When Buttigieg was graduating high school at age 18 in 2000, Sanders was a member of the US House of Representatives. That same year, Buttigiegwon an award for writing an essay about Bernie Sanders,externalwhere he called him an ""outstanding and inspiring example"" of integrity. ""In a climate where even liberalism is considered radical, and Socialism is immediately and perhaps willfully confused with Communism, a politician dares to call himself a socialist? He does indeed."" Buttigieg became South Bend, Indiana, mayor in 2012 - at which point Sanders was in his second term as senator. They're the first states in America to host a caucus and primary election in the long road to the presidency. The states have a decent record for picking the eventual Democratic nominee. So far, they've opted for Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders. Those states' records are a bit more spotty when it comes to picking Republicans. Five out of seven final candidates have won New Hampshire since 1976 and in Iowa, just two since 1980. The 2016 Democratic National Convention had many balloons Clinching victory in New Hampshire by just 2%, Bernie Sanders has currently gained eight delegates from the Granite State, and Pete Buttigieg has seven. So after one caucus and (most of) one primary, where are we sitting with delegate totals?  (This number will change once the final result from New Hampshire comes in) While New Hampshire and Iowa are important for momentum, it's worth remembering they make a small dent in the total delegate count:1,991 delegatesare required for a candidate to become the Democratic White House nominee. That's a loooong way away. Who?He's the 2016 runner-up, who's starting to look like a serious contender to take on Trump in 2020 Key issues:Medicare-for-All universal healthcare coverage; raising
taxes on the wealthiest Americans; upping the minimum wage. One policy:Completely eliminating $1.6tn in existing student debt -
regardless of income, unlike his rival Elizabeth Warren - and making public
colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free by taxing Wall Street. You can read more about the candidates, their key issues, and analysis from
the BBCâs Anthony Zurcher,here. Jon SopelBBC News, New Hampshire It's a win for Bernie Sanders, but it isn't a runaway victory. Iowa and New Hampshire don't matter for the numbers, they matter for the symbolism: first in the nation caucus, first in the nation primary. Bernie Sanders has got some momentum but I don't think this is quite as impressive a victory as he won four years ago. Anthony ZurcherBBC News, New Hampshire Four
years ago, Bernie Sanders took the New Hampshire primary with 60% of the vote.
He wonât come close to that mark this time, but given the depth of the field
the achievement is equally impressive. Whatâs
more, the order of the finishers helps Sanders as well. Biden â the only
candidate he trails in national polling - is wounded, perhaps mortally so. Pete
Buttigieg finished a strong second, but his success outside the first two
states is still an open question. Warren, his closest rival for the liberal
left vote, has yet to prove she can finish near Sanders. Amy Klobucharâs
success ensures sheâll stick around and the moderate support will remain
splintered. Four
years ago, Sanders hit an electoral brick wall after New Hampshire. With plenty
of money, a battle-tested national campaign organisation and divided
opposition, his path ahead - while far from certain - looks the brightest of
any in the field. Read more from Anthony here ""We're going to unite together and defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of his country,"" Sanders said, echoing his rivals' speeches in calling for togetherness in 2020. ""The reason we are going to win is that we are putting together and unprecedented, multigenerational, multiracial political movement."" He adds that he is taking on billionaires and candidates funded by billionaires, honing in on the key issues of healthcare and the economy. Bernie Sanders is all smiles as he thanks the crowd of supporters cheering his name for their ""great victory tonight"". ""The reason we won tonight in New Hampshire, that we won last week in Iowa, is because of the hard work of so many volunteers,"" Sanders said. (This is a bit of a controversial statement as Sanders trailed Pete Buttigieg in Iowa by 0.1%.) ""This victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump."" Bernie Sanders is projected to win the New Hampshire primary, the BBC's US partner CBS reports. He is about to appear in front of his supporters. ""So many of you decided that a middle class mayor and a veteran from the industrial west"" was ready to take on the president, Buttigieg says to supporters in New Hampshire. ""And we will welcome new allies to our movement at every step."" With 83% of precincts reporting, Buttigieg sits in second with 24% of the vote - just 4,500 votes behind Bernie Sanders. ""We go forward to know that this is our chance, this is our only chance,"" he says ""And the stakes could not be higher, we cannot afford to miss the mark or miss the moment. We must get this right."" As Pete Buttigieg speaks, the crowd at the Bernie Sanders headquarters had a less than favourable response. Sanders supporters chanted ""Wall Street Pete"" and booed the screen when Buttigieg appeared, according to our team on the ground in New Hampshire. Speaking to supporters in New Hampshire, Pete Buttigieg begins by commending Senator Bernie Sanders, who is currently in first place. ""I respect him greatly to this day and I congratulate him on his strong showing tonight,"" Buttigeg says, before noting candidates Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, who trail further behind. ""Vote blue no matter who."" President Donald Trump has commented on the Democratic race via Twitter, noting: ""A lot of Democratic dropouts tonight, very low political IQ"". Here's what he's said about the candidates: Nick BryantBBC New York Correspondent It's clear that Bernie Sanders is the standard bearer of the Democratic left. What we've got in the middle is muddled. Moderate Pete Buttigieg has to share the stage with Amy Klobuchar - who had a very strong debate performance last week. Who will take the lead remains to be seen. Pete Buttigieg keeps on eating into Bernie Sanders' lead. It's now down to about 3,800 votes, with about 75% of votes counted. Could he overtake Sanders? The former Massachusetts governor says he is reflecting on his dismal New Hampshire polling. He's garnered less than 1,000 votes. Patrick says he and his wife will ""reflect on this outcome and make some decisions tomorrow morning about what the future of this campaign can and should be"". He is the only African-American candidate still in the running and one of two non-white contenders left in what began as a historically diverse Democratic field. Two candidates - Andrew Yang and Michael Bennet - dropped out on Tuesday. As the race in New Hampshire approaches its close with Bernie Sanders in the lead, we're wondering what conversations are happening between Quincy and her father Ron - a New Hampshire family divided over the Democratic hopefuls. She's all for Sanders, but he's a Warren supporter. Given Warren's heavy loss in the state, Quincy may have bragging rights at the end of the night. Watch their story below. This video can not be played New Hampshire primary: A family split over the Democratic race Jon SopelBBC News, New Hampshire Bernie Sanders has run the most consistently focused campaign, he stays on message and has maintained an energy mostly unmatched by the other candidates. He's got these core beliefs that people seem to like, particularly the young voters who turned out in large numbers to support him. In contrast, I think Joe Biden's campaign is running on fumes. Heading to South Carolina tonight shows just how badly he has been doing. Articulating a clear message for why he wants to win in 2020 has been much more problematic than it has been for Sanders. About two-thirds of the New Hampshire votes are in - so where are we? Bernie Sandersis holding on to his lead with 26% of the vote, followed closely byPete Buttigieg, who has 24%. This is a difference of about5,000 votes- the gap has narrowed quite a bit over the past half-hour. Just behind them sitsAmy Klobuchar, at 20%. The three leaders are trailed byElizabeth Warren(9%),Joe Biden(8%) andTom Steyer(4%). Only the top three are on track to claim any delegates. Â© 2025 BBC.

Samsung unveils S20 flagship and folding Flip phoneFlagship 5G handset has 100x zoom camera and records 8K video while 4G foldable has clamshell design.,"This video can not be played WATCH: Rory Cellan-Jones and Zoe Thomas puzzle out the Z Flip phone Samsung is making all three models in its new flagship smartphone range 5G-compatible. The top-end Galaxy S20 also introduces a 100x zoom camera. The firm also confirmed a new foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip. It uses ""folding glass"" in its display and small fibres in its hinge to protect itself from damage. Several rivals plan their own handset launches over the coming weeks. But the spread of the coronavirus poses a threat to production. ""The virus is going to affect the supply chain,"" said Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""Although Samsung has diversified its manufacturing into places way beyond China, there will still be components in these phones sourced from China."" Many factories in the country have delayed re-opening after its New Year break because of fears the virus could spread in the workplace. China is also the world's biggest smartphone market, and the outbreak has hit local demand. The S20 handsets come in three sizes with different camera capabilities Samsung has suffered less impact than many of its rivals to date because it makes most of its handsets in Vietnam, and sells relatively few phones to Chinese consumers. But TrendForce - a research firm - still predicts the virus will cause the South Korean firm to produce 3% fewer devices than it might have in the current quarter. ""I'm expecting that to mean some delays in delivering the new handsets,"" added Francisco Jeronimo an analyst at IDC. Samsung told the BBC it was making its ""best effort to minimise impact on our operations"". This video can not be played WATCH: Lara Lewington tests the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra There are three S20 variants: the basic model with a 6.2in (15.7cm) display. It has three rear cameras: a 64-megapixel telephoto lens, a 12MP wide and a 12MP ultra-wide. It starts at $999/Â£799 the S20+ has a 6.7in (17cm) display. It adds a depth sensor to the basic model's array. It starts at $1,199/Â£999 the S20 Ultra has a 6.9in (17.5cm) display. Its telephoto lens is only 48MP, but the wide-angle lens is bumped up to 108MP. It starts at $1,399/Â£1,199 The S20 Ultra's camera module is thicker than that of the others to incorporate a periscope. This uses a prism to reflect light into the device's interior, allowing the wide-angle option to feature a longer lens and bigger sensor. Although it is possible to take 108MP shots, owners are expected to let the phone automatically merge groups of nine pixels into one most of the time. This aids low-light photography. The 100x ""super-resolution zoom"" facility uses the lower-resolution 48MP camera. Machine-learning techniques stitch together pixels from up to 20 different frames to achieve a better result than would be possible via a simple digital zoom. The S20 Ultra uses a prism to get light to its largest sensor It allows Samsung to boast double the zoom range of Huawei's competing P30 handset, although one expert questioned how usable it was in practice. ""The 100x zoom ends up with a quite blurred image, so I don't think people will turn to it that often"", commented Mr Jeronimo. ""But it should have a wow factor when shown off in stores. And at 20x to 30x you can get a good photo."" The phones also introduce Single Take mode. Samsung said this uses artificial intelligence to simultaneously take a mix of stills and videos via the various cameras, giving the owner a selection to choose from after the fact. Single Take mode takes photos and video clips over a 10 second period using a variety of the cameras ""We want to make sure consumers can really enjoy the moment in front of them... and don't have to worry about adjusting settings,"" explained product manager Mark Holloway. The phones are also among the first to be capable of recording in 8K resolution - four times as many pixels as 4K and 16 as many as 1080p high definition. Most people do not yet own 8K screens, but Samsung suggests this offers a degree of future-proofing as well as the ability to extract high-quality stills from the footage. ""Both the new tech and the more user-friendly user interface should help with how Samsung's camera functionality is perceived,"" commented Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies. ""Its results in the past were not quite on a par with competitors, perhaps signalling it wasn't leveraging software to do the heavy-lifting as much as the likes of Apple and Google. This time round there is definitely more 'AI' involved."" The S20 phones are Samsung's first to feature screens that refresh their image 120 times a second, which it says should make games appear smoother Samsung is pitching gaming as one benefit of having 5G connectivity, suggesting that lower latencies will mean that players can see and react to events in online titles split-seconds faster than if they were on 4G. Samsung highlights that 5G offers faster upload and download speeds as well as less lag time when using remote services The phones' Google Duo app also displays video chats in higher quality when on 5G. Samsung surprises with Galaxy Flip Z Oscars reveal 5G mobile networks are not ready for primetime 5G explained in 45 seconds Networks are still in the early stages of deploying the technology, but one consultant said it was still wise to offer it as standard. ""Consumers are holding on to their phones for three or four years, and don't want something that will become obsolete in that lifetime,"" said Ben Wood. ""And this launch represents a unique opportunity: Huawei is on the back foot as it doesn't have access to Google's suite of apps, and Apple currently doesn't have a 5G-capable iPhone."" The Z Flip is the second smartphone Samsung has made with a flexible screen The Z Flip, however, is limited to 4G. Several of its features - including a clamshell design with a small display on the outside and a 6.7in foldable screen on the inside -had already been revealed by Samsung in a TV advert on Sunday. It represents the firm's second attempt at a foldable after the troubled launch of the Galaxy Fold tablet-phone hybrid. This time round, the concept is a tall-screened phone that can be used one-handed when opened, and made wallet-sized when closed. The hinge mechanism has also evolved. It now incorporates tiny brushes to sweep away dirt and dust particles. In addition, it can hold the device partially open, which Samsung is pitching as being helpful for taking selfies or recording vlogs. The firm says it can be opened and closed more than 200,000 times. The Z Flip can be placed part-open on a flat surface The other big change is to the display, which now features a substance Samsung calls ""folding glass"". ""You clearly notice that the screen is much more resistant than the Fold's, which should reduce the risk of scratching,"" said Mr Francisco. ""It's still probably not as resistant as a normal smartphone, but you can feel its quality."" The Z Flip will cost $1,380 in the US and Â£1,300 in the UK and becomes available on 14 February. The original Galaxy Fold had to be re-engineered after several reviewers complained their examples had become damaged It will compete with Motorola's Razr, which has a similar design. But both are expected to sell in far smaller quantities than the S20 range. ""There's a lot of excitement around this new category, but [for most] they are prohibitively expensive,"" said Paolo Pescatore from PP Foresight. 25 January:Lunar New Year, one of the biggest festivals of the year, takes place. Millions of people travel home, and many companies close or slow down production. 27 January:Chinese authorities officially extend the holiday period until 10 February to try and contain the spread of the virus. The move affects suppliers of smartphone components for Samsung, Apple, and others. 30 January-3 February:Apple announces all its stores and offices in china will remain shut until at least 9 February,as does Microsoft and Google, while Samsung closes its flagship store in Shanghai. 7 February:Aspressure mounts from companies around the worldfor China to re-open its production facilities, Apple supplierFoxconn repurposes part of its production line to make surgical masks. 10 February:Foxconn receives permission to reopen two major plants in Zhenghzou and Shenzhen. But Reuters news agency reports that only 10% of workers turned up, citing an unnamed source. Other factories remain closed - and some local authorities tell factories not to reopen until 1 March.

HS2 go-ahead 'controversial and difficult',"This video can not be played Johnson: Cabinet has given HS2 ""green signal"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that the controversial HS2 high-speed rail link will be built. The first phase of the route will travel between London and Birmingham, with a second phase going to Manchester and Leeds. ""It has been a controversial and difficult decision,"" Mr Johnson said. The prime minister added he was going to appoint a full-time minister to oversee the project and criticised the HS2 company's management of the scheme. ""I cannot say that HS2 limited has distinguished itself in the handling of local communities. The cost forecasts have exploded, but poor management to date has not detracted from the fundamental value of the project."" The prime minister said that a series of measures would be taken to ""restore discipline to the programme"". Supporters of HS2 say it will improve transport times, increase capacity, create jobs and rebalance the UK's economy. Once it is built, journeys will be shorter. London to Birmingham travel times will be cut from one hour, 21 minutes to 52 minutes, according to the Department for Transport. And while it is being built, it is expected to create thousands of jobs and provide a stimulus to economic growth. The first phase of the high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham was due to open at the end of 2026. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs in September thatthe first trains may not run on the route until some time between 2028 and 2031. The second phase to Manchester and Leeds was due to open in 2032-33, but that has been pushed back to 2035-40. However, Mr Johnson told MPs that he hoped if work started immediately that trains ""could be running by the end of the decade"". Mixed reaction from MPs on HS2 route How much? Six reasons why HS2 is so expensive HS2 in Manchester: 'Waste of money' or 'good news'? The spiralling cost of the project has sparked a backlash. The cost set out in the 2015 Budget was set at just under Â£56bn, but one independent estimate puts the cost as high as Â£106bn. Mr Johnson added: ""We will, in line with the review, investigate the current costs to identify where savings can be made in phase one without a total redesign."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson did not deserve praise for giving the project the go-ahead. ""The Labour Party supports HS2 as a means to boost regional economies and slash climate emissions. It is essential for boosting rail capacity and freeing up other lines,"" he said. ""But we don't see why the government should get a slap on the back for announcing it is going ahead. ""After all, it's only because of the abject failure of successive Conservative governments to keep on top of the costs, that the project's future was in any doubt."" Ron and Anne Ryall have been ordered to leave their home next month Not everybody is benefitting from HS2 being given the go-ahead. Ron and Anne Ryallhave been ordered to leave their home next monthas the route is due to run right through it. Ron told BBC Breakfast:,external""It's completely wrecked our lives. I'm finding it difficult that someone can just walk into your life and destroy it. My family has lived in this lane for 100 years. I was born here."" The village hall in Burton Green is also due to be torn down for HS2 Meanwhile, residents of a Warwickshire village admitted they were resigned to the final decision to build the rail line - even though it will split their lives in half. Burton Green village, home to 640 people,will effectively be bisected by the line. Rona Taylor, who runs the village's residents' association, said: ""It's a very frustrating day because we have opposed this for 10 years."" However, Cate Walter, a director of Rhino Safety based near Crewe,told the BBC:""For Crewe this is absolutely crucial. We're a town been surrounded by a lot of regeneration areas in recent years, but have not been the focus of the regeneration ourselves. ""The investment in our very local economy that HS2 should bring will be absolutely crucial for growing businesses in our area."" Lib Dem MP Munira Wilson said: ""Key to cutting carbon emissions and tackling climate change is cutting domestic flights and moving people on to our railways and so that's why the HS2 announcement is to be welcomed and building a third runway at Heathrow is an act of environmental vandalism."" Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said HS2 would ""destroy or damage hundreds of important wildlife sites, areas of ancient woodland and local nature reserves"". Jude Brimble, national secretary of the GMB trade union, which represents HS2 workers, said: ""The reality is that HS2 is happening and the government should get on with it. ""Thousands of skilled jobs depend on the project in construction and the supply chain."" Matthew Fell, of UK employers' group the CBI, said the decision to back HS2 was ""exactly the sort of bold, decisive action required to inject confidence in the economy"". He added: ""It sends the right signal around the world that the UK is open for business. HS2 shows the government's commitment to levelling up the nations and regions of the UK."" Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers' organisation Make UK, said: ""Industry will applaud this bold, sensible and pragmatic decision which will help change the country for the better. ""Government now has a once in a generation opportunity to develop a fully integrated transport plan for the whole country which it should grab with both hands.""

Ofcom set to gain powers to police UK social media,"New powers will be given to the watchdog Ofcom to force social media firms to act over harmful content. Until now, firms like Facebook, Tiktok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have largely been self-regulating. The companies have defended their own rules about taking down unacceptable content, but critics say independent rules are needed to keep people safe. It is unclear what penalties Ofcom will be able to enforce to target violence, cyber-bullying and child abuse. There have been widespread calls for social media firms to take more responsibility for their content, especially afterthe death of Molly Russellwho took her own life after viewing graphic content on Instagram. The government has now announced it is ""minded""  to grant new powers to Ofcom - which currently only regulates the media and the telecoms industry, not internet safety. How can governments regulate social media? Doctors demand social media firms hand over data Molly Russell: Instagram bans self-harm drawings Ofcom will have the power to make tech firms responsible for protecting people from harmful content such as violence, terrorism, cyber-bullying and child abuse - and platforms will need to ensure that content is removed quickly. They will also be expected to ""minimise the risks"" of it appearing at all. The regulator has just announced the appointment of a new chief executive, Dame Melanie Dawes, who will take up the role in March. Molly Russell's family found she had been accessing distressing material about depression and suicide on Instagram ""There are many platforms who ideally would not have wanted regulation, but I think that's changing,"" said Digital Secretary Baroness Nicky Morgan. ""I think they understand now that actually regulation is coming."" Julian Knight, chair elect of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee which scrutinises social media companies, called for ""a muscular approach"" to regulation. ""That means more than a hefty fine - it means having the clout to disrupt the activities of businesses that fail to comply, and ultimately, the threat of a prison sentence for breaking the law,"" he said. In a statement, Facebook said it had ""long called"" for new regulation, and said it was ""looking forward to carrying on the discussion"" with the government and wider industry. Communication watchdog Ofcom already regulates television and radio broadcasters, including the BBC, and deals with complaints about them. This is the government's first response to the Online Harms consultation it carried out in the UK in 2019, which received 2,500 replies. The new rules will apply to firms hosting user-generated content, including comments, forums and video-sharing - that is likely to include Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. The intention is that government sets the direction of the policy but gives Ofcom the freedom to draw up and adapt the details. By doing this, the watchdog should have the ability to tackle new online threats as they emerge without the need for further legislation. A full response will be published in the spring. Children's charity the NSPCC welcomed the news. ""Too many times social media companies have said: 'We don't like the idea of children being abused on our sites, we'll do something, leave it to us,'"" said chief executive Peter Wanless. ""Thirteen self-regulatory attempts to keep children safe online have failed. ""Statutory regulation is essential."" Seyi Akiwowo set up the campaign group Glitch after experiencing online harassment. Seyi Akiwowo set up the online abuse awareness group Glitch after experiencing sexist and racist harassment online after a video of her giving a talk in her role as a councillor was posted on a neo-Nazi forum. ""When I first suffered abuse the response of the tech companies was below [what I'd hoped],"" she said. ""I am excited by the Online Harms Bill - it places the duty of care on these multi-billion pound tech companies."" UK plans social media and internet watchdog In many countries, social media platforms are permitted to regulate themselves, as long as they adhere to local laws on illegal material. Germany introduced the NetzDG Law in 2018, which states that social media platforms with more than two million registered German users have to review and remove illegal content within 24 hours of being posted or face fines of up to â¬50m (Â£42m). Australia passed the Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material Act in April 2019, introducing criminal penalties for social media companies, possible jail sentences for tech executives for up to three years and financial penalties worth up to 10% of a company's global turnover. China blocks many western tech giants including Twitter, Google and Facebook, and the state monitors Chinese social apps for politically sensitive content.
