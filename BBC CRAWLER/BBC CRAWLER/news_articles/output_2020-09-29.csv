Plea not to axe Â£20 a week benefits âlifelineâ,"There are warnings more children could be plunged into poverty Millions of the UK's poorest households could see their incomes cut by Â£20 a week from April unless a ""lifeline"" payment continues, charities warn. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and others are calling on the chancellor to make a temporary rise in Universal Credit, plus other benefits, permanent. The yearlong hike was introduced in April, after the UK went into lockdown, to help those who had lost their jobs. But there are no signs it will be extended beyond next April. Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week outlined hisWinter Economy Plan,external, but there was no commitment to keeping the temporary Universal Credit increase. Now some 50 children's charities, food bank providers, housing organisations, benefit and debt advisors, disability groups, and others say if this ""lifeline"" is cut it risks plunging struggling households into poverty. ""Falling incomes and rising costs throughout the pandemic have put families under immense financial pressure, but the Â£20 uplift has been a lifeline that has enabled many of them to keep their heads above water and has stopped us seeing a marked surge in poverty levels,"" the coalition of groups say in a letter to the chancellor. ""However, if the uplift ends in April 2021, this good work risks being undermined."" Modelling by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggests around 16 million people will be in households facing an overnight income loss equivalent to Â£1,040 a year, with those on the lowest incomes and families with children being hardest hit. They say 700,000 more people will be driven into poverty, including 300,000 children, while a further 500,000 of those already in poverty will be plunged into deep poverty - a measure which is gauged by being more than 50% below the poverty line. ""We are therefore urging you to make the uplift permanent and stop families being cut adrift whilst they need help to stay afloat,"" the letter adds. The letter also urges the extension of this lifeline to claimants of legacy benefits who are currently excluded from the additional Â£20 a week support. ""Further, it is simply not right that those on legacy benefits, who are mostly sick or disabled people and carers, and so have been most at risk during this pandemic, have not been thrown an equivalent lifeline,"" it says. ""We urge you to follow the advice of the Social Security Advisory Committee and support 1.5 million more people by applying an equivalent uplift to those on legacy benefits who have so far been excluded from increases."" The Joseph Rowntree Foundation is an independent social change organisation working to solve UK poverty. Other signatories include Barnado's, Citizens Advice, Child Poverty Action Group, Macmillan Cancer Support, Oxfam, The Salvation Army, Save the Children, and Shelter. It comes a week after think tank the Resolution Foundation issued a similar warning. It pointed out that unemployment may rise strongly next April, which would add to the hardship of the Â£20 boost being withdrawn.

'No reason' for egg freezing 10-year storage limit,"The 10-year limit for storing eggs frozen for social reasons could be scrapped to give people concerned about declining fertility more time and options, says a UK ethics body. Nuffield Council on Bioethics says consumers also need more data on costs and success rates to inform choices. It criticises methods used by some companies to sell the service. The government is assessing the 10-year rule. Eggs or sperm frozen for medical reasons can be stored for longer. The Nuffield team says research suggests women can feel under pressure to freeze their eggs to avoid regrets later in life, and it is important that marketing strategies do not exploit these anxieties. Some services have used Prosecco-fuelled marketing events and computer algorithms to target women online with adverts, says Nuffield. Egg freezing paid for by companies as an employment benefit is another cause for concern. While some may view it as a workplace ""gender equaliser"" with positive effects on women's salaries, it might also push women to delay motherhood to show commitment to their career, says the team. Egg-freezing: What's the success rate? The NHS only funds egg freezing for medical reasons, not social ones. Someone who has their eggs frozen for medical reasons - in advance of cancer treatment, for example - can apply to have them stored for up to 55 years. Nuffield says there appear to be few arguments against increasing the storage limit for social egg freezing. Dr John Appleby, lecturer in medical ethics at Lancaster University, said: ""The UK's 10-year egg freezing rule for social egg freezing is not fit for purpose and this briefing highlights how we have very little reason for maintaining it any longer."" Sarah Norcross, from the assisted conception debate group Progress Educational Trust, said: ""With more women than ever choosing to freeze their eggs, it is time for the law to be changed."" Frances Flinter, Nuffield Council member and emeritus professor of clinical genetics at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""It's vital for women thinking about freezing their eggs to be able to make informed choices. ""To do this, they need easy access to data on their chances of success across various stages of the process - from freezing and thawing eggs, to having a live birth. But they also need clinics to be frank about the process, and about what is known and unknown about egg freezing."" According to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, around a fifth of IVF treatments using a patient's own frozen eggs result in the birth of a baby, based on figures for 2017. Not all eggs survive thawing. If they do, the chance of a live birth depends to a large extent on the age of the woman when the eggs were collected, with success more likely for those under 35. The average cost of having eggs collected and frozen for social reasons is Â£3,350, with additional Â£500-Â£1,500 costs for medication. Storage costs are extra and tend to be Â£125-Â£350 per year.

Government's Brexit plan gets MPs' final backing,"MPs have given their final backing to government plans to override parts of its Brexit agreement with the EU. Amid concerns that the move would break international law, ministers agreed to give Parliament a say before ever using the powers they would be granted by the Internal Market Bill. The legislation, which passed through the House of Commons by 340 votes to 256, will now go to the House of Lords. The government says it will help protect the integrity of the UK. But Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the EU argue that - in allowing the government to undo parts of a treaty signed by the EU and UK - it could damage the country's international reputation and standing. The UK's five living former prime ministers - Sir John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May - have spoken out against the bill. Gove stands by Brexit bill after EU concerns Why does the UK need another Brexit deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Seven things that will change on 1 January The parliamentary debate on Tuesday came as the EU and the UK began a ninth - and final - scheduled round of talks aimed at securing a trade deal. The post-Brexit transition period - in which the UK has kept to EU trading rules and remained inside its customs union and single market - runs out at the end of the year. Theresa May has said she cannot back the legislation If the sides fail to reach a deal, the UK would trade with the EU after that on World Trade Organization rules. This would mean tariffs on most goods which UK businesses send to the EU, while the UK could also apply tariffs to EU goods. The Internal Market Bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after 1 January. It gives the government the power to change aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement, a legally binding deal governing the terms of Brexit made earlier this year. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses Ministers say the bill would provide a ""safety net"" in case the EU interprets the agreement, in particular the section on Northern Ireland, in an ""extreme and unreasonable"" way. The section -known as the protocol- is designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats opposed the bill, while the EU has asked the UK government to remove ""contentious parts"" of it by Wednesday. In the Commons, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the legislation would protect the ""shared prosperity"" of the UK's nations, adding: ""It demonstrates that, as a union, our country is greater than the sum of its parts."" For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said it was ""unprecedented"" to ""break"" a treaty signed by the UK and EU, and that the government's stance was being ""noticed around the world"". Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, said ministers had ""typically and arrogantly ploughed on"" despite opposition to the bill in the devolved nations. The Democratic Unionist Party supported the government, which already has a Commons majority of almost 80. No Conservative MPs voted against the bill at its final stage - and although 21, including Mrs May, did not vote this does not necessarily mean they abstained.

Manchester Arena bomb plotters 'still at large',"Top row (left to right): Alison Howe, Martyn Hett, Lisa Lees, Courtney Boyle, Eilidh MacLeod, Elaine McIver, Georgina Callander, Jane Tweddle - Middle row (left to right): John Atkinson, Kelly Brewster, Liam Curry, Chloe Rutherford, Marcin Klis, Angelika Klis, Megan Hurley, Michelle Kiss - Bottom row (left to right): Nell Jones, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Philip Tron, Saffie-Rose Roussos, Sorrell Leczkowski, Wendy Fawell The brothers who carried out the Manchester Arena attack ""did not act alone"" and others who knew about it are still ""at large"", an inquiry has heard. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb in May 2017. His brother Hashem wasjailed for 55 yearsin August for helping plan the atrocity. A barrister representing British Transport Police at the public inquiry said it was ""obvious"" they had help. ""What of the other potential murderers?"" asked Patrick Gibbs QC during his opening statement on behalf of British Transport Police (BTP) at the inquiry sitting at Manchester Magistrates' Court. ""We don't yet know their names."" He cited the ""intricate, lengthy and carefully planned preparations"" of the brothers, detailed earlier in the inquiry and during Hashem's trial. ""It will be obvious, I suggest, to all of us that those brothers did not act alone. ""They must have received technical help, financial help and training and support from other people,"" Mr Gibbs said. ""Other people must have known or at least suspected what they were up to and those other people are at large."" CCTV caught Salman Abedi in the arena foyer just seconds before he blew himself up Mr Gibbs suggested the ""mountain"" of money spent on the inquiry would be worthwhile ""if one or more of those accessories to mass murder... can be brought to justice"". He said although BTP was responsible for policing the arena, as it is on the site of Manchester Victoria railway station, it had no intelligence about the bomber, who was known to security services and counter-terrorism police. Despite Abedi's three trips to the arena in the days before the attack on ""hostile reconnaissance"" a young man with a backpack at a railway station was not unusual, the inquiry heard. Two BTP officers had missed Abedi ""by a matter of seconds"" at 20:48 when they checked on the toilets while the bomber was in there with his backpack, Mr Gibbs said. And at the time BTP officers were in the foyer - where the bomb was detonated at 22:30 - Abedi was ""out of sight"" hiding as best he could in a mezzanine area for an hour before the attack. Four BTP officers at Victoria Station immediately ran to the scene, helping evacuate the dying and injured, Mr Gibbs said. The ""overall"" assessment of BTP's response was ""extremely good"", he said, and he had ""nothing negative"" to say about other organisations, such as Greater Manchester Police, fire or ambulance services. However, he described a ""carousel of blame"" which he said had been ""sent spinning"" by Jonathan Laidlaw QC, representing Showsec - the company employed to provide arena security. Mr Laidlaw said it was ""not a question of buck-passing"" but stated that Showsec provided crowd management services. He said security was only one element of its remit and it mainly employed students part-time so there were limits to what could be expected  in terms of a counter-terrorism deterrent. It was also said the arena's foyer is a public thoroughfare with access to the railway station. SMG, operators of the arena, admitted there were ""shortcomings and ""inadequacies"" in its risk assessments but Andrew O'Connor QC said SMG did have security measures in place that were ""at the time considered generally appropriate to mitigate terrorism risk"".

What you need to know about the Trump tax story,"The New York Times has obtained decades of tax information on US President Donald Trump. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"", the newspaper says. The report,external, which Mr Trump has called ""fake news"", comes a little over a month before the presidential election, when he will take on Democratic nominee Joe Biden. There is a lot to get through, so here are some of the main points you need to know. You can read our detailed full story here. The president paid just $750 (Â£580) in federal income tax both in 2016, the year he ran for the US presidency, and in his first year in the White House He paid no such taxes in 11 of 18 years of tax records examined by the newspaper The president has managed to lower his taxes through reporting hefty losses on his businesses After the success of The Apprentice TV show he did initially pay significant taxes - $95m over 18 years. But he later got most of that back via a $72.9 million federal tax refund. The refund remains under review Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, has helped reduce the family's tax bill through large ""consulting fees"" He is personally responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, most of which will come due in the next four years He has claimed tax deductions on expenses including $70,000 of hair styling for television The New York Times (NYT) reporting alleges large scale tax avoidance, which may be controversial but is not illegal. Many wealthy Americans use loopholes to reduce the amount of tax they are legally bound to pay. Even so, in 2017, the average federal income tax rate for the highest-earning .001% percent of tax filers was 24.1%,according to the IRS.,external This is about the same as the net average tax rate paid by the average American worker in 2019,according to data,externalfrom the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The NYT says Mr Trump has paid about $400m less in combined federal income taxes over the last two decades compared to a very rich person who paid the average for that group each year. His presidential predecessors Barack Obama and George Bush often paid in excess of $100,000 in federal income taxes while in office. The Trump Organization has joined the president in denying the NYT's allegations. The company's chief legal officer, Alan Garten, told the newspaper that ""most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate"". Mr Trump has come under fire from Democrats for years for not making his tax returns public as his predecessors did. His lawyers have argued that he enjoys total immunity while in office and that Congress has no valid justification to seek the records. In July, the US Supreme Court ruled that Mr Trump's financial records could be examined by prosecutors in New York. In a related case, the court ruled that this information did not have to be shared with Congress. The matter remains under appeal in lower courts so the records have not been handed over in New York. This video can not be played Trump: Supreme Court ruling a 'witch hunt' and 'hoax' Mr Trump has denied wrongdoing and called the investigation into his tax affairs a ""witch hunt"". The president also remains engaged in a long-running battle with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over the $72.9m tax refund he received. He could be forced to pay more than $100 million if a ruling were to go against him, the NYT says. The president will certainly have to face many more questions over these allegations in the run-up to the 3 November election. It is a matter likely to come up in the presidential debates. He is trailing Joe Biden in opinion polls, as the Democrats and other critics continue to accuse him of mishandling the coronavirus crisis. The allegations of tax avoidance will not be welcomed by his campaign, as millions of Americans deal with the financial fallout from the pandemic. At the same time, it's unclear how much political damage this will do. Four years ago, when Hilary Clinton upbraided him over how little tax he paid, Mr Trump replied: ""That makes me smart."" Several leading Republicans have backed him on that. This is also far from the first controversy Mr Trump has needed to overcome in the run-up to an election. He won the 2016 election despite a barrage of sexual misconduct allegations and the emergence of a video in which he used vulgar language about women.

Trump or Biden - Who is winning in polls?,"Voters in America will decide on 3 November whether Donald Trump remains in the White House for another four years. The Republican president is being challenged by Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden, who is best known as Barack Obama's vice-president but has been in US politics since the 1970s. As election day approaches, polling companies will be trying to gauge the mood of the nation by asking voters which candidate they prefer. We'll be keeping track of those polls here and trying to work out what they can and can't tell us about who will win the election. National polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, but they're not necessarily a good way to predict the result of the election. In 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton led in the polls and won nearly three million more votes than Donald Trump, but she still lost - that's because the US usesan electoral college system, so winning the most votes doesn't always win you the election. With that caveat aside, Joe Biden has been ahead of Donald Trump in most national polls since the start of the year. He has hovered around 50% in recent months and has had a 10-point lead on occasions. DEMOCRAT BIDEN 52% REPUBLICAN TRUMP 44% Trend line showing average voting intention based on individual polls average voting intention based on individual polls 30 days until Election day TheBBC poll of pollslooks at theindividual national polls from the last 14 days and createstrend lines using the median value, i.e. the value in the middle of the set of numbers. By contrast, in 2016the polls were far less clear,externaland just a couple of percentage points separated Mr Trump and his rival in the days before the election. A simple guide to the US election What to look out for on election night When might we get a result? Trump or Biden? You decide How to follow the election on the BBC Results in maps and charts Full coverage of the US election As Mrs Clinton discovered in 2016, the number of votes you win is less important than where you win them. Most states nearly always vote the same way, meaning that in reality there are just a handful of states where both candidates stand a chance of winning. These are the places where the election will be won and lost and are known as battleground states. In the electoral college system the US uses to elect its president, each state is given a number of votes based on how many members it sends to Congress - House and Senate. A total of 538 electoral college votes are up for grabs, so a candidate needs to hit 270 to win. As the map above shows, some battleground states have a lot more electoral college votes on offer than others so candidates often spend a lot more time campaigning in them. What is the electoral college? At the moment, polls in the battleground states look good for Mr Biden - although the margins have tightened in recent days. He appears to be ahead in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - three industrial states his Republican rival won by margins of less than 1% to clinch victory in 2016. Please update your browser to see full interactive Source: Real Clear Politics, Associated Press. Last updated: 3 November For Mr Trump, it's the battleground states he won big in 2016 that his campaign team will be most worried about. His winning margin in Iowa, Ohio and Texas was between 8-10% back then but it looks much closer in all three this time. That's one of the reasons why some political analysts rate his chances of re-election as low as things stand. The Economist,externalthinks Mr Biden is ""very likely"" to beat Mr Trump whileFiveThirtyEight,external, a political analysis website, sees Mr Biden as ""favoured"" to win the election but says the presidentcould still come out on top,external. What has Trump said about your country? Donald Trump and Joe Biden went head-to-head in two live TV debates. Thefirst, on 29 September, was a chaotic affair, with Mr Trump's combative approach stamping out any chance of a real debate. ACBS News/YouGov poll,externaltaken straight afterwards suggested it was a good night for Mr Biden. Of those who watched, 48% said Mr Biden was the winner while 41% went for Mr Trump - a similar split to national polling averages. Nearly 70% of people said the debate made them feel ""annoyed"". Inthe second debate, on 22 October, organisers introduced a mute button to help police the arguments. But it was a much more restrained President Trump on show and there was a much greater focus on the policies of the two candidates. While that seemed to help Mr Trump somewhat, snap polls still suggested viewers thought Mr Biden's performance was more impressive. ACNN poll,externalfound 53% of viewers thought the Democrat had done a better job in the debate, while 39% went with Mr Trump. AYouGov snap poll,externalwas similar, with 54% saying Mr Biden had won compared to 35% for the president. So while Mr Trump put in a better performance, it's unlikely to have been enough to change the balance of the race on its own. Key takeaways from the Trump-Biden showdown We only had a couple of days to mull over the first debate before President Trump'sbombshell tweet,externalin the early hours of 2 October revealed he and the first lady had tested positive for coronavirus. While the pandemic has dominated headlines in the US since the start of the year, the focus had shifted to the Supreme Court after the death of long-serving Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September. So Mr Trump's positive coronavirus test put his response to the pandemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 230,000 people in the US, back under the spotlight. According to data from anABC News/Ipsos poll,external, just 35% of Americans approve of how the president has handled the crisis. That figure climbs among Republicans, but only to 76%. On his own health, 72% of respondents said that Mr Trump did not take the ""risk of contracting the virus seriously enough,"" while the same number said he failed to take ""the appropriate precautions when it came to his personal health"". A similarYahoo News/YouGov poll,externalfound that about half of respondents believed he could have avoided contracting the disease altogether if he had practised greater social distancing and worn a face mask. Why are Covid-19 infections rising again in US? This video can not be played Can we believe the polls this time? It's easy to dismiss the polls by saying they got it wrong in 2016 and President Trump frequently does exactly that. But it's not entirely true. Most national polls did have Hillary Clinton ahead by a few percentage points, but that doesn't mean they were wrong, since she won three million more votes than her rival. Pollsters did havesome problems in 2016,external- notably a failure to properly represent voters without a college degree - meaning Mr Trump's advantage in some key battleground states wasn't spotted until late in the race, if at all. Most polling companies have corrected this now. But this year there's even more uncertainty than normal due to the coronavirus pandemic and the effect it's having on both the economy and how people will vote in November, so all polls should be read with some scepticism.

LiveLiveBiden and Trump tour venue ahead of first debate5 minutes ago,"The long-awaited battle between Donald Trump and Joe Biden was scrappy and acrimonious They clashed over Covid, crime, healthcare, their families - and even with the moderator Far-right group Proud Boys celebrated on social media after President Trump sidestepped condemning them by name Fox News anchor Chris Wallace had his hands full throughout as Biden and Trump interrupted each other Low points included Biden telling Trump to 'shut up' and Trump questioning his intelligence Tens of millions of US voters were expected to have tuned in to watch the event in Cleveland, Ohio Edited by Mal Siret That's all from us. Our live coverage has come to an end. We hope you tune in for the next election debate - the race for the White House could still go either way. This live page was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Holly Honderich, Sam Proffitt, Marianna Brady, Max Matza, Boer Deng, Matt Davis, Joshua Nevett, Mal Siret, Anthony Zurcher, Georgina Rannard, Rebecca Seales, Vicky Baker, Jessica Murphy and Jessica Lussenhop. Many thanks for reading. We're ending our live coverage of the debate and its aftermath soon. Thanks for joining us for what proved to be an explosive encounter between two bitter rivals for the US presidency. Before we wrap up, here is a summary of some of the key moments before, during and after the debate in Cleveland, Ohio. For more on the first debate, you can read ournews story,analysisand trove of explainers - including those onhow the US election worksandthe latest polling data. Reality Check After polls close in the US presidential election, it could take days - or even weeks - to find out if Joe Biden or Donald Trump has won. Millions more Americans are expected to vote by post because of coronavirus, meaning a delay in counting all the votes is highly likely. Will the winner be announced on 3 November? It's very possible that it won't. Although the result
of a US presidential vote is usually known on the night of the election, this
year is very different with so many votes being cast by post. In 2016, nearly a quarter of votes were cast by post. It's estimated
that this time it could be more than double â around 80 million â as states
employ measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. There are also concerns that the US Postal Service,
responsible for delivering the postal ballots, will struggle to cope with the
demand. It has faced budget cutbacks and critics of Trump have
accused him of deliberately blocking additional funding. Most states only include ballots received by the time polls
close on election day. But some, like California, will accept them as long
as they are sent by the day of the election, even if they arrive a week later. Will Trump try to overturn
the results and ask for a recount of sorts? This is unknown. Trump has made clear his mistrust
of the postal voting system and says there will be ""tremendous"" fraud involved.
This could be the basis of a challenge to the result if he loses. When asked if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of
power if he loses the election, Trump said: ""We'll have to see what
happens"". He also said the election result could end up in the US Supreme
Court as a result of doubts over the integrity of postal voting. A recount of votes would certainly delay the outcome, but is
not unprecedented. In 2000, a dispute in Florida took more than a month to
resolve before George W Bush was ultimately declared the winner. There is no love lost between Trump and Biden With round one of debating over, Trump and Biden are approaching the final strait of the race for the White House. The presidential election is now just 34 days away, giving Trump and Biden little time to dust themselves down for their next head-to-head clash. Two presidential debates remain on the agenda:  Vice-President Mike Pence and Biden's running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, will also lock horns in a debate:  Like the first debate in Ohio, they will all take place from 21:00-22:30ET (02:00-03:30BST), with no commercial interruptions. Expect more sparks to fly. This year's US presidential election could come down to results in just a few key states.
Most states are tipped to vote one way or another - so we have already assigned 188 votes to Trump and 233 to Biden. Can Biden wrestle enough away to seize the presidency? Or will Trump romp home to a second term?
It's all about the race to 270 electoral votes - and this time you decide. Play our game to predict whether Trump or Biden will win,externalthe key states at the election. As the presidential election draws closer, you may be asking yourself: how does it all work? Well, we've put together areally simple guide to the election, which could shape the US and the world for years to come. By now, you probably know the candidates are incumbent Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden. When Americans go to the polls on 3 November, they will cast ballots for a group of officials who represent Trump and Biden in the electoral college. Each state gets a certain number of electoral-college votes partly based on its population. There are a total of 538 votes up for grabs, so the victor is the candidate that wins 270 or more. This means voters decide state-level contests rather than the national one, which is why it's possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - in what is called the popular vote - but still be defeated by the electoral college. Got it? If not, you canread more about how the electoral college works here. Voters around the US tuned in to see President Donald Trump and former
Vice-President Joe Biden spar in the first presidential debate. As the exchange came to a close, we asked members of the BBC voter panel
how the candidates performed - and if their answers had swayed their vote. Keirsten,
undecided voter:""I definitely
think Biden won the debate, but I don't think that was hard to do because there
wasnât a lot that I was expecting from Donald Trump. At the end of the 'day the
loser was really us, the American people. A lot of people were expecting this
to go the way that it did."" Brian,
undecided voter:""I wouldn't
call anyone a winner. It was expected to be chaotic, [and] it was chaotic.
Trump controlled the message with more interrupting, talking and controlling.
Biden withstood it better than I thought he would. He got a little hot in the
collar a few times but I didnât see any big eye-catching gaffes. I thought Biden
had a good few moments where he looked directly at the camera and aimed his
message at the public. I think both sides will say they win, but itâs like
comparing apples to oranges."" Ariel, Trump voter:""I thought nobody won
the debate. I really understand that Trump is not a very seasoned politician.
When he did his best was when he was talking about his policies, what heâs done
and what heâs going to do. But there were other times Biden would say something
and heâd try to debunk it."" Josh, Biden
voter:""Biden came
out on top. He came out with a strong message and I can't tell you enough how
much it mattered that he looked into the camera. Trump was disrespecting Chris
Wallace. We already knew he's disrespectful but now America all watched him
disrespect Chris Wallace at the same time."" Meet the voters we watched the debate with. Peskov said Russia did not wish to intervene in US affairs The Russian government is watching the presidential campaign in the US closely, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said in the wake of the first debate. ""But we do not want to make any statements as this could be viewed as an attempt to intervene [into the election process],"" Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday,according to Reuters news agency,external. ""Russia has never, is not and is not going to intervene in US domestic affairs,"" he added. That statement contradicts US intelligence agencies, which accused Russia's government of interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Intelligence chiefs said Russia wanted to help boost Trump's campaign, including by spreading disinformation online, but the Kremlin has denied the allegations. In August, the head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) saidRussia was among several countries seeking to influence the presidential election this year. Trump cut a confrontation figure in the first debate We can bring you some more reaction from Robin Wright, a foreign affairs analyst who has written extensively about the upcoming election. She has seen many debates in her time, yet none were more dispiriting than this one. It was, she said, ""one of the lowest points in presidential debate history"". She said the chaotic bust-up not only raised questions about the future of presidential debates, but the future of America's political system. ""It's hard to absorb what has just happened and I suspect that is even more true of people watching around the world who once thought that America had the kind of democracy, even if flawed, that they aspired to,"" Wright told the BBC. ""This was not just 90 minutes of chaos,"" she added. ""It was America, the history of America in 2020."" Both Democrat and Republican supporters have been having their say on the presidential debate. Naturally, the reaction has been partisan on both sides. Here's what some observers told the BBC and other news agencies. Republicans Randi Reed is a Republican and a Trump supporter from Nevada. She described the debate as a ""kindergarten cat fight"". She said the president's ""gunning for the jugular"" was ""exactly what we expected from Trump - the rude, crude interrupting"". ""We went in knowing who we were supporting,"" she said. Doug Miller has served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention, he told AFP news agency he ""thought the president performed very well"". ""But I feel for most of the evening, he was not only debating 'Sleepy Joe Biden', he was having to debate [moderator] Chris Wallace, who I think is a total fool,"" he said. Democrats Bilal Aksoy is a student and a registered Democrat voter in Pennsylvania. He said the debate only served to reinforce the views he held about both candidates. ""I knew that Trump didn't believe in science. He refuses to acknowledge climate change and he refuses to act on the global pandemic that we're living through,"" he said. Jamal Simmons is a Democratic Party strategist who has worked as an adviser to former President Barack Obama's campaign. He said Trump missed opportunities to reach out to undecided voters. ""I think Donald Trump went out for a boxing match, went out to just clinch it up for as many rounds as he could,"" he said. Reality Check During an exchange about Biden's eldest son Beau, who served in the US military and died of cancer in 2015, Trump brought up Biden's other son, Hunter. Trump: ""I don't know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the militaryâ¦ dishonourably dischargedâ¦ for cocaine use."" Biden replied that it was not true that his son had been dishonourably discharged. Hunter Biden was discharged from the US Navy in 2014, and media reports at the timesaid that a navy drug test had detected the presence of cocaine.,external However, he was not dishonourably discharged, which is the highest level of punishment the military can hand out. Readmore about the claims made throughout the debate here. ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,"" Trump said in response to a question asking him to condemn white supremacist and militia groups. The Proud Boys is a far-right, anti-immigrant group witha history of street violence against its left-wing opponents. Trumpâs apparent refusal to denounce the group proved to be one of the most controversial and hotly debated moments of the first debate. In case you missed it, here's a video of the exchange with debate moderator Chris Wallace. This video can not be played 'Proud Boys, stand back and stand by' - Trump Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington Joe Biden makes a trip to China while serving as Barack Obama's vice-president Like Donald Trump, Joe Biden wants to end the forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but he would keep a small troop presence in both to help battle terrorism. On Russia, the relationship at the top would certainly look different, likely little else. President Trump often seemed ready to personally forgive Vladimir Putin for violating international norms. But his administration punished Russia with sanctions, and that would probably continue under a Biden presidency. On China there is rare bipartisan agreement to get tough with Beijing over trade and other issues, the question is about tactics. Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices"", but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals. The sharp elbows of the Trump administration have been successful in winning global support for a boycott of Chinese communications technology. That's part of a serious escalation in US efforts to push back against Beijing on many fronts, anchored in accusations that it mishandled the Coronavirus. This campaign is led by Mr Trump's China hawks: strategic competition they call it; strategic confrontation, is how some analysts describe it. Mr Biden would more actively seek areas of cooperation with a rising China. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring This Channel One news ticker reads: ""The debate has been dubbed the most scandalous in US history."" The Trump-Biden
debate is a lead story on Russian TV this morning, with news bulletins focusing
on the chaotic nature of the event. State TV's Channel
One: ""A political theatre of the absurd. A verbal duel which has been dubbed
the most scandalous in the history of election campaigning in the USâ¦ The most
important political show in the presidential race has probably never been so
chaotic before."" Pro-Kremlin NTV
television: ""There was no constructive dialogue. The rivals kept interrupting
each other and instead of a balanced discussion they chose the path of mutual
insults."" Channel 5, St
Petersburg: ""The rivals have crossed all boundaries."" Pro-Kremlin Ren TV: ""The election debate between Biden and Trump has been called America's greatest
disgrace."" Presidential debates have captivated Americans for decades. They can be bruising, gruelling and sometimes explosive affairs - as last night's debate between Biden and Trump proved. Over the years, some debates have stood out more than others. The first ever televised debate in 1960 pitted young Democratic SenatorJohn F Kennedyagainst the sitting vice-president, RepublicanRichard Nixon. Kennedy's team made sure he looked fresh for the close-ups, while Nixon, who was recovering from an illness, donned an ill-fitting suit and was seen wiping sweat from his brow. Kennedy did see a jump in the polls after the debates, even though we can't say for certain it was due to his prowess. Nixon (L) and Kennedy locked horns in 1960 In 2000, Democratic candidateAl Gore's debate performance againstGeorge W Bushmay have cost him the presidency. His sighing and eye-rolling during his Republican counterpart's responses came across as condescending to many voters (and made it into a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch). The significance of the first Trump-Biden debate will become clearer when the dust settles. Now we turn to BBC Reality Check's examination of some of the claims made by Biden during the first debate. Biden: ""We have 4% of the world's population, [but] 20% of the [Covid-19] deaths."" Verdict:This is roughly correct. But looking at coronavirus deaths per capita, there are a number of countries which are worse than the US. Biden:""Manufacturing went into a hole"" before coronavirus. Verdict:That's not right, according to the figures. Prior to the outbreak, President Trump had added almost half a million manufacturing jobs during his first three years in office. Biden:""Trump hasn't lowered drug prices for anyone."" Verdict:The average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell slightly in the year to August 2019, although it then rose again. For a more detailed take on Bidenâs claims,see here. BBC Reality Check has been verifying some of the claims made by both Trump and Biden during the first debate. Firstly, let's look at some of the claims Trump made. Trump:""We built the greatest economy in history."" Verdict:That's not right - there have been times in US history when the economy was stronger, as the chart below shows. Trump:Postal ballots increase will cause ""a fraud like you've never seen"". Verdict:Studies have not found evidence of widespread fraud, although there have been isolated cases. Trump:""We're weeks away from a vaccine."" Verdict:There is a ""very, very low chance"" of an approved vaccine being ready by the end of October, the chief scientific adviser to the US vaccine programme has said. For more clarity on claims made in the debate,read BBC Reality Check's fuller analysis. Harris said Biden was prepared to engage with the Black Lives Matter movement Senator Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's vice-presidential running mate, has rebuked President Trump for failing to condemn white supremacists during the first debate. In one of the most talked about exchanges of the night, the president was asked by the moderator, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, if he was prepared to condemn white supremacists. He initially said he would, but when asked to denounce the far-right Proud Boys group by name, he told those affiliated with it to ""stand back and stand by"". Those who support the group later expressed their allegiance to Trump on social media. In an interview with CNN,external, Harris said Trump's comments illustrated the contrast between him and Biden, who was ""not afraid to speak the phrase Black Lives Matter"". ""I heard what we all heard, the president of the United States, in the year of our Lord 2020, refuses to condemn white supremacists,"" Harris said. ""People talk about, 'is he dog whistling?',"" she added. ""Dog whistling through a bullhorn is what he's doing."" James RobbinsDiplomatic Correspondent If Donald Trump wins a second
term, the only safe prediction is that relations with Britain will remain
utterly unpredictable. Normally, Downing Street and
the Foreign Office would have a fair idea what to expect from a re-elected
American president and commander-in-chief. With Trump, however, all bets
are off. The certainties are that Joe
Biden's promise to take the US back into the Paris Climate Change accord will
most definitely not be the path Trump follows. So, British hopes for a
far more ambitious and more broadly based outcome from next year's United
Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow - with the US on board
again - will be dashed if it's still President Trump in the White House. More than that, a naturally
divisive Trump in his second term will surely not retreat from his open
scorn for the global institutions. The longer that
remains the case, the more other democracies, including Britain, think they
have to lose in competition with the rising power of autocrats and
protectionists of varying degree spread around the world. Publicly, of course, any
British prime minister will commit to working very closely with the leader of
the United States. But a second-term President
Trump, emboldened by a new mandate and also freed from any constraint imposed
by worry over a further electoral test, is hardly likely to be any easier an
adversary in the continuing tough negotiations over a new UK/US trade
agreement. Chlorinated chicken will remain firmly on the menu America would
like to serve up to the UK consumer. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Whenthe New York Times story,externalabout Donald Trump's taxes broke on Sunday night, it was viewed as a bombshell - the public was finally getting a look at information the president - in a break with tradition - had withheld for years. The Times said Trump paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"",the paper said. When the topic came up in the debate, Trump offered a similar defence to the one he provided in 2016 - that he had paid plenty of taxes and his ability to avoid a larger tax bill was simply his taking advantage of the law. Biden, for his part, tried to turn the topic into a condemnation of Republican-passed tax reform. While he noted that Trump paid less in federal taxes than schoolteachers, that message - which could have been a powerful attack - got buried in an ensuing scuffle with the president. If Trump's tax returns have any legs as an issue in this campaign, it won't be because of this debate.

Amazon payment gadget will scan veins in your hand,"The Amazon One scanner could be used to enter buildings, the firm says Amazon has announced a new payment system for real-world shops which uses a simple wave of the hand. Its new Amazon One scanner registers an image of the user's palm, letting them pay by hovering their hand in mid-air ""for about a second or so"", it says. The product will be trialled at two of Amazon's physical stores in Seattle. But the company said it is ""in active discussions with several potential customers"" about rolling it out to other shops in the future. ""In most retail environments, Amazon One could become an alternate payment or loyalty card option with a device at the checkout counter next to a traditional point of sale system,"" it said. Amazon also said the system could be used for ""entering a location like a stadium"" or scanning yourself into work instead of using an ID card. ""We believe Amazon One has broad applicability beyond our retail stores,"" it added. Palm scanners are not a brand-new technology, and there are already some commercially available solutions. ""Palm-based identification is based on capturing the vein patterns of the palm,"" explains Dr Basel Halak of the Electronics and Computer Science School at the University of Southampton. Why Amazon knows so much about you Where the money is really made at Amazon ""These patterns are different for each finger and for each person, and as they are hidden underneath the skin's surface, forgery is extremely difficult."" Dr Halak said the level of security was roughly similar to a fingerprint scan, but could be used at a distance of a few inches, making it much more practical. This video can not be played Click's Marc Cieslak tries a device which scans a user's palm to authorise financial transactions. ""In comparison with other form of identifiers such as physical devices, this form of biometric authentication is based on physical characteristics that stay constant throughout one's lifetime and are more difficult to fake, change or steal,"" he said. Amazon has not detailed exactly how its version of the technology will work, beyond saying it will use ""custom-built algorithms and hardware"" and scan ""distinct features on and below the surface"" of the hand. But it said one of the reasons  it chose palm recognition was that it is ""more private"" than some other options. ""You can't determine a person's identity by looking at an image of their palm,"" it said, possibly a reference to the controversy surrounding facial recognition. The firm has paused police use of its Recognition facial recognition software after civil rights advocates raised concerns about potential racial bias. Amazon said other reasons for the choice  included the ""intentional gesture"" of holding a palm over a sensor, and the contactless nature, ""which we think customers will appreciate, especially in current times"". But privacy group Big Brother Watch criticised the development. ""Amazon continues to fill the market with invasive, dystopian technologies that solve non-existent problems,"" its director Silkie Carlo said. ""No one should have to provide biometric data in order to buy goods or services. Amazon's attempt to normalise biometric payment and home surveillance devices risks building a world in which we're more easily tracked and recorded, which will inevitably disempower citizens."" Early adopters can only try out the first version of the technology at two Amazon Go shops -the company's experiment with a real-world supermarket that has no checkouts, but instead tracks the shopper and what they pick up. No Amazon account is required. To register, a customer can just insert their bank card and follow the on-screen instructions to link their palm print to that payment option, Amazon said. The company promises that the print is not stored on site, but encrypted and kept securely in the Cloud. Customers could also delete their data via website, it added.

NHS well stocked for ventilators this winter,"The NHS now has 30,000 ventilators that can help people breathe if they are very unwell with coronavirus. That is about one for every 2,200 people in the UK - many more than are likely to be needed this winter. Hospitals in England had 7,400 of the machines at the start of the pandemic,a report reveals,external. And the government spent Â£569m to secure more. The National Audit Office says ministers prioritised speed over cost but used taxpayers' money responsibly. Currently, there are 2,049 coronavirus patients in hospital in the UK. And 297 of those are on ventilators. When coronavirus first struck UK shores, experts estimated the NHS could be overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients and would need 90,000 beds with ventilators to cope. In response, the government set about buying up as many machines as possible. And it encouraged UK manufacturers to make new ones, launching its Ventilator Challenge. The estimate of ventilators needed was later revised down - to 17,500 in England. But the government had already signed contracts with suppliers and paid money up front, the NAO report says. Although, about Â£36.3m of this money has been recovered by cancelling orders and selling components brought in preparation for manufacture back into the wider supply chain. The report also says: The government faced growing competition buying ventilators on the world market and usually had to pay up front, and in some cases more than typical market rates, accepting the risk products may be unsuitable In one such case, 750 ventilators, bought for about Â£2.2m, were withdrawn from use following feedback from clinicians Established NHS suppliers were paid an average of Â£20,000 for each of the 2,200 new intensive care unit mechanical ventilators, while another 5,900 were bought from new suppliers for about Â£30,100 apiece The Cabinet Office sought assurance over suppliers' costs, with input from the Ministry of Defence's Cost Assurance and Analysis Service At the spring peak of coronavirus, 6,818 of 10,900 ventilators available across the UK were being used to treat patients in England. And by 16 September, about 2,150 of the extra ventilators bought or built had been distributed to NHS trusts. The remainder are in storage in warehouses, including a facility in Donnington owned by the Ministry of Defence. The government has also bought 17,800 other, non-invasive oxygen therapy devices for the NHS, such as continuous positive airway pressure machines. Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said the government had been ""quick off the blocks"" to increase the number of ventilators in the NHS. ""We were lucky the worst-case scenario didn't come to pass before the extra ventilators had arrived,"" she said. ""However, the NHS is now much better prepared for whatever happens next. ""The Department of Health and Social Care and the Cabinet Office have shown it's possible to work at pace and get results without writing a blank cheque. ""In this case, they kept the chancers at arm's length and have set a benchmark for procurement during the pandemic."" Prof Derek Hill, an expert in medical devices from University College London, said: ""In normal times, more than Â£500m spent on unused medical equipment would be seen as a massive waste of tax payer money, but in the context of Covid, and risk mitigation, the National Audit Office is not critical of the programme."" A government spokeswoman said: ""The NHS now has access to over 30,000 mechanical and 15,000 non-invasive ventilators. This is more than three times as many as it had at the start of the pandemic so we are well prepared to meet any future need."" What are ventilators and how do they work?

Brexit: Government plan gets MPs' final backing,"MPs have given their final backing to government plans to override parts of its Brexit agreement with the EU. Amid concerns that the move would break international law, ministers agreed to give Parliament a say before ever using the powers they would be granted by the Internal Market Bill. The legislation, which passed through the House of Commons by 340 votes to 256, will now go to the House of Lords. The government says it will help protect the integrity of the UK. But Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the EU argue that - in allowing the government to undo parts of a treaty signed by the EU and UK - it could damage the country's international reputation and standing. The UK's five living former prime ministers - Sir John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May - have spoken out against the bill. Gove stands by Brexit bill after EU concerns Why does the UK need another Brexit deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Seven things that will change on 1 January The parliamentary debate on Tuesday came as the EU and the UK began a ninth - and final - scheduled round of talks aimed at securing a trade deal. The post-Brexit transition period - in which the UK has kept to EU trading rules and remained inside its customs union and single market - runs out at the end of the year. Theresa May has said she cannot back the legislation If the sides fail to reach a deal, the UK would trade with the EU after that on World Trade Organization rules. This would mean tariffs on most goods which UK businesses send to the EU, while the UK could also apply tariffs to EU goods. The Internal Market Bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after 1 January. It gives the government the power to change aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement, a legally binding deal governing the terms of Brexit made earlier this year. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses Ministers say the bill would provide a ""safety net"" in case the EU interprets the agreement, in particular the section on Northern Ireland, in an ""extreme and unreasonable"" way. The section -known as the protocol- is designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats opposed the bill, while the EU has asked the UK government to remove ""contentious parts"" of it by Wednesday. In the Commons, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the legislation would protect the ""shared prosperity"" of the UK's nations, adding: ""It demonstrates that, as a union, our country is greater than the sum of its parts."" For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said it was ""unprecedented"" to ""break"" a treaty signed by the UK and EU, and that the government's stance was being ""noticed around the world"". Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, said ministers had ""typically and arrogantly ploughed on"" despite opposition to the bill in the devolved nations. The Democratic Unionist Party supported the government, which already has a Commons majority of almost 80. No Conservative MPs voted against the bill at its final stage - and although 21, including Mrs May, did not vote this does not necessarily mean they abstained.

BBC boss 'prepared to fire stars who break rules',"Party politics is ""not the right place to be"" for top BBC presenters, Tim Davie said BBC director general Tim Davie has said he would be prepared to sack presenters who make major breaches of impartiality guidelines on social media. Mr Davie, who became DG earlier this month, said new social media rules would be announced in the coming weeks, and would apply to all staff. ""I am prepared to take the appropriate disciplinary action, all the way to termination,"" Mr Davie said. He said he would also be able ""to take people off Twitter"" if necessary. His comments come after criticism of stars such as Gary Lineker, who has courted controversy in the past for sharing his political views on Twitter. Responding to Mr Davie's comments on Tuesday,the Match of the Day host said:,external""I think only Twitter can take people off Twitter."" Mr Davie told MPs on the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee: ""Enforcement actions will be very clear, we will be able to take disciplinary action, we'll be able to take people off Twitter. I know people want to see hard action on this."" Pressed on how people could be removed from Twitter, he clarified that in some cases he would ask staff to suspend their Twitter accounts if they wanted to continue working for the BBC. He told the MPs he wouldn't rush into far-reaching action. ""I know some people would like me to fire [people] immediately [when] there is a foot fault,"" he said. ""I'm sure over your career and my career, sometimes we have not acted perfectly. So there will be a range of enforcements. Sometimes someone just needs a talking to. Other times there will be more serious matters."" Gary Lineker has been criticised for sharing his political views on Twitter The action taken would not depend on the stature of the star involved, but there would be a distinction between occasional contributors and those who are ""the face of the BBC"", he said. ""Social media guidelines will make clear where the lines are. If someone is a face of the BBC, I think entering into party politics seems to me not the right place to be."" Gary Lineker takes Â£400,000 BBC pay cut Asked specifically about Lineker, Mr Davie said the former footballer had ""always got a flavoursome turn of phrase"", but ""understands his responsibilities as a person within the BBC"". He said: ""We will issue the social media guidelines which will be clear. I would note that Gary Lineker has been very clear in his statements recently, saying, 'I understand I have responsibilities while working at the BBC'. ""Those responsibilities will be clearly laid out. I am the director general so I am now running the show, and in my view, party political statements are not the right thing for people to be making if they are part of an impartial news organisation."" In the past, there have been ""a few tweets and a few incidents"" from BBC staff and presenters that ""in my mind have not furthered the BBC's reputation for impartiality"", Mr Davie said. The new social media guidelines will cover people working in all areas of BBC programming, Mr Davie said. ""The bar will be higher for news and current affairs, but there will also be a bar for those people working as BBC talent across the organisation, across genres,"" he said. ""I don't think this is about banning people on social media, by the way. We must be up there. I passionately believe that impartial reporting can be flavoursome. The idea that it's dull is wrong."" Zoe Ball was the second top earner at the BBC last year, after Lineker Lineker topped the BBC's most recent ""star salaries"" list with Â£1.75m in the 2019-20 financial year, but has announced he will take a 23% pay cut, amounting to Â£400,000. The second highest earner was Zoe Ball, who was paid Â£1.36m to host the Radio 2 breakfast show. MPs asked Mr Davie why Ball is paid more than triple the salary of the station's mid-morning presenter Ken Bruce,despite attracting fewer listeners than him. Ball has lost around a million listeners since taking over from her predecessor Chris Evans, who was paid around Â£240,000 more than her. Mr Davie referred to ""the historical rate for the Radio 2 breakfast show"" and said such leading presenters were able to look at ""entertainment options across television and radio"". ""Don't get me wrong,"" he added. ""I've inherited some of this. You've seen what we've done with Gary. I want to make sure that we are getting as best value as we can in the market, and better value where we can. ""I've spent a lot of the last few years working in the international market, fighting for talent. There is an element of hyper-inflation, as all these services pile in, and people with TV personality and profile will be difficult to get. ""I'm all for developing young talent and taking more risk or opportunity with developing talent coming through. But I absolutely think that with a few people, and it is a very small number of people, we are in a bit of a market."" Andrew Neil announced at the weekend he was leaving the BBC Recent media reports have suggested Ball will request a pay cut when renegotiating her current contract in the coming weeks. ""With Zoe in particular, she's an outstanding broadcaster, we are in a renegotiation and we'll be looking where we go forward,"" Mr Davie said. Mr Davie also addressed the departure of political interviewer Andrew Neil to become the face and chairman of new TV channel GB News. The director general said the issue was not the amount he had offered Neil to stay, but ""what he wants to do with his life"". He said: ""Andrew's an outstanding broadcaster. We had a good conversation, I made a good offer, he had a better one. We move on. He's been brilliant."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

UK records highest daily Covid deaths since 1 July,"The UK announces 7,143 new cases and 71 more Covid-related deaths The cases are a daily record since mass testing began - but experts believe the figure was much higher in the spring The daily deaths announcement was the highest since 1 July, when 97 deaths were confirmed But hospital admissions fall in England for fourth day in a row PM Boris Johnson apologises for ""misspeaking"" about new virus rules in north-east England The world's coronavirus death toll crosses one million, with the US, Brazil and India making up nearly half of the total The UN secretary general calls it a ""mind-numbing"" figure and ""an agonising milestone"" New York City introduces fines for people who refuse to wear masks Edited by Owen Amos The virus live page is closing - but there will be live coverage of theUS presidential debate here. Our writers were Toby Luckhurst, Ashitha Nagesh, Alice Evans, and Lauren Turner. The editors were Paulin Kola and Owen Amos.  We're closing our virus live page soon. Here are the main stories we've been covering, both here in the UK and around the world.  Mike Coupe, former chief executive at Sainsbury's istaking over as director of Covid-19 testing at England's Test and Trace agency. He left the supermarket chain in May and replaces Sarah-Jane Marsh, who earlier this monthissued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the coronavirus testing system. Mr Coupe has experience in running supply chains and logistics, said the Department for Health and Social Care. But Labour shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it would make more sense to put ""those trained in actual infectious disease control in charge"". At Test and Trace, Mr Coupe will be joining other former retail executives. The head of the service, Dido Harding, worked at Tesco and Sainsbury's before spending seven years as boss of TalkTalk. As we've been reporting, the rate of infections in many parts of the world appears to be picking up. So here is a reminder on what simple measures we all need to take to stay safe - beginning with washing the hands. Simple guide to staying safe. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Covid-19 cases in parts of Canada have been rising at an
alarming rate and last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned the
country was experiencing a second wave. Some regions are now further tightening restrictions. Quebec will close
bars and restaurants for 28 days, in three âred zonesâ across the country,
including the city of Montreal. Indoor home
gatherings will also be forbidden. The province saw 750 new cases on Monday,
and 896 on Sunday, its highest tally since the spring. In Ontario, where
about 40% of the countryâs population lives, new cases reached an all-time
peak, with 700 new cases. Thatâs 60 cases higher than the previous high of 640
on 24 April. The milestone
renewed calls to scale back reopening â the Ontario Hospital Association urged
the province to go back to Stage 2, which would shutter restaurants and bars
except for outdoor dining, and other businesses like gyms. Ontario Premier
Doug Ford did not announce such measures on Monday, the same day casinos
reopened across the province. Last week, with cases rising, the province issued
an earlier closing time for bars and shut down strip clubs. Chief Medical
Officer of Health Dr David Williams said the province may consider further
âtargetedâ closures as needed. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The rules people are being told to follow are becoming a lot more complicated and can vary significantly in different parts of the UK. But at the same time the government is ramping up enforcement - creating criminal offences and introducing fines for those who don't follow them. That's why it's so important that ministers can explain to the public what the rules are and the rationale behind them. On two occasions today, the prime minister and a junior minister have beenunable to do so. Opposition parties accuse the government of not being in control - and not understanding the rules it is enforcing. But at the same time the PM is facing pressure from within his own party - with a significant bloc of Tory backbenchers demanding Parliament has more of a say when new restrictions are brought in. They fear some of the decisions go too far - and perhaps don't make sense. The PM being unable to explain them won't help. Restrctions have already been tightened in other parts of Wales - and now four councils in north Wales are to go into ""local lockdown"". The new measures for Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham come into effect at 18:00 BST on Thursday. Vaughan Gething, Wales' health minister, made the announcement in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday evening. He said a similar pattern of transmission was being seen in the four areas as had happened in the south, but rates in neighbouring Gwynedd and Anglesey currently ""remain low"". Travel to and from the areas will not be permitted unless people have a ""reasonable excuse"", such as work or for buying essentials. It will be illegal to meet others indoors who are not within your immediate household. You can read more about it here. Some GPs and pharmacies haverun out of flu jabs in the UKamid high demand - and are asking people to wait until more stock can be delivered. Boots says it has had to suspend bookings. But there is no national shortage, government officials say, and there are enough doses to vaccinate the 30 million people who are deemed most vulnerable to flu. The over-65s, and those in higher risk groups, are being given priority. Once those groups have been immunised, healthy 50 to 64-year-olds in England will, for the first time, be eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS. This is to help protect against the double threat of flu and coronavirus this winter. Research shows people can catch both diseases at the same time, with serious and sometimes deadly consequences. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter On-the-spot coronavirus tests â 120 million of them â which
give results within minutes are being made available to low- and middle-income
countries by the World Health Organization. One of the tests â the South Korean-made SD BioSensor â is
 already in use in Italy to screen people at airports. But these speedy tests are not currently available in the
UK. Thatâs partly because different countries have different
ways of approving tests, and hold them to different standards. And the UK has generally erred on the side of caution in
this arena. Apart from a natural risk aversion, these very quick tests
are considerably less sensitive than the standard test used in the NHS. That
means they pick up fewer cases and tell more people theyâre negative when they
do in fact have the virus. For countries that donât have the infrastructure to run big
labs and currently have very little access to any testing at all, these kits
could be a game-changer. The UK is instead focusing its energy on two other rapid
tests, which take more like 90 minutes to process than ten and are roughly as
sensitive as the standard diagnostic test. South Africa lost 2.2 million jobs during the country's coronavirus lockdown earlier this year - one of the strictest in the world. This is the biggest fall in job numbers since 2008, when the country's employment survey began. Most businesses were shut for five weeks from 27 March, and as a result the economy shrank at an unprecedented level. Read the full story of South Africa's unemployment crisishere. Updated to include the data released earlier this afternoon... Primary schools in New York have reopened and welcomed children for in-person lessons, after being closed for six months. The reopening of primary schools is the second stage in a three-part plan for reopening education. Last week, nursery-age children and some children with special educational needs were allowed back into buildings. Middle and High School pupils are expected to return to in-person classes on Thursday. But this comes as Mayor Bill de Blasio warns that New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". He also says anyone who refuses to wear a mask in public will be fined. A village in southern Romania has re-elected a beloved local mayor, Ion Aliman, 10 days after his death of Covid-19. His death was so close to the election that it was too late to remove his name from the ballot, Associated Press news agency reports. Because of this, residents of Deveselu village paid their respects by casting their votes for him anyway. Aliman won 1,057 of the 1,600 votes cast in the village, which is home to just 3,000 people. His victory was a landslide, meaning that had he been alive he would have won an unprecedented third term. The popular mayor would have celebrated his 57th birthday on election day. The landlord said his decision to allow the funeral to take place on the pubs grounds ""was led by a personal friendship"" with the biker who had died A pub landlord has apologised after 300 people turned up for a biker's funeral, ""far exceeding"" the number expected.  Police visited The Gate Hangs Well, in Syston, Leicestershire, on Friday where a service was being held in a marquee.  Publican Neil Henderson said it was set up to seat 30 people but he was ""naive"" to think numbers ""would be manageable"" and voluntarily closed when regulations were no longer met.  Police said the group was dispersed and a fixed penalty notice was issued.  Mr Henderson said he did not know how much the fine would be but Charnwood Police said in a tweet it could be ""up to Â£10k"".  Read more here Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent While the number of new infections and deaths will cause
alarm â both are up on previous days â the data on hospital admissions is more
encouraging.  For the fourth day in a row, the numbers have come down in
England.  On Sunday there were 241 admissions, down from 314 on
Wednesday.  To put that in context, at the peak England was seeing 3,000
admissions a day.  This mirrors what has been seen in France and Spain â a
gradual upward trend in serious Covid cases, but not the rapid increase that
was seen in the spring.  Even the number of new daily cases â the highest on record
at over 7,000 â is still below the doomsday trajectory the governmentâs senior
advisers warned about last week when they said there could be 50,000 cases a
day by mid October.  It all points to a second wave, but one that is more
manageable than feared by some.  It is, though, still early days. The areas with the highest
rates in the North West and North East are causing concern.  And we are just at the start of the autumn and winter season
when respiratory viruses circulate more.  Another unknown is the impact the problems with testing are
having on the ability of the system to pick up on cases.  Last week surveillance suggested perhaps less than half of
cases were being picked up.  That is why, arguably, it is more important to pay close
attention to hospital cases in the coming days and weeks to measure the true
impact Covidâs second wave is having.  Last Tuesday, 22 September, there were 37 deaths recorded - which has now nearly doubled, to 71. And the number of cases recorded that day was 4,926, whereas it is now over 7,000. But it's important to note cases had dropped for the past three days, while deaths had dropped for the past two days. Here's the overall picture of how things have changed in the past seven days.  There were lower numbers for deaths and cases at the weekend and on Monday - but that's usually the case, due to the fact more are recorded during the week. Officials in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, are preparing a burial site that will have 6,000 additional graves for people who've died of Covid-19. Indonesia has the highest virus death toll in South East Asia, and is currently dealing with another surge in deaths. It has now had more than 280,000 reported infections, and more than 10,000 deaths. The country has recorded more than 4,000 new cases of the virus each day for almost 10 days, despite limited testing. Gravediggers have told local media that they've been rushing to bury as many bodies as possible during daylight hours. Cemeteries in the capital have been running out of space. From today people in New York City will be fined if they refuse to wear masks, Mayor Bill de Blasio says. Officials will first offer free masks to anyone not wearing one. If that person then refuses, then they will be fined. De Blasio didn't specify how much the fine would be. He also says New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". ""Obviously everyone is concerned about that,"" he says. ""That is something we all have to work on together to address."" New York City was the original epicentre of the US outbreak, during the country's first wave of the virus in spring. While the 7,143 lab-confirmed cases recorded in the UK is the highest since the outbreak began, experts have previously warned that describing the daily figure as a record could be ""misleading"". That's because it is not clear how many people were actually infected at the height of the first wave due to a lack of mass testing in the community. Coronavirus cases have been rising again since July, but the rate of growth has increased since the end of August. The 71 deaths recorded were the highest UK total announced since1 July.,external Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been nearly 57,900 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.

Trump and Biden to lock horns in presidential debate,"The long-awaited battle between Donald Trump and Joe Biden was scrappy and acrimonious They clashed over Covid, crime, healthcare, their families - and even with the moderator Far-right group Proud Boys celebrated on social media after President Trump sidestepped condemning them by name Fox News anchor Chris Wallace had his hands full throughout as Biden and Trump interrupted each other Low points included Biden telling Trump to 'shut up' and Trump questioning his intelligence Tens of millions of US voters were expected to have tuned in to watch the event in Cleveland, Ohio Edited by Mal Siret That's all from us. Our live coverage has come to an end. We hope you tune in for the next election debate - the race for the White House could still go either way. This live page was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Holly Honderich, Sam Proffitt, Marianna Brady, Max Matza, Boer Deng, Matt Davis, Joshua Nevett, Mal Siret, Anthony Zurcher, Georgina Rannard, Rebecca Seales, Vicky Baker, Jessica Murphy and Jessica Lussenhop. Many thanks for reading. We're ending our live coverage of the debate and its aftermath soon. Thanks for joining us for what proved to be an explosive encounter between two bitter rivals for the US presidency. Before we wrap up, here is a summary of some of the key moments before, during and after the debate in Cleveland, Ohio. For more on the first debate, you can read ournews story,analysisand trove of explainers - including those onhow the US election worksandthe latest polling data. Reality Check After polls close in the US presidential election, it could take days - or even weeks - to find out if Joe Biden or Donald Trump has won. Millions more Americans are expected to vote by post because of coronavirus, meaning a delay in counting all the votes is highly likely. Will the winner be announced on 3 November? It's very possible that it won't. Although the result
of a US presidential vote is usually known on the night of the election, this
year is very different with so many votes being cast by post. In 2016, nearly a quarter of votes were cast by post. It's estimated
that this time it could be more than double â around 80 million â as states
employ measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. There are also concerns that the US Postal Service,
responsible for delivering the postal ballots, will struggle to cope with the
demand. It has faced budget cutbacks and critics of Trump have
accused him of deliberately blocking additional funding. Most states only include ballots received by the time polls
close on election day. But some, like California, will accept them as long
as they are sent by the day of the election, even if they arrive a week later. Will Trump try to overturn
the results and ask for a recount of sorts? This is unknown. Trump has made clear his mistrust
of the postal voting system and says there will be ""tremendous"" fraud involved.
This could be the basis of a challenge to the result if he loses. When asked if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of
power if he loses the election, Trump said: ""We'll have to see what
happens"". He also said the election result could end up in the US Supreme
Court as a result of doubts over the integrity of postal voting. A recount of votes would certainly delay the outcome, but is
not unprecedented. In 2000, a dispute in Florida took more than a month to
resolve before George W Bush was ultimately declared the winner. There is no love lost between Trump and Biden With round one of debating over, Trump and Biden are approaching the final strait of the race for the White House. The presidential election is now just 34 days away, giving Trump and Biden little time to dust themselves down for their next head-to-head clash. Two presidential debates remain on the agenda:  Vice-President Mike Pence and Biden's running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, will also lock horns in a debate:  Like the first debate in Ohio, they will all take place from 21:00-22:30ET (02:00-03:30BST), with no commercial interruptions. Expect more sparks to fly. This year's US presidential election could come down to results in just a few key states.
Most states are tipped to vote one way or another - so we have already assigned 188 votes to Trump and 233 to Biden. Can Biden wrestle enough away to seize the presidency? Or will Trump romp home to a second term?
It's all about the race to 270 electoral votes - and this time you decide. Play our game to predict whether Trump or Biden will win,externalthe key states at the election. As the presidential election draws closer, you may be asking yourself: how does it all work? Well, we've put together areally simple guide to the election, which could shape the US and the world for years to come. By now, you probably know the candidates are incumbent Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden. When Americans go to the polls on 3 November, they will cast ballots for a group of officials who represent Trump and Biden in the electoral college. Each state gets a certain number of electoral-college votes partly based on its population. There are a total of 538 votes up for grabs, so the victor is the candidate that wins 270 or more. This means voters decide state-level contests rather than the national one, which is why it's possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - in what is called the popular vote - but still be defeated by the electoral college. Got it? If not, you canread more about how the electoral college works here. Voters around the US tuned in to see President Donald Trump and former
Vice-President Joe Biden spar in the first presidential debate. As the exchange came to a close, we asked members of the BBC voter panel
how the candidates performed - and if their answers had swayed their vote. Keirsten,
undecided voter:""I definitely
think Biden won the debate, but I don't think that was hard to do because there
wasnât a lot that I was expecting from Donald Trump. At the end of the 'day the
loser was really us, the American people. A lot of people were expecting this
to go the way that it did."" Brian,
undecided voter:""I wouldn't
call anyone a winner. It was expected to be chaotic, [and] it was chaotic.
Trump controlled the message with more interrupting, talking and controlling.
Biden withstood it better than I thought he would. He got a little hot in the
collar a few times but I didnât see any big eye-catching gaffes. I thought Biden
had a good few moments where he looked directly at the camera and aimed his
message at the public. I think both sides will say they win, but itâs like
comparing apples to oranges."" Ariel, Trump voter:""I thought nobody won
the debate. I really understand that Trump is not a very seasoned politician.
When he did his best was when he was talking about his policies, what heâs done
and what heâs going to do. But there were other times Biden would say something
and heâd try to debunk it."" Josh, Biden
voter:""Biden came
out on top. He came out with a strong message and I can't tell you enough how
much it mattered that he looked into the camera. Trump was disrespecting Chris
Wallace. We already knew he's disrespectful but now America all watched him
disrespect Chris Wallace at the same time."" Meet the voters we watched the debate with. Peskov said Russia did not wish to intervene in US affairs The Russian government is watching the presidential campaign in the US closely, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said in the wake of the first debate. ""But we do not want to make any statements as this could be viewed as an attempt to intervene [into the election process],"" Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday,according to Reuters news agency,external. ""Russia has never, is not and is not going to intervene in US domestic affairs,"" he added. That statement contradicts US intelligence agencies, which accused Russia's government of interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Intelligence chiefs said Russia wanted to help boost Trump's campaign, including by spreading disinformation online, but the Kremlin has denied the allegations. In August, the head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) saidRussia was among several countries seeking to influence the presidential election this year. Trump cut a confrontation figure in the first debate We can bring you some more reaction from Robin Wright, a foreign affairs analyst who has written extensively about the upcoming election. She has seen many debates in her time, yet none were more dispiriting than this one. It was, she said, ""one of the lowest points in presidential debate history"". She said the chaotic bust-up not only raised questions about the future of presidential debates, but the future of America's political system. ""It's hard to absorb what has just happened and I suspect that is even more true of people watching around the world who once thought that America had the kind of democracy, even if flawed, that they aspired to,"" Wright told the BBC. ""This was not just 90 minutes of chaos,"" she added. ""It was America, the history of America in 2020."" Both Democrat and Republican supporters have been having their say on the presidential debate. Naturally, the reaction has been partisan on both sides. Here's what some observers told the BBC and other news agencies. Republicans Randi Reed is a Republican and a Trump supporter from Nevada. She described the debate as a ""kindergarten cat fight"". She said the president's ""gunning for the jugular"" was ""exactly what we expected from Trump - the rude, crude interrupting"". ""We went in knowing who we were supporting,"" she said. Doug Miller has served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention, he told AFP news agency he ""thought the president performed very well"". ""But I feel for most of the evening, he was not only debating 'Sleepy Joe Biden', he was having to debate [moderator] Chris Wallace, who I think is a total fool,"" he said. Democrats Bilal Aksoy is a student and a registered Democrat voter in Pennsylvania. He said the debate only served to reinforce the views he held about both candidates. ""I knew that Trump didn't believe in science. He refuses to acknowledge climate change and he refuses to act on the global pandemic that we're living through,"" he said. Jamal Simmons is a Democratic Party strategist who has worked as an adviser to former President Barack Obama's campaign. He said Trump missed opportunities to reach out to undecided voters. ""I think Donald Trump went out for a boxing match, went out to just clinch it up for as many rounds as he could,"" he said. Reality Check During an exchange about Biden's eldest son Beau, who served in the US military and died of cancer in 2015, Trump brought up Biden's other son, Hunter. Trump: ""I don't know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the militaryâ¦ dishonourably dischargedâ¦ for cocaine use."" Biden replied that it was not true that his son had been dishonourably discharged. Hunter Biden was discharged from the US Navy in 2014, and media reports at the timesaid that a navy drug test had detected the presence of cocaine.,external However, he was not dishonourably discharged, which is the highest level of punishment the military can hand out. Readmore about the claims made throughout the debate here. ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,"" Trump said in response to a question asking him to condemn white supremacist and militia groups. The Proud Boys is a far-right, anti-immigrant group witha history of street violence against its left-wing opponents. Trumpâs apparent refusal to denounce the group proved to be one of the most controversial and hotly debated moments of the first debate. In case you missed it, here's a video of the exchange with debate moderator Chris Wallace. This video can not be played 'Proud Boys, stand back and stand by' - Trump Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington Joe Biden makes a trip to China while serving as Barack Obama's vice-president Like Donald Trump, Joe Biden wants to end the forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but he would keep a small troop presence in both to help battle terrorism. On Russia, the relationship at the top would certainly look different, likely little else. President Trump often seemed ready to personally forgive Vladimir Putin for violating international norms. But his administration punished Russia with sanctions, and that would probably continue under a Biden presidency. On China there is rare bipartisan agreement to get tough with Beijing over trade and other issues, the question is about tactics. Biden would continue President Trump's policy of countering China's ""abusive economic practices"", but jointly with allies, as opposed to Trump's preference for unilateral trade deals. The sharp elbows of the Trump administration have been successful in winning global support for a boycott of Chinese communications technology. That's part of a serious escalation in US efforts to push back against Beijing on many fronts, anchored in accusations that it mishandled the Coronavirus. This campaign is led by Mr Trump's China hawks: strategic competition they call it; strategic confrontation, is how some analysts describe it. Mr Biden would more actively seek areas of cooperation with a rising China. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring This Channel One news ticker reads: ""The debate has been dubbed the most scandalous in US history."" The Trump-Biden
debate is a lead story on Russian TV this morning, with news bulletins focusing
on the chaotic nature of the event. State TV's Channel
One: ""A political theatre of the absurd. A verbal duel which has been dubbed
the most scandalous in the history of election campaigning in the USâ¦ The most
important political show in the presidential race has probably never been so
chaotic before."" Pro-Kremlin NTV
television: ""There was no constructive dialogue. The rivals kept interrupting
each other and instead of a balanced discussion they chose the path of mutual
insults."" Channel 5, St
Petersburg: ""The rivals have crossed all boundaries."" Pro-Kremlin Ren TV: ""The election debate between Biden and Trump has been called America's greatest
disgrace."" Presidential debates have captivated Americans for decades. They can be bruising, gruelling and sometimes explosive affairs - as last night's debate between Biden and Trump proved. Over the years, some debates have stood out more than others. The first ever televised debate in 1960 pitted young Democratic SenatorJohn F Kennedyagainst the sitting vice-president, RepublicanRichard Nixon. Kennedy's team made sure he looked fresh for the close-ups, while Nixon, who was recovering from an illness, donned an ill-fitting suit and was seen wiping sweat from his brow. Kennedy did see a jump in the polls after the debates, even though we can't say for certain it was due to his prowess. Nixon (L) and Kennedy locked horns in 1960 In 2000, Democratic candidateAl Gore's debate performance againstGeorge W Bushmay have cost him the presidency. His sighing and eye-rolling during his Republican counterpart's responses came across as condescending to many voters (and made it into a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch). The significance of the first Trump-Biden debate will become clearer when the dust settles. Now we turn to BBC Reality Check's examination of some of the claims made by Biden during the first debate. Biden: ""We have 4% of the world's population, [but] 20% of the [Covid-19] deaths."" Verdict:This is roughly correct. But looking at coronavirus deaths per capita, there are a number of countries which are worse than the US. Biden:""Manufacturing went into a hole"" before coronavirus. Verdict:That's not right, according to the figures. Prior to the outbreak, President Trump had added almost half a million manufacturing jobs during his first three years in office. Biden:""Trump hasn't lowered drug prices for anyone."" Verdict:The average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell slightly in the year to August 2019, although it then rose again. For a more detailed take on Bidenâs claims,see here. BBC Reality Check has been verifying some of the claims made by both Trump and Biden during the first debate. Firstly, let's look at some of the claims Trump made. Trump:""We built the greatest economy in history."" Verdict:That's not right - there have been times in US history when the economy was stronger, as the chart below shows. Trump:Postal ballots increase will cause ""a fraud like you've never seen"". Verdict:Studies have not found evidence of widespread fraud, although there have been isolated cases. Trump:""We're weeks away from a vaccine."" Verdict:There is a ""very, very low chance"" of an approved vaccine being ready by the end of October, the chief scientific adviser to the US vaccine programme has said.

Harris said Biden was prepared to engage with the Black Lives Matter movement Senator Kamala Harris, Joe Biden's vice-presidential running mate, has rebuked President Trump for failing to condemn white supremacists during the first debate. In one of the most talked about exchanges of the night, the president was asked by the moderator, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, if he was prepared to condemn white supremacists. He initially said he would, but when asked to denounce the far-right Proud Boys group by name, he told those affiliated with it to ""stand back and stand by"". Those who support the group later expressed their allegiance to Trump on social media. In an interview with CNN,external, Harris said Trump's comments illustrated the contrast between him and Biden, who was ""not afraid to speak the phrase Black Lives Matter"". ""I heard what we all heard, the president of the United States, in the year of our Lord 2020, refuses to condemn white supremacists,"" Harris said. ""People talk about, 'is he dog whistling?',"" she added. ""Dog whistling through a bullhorn is what he's doing."" James RobbinsDiplomatic Correspondent If Donald Trump wins a second
term, the only safe prediction is that relations with Britain will remain
utterly unpredictable. Normally, Downing Street and
the Foreign Office would have a fair idea what to expect from a re-elected
American president and commander-in-chief. With Trump, however, all bets
are off. The certainties are that Joe
Biden's promise to take the US back into the Paris Climate Change accord will
most definitely not be the path Trump follows. So, British hopes for a
far more ambitious and more broadly based outcome from next year's United
Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow - with the US on board
again - will be dashed if it's still President Trump in the White House. More than that, a naturally
divisive Trump in his second term will surely not retreat from his open
scorn for the global institutions. The longer that
remains the case, the more other democracies, including Britain, think they
have to lose in competition with the rising power of autocrats and
protectionists of varying degree spread around the world. Publicly, of course, any
British prime minister will commit to working very closely with the leader of
the United States. But a second-term President
Trump, emboldened by a new mandate and also freed from any constraint imposed
by worry over a further electoral test, is hardly likely to be any easier an
adversary in the continuing tough negotiations over a new UK/US trade
agreement. Chlorinated chicken will remain firmly on the menu America would
like to serve up to the UK consumer. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Whenthe New York Times story,externalabout Donald Trump's taxes broke on Sunday night, it was viewed as a bombshell - the public was finally getting a look at information the president - in a break with tradition - had withheld for years. The Times said Trump paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"",the paper said. When the topic came up in the debate, Trump offered a similar defence to the one he provided in 2016 - that he had paid plenty of taxes and his ability to avoid a larger tax bill was simply his taking advantage of the law. Biden, for his part, tried to turn the topic into a condemnation of Republican-passed tax reform. While he noted that Trump paid less in federal taxes than schoolteachers, that message - which could have been a powerful attack - got buried in an ensuing scuffle with the president. If Trump's tax returns have any legs as an issue in this campaign, it won't be because of this debate.

PM promises 'radical' shake-up of adult education,"This video can not be played PM: Covid has âmassively accelerated changes that were already happening"". Boris Johnson has vowed ""radical"" changes to the adult education system in England to help boost the post-Covid economy. The prime minister said the pandemic had ""massively accelerated"" changes to the world of work, and made training gaps ""painfully apparent"". He said funding changes could help end the ""bogus distinction"" between academic and vocational learning. But Labour said the plans would not make up for ""a decade of cuts"". Speaking at a further education college in Exeter, Mr Johnson said the government cannot ""save every job"" amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But he added that better training would ""give people the skills to find and create new and better jobs"". Seven ways covid changed the workplace Jobs scheme 'won't stop major rise in unemployment' How many people could become unemployed? He said a new ""lifetime skills guarantee"" would offer a fully funded college course to all people over 18 in England without an A-level or equivalent qualification. Currently, only people aged under 23 qualify for a fully-funded qualification at this level. The commitment will be paid for under an already-announced Â£2.5bn boost to England's National Skills Fund coming into effect next April. Funding will be offered for courses offering ""skills valued by employers"" - with full list to be announced next month. The prime minister added that the government would make higher education loans more flexible, to allow people to ""space out their study across their lifetimes"". Whether it's Boris Johnson's ""levelling up"" agenda or previous governments' promises to tackle the skills gap, some of what we've heard today may sound familiar. For example, that the supply of skilled workers in certain industries simply isn't meeting demand, and calls to end the ""snootiness"" between academic and vocational qualifications. Also familiar was the suggestion that the economy is evolving, at speed, as technology changes the way we live. Coronavirus has, it's argued, accelerated the latter trend with, for example, more working from home and online shopping. And that therefore the task of re-directing workers into industries where there's a shortage of workers has been made more urgent. With fears unemployment will continue to rise, particularly in hospitality and retail, the government is saying that there will be more support for retraining. But this announcement also comes a week after ministers opted for measures such as the 10pm curfew in bars and pubs. That's led to accusations that this government is actually causing job losses in already hard-hit sectors. With that in mind, and amid all the gloomier headlines, Boris Johnson may want to be the person offering some help and some hope. The question is whether it's enough and in time. Mr Johnson said the pandemic had ""compressed"" a ""revolution"" to the jobs market caused by trends such as online shopping. He added that although some jobs would fall away, he wanted people to take advantage of ""new opportunities opening up with dizzying speed"". Meanwhile, the government's Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) said care workers, butchers, and bricklayers should go on the UK's""shortage occupation list"",external. The recommended move would be easier for migrants to get a work visa for those jobs after the post-Brexit transition period ends in January. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? In other plans, small businesses will be offered financial incentives to take on apprentices and Â£8m will be spent on skills ""boot camps"" in West Yorkshire, south-west England, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire to cover sectors like construction and engineering. This follows pilots in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands that focused on digital skills. And the government's online Skills Toolkit, a collection of training resources launched in the spring to help people acquire jobs skills ahead of businesses reopening, will be expanded to include 62 additional courses. Seven ways covid changed the workplace Jobs scheme 'won't stop major rise in unemployment' How many people could become unemployed? Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green called the new funding announcement ""a mix of reheated old policies and funding that won't be available until April"". ""By then many workers could have been out of work for nearly a year, and the Tories still think that they will need to take out loans to get the training they will need to get back in work."" Her party has previously called for the money in the National Skills Fund to be brought forward to tackle the crisis. Paul from Leeds lost his job at the start of lockdown and then saw several job opportunities fall through as the pandemic took hold. But he says he eventually got a job as a site manager at his local primary school, after taking a course in children's mental health funded by the Yorkshire Cricket Foundation. The qualification was his first experience of formal training since he took a glasswork and glazing apprenticeship around 20 years ago. ""Having the time is something I've never had before,"" said the father of three. ""If I hadn't done the course, I don't think I would have had the answers to the questions in the interview,"" he adds. ""It's given me the confidence to walk into a school and believe I can get the job."" CBI director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the ""significant"" unemployment coronavirus is leaving in its wake ""only accelerates the need for people to develop new skills and adapt to new ways of working"". ""The lifetime skills guarantee and flexible loans to support bitesize learning are a strong start but to really shift gears, this must be backed up by meaningful progress on evolving the apprenticeship levy into a flexible skills levy,"" she added. The apprenticeship levy - introduced in 2017 - takes 0.5% of the salary bill from major employers that have an annual pay bill over Â£3m, with the intention of using the money to improve skills and provide training.

Armenia says its fighter jet 'shot down by Turkey',"Turkey, which has F-16s, is openly backing Azerbaijan in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh Armenia says one of its fighter jets was shot down by a Turkish jet in a major escalation of the conflict over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Armenian foreign ministry said the pilot of the Soviet-made SU-25 died after being hit by the Turkish F-16 in Armenian air space. Turkey, which is backing Azerbaijan in the conflict, has denied the claim. Nearly 100 people, including civilians, have died in three days of fighting over the disputed mountainous region. The enclave is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but has been run by ethnic Armenians since a 1988-94 war between the two former Soviet republics. What are Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over? Nagorno-Karabakh profile Azerbaijan has repeatedly stated that its air force does not have F-16 fighter jets. However, Turkey does. The fighting that started three days ago now appears to be spilling out of Nagorno-Karabakh, with Armenia and Azerbaijan trading accusations of direct fire into their territories. They also blame each other for starting the conflict. While Turkey openly backs Azerbaijan, Russia - which has a military base in Armenia but is also friendly with Azerbaijan - has called for an immediate ceasefire. Armenian Defence Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said the Armenian SU-25 was shot down on Tuesday morning and the pilot ""died heroically"". In a Facebook post, she said the Turkish F-16 was 60km (37 miles) deep into Armenian air space. Turkey immediately denied the claim as ""absolutely untrue"". ""Armenia should withdraw from the territories under its occupation instead of resorting to cheap propaganda tricks,"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's aide Fahrettin Altun said. No material evidence about the jet has yet been released. Azerbaijan has called for Armenia to provide it. The self-proclaimed authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh say enemy troops have suffered big losses Azerbaijan says a column of Armenian armoured and other combat vehicles has been destroyed Earlier on Tuesday, both Armenia and Azerbaijan said that heavy fighting had continued overnight in Nagorno-Karabakh. The region's self-proclaimed authorities said 87 of their military personnel had been killed and 120 wounded since the fighting began on Sunday, according to the Armenpress news agency. They put the number of deaths on the Azerbaijani side at nearly 400, saying that one aircraft, four helicopters and a number of tanks had been destroyed. This video can not be played Tanks ablaze as fighting erupts over disputed region Azerbaijan has released no figures on its military casualties, but says 12 civilians were killed by Armenian fire. Azerbaijan's defence ministry was quoted by news agencies as saying that Armenian troops had repeatedly tried and failed to regain lost positions in the Fuzuli-Jabrayil and Aghdere-Terter areas. The ministry said that a column of Armenian armoured and other combat vehicles had been destroyed, adding that the enemy had suffered heavy losses. The casualty claims by Armenia and Azerbaijan have not been independently verified. There appears to be little at the moment. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan told Russian media the atmosphere was not right for talks while military operations were ongoing. Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev, also speaking to Russian outlets, ruled out any talks given Armenia's current stance. Analysis by Emre Temel, BBC Turkish Diplomatic relations between Turkey and Azerbaijan have always been strong. When fighting erupted over Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday, Turkey immediately extended its support ""both on the field and at the negotiation table"", in the words of its foreign minister. They share a similar history, language and heritage and their leaders often refer to ""one nation and two states"". Turkey's border with Armenia has been closed since 1993 as a gesture of support over Nagorno-Karabakh. President Erdogan has vowed to stand by Azerbaijan ""with all its resources and heart"". But it's still unknown whether Turkey has supplied Azerbaijan with military experts, drones and warplanes, as Armenia alleges. And yet it is Russia, not Turkey, that holds the key to the region. Russia has a mutual defence pact with Armenia and a military base there. Turkey is already at odds with Russia over Syria and Libya, and the Caucasus could open a new front. Standing up to Russia would be too risky for Turkey economically and militarily. Russia is Turkey's prime energy supplier and a key trading partner. A mountainous region of about 4,400 sq km (1,700 sq miles) Traditionally inhabited by Christian Armenians and Muslim Turks In Soviet times, it became an autonomous region within the republic of Azerbaijan Internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but majority of population is ethnic Armenian Self-proclaimed authorities are not recognised by any UN member, including Armenia An estimated one million people displaced by war in 1988-94, and about 30,000 killed Separatist forces captured some extra territory around the enclave in Azerbaijan Stalemate has largely prevailed since a 1994 ceasefire Turkey openly supports Azerbaijan Russia has a military base in Armenia In 1988, towards the end of Soviet rule, Azerbaijani troops and Armenian secessionists began a bloody war which left Nagorno-Karabakh in the hands of ethnic Armenians when a truce was signed in 1994. Tens of thousands died in fighting, and many ethnic Azerbaijanis were forced to flee their homes. It is now a de facto independent region, relying heavily on support from Armenia. But it is not recognised by any UN member, including Armenia. Swathes of Azeri territory around the enclave are also under Armenian control. Shelling has caused damage to homes in the city of Martuni Negotiations have so far failed to produce a permanent peace agreement, and the dispute in the region remains one of post-Soviet Europe's ""frozen conflicts"". Karabakh is the Russian rendering of an Azeri word meaning ""black garden"", while Nagorno is a Russian word meaning ""mountainous"". Ethnic Armenians prefer to call the region Artsakh, an ancient Armenian name for the area. Over the years both sides have had soldiers killed in sporadic breaches of the ceasefire. Landlocked Armenia has suffered severe economic problems due to the closure of borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan. Russia, France and the US co-chair the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Minsk Group, which has been attempting to broker an end to the dispute.

Flu jab delays amid high demand,"Some GPs and pharmacies have run out of flu jabs and are asking people to wait until more stock can be delivered. Boots says it has seen very high demand for the vaccine and has now had to suspend bookings. Government officials say there is no national shortage and there will be enough doses in the coming weeks and months to vaccinate the 30 million people deemed most vulnerable to flu. Available stocks are being given to the over-65s and high risk groups. Once those groups have been immunised, healthy 50 to 64-year-olds in England will, for the first time, be eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS. This is to help protect against the double threat of flu and coronavirus this winter - research shows people can catch both diseases at the same time, with serious and sometimes deadly consequences. There is currently no vaccine for coronavirus. How can I get a flu jab? Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Flu: Why we still need to worry about it this winter How bad will winter really be? Boots pharmacy said it had increased its order of flu jabs by around a fifth in anticipation of a very busy period, but the level of demand it had seen in the last few weeks was unprecedented. Flu vaccine ordering is done many months in advance of the flu season and the delivery is phased over the autumn and into winter. Head of the Royal College of GPs Prof Martin Marshall urged people to ""sit tight"" and stressed it was important that all those eligible for the flu jab came forward when told to do so. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: ""It is usual for manufacturers to stagger deliveries of the vaccine. Every year, there is a phased roll-out and vaccinations continue throughout the autumn. Some GP practices and pharmacies may ask people to wait until they receive further deliveries."" Helen Concilia from Seqirus, the company that supplies the type of flu vaccine used to immunise over 65s, said: ""We can confirm that there is no supply issue."" Jessica Kirby, Head of Health Advice at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: ""We'd urge people who are unable to book via their pharmacy or GP at this stage not to give up and to keep trying. Flu season lasts until spring, so whilst we'd encourage vaccination as early as possible, there is still time."" This year,the free vaccination is being offered,externalin England to: people who were required toshield from coronavirusand anyone they live with people withsome medical conditions,externalincluding diabetes, heart failure and asthma pregnant women pre-school children over the age of two all primary school children, as last year, and, for the first time, Year 7 pupils initially all people over 65, before the programme is extended to the over-50s healthcare and social care staff people living in a residential or nursing home people who are the main carer for an elderly or disabled person The NHS will get in contact with those who are eligible. Flu, like coronavirus, is a viral infection that is passed on through coughs and sneezes. Social distancing, masks and hand-washing should help reduce the spread. Most people with flu recover at home in a week, but people with chronic conditions or who are over 65 should call NHS 111. Anyone who thinks they have either flu or Covid-19 should stay at home and self-isolate. People should book a coronavirus test if they have: a high fever a new, continuous cough a loss of, or a change to their sense of smell or taste Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Can I get a free flu jab?

Our writers were Toby Luckhurst, Ashitha Nagesh, Alice Evans, and Lauren Turner. The editors were Paulin Kola and Owen Amos.  We're closing our virus live page soon. Here are the main stories we've been covering, both here in the UK and around the world.  Mike Coupe, former chief executive at Sainsbury's istaking over as director of Covid-19 testing at England's Test and Trace agency. He left the supermarket chain in May and replaces Sarah-Jane Marsh, who earlier this monthissued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the coronavirus testing system. Mr Coupe has experience in running supply chains and logistics, said the Department for Health and Social Care. But Labour shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it would make more sense to put ""those trained in actual infectious disease control in charge"". At Test and Trace, Mr Coupe will be joining other former retail executives. The head of the service, Dido Harding, worked at Tesco and Sainsbury's before spending seven years as boss of TalkTalk. As we've been reporting, the rate of infections in many parts of the world appears to be picking up. So here is a reminder on what simple measures we all need to take to stay safe - beginning with washing the hands. Simple guide to staying safe. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Covid-19 cases in parts of Canada have been rising at an
alarming rate and last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned the
country was experiencing a second wave. Some regions are now further tightening restrictions. Quebec will close
bars and restaurants for 28 days, in three âred zonesâ across the country,
including the city of Montreal. Indoor home
gatherings will also be forbidden. The province saw 750 new cases on Monday,
and 896 on Sunday, its highest tally since the spring. In Ontario, where
about 40% of the countryâs population lives, new cases reached an all-time
peak, with 700 new cases. Thatâs 60 cases higher than the previous high of 640
on 24 April. The milestone
renewed calls to scale back reopening â the Ontario Hospital Association urged
the province to go back to Stage 2, which would shutter restaurants and bars
except for outdoor dining, and other businesses like gyms. Ontario Premier
Doug Ford did not announce such measures on Monday, the same day casinos
reopened across the province. Last week, with cases rising, the province issued
an earlier closing time for bars and shut down strip clubs. Chief Medical
Officer of Health Dr David Williams said the province may consider further
âtargetedâ closures as needed. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The rules people are being told to follow are becoming a lot more complicated and can vary significantly in different parts of the UK. But at the same time the government is ramping up enforcement - creating criminal offences and introducing fines for those who don't follow them. That's why it's so important that ministers can explain to the public what the rules are and the rationale behind them. On two occasions today, the prime minister and a junior minister have beenunable to do so. Opposition parties accuse the government of not being in control - and not understanding the rules it is enforcing. But at the same time the PM is facing pressure from within his own party - with a significant bloc of Tory backbenchers demanding Parliament has more of a say when new restrictions are brought in. They fear some of the decisions go too far - and perhaps don't make sense. The PM being unable to explain them won't help. Restrctions have already been tightened in other parts of Wales - and now four councils in north Wales are to go into ""local lockdown"". The new measures for Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham come into effect at 18:00 BST on Thursday. Vaughan Gething, Wales' health minister, made the announcement in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday evening. He said a similar pattern of transmission was being seen in the four areas as had happened in the south, but rates in neighbouring Gwynedd and Anglesey currently ""remain low"". Travel to and from the areas will not be permitted unless people have a ""reasonable excuse"", such as work or for buying essentials. It will be illegal to meet others indoors who are not within your immediate household. You can read more about it here. Some GPs and pharmacies haverun out of flu jabs in the UKamid high demand - and are asking people to wait until more stock can be delivered. Boots says it has had to suspend bookings. But there is no national shortage, government officials say, and there are enough doses to vaccinate the 30 million people who are deemed most vulnerable to flu. The over-65s, and those in higher risk groups, are being given priority. Once those groups have been immunised, healthy 50 to 64-year-olds in England will, for the first time, be eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS. This is to help protect against the double threat of flu and coronavirus this winter. Research shows people can catch both diseases at the same time, with serious and sometimes deadly consequences. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter On-the-spot coronavirus tests â 120 million of them â which
give results within minutes are being made available to low- and middle-income
countries by the World Health Organization. One of the tests â the South Korean-made SD BioSensor â is
 already in use in Italy to screen people at airports. But these speedy tests are not currently available in the
UK. Thatâs partly because different countries have different
ways of approving tests, and hold them to different standards. And the UK has generally erred on the side of caution in
this arena. Apart from a natural risk aversion, these very quick tests
are considerably less sensitive than the standard test used in the NHS. That
means they pick up fewer cases and tell more people theyâre negative when they
do in fact have the virus. For countries that donât have the infrastructure to run big
labs and currently have very little access to any testing at all, these kits
could be a game-changer. The UK is instead focusing its energy on two other rapid
tests, which take more like 90 minutes to process than ten and are roughly as
sensitive as the standard diagnostic test. South Africa lost 2.2 million jobs during the country's coronavirus lockdown earlier this year - one of the strictest in the world. This is the biggest fall in job numbers since 2008, when the country's employment survey began. Most businesses were shut for five weeks from 27 March, and as a result the economy shrank at an unprecedented level. Read the full story of South Africa's unemployment crisishere. Updated to include the data released earlier this afternoon... Primary schools in New York have reopened and welcomed children for in-person lessons, after being closed for six months. The reopening of primary schools is the second stage in a three-part plan for reopening education. Last week, nursery-age children and some children with special educational needs were allowed back into buildings. Middle and High School pupils are expected to return to in-person classes on Thursday. But this comes as Mayor Bill de Blasio warns that New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". He also says anyone who refuses to wear a mask in public will be fined. A village in southern Romania has re-elected a beloved local mayor, Ion Aliman, 10 days after his death of Covid-19. His death was so close to the election that it was too late to remove his name from the ballot, Associated Press news agency reports. Because of this, residents of Deveselu village paid their respects by casting their votes for him anyway. Aliman won 1,057 of the 1,600 votes cast in the village, which is home to just 3,000 people. His victory was a landslide, meaning that had he been alive he would have won an unprecedented third term. The popular mayor would have celebrated his 57th birthday on election day. The landlord said his decision to allow the funeral to take place on the pubs grounds ""was led by a personal friendship"" with the biker who had died A pub landlord has apologised after 300 people turned up for a biker's funeral, ""far exceeding"" the number expected.  Police visited The Gate Hangs Well, in Syston, Leicestershire, on Friday where a service was being held in a marquee.  Publican Neil Henderson said it was set up to seat 30 people but he was ""naive"" to think numbers ""would be manageable"" and voluntarily closed when regulations were no longer met.  Police said the group was dispersed and a fixed penalty notice was issued.  Mr Henderson said he did not know how much the fine would be but Charnwood Police said in a tweet it could be ""up to Â£10k"".  Read more here Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent While the number of new infections and deaths will cause
alarm â both are up on previous days â the data on hospital admissions is more
encouraging.  For the fourth day in a row, the numbers have come down in
England.  On Sunday there were 241 admissions, down from 314 on
Wednesday.  To put that in context, at the peak England was seeing 3,000
admissions a day.  This mirrors what has been seen in France and Spain â a
gradual upward trend in serious Covid cases, but not the rapid increase that
was seen in the spring.  Even the number of new daily cases â the highest on record
at over 7,000 â is still below the doomsday trajectory the governmentâs senior
advisers warned about last week when they said there could be 50,000 cases a
day by mid October.  It all points to a second wave, but one that is more
manageable than feared by some.  It is, though, still early days. The areas with the highest
rates in the North West and North East are causing concern.  And we are just at the start of the autumn and winter season
when respiratory viruses circulate more.  Another unknown is the impact the problems with testing are
having on the ability of the system to pick up on cases.  Last week surveillance suggested perhaps less than half of
cases were being picked up.  That is why, arguably, it is more important to pay close
attention to hospital cases in the coming days and weeks to measure the true
impact Covidâs second wave is having.  Last Tuesday, 22 September, there were 37 deaths recorded - which has now nearly doubled, to 71. And the number of cases recorded that day was 4,926, whereas it is now over 7,000. But it's important to note cases had dropped for the past three days, while deaths had dropped for the past two days. Here's the overall picture of how things have changed in the past seven days.  There were lower numbers for deaths and cases at the weekend and on Monday - but that's usually the case, due to the fact more are recorded during the week. Officials in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, are preparing a burial site that will have 6,000 additional graves for people who've died of Covid-19. Indonesia has the highest virus death toll in South East Asia, and is currently dealing with another surge in deaths. It has now had more than 280,000 reported infections, and more than 10,000 deaths. The country has recorded more than 4,000 new cases of the virus each day for almost 10 days, despite limited testing. Gravediggers have told local media that they've been rushing to bury as many bodies as possible during daylight hours. Cemeteries in the capital have been running out of space. From today people in New York City will be fined if they refuse to wear masks, Mayor Bill de Blasio says. Officials will first offer free masks to anyone not wearing one. If that person then refuses, then they will be fined. De Blasio didn't specify how much the fine would be. He also says New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". ""Obviously everyone is concerned about that,"" he says. ""That is something we all have to work on together to address."" New York City was the original epicentre of the US outbreak, during the country's first wave of the virus in spring. While the 7,143 lab-confirmed cases recorded in the UK is the highest since the outbreak began, experts have previously warned that describing the daily figure as a record could be ""misleading"". That's because it is not clear how many people were actually infected at the height of the first wave due to a lack of mass testing in the community. Coronavirus cases have been rising again since July, but the rate of growth has increased since the end of August. The 71 deaths recorded were the highest UK total announced since1 July.,external Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been nearly 57,900 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.

Here are the main stories we've been covering, both here in the UK and around the world.  Mike Coupe, former chief executive at Sainsbury's istaking over as director of Covid-19 testing at England's Test and Trace agency. He left the supermarket chain in May and replaces Sarah-Jane Marsh, who earlier this monthissued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the coronavirus testing system. Mr Coupe has experience in running supply chains and logistics, said the Department for Health and Social Care. But Labour shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it would make more sense to put ""those trained in actual infectious disease control in charge"". At Test and Trace, Mr Coupe will be joining other former retail executives. The head of the service, Dido Harding, worked at Tesco and Sainsbury's before spending seven years as boss of TalkTalk. As we've been reporting, the rate of infections in many parts of the world appears to be picking up. So here is a reminder on what simple measures we all need to take to stay safe - beginning with washing the hands. Simple guide to staying safe. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Covid-19 cases in parts of Canada have been rising at an
alarming rate and last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned the
country was experiencing a second wave. Some regions are now further tightening restrictions. Quebec will close
bars and restaurants for 28 days, in three âred zonesâ across the country,
including the city of Montreal. Indoor home
gatherings will also be forbidden. The province saw 750 new cases on Monday,
and 896 on Sunday, its highest tally since the spring. In Ontario, where
about 40% of the countryâs population lives, new cases reached an all-time
peak, with 700 new cases. Thatâs 60 cases higher than the previous high of 640
on 24 April. The milestone
renewed calls to scale back reopening â the Ontario Hospital Association urged
the province to go back to Stage 2, which would shutter restaurants and bars
except for outdoor dining, and other businesses like gyms. Ontario Premier
Doug Ford did not announce such measures on Monday, the same day casinos
reopened across the province. Last week, with cases rising, the province issued
an earlier closing time for bars and shut down strip clubs. Chief Medical
Officer of Health Dr David Williams said the province may consider further
âtargetedâ closures as needed. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The rules people are being told to follow are becoming a lot more complicated and can vary significantly in different parts of the UK. But at the same time the government is ramping up enforcement - creating criminal offences and introducing fines for those who don't follow them.

TV crew finds new evidence in Estonia ship disaster,"The ferry was sailing from Estonia to Sweden on 28 September 1994 when it sank in the Baltic Sea Estonia, Sweden and Finland will examine new evidence that may shed light on the cause of one of Europe's worst peacetime shipping disasters. The MS Estonia ferry sank as it was crossing from Tallinn to Stockholm in September 1994, killing 852 people. A 1997 investigation found that the ship's bow door locks had failed in a storm. But new underwater footage appears to show a previously unrecorded four metre (13ft) hole in the ship's hull. The three countries said they would ""assess new information"" which could contradict the official explanation. The vessel was sailing from Estonia to Sweden on 28 September 1994 when it sank in the Baltic Sea off Finland. Most passengers on board the ship were trapped inside after it capsized, but 97, who managed to leave the vessel, died in the water. There were 137 survivors. In 1997, an official report into the incident concluded that the locks on the ship's bow doors had failed during stormy weather and huge amounts of water had gushed in. But survivors and relatives of the victims have long been calling for a fuller investigation, and various unproven theories have circulated since the tragedy. French court rejects MS Estonia claim Estonia's victims to rest at sea,external 'I took her hand and then we jumped' The new underwater footage features in a five-part Discovery Network documentary about the disaster titled Estonia: The Find That Changes Everything. The film crew discovered the hole in the ship's hull while using a remote-controlled submarine to explore the wreckage. This still from the documentary shows a hole in the ship's hull ""Estonia, Finland and Sweden have agreed that verification of the new information presented in the documentary will be made,"" the three countries said in a joint statement. ""Our countries will cooperate closely in this matter and Estonia [where the ship was registered] will lead this process,"" they added. The new documentary has reignited calls for a fresh investigation. ""A new technical investigation into the circumstances of Estonia's sinking must be carried out,"" Estonia's Prime Minister Juri Ratas said, according to local media. ""A hole in the hull was dismissed over the years,"" Kent Harstedt, a survivor and former member of the Swedish parliament, told a news conference on Monday. ""What has emerged today adds to the question marks - why was the hole not included in the official investigation?"" This video can not be played BBC reports on the Estonia ferry disaster in 1994 ""I believe the truth is something other than what people have been told until now,"" survivor Carl Eric Reintamm said in the documentary. Last year, more than 1,000 survivors and relatives of victims requested â¬40.8m (Â£36.6m; $45.8m) in compensation from the French agency that deemed the vessel seaworthy and the German shipbuilder. But the claim was rejected by a Paris court, which said the claimants had failed to prove ""intentional fault"". People from 17 countries lost their lives in the disaster. Of the 852 people killed, 501 were Swedish and 285 were Estonian. A crew member who survived the accident told the BBC at the time that he had seen a loading bay door open and taking in water minutes before the ship sank.

"Armenia says its fighter jet 'shot down by Turkey'Armenia says its fighter jet was shot down by Turkey in Armenian air space, a claim Turkey denies.Europe","Turkey, which has F-16s, is openly backing Azerbaijan in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh Armenia says one of its fighter jets was shot down by a Turkish jet in a major escalation of the conflict over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Armenian foreign ministry said the pilot of the Soviet-made SU-25 died after being hit by the Turkish F-16 in Armenian air space. Turkey, which is backing Azerbaijan in the conflict, has denied the claim. Nearly 100 people, including civilians, have died in three days of fighting over the disputed mountainous region. The enclave is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but has been run by ethnic Armenians since a 1988-94 war between the two former Soviet republics. What are Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over? Nagorno-Karabakh profile Azerbaijan has repeatedly stated that its air force does not have F-16 fighter jets. However, Turkey does. The fighting that started three days ago now appears to be spilling out of Nagorno-Karabakh, with Armenia and Azerbaijan trading accusations of direct fire into their territories. They also blame each other for starting the conflict. While Turkey openly backs Azerbaijan, Russia - which has a military base in Armenia but is also friendly with Azerbaijan - has called for an immediate ceasefire. Armenian Defence Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said the Armenian SU-25 was shot down on Tuesday morning and the pilot ""died heroically"". In a Facebook post, she said the Turkish F-16 was 60km (37 miles) deep into Armenian air space. Turkey immediately denied the claim as ""absolutely untrue"". ""Armenia should withdraw from the territories under its occupation instead of resorting to cheap propaganda tricks,"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's aide Fahrettin Altun said. No material evidence about the jet has yet been released. Azerbaijan has called for Armenia to provide it. The self-proclaimed authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh say enemy troops have suffered big losses Azerbaijan says a column of Armenian armoured and other combat vehicles has been destroyed Earlier on Tuesday, both Armenia and Azerbaijan said that heavy fighting had continued overnight in Nagorno-Karabakh. The region's self-proclaimed authorities said 87 of their military personnel had been killed and 120 wounded since the fighting began on Sunday, according to the Armenpress news agency. They put the number of deaths on the Azerbaijani side at nearly 400, saying that one aircraft, four helicopters and a number of tanks had been destroyed. This video can not be played Tanks ablaze as fighting erupts over disputed region Azerbaijan has released no figures on its military casualties, but says 12 civilians were killed by Armenian fire. Azerbaijan's defence ministry was quoted by news agencies as saying that Armenian troops had repeatedly tried and failed to regain lost positions in the Fuzuli-Jabrayil and Aghdere-Terter areas. The ministry said that a column of Armenian armoured and other combat vehicles had been destroyed, adding that the enemy had suffered heavy losses. The casualty claims by Armenia and Azerbaijan have not been independently verified. There appears to be little at the moment. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan told Russian media the atmosphere was not right for talks while military operations were ongoing. Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev, also speaking to Russian outlets, ruled out any talks given Armenia's current stance. Analysis by Emre Temel, BBC Turkish Diplomatic relations between Turkey and Azerbaijan have always been strong. When fighting erupted over Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday, Turkey immediately extended its support ""both on the field and at the negotiation table"", in the words of its foreign minister. They share a similar history, language and heritage and their leaders often refer to ""one nation and two states"". Turkey's border with Armenia has been closed since 1993 as a gesture of support over Nagorno-Karabakh. President Erdogan has vowed to stand by Azerbaijan ""with all its resources and heart"". But it's still unknown whether Turkey has supplied Azerbaijan with military experts, drones and warplanes, as Armenia alleges. And yet it is Russia, not Turkey, that holds the key to the region. Russia has a mutual defence pact with Armenia and a military base there. Turkey is already at odds with Russia over Syria and Libya, and the Caucasus could open a new front. Standing up to Russia would be too risky for Turkey economically and militarily. Russia is Turkey's prime energy supplier and a key trading partner. A mountainous region of about 4,400 sq km (1,700 sq miles) Traditionally inhabited by Christian Armenians and Muslim Turks In Soviet times, it became an autonomous region within the republic of Azerbaijan Internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but majority of population is ethnic Armenian Self-proclaimed authorities are not recognised by any UN member, including Armenia An estimated one million people displaced by war in 1988-94, and about 30,000 killed Separatist forces captured some extra territory around the enclave in Azerbaijan Stalemate has largely prevailed since a 1994 ceasefire Turkey openly supports Azerbaijan Russia has a military base in Armenia In 1988, towards the end of Soviet rule, Azerbaijani troops and Armenian secessionists began a bloody war which left Nagorno-Karabakh in the hands of ethnic Armenians when a truce was signed in 1994. Tens of thousands died in fighting, and many ethnic Azerbaijanis were forced to flee their homes. It is now a de facto independent region, relying heavily on support from Armenia. But it is not recognised by any UN member, including Armenia. Swathes of Azeri territory around the enclave are also under Armenian control.

LiveLiveCovid deaths cross 'agonising' 1m milestone3 minutes ago,"The UK announces 7,143 new cases and 71 more Covid-related deaths The cases are a daily record since mass testing began - but experts believe the figure was much higher in the spring The daily deaths announcement was the highest since 1 July, when 97 deaths were confirmed But hospital admissions fall in England for fourth day in a row PM Boris Johnson apologises for ""misspeaking"" about new virus rules in north-east England The world's coronavirus death toll crosses one million, with the US, Brazil and India making up nearly half of the total The UN secretary general calls it a ""mind-numbing"" figure and ""an agonising milestone"" New York City introduces fines for people who refuse to wear masks Edited by Owen Amos The virus live page is closing - but there will be live coverage of theUS presidential debate here. Our writers were Toby Luckhurst, Ashitha Nagesh, Alice Evans, and Lauren Turner. The editors were Paulin Kola and Owen Amos.  We're closing our virus live page soon. Here are the main stories we've been covering, both here in the UK and around the world.  Mike Coupe, former chief executive at Sainsbury's istaking over as director of Covid-19 testing at England's Test and Trace agency. He left the supermarket chain in May and replaces Sarah-Jane Marsh, who earlier this monthissued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the coronavirus testing system. Mr Coupe has experience in running supply chains and logistics, said the Department for Health and Social Care. But Labour shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it would make more sense to put ""those trained in actual infectious disease control in charge"". At Test and Trace, Mr Coupe will be joining other former retail executives. The head of the service, Dido Harding, worked at Tesco and Sainsbury's before spending seven years as boss of TalkTalk. As we've been reporting, the rate of infections in many parts of the world appears to be picking up. So here is a reminder on what simple measures we all need to take to stay safe - beginning with washing the hands. Simple guide to staying safe. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Covid-19 cases in parts of Canada have been rising at an
alarming rate and last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned the
country was experiencing a second wave. Some regions are now further tightening restrictions. Quebec will close
bars and restaurants for 28 days, in three âred zonesâ across the country,
including the city of Montreal. Indoor home
gatherings will also be forbidden. The province saw 750 new cases on Monday,
and 896 on Sunday, its highest tally since the spring. In Ontario, where
about 40% of the countryâs population lives, new cases reached an all-time
peak, with 700 new cases. Thatâs 60 cases higher than the previous high of 640
on 24 April. The milestone
renewed calls to scale back reopening â the Ontario Hospital Association urged
the province to go back to Stage 2, which would shutter restaurants and bars
except for outdoor dining, and other businesses like gyms. Ontario Premier
Doug Ford did not announce such measures on Monday, the same day casinos
reopened across the province. Last week, with cases rising, the province issued
an earlier closing time for bars and shut down strip clubs. Chief Medical
Officer of Health Dr David Williams said the province may consider further
âtargetedâ closures as needed. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The rules people are being told to follow are becoming a lot more complicated and can vary significantly in different parts of the UK. But at the same time the government is ramping up enforcement - creating criminal offences and introducing fines for those who don't follow them. That's why it's so important that ministers can explain to the public what the rules are and the rationale behind them. On two occasions today, the prime minister and a junior minister have beenunable to do so. Opposition parties accuse the government of not being in control - and not understanding the rules it is enforcing. But at the same time the PM is facing pressure from within his own party - with a significant bloc of Tory backbenchers demanding Parliament has more of a say when new restrictions are brought in. They fear some of the decisions go too far - and perhaps don't make sense. The PM being unable to explain them won't help. Restrctions have already been tightened in other parts of Wales - and now four councils in north Wales are to go into ""local lockdown"". The new measures for Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham come into effect at 18:00 BST on Thursday. Vaughan Gething, Wales' health minister, made the announcement in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday evening. He said a similar pattern of transmission was being seen in the four areas as had happened in the south, but rates in neighbouring Gwynedd and Anglesey currently ""remain low"". Travel to and from the areas will not be permitted unless people have a ""reasonable excuse"", such as work or for buying essentials. It will be illegal to meet others indoors who are not within your immediate household. You can read more about it here. Some GPs and pharmacies haverun out of flu jabs in the UKamid high demand - and are asking people to wait until more stock can be delivered. Boots says it has had to suspend bookings. But there is no national shortage, government officials say, and there are enough doses to vaccinate the 30 million people who are deemed most vulnerable to flu. The over-65s, and those in higher risk groups, are being given priority. Once those groups have been immunised, healthy 50 to 64-year-olds in England will, for the first time, be eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS. This is to help protect against the double threat of flu and coronavirus this winter. Research shows people can catch both diseases at the same time, with serious and sometimes deadly consequences. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter On-the-spot coronavirus tests â 120 million of them â which
give results within minutes are being made available to low- and middle-income
countries by the World Health Organization. One of the tests â the South Korean-made SD BioSensor â is
 already in use in Italy to screen people at airports. But these speedy tests are not currently available in the
UK. Thatâs partly because different countries have different
ways of approving tests, and hold them to different standards. And the UK has generally erred on the side of caution in
this arena. Apart from a natural risk aversion, these very quick tests
are considerably less sensitive than the standard test used in the NHS. That
means they pick up fewer cases and tell more people theyâre negative when they
do in fact have the virus. For countries that donât have the infrastructure to run big
labs and currently have very little access to any testing at all, these kits
could be a game-changer. The UK is instead focusing its energy on two other rapid
tests, which take more like 90 minutes to process than ten and are roughly as
sensitive as the standard diagnostic test. South Africa lost 2.2 million jobs during the country's coronavirus lockdown earlier this year - one of the strictest in the world. This is the biggest fall in job numbers since 2008, when the country's employment survey began. Most businesses were shut for five weeks from 27 March, and as a result the economy shrank at an unprecedented level. Read the full story of South Africa's unemployment crisishere. Updated to include the data released earlier this afternoon... Primary schools in New York have reopened and welcomed children for in-person lessons, after being closed for six months. The reopening of primary schools is the second stage in a three-part plan for reopening education. Last week, nursery-age children and some children with special educational needs were allowed back into buildings. Middle and High School pupils are expected to return to in-person classes on Thursday. But this comes as Mayor Bill de Blasio warns that New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". He also says anyone who refuses to wear a mask in public will be fined. A village in southern Romania has re-elected a beloved local mayor, Ion Aliman, 10 days after his death of Covid-19. His death was so close to the election that it was too late to remove his name from the ballot, Associated Press news agency reports. Because of this, residents of Deveselu village paid their respects by casting their votes for him anyway. Aliman won 1,057 of the 1,600 votes cast in the village, which is home to just 3,000 people. His victory was a landslide, meaning that had he been alive he would have won an unprecedented third term. The popular mayor would have celebrated his 57th birthday on election day. The landlord said his decision to allow the funeral to take place on the pubs grounds ""was led by a personal friendship"" with the biker who had died A pub landlord has apologised after 300 people turned up for a biker's funeral, ""far exceeding"" the number expected.  Police visited The Gate Hangs Well, in Syston, Leicestershire, on Friday where a service was being held in a marquee.  Publican Neil Henderson said it was set up to seat 30 people but he was ""naive"" to think numbers ""would be manageable"" and voluntarily closed when regulations were no longer met.  Police said the group was dispersed and a fixed penalty notice was issued.  Mr Henderson said he did not know how much the fine would be but Charnwood Police said in a tweet it could be ""up to Â£10k"".  Read more here Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent While the number of new infections and deaths will cause
alarm â both are up on previous days â the data on hospital admissions is more
encouraging.  For the fourth day in a row, the numbers have come down in
England.  On Sunday there were 241 admissions, down from 314 on
Wednesday.  To put that in context, at the peak England was seeing 3,000
admissions a day.  This mirrors what has been seen in France and Spain â a
gradual upward trend in serious Covid cases, but not the rapid increase that
was seen in the spring.  Even the number of new daily cases â the highest on record
at over 7,000 â is still below the doomsday trajectory the governmentâs senior
advisers warned about last week when they said there could be 50,000 cases a
day by mid October.  It all points to a second wave, but one that is more
manageable than feared by some.  It is, though, still early days. The areas with the highest
rates in the North West and North East are causing concern.  And we are just at the start of the autumn and winter season
when respiratory viruses circulate more.  Another unknown is the impact the problems with testing are
having on the ability of the system to pick up on cases.  Last week surveillance suggested perhaps less than half of
cases were being picked up.  That is why, arguably, it is more important to pay close
attention to hospital cases in the coming days and weeks to measure the true
impact Covidâs second wave is having.  Last Tuesday, 22 September, there were 37 deaths recorded - which has now nearly doubled, to 71. And the number of cases recorded that day was 4,926, whereas it is now over 7,000. But it's important to note cases had dropped for the past three days, while deaths had dropped for the past two days. Here's the overall picture of how things have changed in the past seven days.  There were lower numbers for deaths and cases at the weekend and on Monday - but that's usually the case, due to the fact more are recorded during the week. Officials in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, are preparing a burial site that will have 6,000 additional graves for people who've died of Covid-19. Indonesia has the highest virus death toll in South East Asia, and is currently dealing with another surge in deaths. It has now had more than 280,000 reported infections, and more than 10,000 deaths. The country has recorded more than 4,000 new cases of the virus each day for almost 10 days, despite limited testing. Gravediggers have told local media that they've been rushing to bury as many bodies as possible during daylight hours. Cemeteries in the capital have been running out of space. From today people in New York City will be fined if they refuse to wear masks, Mayor Bill de Blasio says. Officials will first offer free masks to anyone not wearing one. If that person then refuses, then they will be fined. De Blasio didn't specify how much the fine would be. He also says New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". ""Obviously everyone is concerned about that,"" he says. ""That is something we all have to work on together to address."" New York City was the original epicentre of the US outbreak, during the country's first wave of the virus in spring. While the 7,143 lab-confirmed cases recorded in the UK is the highest since the outbreak began, experts have previously warned that describing the daily figure as a record could be ""misleading"". That's because it is not clear how many people were actually infected at the height of the first wave due to a lack of mass testing in the community. Coronavirus cases have been rising again since July, but the rate of growth has increased since the end of August. The 71 deaths recorded were the highest UK total announced since1 July.,external Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been nearly 57,900 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.

Pubs and restaurants must shut in NI at 11pm,"This video can not be played 'We would prefer that everyone works with us' Pubs, hotel bars and restaurants will have to shut at 23:00 in Northern Ireland under new rules for the hospitality sector. They will come into force from midnight on Wednesday. Stormont ministers gave details of the decision in the assembly on Tuesday. No alcohol or food will be served after 22:30 and all customers must leave by 23:00, said First Minister Arlene Foster. She said there could be ""no exceptions"" to the rule, and it would also apply to weddings and other social events. No late licences will be permitted. Hospitality leaders had urged a later closing time for Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK, where it is 22:00. Colin Neill, from Hospitality Ulster, said the announcement was ""another blow to our industry"". ""The sector is going to lose hours, it's losing staff and it has lost live music and needs to be given a fighting chance,"" said Mr Neill. ""A curfew is not ideal, but we in the hospitality sector will do all we can to make this work, which hopefully will be only a temporary measure."" The restriction must be kept under continuous review, he said. Most drink-only pubs in Northern Ireland only opened on 23 September Mr Neill said his organisation had lobbied the government for a 23:30 closing time, in line with the Republic of Ireland. ""My biggest fear is that they'll just bypass my industry altogether,"" he said. ""They'll bypass the pub and go straight to a house party."" Alan Simms, director of the Limelight pub and live music venue in Belfast, said he believed some businesses will decide not to open but to close and make their staff redundant. ""Some businesses will go bust through just not being able to trade sufficiently to get the bills paid,"" he said. Mrs Foster said the executive recognised the risk, but that gatherings in homes were currently illegal, following new restrictions imposed last week on household visits. She stressed enforcement was a ""priority"" for ministers. ""We do not want to go there, we'd prefer that everyone works with us, but enforcement has a role,"" she added. ""We will be looking at the levels of fines we have."" The first minister said she regrets the time limit had to be imposed, but medical evidence showed ""people socialising later in the evening is considered to increase the risk of the virus spreading"". ""People adhere to rules less strictly in venues where they are used to less strict social distancing,"" she added. In Northern Ireland, off-licences and supermarkets can sell alcohol until 23:00 most days. The cut-off is 22:00 on Sundays. The executive said it had taken the decision to impose a 23:00 hospitality closing time in order to ensure a ""consistent approach"". The first minister said the executive is still considering how to deal with beer bikes in the new legislation In England, there have been calls for a review of the 22:00 limit, which has led toscenes of crowds forming after closing timein cities including Liverpool and York. Mrs Foster said the Stormont Executive had looked at the experience in other parts of the UK with closing times, and she hoped it would not be replicated in NI. ""There is the allegation that people will leave the pub and go to a house party, but they cannot go to an off-licence or supermarket to buy alcohol after 23:00 so we felt it was a good idea,"" she told the assembly. ""We were conscious it's later in the Republic of Ireland, but we felt people will not travel across the border for such a short length of time."" The Department of Health is expected to publish the regulations on Wednesday and they will take effect that evening. There is still confusion about so-called beer bikes, which operate in parts of Northern Ireland, and whether they will be allowed. Earlier this month, the executive said new hospitality restrictions would ban them, but Mrs Foster said it had not been resolved yet. ""Beer bikes are a particular problem, we are currently considering how to deal with it,"" said the first minister. ""Officials will be engaging with operators of those bikes but still needs to be dealt with, I hope we can deal with it sooner rather than later.""

"Flu jab delays amid high demandOfficials in England say there will be enough stock to protect the vulnerable, but some will have to wait.HealthComments","Some GPs and pharmacies have run out of flu jabs and are asking people to wait until more stock can be delivered. Boots says it has seen very high demand for the vaccine and has now had to suspend bookings. Government officials say there is no national shortage and there will be enough doses in the coming weeks and months to vaccinate the 30 million people deemed most vulnerable to flu. Available stocks are being given to the over-65s and high risk groups. Once those groups have been immunised, healthy 50 to 64-year-olds in England will, for the first time, be eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS. This is to help protect against the double threat of flu and coronavirus this winter - research shows people can catch both diseases at the same time, with serious and sometimes deadly consequences. There is currently no vaccine for coronavirus. How can I get a flu jab? Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Flu: Why we still need to worry about it this winter How bad will winter really be? Boots pharmacy said it had increased its order of flu jabs by around a fifth in anticipation of a very busy period, but the level of demand it had seen in the last few weeks was unprecedented. Flu vaccine ordering is done many months in advance of the flu season and the delivery is phased over the autumn and into winter. Head of the Royal College of GPs Prof Martin Marshall urged people to ""sit tight"" and stressed it was important that all those eligible for the flu jab came forward when told to do so. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: ""It is usual for manufacturers to stagger deliveries of the vaccine. Every year, there is a phased roll-out and vaccinations continue throughout the autumn. Some GP practices and pharmacies may ask people to wait until they receive further deliveries."" Helen Concilia from Seqirus, the company that supplies the type of flu vaccine used to immunise over 65s, said: ""We can confirm that there is no supply issue."" Jessica Kirby, Head of Health Advice at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: ""We'd urge people who are unable to book via their pharmacy or GP at this stage not to give up and to keep trying. Flu season lasts until spring, so whilst we'd encourage vaccination as early as possible, there is still time."" This year,the free vaccination is being offered,externalin England to: people who were required toshield from coronavirusand anyone they live with people withsome medical conditions,externalincluding diabetes, heart failure and asthma pregnant women pre-school children over the age of two all primary school children, as last year, and, for the first time, Year 7 pupils initially all people over 65, before the programme is extended to the over-50s healthcare and social care staff people living in a residential or nursing home people who are the main carer for an elderly or disabled person The NHS will get in contact with those who are eligible. Flu, like coronavirus, is a viral infection that is passed on through coughs and sneezes. Social distancing, masks and hand-washing should help reduce the spread. Most people with flu recover at home in a week, but people with chronic conditions or who are over 65 should call NHS 111. Anyone who thinks they have either flu or Covid-19 should stay at home and self-isolate.

"Blaenau Gwent hardest-hit Covid-19 area in UKThe county has 304.9 positive coronavirus test results for every 100,000 people.Wales","Council leaders have urged residents to help ""get things under control and hopefully avoid a tougher lockdown"" The locked-down county of Blaenau Gwent has one of the highest and fastest rising case rates for Covid-19 infection in the UK. A case rate of 307.7 positive results per 100,000 in the week to 26 September was reported by Public Health Wales. Merthyr Tydfil also has one of the highest rates - but Caerphilly has seen one of the biggest falls. There were five deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest week reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is four more than the week before and 0.9% of all deaths. Councillor labelled 'reckless' for blaming coronavirus cases on 5G The ONS reports registered deaths, which involve Covid-19 cases both suspected by doctors and confirmed by laboratories, and in different places, such as hospitals, hospices and at home. There were two deaths registered in Flintshire, one in a hospital and one in a care home. The other deaths were in hospital involving patients from Caerphilly, RCT and Merthyr Tydfil. Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population in seven days to 26 September Burnley314 Blaenau Gwent307.7 Knowsley283 Liverpool266 Newcastle-upon-Tyne258 Derry & Strabane237 It has the fastest case rise in Wales - 307.7 per 100,000 up to 26 September - 215 actual cases, over a seven-day period. Earlier analysis by the BBC suggested it was also the hardest-hit area in the UK for the week up to 25 September. But the most recent figures out on Tuesday saw Burnley in Lancashire overtake Blaenau Gwent, on 314 cases per 100,000. The areas hardest hit for infection rate rises in recent weeks have been in the north of England. Blaenau Gwent also had the highest rate of positive tests in Wales - 10.4% in the past week. Any figure above 4% is worrying for health officials. A cluster of cases in the Brynmawr area in particular has been causing concern and a mobile testing unit was set up last week in Nantyglo. Mererid Bowley, interim public health director at Aneurin Bevan health board, said she hoped it would ""help us learn more about the rate of infection, help us protect the residents of Blaenau Gwent"". CounciI leader Nigel Daniels also urged residents to ""do what's needed"" and ""help to fight off any second wave of this dreadful virus in Wales"". Darren Brice, landlord of The Castle in Tredegar, said just two people were in the pub on a Tuesday lunchtime and any further restrictions would be ""devastating"" for all pubs in the town. ""For some of them there's been no coming back,"" he said. ""We seem to be the ones getting the blame. ""When you go to supermarkets, with thousands of people through their door every day, no track and trace, picking up items, I think it's very unfair the hospitality trade has been singled out."" Salon owner Michael James said businesses were ""living on a knife edge"" Michael James has owned a hair salon in the town for 37 years but said the past couple of weeks had seen business go ""very quiet"". He added: ""People are scared to come out. We're hanging in there. Tredegar wasn't exactly booming before all this happened.Â ""Most valleys towns are the same. I think a number of shops would be closing if this went on until March - half the town might go."" Blaenau Gwent has overtaken another heads of the valleys area Merthyr Tydfil - which still has more than 217 positive tests per 100,000 and was also ranked seventh hardest-hit UK area. These two local authorities are among11 local areas, along with Llanelli town, which have been put into local lockdown. Caerphilly now has one of the biggest falling case rates, lying at 50.8 cases per 100,000 in the most recent week, lower than the Welsh average and ranking 96th in the UK. Figuring out the stats about Covid-19 in Wales Tackling coronavirus 'down to every one of us' Wales' local coronavirus lockdowns: What are the rules? There are also ""areas of concern"" in other areas,which has led to four north Wales council areas also facing restrictions from Thursday. First Minister Mark Drakeford earlier met council leaders to discuss coronavirus cases in the region. The worries were over rising rates in Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, and Wrexham It comes as theso-called R-number - an estimate of the infection rate in Wales - has risen. This measures the average number a sick person could pass the virus on to - so anything above one means it is spreading. The R rate is now between 1.0 and 1.4 in Wales, however the true figure is expected to be higher, according to the Welsh Government's scientific expert group, the Technical Advisory Cell. Previously it was estimated at being between 0.7 and 1.2, with Mr Drakeford saying officials were ""confident it is above one"". Meanwhile, the latest ONS weekly mortality figures show the total number of covid deaths in the pandemic in Wales up to 18 September was 2,575. Cardiff has had the largest number of deaths with 389, followed by Rhondda Cynon Taf with 303 up to 18 September but the rate of increase has dramatically slowed down in recent months. So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are fewer than the five-year average for the most recent week. Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing. In Wales, the number of deaths fell to 555 in the latest week, 20 fewer than the 2015-19 average. Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?

"Greggs hints at job cuts as furlough scheme endsThe baker is consulting with its 25,000 staff to minimise cuts by putting people on fewer hours.Business","Staff at around half of Greggs' stores will have to accept fewer hours or face losing their jobs as the government's furlough scheme comes to an end. The bakery chain, which employs 25,000 workers, expects business activity to ""remain below normal for the foreseeable future"". Chief executive Roger Whiteside said ""about 50%"" of its shops have staffing that was too high for customer demand. He added there was ""no chance"" reducing hours would be enough to stop job cuts. ""Some stores have staff hours which are just off what's needed for current demand,"" said Mr Whiteside. ""But others are a long way off and will need significant change."" It is not clear if the company will usethe government's new Job Support Schemewhere employers and the state top up workers' pay who are on fewer hours. The scheme will replace the existing furlough programme which is coming to an end on 31 October. The vast majority of Greggs 25,000 workforce had been placed on furlough during lockdown and a quarter remained on the scheme when the company announced its interim results in July. Greggs declined to comment on how many jobs could potentially go from its shops, of which there are more than 2,000 across the UK. Mr Whiteside said: ""Some shops are well down and, unsurprisingly, these are the city centre stores or public transport sites."" But he said he did not expect cuts to be as steep as those already announced by Pret a Manager, where 3,000 are losing their jobs, or Upper Crust-owner SSP, which is making up to 5,000 people redundant. Pret A Manger to cut 3,000 jobs in the UK CUpper Crust owner SSP to cut up to 5,000 UK jobs ""Those businesses are very concentrated in the areas worst hit by the pandemic - we've got a much better spread of locations,"" he said. Greggs said it was currently consulting with unions and employee representatives about the changes. In a trading statement, it said that since reopening all its shops in July, like-for-like sales in the three months to 26 September have averaged 71.2% of the levels recorded in the same period last year. Greggs said sales in September were above that average, with a recovery in customer visits. However, it said August was a difficult month because of high temperatures and it was unable to take part in the government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme because its shops with seating were closed. In addition, average sales remain below the 80% level whichGreggs said in July was needed for the company to break even. Nevertheless, Greggs is moving ahead with opening a net 20 new shops this year, which it said will be ""predominantly in locations accessed by car"". The company said it had increased its digital investment during lockdown and ""click & collect"" - which allows customers pre-order and pay online before picking up food at a shop - has now been rolled out at all its stores. It has also launched food deliveries with delivery app Just East and said it was ""seeing encouraging participation levels"". By Dearbail Jordan, business reporter Greggs is facing a dilemma that many businesses are currently grappling with. Act now to deal with the current trading environment? Or hang on to see if the trends started by the pandemic - such as the accelerated shift to online - become permanent? It is little wonder that the bakery chain hasn't given any figures on how many jobs it may cut or how many workers will be placed on reduced hours. When it began consultations with its staff, the government's Job Support Scheme hadn't even been announced. Greggs was still working on the assumption that the furlough scheme would end on 31 October. Throw in the government's changed stance on people working from home and the spectre of a second wave of coronavirus cases and it is nearly impossible for companies to get a steady enough footing on which to make long-term decisions. Hotel Chocolat's boss Angus Thirlwell says the pandemic has simply sped up changes in the way that people are shopping. But that doesn't mean running a company at the moment is any less precarious. For Hotel Chocolat, that means avoiding knee-jerk reactions. For businesses everywhere, it will mean navigating a minefield. ""Greggs will undoubtedly survive and be able to thrive once again,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at business consultancy Begbies Traynor. ""But its struggles tell the story of every business in the UK. ""What worked before the pandemic may not work during it. It, like many others, must adapt and change to the way that the world now works."" Separately, confectioner Hotel Chocolat announced that after a strong first half, sales and profits tumbled in the second six months of its financial year as lockdown was imposed. Overall annual sales for the year to 28 June rose by 3% to Â£136.2m. Revenue grew 14% in the first six months before sinking by 14% in the second half. Lockdown meant Hotel Chocolat's physical shops were closed for Easter, one of its key trading periods. It reported a Â£6.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£10.9m profit in the previous year. The company said that it had been able to react quickly to the changing circumstances. When its shops  - which typically generate 70% of sales in the second half of its financial year - were closed two weeks before Easter, it recalled its inventory to its distribution centres and was able to grow sales online and through partners who sell its goods. But Angus Thirlwell, Hotel Chocolat's co-founder and chief executive, said that since reopening its shops, ""we are seeing a very patchy picture"". He told the BBC's Today programme that while tourist spots such as Shrewsbury, Hitchin, Truro and Chichester were doing well, ""the places that are tougher are city centres, transit and tourist-based locations... which is no surprise"". ""All we're trying to do is disentangle the very short-term kind of impact from the more longer-term shift towards online,"" he added. Asked whether the shift from High Street shops to online was permanent or not, and whether retailers should be changing their business models, Mr Thirlwell said: ""I think there is going to be a lasting legacy from this which is that five years of what was going to happen anyway has just happened in five months."" He said it could have implications on ""where we should have our Hotel Chocolat locations"", but the company was also trying to ""avoid doing knee-jerk reactions"".

Here are the main stories we've been covering, both here in the UK and around the world.  Mike Coupe, former chief executive at Sainsbury's istaking over as director of Covid-19 testing at England's Test and Trace agency. He left the supermarket chain in May and replaces Sarah-Jane Marsh, who earlier this monthissued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the coronavirus testing system. Mr Coupe has experience in running supply chains and logistics, said the Department for Health and Social Care. But Labour shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it would make more sense to put ""those trained in actual infectious disease control in charge"". At Test and Trace, Mr Coupe will be joining other former retail executives. The head of the service, Dido Harding, worked at Tesco and Sainsbury's before spending seven years as boss of TalkTalk. As we've been reporting, the rate of infections in many parts of the world appears to be picking up. So here is a reminder on what simple measures we all need to take to stay safe - beginning with washing the hands. Simple guide to staying safe. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Covid-19 cases in parts of Canada have been rising at an
alarming rate and last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned the
country was experiencing a second wave. Some regions are now further tightening restrictions. Quebec will close
bars and restaurants for 28 days, in three âred zonesâ across the country,
including the city of Montreal. Indoor home
gatherings will also be forbidden. The province saw 750 new cases on Monday,
and 896 on Sunday, its highest tally since the spring. In Ontario, where
about 40% of the countryâs population lives, new cases reached an all-time
peak, with 700 new cases. Thatâs 60 cases higher than the previous high of 640
on 24 April. The milestone
renewed calls to scale back reopening â the Ontario Hospital Association urged
the province to go back to Stage 2, which would shutter restaurants and bars
except for outdoor dining, and other businesses like gyms. Ontario Premier
Doug Ford did not announce such measures on Monday, the same day casinos
reopened across the province. Last week, with cases rising, the province issued
an earlier closing time for bars and shut down strip clubs. Chief Medical
Officer of Health Dr David Williams said the province may consider further
âtargetedâ closures as needed. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The rules people are being told to follow are becoming a lot more complicated and can vary significantly in different parts of the UK. But at the same time the government is ramping up enforcement - creating criminal offences and introducing fines for those who don't follow them. That's why it's so important that ministers can explain to the public what the rules are and the rationale behind them. On two occasions today, the prime minister and a junior minister have beenunable to do so. Opposition parties accuse the government of not being in control - and not understanding the rules it is enforcing. But at the same time the PM is facing pressure from within his own party - with a significant bloc of Tory backbenchers demanding Parliament has more of a say when new restrictions are brought in. They fear some of the decisions go too far - and perhaps don't make sense. The PM being unable to explain them won't help. Restrctions have already been tightened in other parts of Wales - and now four councils in north Wales are to go into ""local lockdown"". The new measures for Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham come into effect at 18:00 BST on Thursday. Vaughan Gething, Wales' health minister, made the announcement in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday evening. He said a similar pattern of transmission was being seen in the four areas as had happened in the south, but rates in neighbouring Gwynedd and Anglesey currently ""remain low"". Travel to and from the areas will not be permitted unless people have a ""reasonable excuse"", such as work or for buying essentials. It will be illegal to meet others indoors who are not within your immediate household. You can read more about it here. Some GPs and pharmacies haverun out of flu jabs in the UKamid high demand - and are asking people to wait until more stock can be delivered. Boots says it has had to suspend bookings. But there is no national shortage, government officials say, and there are enough doses to vaccinate the 30 million people who are deemed most vulnerable to flu. The over-65s, and those in higher risk groups, are being given priority. Once those groups have been immunised, healthy 50 to 64-year-olds in England will, for the first time, be eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS. This is to help protect against the double threat of flu and coronavirus this winter. Research shows people can catch both diseases at the same time, with serious and sometimes deadly consequences. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter On-the-spot coronavirus tests â 120 million of them â which
give results within minutes are being made available to low- and middle-income
countries by the World Health Organization. One of the tests â the South Korean-made SD BioSensor â is
 already in use in Italy to screen people at airports. But these speedy tests are not currently available in the
UK. Thatâs partly because different countries have different
ways of approving tests, and hold them to different standards. And the UK has generally erred on the side of caution in
this arena. Apart from a natural risk aversion, these very quick tests
are considerably less sensitive than the standard test used in the NHS. That
means they pick up fewer cases and tell more people theyâre negative when they
do in fact have the virus. For countries that donât have the infrastructure to run big
labs and currently have very little access to any testing at all, these kits
could be a game-changer. The UK is instead focusing its energy on two other rapid
tests, which take more like 90 minutes to process than ten and are roughly as
sensitive as the standard diagnostic test. South Africa lost 2.2 million jobs during the country's coronavirus lockdown earlier this year - one of the strictest in the world. This is the biggest fall in job numbers since 2008, when the country's employment survey began. Most businesses were shut for five weeks from 27 March, and as a result the economy shrank at an unprecedented level. Read the full story of South Africa's unemployment crisishere. Updated to include the data released earlier this afternoon... Primary schools in New York have reopened and welcomed children for in-person lessons, after being closed for six months. The reopening of primary schools is the second stage in a three-part plan for reopening education. Last week, nursery-age children and some children with special educational needs were allowed back into buildings. Middle and High School pupils are expected to return to in-person classes on Thursday. But this comes as Mayor Bill de Blasio warns that New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". He also says anyone who refuses to wear a mask in public will be fined. A village in southern Romania has re-elected a beloved local mayor, Ion Aliman, 10 days after his death of Covid-19. His death was so close to the election that it was too late to remove his name from the ballot, Associated Press news agency reports. Because of this, residents of Deveselu village paid their respects by casting their votes for him anyway. Aliman won 1,057 of the 1,600 votes cast in the village, which is home to just 3,000 people. His victory was a landslide, meaning that had he been alive he would have won an unprecedented third term. The popular mayor would have celebrated his 57th birthday on election day. The landlord said his decision to allow the funeral to take place on the pubs grounds ""was led by a personal friendship"" with the biker who had died A pub landlord has apologised after 300 people turned up for a biker's funeral, ""far exceeding"" the number expected.  Police visited The Gate Hangs Well, in Syston, Leicestershire, on Friday where a service was being held in a marquee.  Publican Neil Henderson said it was set up to seat 30 people but he was ""naive"" to think numbers ""would be manageable"" and voluntarily closed when regulations were no longer met.  Police said the group was dispersed and a fixed penalty notice was issued.  Mr Henderson said he did not know how much the fine would be but Charnwood Police said in a tweet it could be ""up to Â£10k"".  Read more here Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent While the number of new infections and deaths will cause
alarm â both are up on previous days â the data on hospital admissions is more
encouraging.  For the fourth day in a row, the numbers have come down in
England.  On Sunday there were 241 admissions, down from 314 on
Wednesday.  To put that in context, at the peak England was seeing 3,000
admissions a day.  This mirrors what has been seen in France and Spain â a
gradual upward trend in serious Covid cases, but not the rapid increase that
was seen in the spring.  Even the number of new daily cases â the highest on record
at over 7,000 â is still below the doomsday trajectory the governmentâs senior
advisers warned about last week when they said there could be 50,000 cases a
day by mid October.  It all points to a second wave, but one that is more
manageable than feared by some.  It is, though, still early days. The areas with the highest
rates in the North West and North East are causing concern.  And we are just at the start of the autumn and winter season
when respiratory viruses circulate more.  Another unknown is the impact the problems with testing are
having on the ability of the system to pick up on cases.  Last week surveillance suggested perhaps less than half of
cases were being picked up.  That is why, arguably, it is more important to pay close
attention to hospital cases in the coming days and weeks to measure the true
impact Covidâs second wave is having.  Last Tuesday, 22 September, there were 37 deaths recorded - which has now nearly doubled, to 71. And the number of cases recorded that day was 4,926, whereas it is now over 7,000. But it's important to note cases had dropped for the past three days, while deaths had dropped for the past two days. Here's the overall picture of how things have changed in the past seven days.  There were lower numbers for deaths and cases at the weekend and on Monday - but that's usually the case, due to the fact more are recorded during the week. Officials in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, are preparing a burial site that will have 6,000 additional graves for people who've died of Covid-19. Indonesia has the highest virus death toll in South East Asia, and is currently dealing with another surge in deaths. It has now had more than 280,000 reported infections, and more than 10,000 deaths. The country has recorded more than 4,000 new cases of the virus each day for almost 10 days, despite limited testing. Gravediggers have told local media that they've been rushing to bury as many bodies as possible during daylight hours. Cemeteries in the capital have been running out of space. From today people in New York City will be fined if they refuse to wear masks, Mayor Bill de Blasio says. Officials will first offer free masks to anyone not wearing one. If that person then refuses, then they will be fined. De Blasio didn't specify how much the fine would be. He also says New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". ""Obviously everyone is concerned about that,"" he says. ""That is something we all have to work on together to address."" New York City was the original epicentre of the US outbreak, during the country's first wave of the virus in spring. While the 7,143 lab-confirmed cases recorded in the UK is the highest since the outbreak began, experts have previously warned that describing the daily figure as a record could be ""misleading"". That's because it is not clear how many people were actually infected at the height of the first wave due to a lack of mass testing in the community. Coronavirus cases have been rising again since July, but the rate of growth has increased since the end of August. The 71 deaths recorded were the highest UK total announced since1 July.,external Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been nearly 57,900 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.

"NHS faces pandemic 'triple whammy' this winterHealth bosses warn about rising Covid-19 cases, a major backlog in treatment and reduced capacity.HealthComments","The NHS is facing a ""triple whammy"" of rising Covid-19 cases, a major backlog in treatment and reduced capacity due to infection-control measures, according to health bosses. The NHS Confederation report on the English NHS said more investment was desperately needed. The NHS bosses also called on ministers to be ""honest and realistic"" about waiting lists for treatment. It comes despite the government promising an extra Â£3bn this winter. That money - announced over the summer - was intended to: help hospitals cope with the extra-infection control measures required pay for patients to be treated privately for routine treatment, such as knee and hip replacements But hospitals are still performing only half the number of routine operations they normally would. Two million patients have already waited longer than 18 weeks for treatment, the highest number since records began, in 2007. And services in other areas, such as cancer care, are running at about three-quarters capacity. Of the more than 250 bosses who responded to the confederation's survey: fewer than one in 10 said the current level of funding allowed them to deliver safe and effective care nearly nine in 10 said a lack of funding would be a significant barrier to achieving waiting-time targets for everything from mental-health care to cancer treatment and routine operations SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? NHS Confederation  chief executive Danny Mortimer said a sustainable plan had to be found for the NHS. ""No-one can be in any doubt that the road to recovery for the NHS and social-care services will be long,"" he said. ""Despite dire predictions that it would not be able to cope, the NHS has not only managed a huge wave of Covid patients but also continued to treat millions not infected with the virus. ""We have learned much and are in a better position to manage the virus than first time round, despite still not having an effective test-and-trace system."" Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, called the report ""deeply concerning"". A ""serious shortage"" of nursing staff was putting a strain on services and the people who worked in them, she added.

Blaenau Gwent hardest-hit Covid-19 area in UK,"Council leaders have urged residents to help ""get things under control and hopefully avoid a tougher lockdown"" The locked-down county of Blaenau Gwent has one of the highest and fastest rising case rates for Covid-19 infection in the UK. A case rate of 307.7 positive results per 100,000 in the week to 26 September was reported by Public Health Wales. Merthyr Tydfil also has one of the highest rates - but Caerphilly has seen one of the biggest falls. There were five deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest week reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is four more than the week before and 0.9% of all deaths. Councillor labelled 'reckless' for blaming coronavirus cases on 5G The ONS reports registered deaths, which involve Covid-19 cases both suspected by doctors and confirmed by laboratories, and in different places, such as hospitals, hospices and at home. There were two deaths registered in Flintshire, one in a hospital and one in a care home. The other deaths were in hospital involving patients from Caerphilly, RCT and Merthyr Tydfil. Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population in seven days to 26 September Burnley314 Blaenau Gwent307.7 Knowsley283 Liverpool266 Newcastle-upon-Tyne258 Derry & Strabane237 It has the fastest case rise in Wales - 307.7 per 100,000 up to 26 September - 215 actual cases, over a seven-day period. Earlier analysis by the BBC suggested it was also the hardest-hit area in the UK for the week up to 25 September. But the most recent figures out on Tuesday saw Burnley in Lancashire overtake Blaenau Gwent, on 314 cases per 100,000. The areas hardest hit for infection rate rises in recent weeks have been in the north of England. Blaenau Gwent also had the highest rate of positive tests in Wales - 10.4% in the past week. Any figure above 4% is worrying for health officials. A cluster of cases in the Brynmawr area in particular has been causing concern and a mobile testing unit was set up last week in Nantyglo. Mererid Bowley, interim public health director at Aneurin Bevan health board, said she hoped it would ""help us learn more about the rate of infection, help us protect the residents of Blaenau Gwent"". CounciI leader Nigel Daniels also urged residents to ""do what's needed"" and ""help to fight off any second wave of this dreadful virus in Wales"". Darren Brice, landlord of The Castle in Tredegar, said just two people were in the pub on a Tuesday lunchtime and any further restrictions would be ""devastating"" for all pubs in the town. ""For some of them there's been no coming back,"" he said. ""We seem to be the ones getting the blame. ""When you go to supermarkets, with thousands of people through their door every day, no track and trace, picking up items, I think it's very unfair the hospitality trade has been singled out."" Salon owner Michael James said businesses were ""living on a knife edge"" Michael James has owned a hair salon in the town for 37 years but said the past couple of weeks had seen business go ""very quiet"". He added: ""People are scared to come out. We're hanging in there. Tredegar wasn't exactly booming before all this happened.Â ""Most valleys towns are the same. I think a number of shops would be closing if this went on until March - half the town might go."" Blaenau Gwent has overtaken another heads of the valleys area Merthyr Tydfil - which still has more than 217 positive tests per 100,000 and was also ranked seventh hardest-hit UK area. These two local authorities are among11 local areas, along with Llanelli town, which have been put into local lockdown. Caerphilly now has one of the biggest falling case rates, lying at 50.8 cases per 100,000 in the most recent week, lower than the Welsh average and ranking 96th in the UK. Figuring out the stats about Covid-19 in Wales Tackling coronavirus 'down to every one of us' Wales' local coronavirus lockdowns: What are the rules? There are also ""areas of concern"" in other areas,which has led to four north Wales council areas also facing restrictions from Thursday. First Minister Mark Drakeford earlier met council leaders to discuss coronavirus cases in the region. The worries were over rising rates in Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, and Wrexham It comes as theso-called R-number - an estimate of the infection rate in Wales - has risen. This measures the average number a sick person could pass the virus on to - so anything above one means it is spreading. The R rate is now between 1.0 and 1.4 in Wales, however the true figure is expected to be higher, according to the Welsh Government's scientific expert group, the Technical Advisory Cell. Previously it was estimated at being between 0.7 and 1.2, with Mr Drakeford saying officials were ""confident it is above one"". Meanwhile, the latest ONS weekly mortality figures show the total number of covid deaths in the pandemic in Wales up to 18 September was 2,575. Cardiff has had the largest number of deaths with 389, followed by Rhondda Cynon Taf with 303 up to 18 September but the rate of increase has dramatically slowed down in recent months. So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are fewer than the five-year average for the most recent week. Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing. In Wales, the number of deaths fell to 555 in the latest week, 20 fewer than the 2015-19 average. Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?

Covid survivor: 'I have come out the other end',"This video can not be played Covid ICU patient Tam McCue on his 'slow recovery' Covid survivor Tam McCue is one of the lucky ones I first met him when he was just out of intensive care in the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley where he had been on a ventilator for nearly two weeks. At one pointMr McCue, who could barely speak, didn't think he would live. His wife was even worrying about who could attend his funeral. Fast forward five months and Mr McCue, of Barrhead, East Renfrewshire, is back from the brink. Mr McCue, 64, told BBC Scotland: ""I just want to move forward. I don't want to go back and say 'Look at me. I've beat this. I've kicked its back end'. ""I haven't. I have come out the other end, definitely. Might be a long way to go."" The food distribution driver finished his shift on Friday 24 April and, in his own words, ""went down like a bag of washing"" on the Sunday. 'I missed my first shift in 30 years when I got Covid-19' He became desperately ill but, thankfully, it only went as far as his lungs. Mr McCue spoke to BBC Scotland in May while he was a patient at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. With coronavirus some patients have have suffered multiple organ failure which also affected their heart, kidneys, brain and gut. Mr McCue describes his recovery as a ""rollercoaster"". He added: ""It's a slow process. You think you can do things then the tiredness and fatigue sets in."" Mr McCue believes his active lifestyle has helped him to pull through but admits the potential long term damage to his body plays on his mind. A simple task, such as taking out the bins, highlights how far he has come but he is taking nothing for granted. He said: ""It lies in the back of your mind. As years go on, how are you going to be? Is it going to get you again? It does play on you. It definitely does. As part of his recovery Mr McCue is attending the Ins:pire clinic online. It is normally a face-to-face rehabilitation clinic which involves multiple specialties, including pharmacists, physiotherapists and psychologists. Mr McCue is one of the first Covid survivors to take part in the five-week programme, which started earlier this month. ICU Consultant Dr Lisa Gemmell said ICU patients may take between six months and a year to improve. Lisa Gemmell, an ICU consultant at the Royal Alexandra, described Mr Mccue as an ""A-star patient"". She said: ""We don't expect them to be feeling their full self until to between six months and a year after intensive care discharge and sometimes they might not ever get back to their previous level of function."" At the peak of the pandemic the Paisley hospital was more than double its usual capacity for intensive care patients. It is now back to a single ICU but is ready to scale up with 24 hours notice, should there be a second surge of cases. Dr Gemmell added: ""Seeing these patients, like Tam, lifts our spirits and we desperately need that. ""It is refreshing to see, particularly for the difficult months that could lie ahead of us.""

Island economy 'scarred' by Covid-19 restrictions,"Social distancing has limited capacity to about 20% on some ferry services to and from Arran The loss of visitors and reduced ferry capacity to Arran during the Covid pandemic could have ""long-term scarring effects"" on the island's labour market. A new study has highlighted a third of Arran's economy is reliant on the tourism and hospitality sector. It also suggested the ferry service is worth Â£170,000 a day to the island. The report, by the the Fraser of Allander Institute, said island communities had been hit ""disproportionately hard"". In June, community leaders on Arran suggested thatday trips to the island should be bannedwhile Scotland was tackling the coronavirus. The Arran Recovery Group (ARG) said it wanted only tourists staying multiple nights to be allowed on the ferry. Social distancing has limited capacity to about 20% on some services. Call for daytrips to Arran to be banned Physical distancing on Arran ferries 'unrealistic' for tourism Local councillor Alex Gallagher described the new report as a ""wake-up call"" and pushed for support from the Scottish and UK governments. He said: ""Nowhere has escaped the economic impact of Covid-19, but some areas have felt it far more sharply than others - areas such as Arran. ""The report highlights that Arran's labour market has been more severely affected than surrounding areas and Scotland as a whole. ""Even as restrictions have eased, the report shows Arran is still struggling to recover and that there will be longer-term impacts on Arran's businesses and communities."" Arran's Gross Value Added (GVA) - the measure of the value of goods and services produced on the island - was estimated to be more than Â£77m in 2018. In the first half of 2020, GVA fell by 33% as a result of a lower number of ferry passengers. The view from Goatfell on Arran Mairi Spowage, deputy director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, said there were ""challenging times ahead"" for island communities. She added: ""Arran's dominant hospitality sector has made it particularly exposed to the initial lockdown restrictions and the ensuing capacity and social distancing regulations as the economy began to open back up. ""Like most island economies, Arran is constrained by its infrastructure and is reliant on its ferries to transport commuters and tourists. ""National policy must recognise the unique challenges that island economies are facing in the months and years ahead as we recover from this economic crisis."" The Scottish government said it had recently announced a Â£2m programme of ""locally-led green projects"" designed to help support island communities. It said it would ""help businesses recover from the impacts of the pandemic and create new, quality jobs"". A spokesman added: ""We are also doing everything we can with the limited powers available to us to support the tourism sector."" The UK government said schemes introduced by the chancellor had ""protected jobs and businesses across Scotland"". A spokeswoman said: ""Thenew package of measureswill continue to protect jobs in Scotland, and help businesses through the uncertain months ahead, as we continue to tackle the spread of the virus.""

Smoking at children's football games to be banned,"The ban will be phased in between September 2020 and 2022 Smoking on the touchlines at children's football matches is being banned by the Football Association of Wales. A total of 522 junior clubs affiliated to the FAW will be required to enforce the ban and will have to tell spectators that smoking is not allowed. It is being phased in this month at under-12s games and will then be expanded to take in under-14s. Smokers' group Forest said the number of smokers at games would be small and ""most eyes will be on the football"". Clubs are being given promotional material to help them to publicise the ban, which has been set up with anti-smoking campaign group ASH Wales. Sports clubs 'could lose a generation of players' It comes after a pilot was held at Rhondda and District Football League's mini and junior football games and at the South Wales Women's and Girls' League junior matches. The Welsh Government plans toban smoking in playgrounds,externalby March. Clubs are being given promotional material to help them to publicise the ban Health Minister Vaughan Gething praised the ban by the FAW and its trust, which supports grassroots football. ""Voluntary bans like this one help protect children from seeing smoking as an acceptable and normal behaviour and can help prevent them from taking up smoking in the first place,"" he said. Dr David Adams, from the FAW Trust, said: ""As a parent of children who take part in grassroots football, I am delighted with our partnership with ASH Wales, and that the FAW and FAW Trust are leading the way to help the next generation of children grow up recognising the health risks associated with smoking."" Donna Williams, Su Griffith, Liam Jones and Evelyn Roberts shared their views on the streets in Porthmadog Former smoker Su Griffith agrees with the ban, saying ""losing two hours not being able to have a cigarette isn't going to kill them"". Liam Jones said it was a ""good idea"" to protect people from second-hand smoke. ""It can affect kids' minds as well, thinking it's OK to smoke,"" he added. Evelyn Roberts said the ban was ""fine as long as there is a smoking shed or somewhere else for them to smoke"". And non-smoker Donna Williams said: ""For the health of young children, I agree with banning it."" George Oliver, Gemma Walsh and Rob Morville give their views in Cardiff Parents at a children's football training session in Cardiff supported the move. George Oliver said he did not see most parents smoking on the sidelines, but anything which re-enforced the message ""has got to be a really positive thing"". Gemma Walsh said the move was ""a good idea"", while Rob Morville agreed, adding: ""If you've got parents on the sidelines smoking, that's only going to give a bad impression to the children."" Suzanne Cass, from ASH Wales, said there was ""an urgent need to address youth smoking prevalence which is still at an unacceptable level"". ""This policy will make a big difference to children's perception of smoking and we very much hope that this will prevent many of them from taking up the habit in later life,"" she said. Simon Clark, director of smokers' lobby group Forest, said ""smoking in the open air does not put anyone else's health at risk"". ""This is virtue-signalling by the FAW and further evidence that the war on tobacco is now a moral crusade with unintended consequences for tolerance and moderation,"" he said. ""A genuine problem at children's football matches is pushy parents screaming abuse at referees.""

"BBC boss 'prepared to fire stars who break rules'New director general Tim Davie also says he will ""take people off Twitter"" if necessary.Entertainment & Arts","Party politics is ""not the right place to be"" for top BBC presenters, Tim Davie said BBC director general Tim Davie has said he would be prepared to sack presenters who make major breaches of impartiality guidelines on social media. Mr Davie, who became DG earlier this month, said new social media rules would be announced in the coming weeks, and would apply to all staff. ""I am prepared to take the appropriate disciplinary action, all the way to termination,"" Mr Davie said. He said he would also be able ""to take people off Twitter"" if necessary. His comments come after criticism of stars such as Gary Lineker, who has courted controversy in the past for sharing his political views on Twitter. Responding to Mr Davie's comments on Tuesday,the Match of the Day host said:,external""I think only Twitter can take people off Twitter."" Mr Davie told MPs on the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee: ""Enforcement actions will be very clear, we will be able to take disciplinary action, we'll be able to take people off Twitter. I know people want to see hard action on this."" Pressed on how people could be removed from Twitter, he clarified that in some cases he would ask staff to suspend their Twitter accounts if they wanted to continue working for the BBC. He told the MPs he wouldn't rush into far-reaching action. ""I know some people would like me to fire [people] immediately [when] there is a foot fault,"" he said. ""I'm sure over your career and my career, sometimes we have not acted perfectly. So there will be a range of enforcements. Sometimes someone just needs a talking to. Other times there will be more serious matters."" Gary Lineker has been criticised for sharing his political views on Twitter The action taken would not depend on the stature of the star involved, but there would be a distinction between occasional contributors and those who are ""the face of the BBC"", he said. ""Social media guidelines will make clear where the lines are. If someone is a face of the BBC, I think entering into party politics seems to me not the right place to be."" Gary Lineker takes Â£400,000 BBC pay cut Asked specifically about Lineker, Mr Davie said the former footballer had ""always got a flavoursome turn of phrase"", but ""understands his responsibilities as a person within the BBC"". He said: ""We will issue the social media guidelines which will be clear. I would note that Gary Lineker has been very clear in his statements recently, saying, 'I understand I have responsibilities while working at the BBC'. ""Those responsibilities will be clearly laid out. I am the director general so I am now running the show, and in my view, party political statements are not the right thing for people to be making if they are part of an impartial news organisation."" In the past, there have been ""a few tweets and a few incidents"" from BBC staff and presenters that ""in my mind have not furthered the BBC's reputation for impartiality"", Mr Davie said. The new social media guidelines will cover people working in all areas of BBC programming, Mr Davie said. ""The bar will be higher for news and current affairs, but there will also be a bar for those people working as BBC talent across the organisation, across genres,"" he said. ""I don't think this is about banning people on social media, by the way. We must be up there. I passionately believe that impartial reporting can be flavoursome. The idea that it's dull is wrong."" Zoe Ball was the second top earner at the BBC last year, after Lineker Lineker topped the BBC's most recent ""star salaries"" list with Â£1.75m in the 2019-20 financial year, but has announced he will take a 23% pay cut, amounting to Â£400,000. The second highest earner was Zoe Ball, who was paid Â£1.36m to host the Radio 2 breakfast show. MPs asked Mr Davie why Ball is paid more than triple the salary of the station's mid-morning presenter Ken Bruce,despite attracting fewer listeners than him. Ball has lost around a million listeners since taking over from her predecessor Chris Evans, who was paid around Â£240,000 more than her. Mr Davie referred to ""the historical rate for the Radio 2 breakfast show"" and said such leading presenters were able to look at ""entertainment options across television and radio"". ""Don't get me wrong,"" he added. ""I've inherited some of this. You've seen what we've done with Gary. I want to make sure that we are getting as best value as we can in the market, and better value where we can. ""I've spent a lot of the last few years working in the international market, fighting for talent. There is an element of hyper-inflation, as all these services pile in, and people with TV personality and profile will be difficult to get. ""I'm all for developing young talent and taking more risk or opportunity with developing talent coming through. But I absolutely think that with a few people, and it is a very small number of people, we are in a bit of a market."" Andrew Neil announced at the weekend he was leaving the BBC Recent media reports have suggested Ball will request a pay cut when renegotiating her current contract in the coming weeks. ""With Zoe in particular, she's an outstanding broadcaster, we are in a renegotiation and we'll be looking where we go forward,"" Mr Davie said. Mr Davie also addressed the departure of political interviewer Andrew Neil to become the face and chairman of new TV channel GB News. The director general said the issue was not the amount he had offered Neil to stay, but ""what he wants to do with his life"". He said: ""Andrew's an outstanding broadcaster. We had a good conversation, I made a good offer, he had a better one. We move on. He's been brilliant."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Amnesty International to halt India operationsThe human rights watchdog tells the BBC that the move comes due to reprisal from the government.India,"The watchdog says it has had to suspend its campaign and research work in India (file photo) Amnesty International says it has been forced to halt its India operations due to ""reprisals"" from the government. The watchdog also accused the government of pursuing a ""witch-hunt"" against human rights organisations. Amnesty said its bank accounts had been frozen and it had been forced to lay off staff in the country and suspend all its campaign and research work. India's government said in a statement that the accusations were ""unfortunate, exaggerated and far from the truth"". Rajat Khosla, Amnesty's senior director of research, advocacy and policy, told the BBC: ""We are facing a rather unprecedented situation in India. Amnesty International India has been facing an onslaught of attacks, bullying and harassment by the government in a very systematic manner. ""This is all down to the human rights work that we were doing and the government not wanting to answer questions we raised, whether it's in terms of our investigations into the Delhi riots, or the silencing of voices in Jammu and Kashmir."" In a report released last month,the group said police in the Indian capital, Delhi, committed human rights violationsduring deadly religious riots between Hindus and Muslims in February. Rebutting the claims, the Delhi police told The Hindu newspaper that Amnesty's report was ""lopsided, biased and malicious"". Earlier in August, on the first anniversary of the revocation of Indian-administered Kashmir's special status,Amnesty had called for the release of all detained political leaders, activists and journalists,external, and for the resumption of high-speed internet services in the region. In 2019, the watchdog testified before the US Foreign Affairs Committee during a hearing on human rights in South Asia, where it highlighted its findings on arbitrary detentions, and the use of excessive force and torture in Kashmir. Responding to Amnesty's announcement on Tuesday, the government said the group had broken the law by circumventing rules around foreign donations. ""India, by settled law, does not allow interference in domestic political debates by entities funded by foreign donations."" the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement. ""This law applies equally to all and it shall apply to Amnesty International as well."" The current government has previously stated that Amnesty was being investigated over suspicions that the group was violating foreign funding laws. ""That's a blatant lie,"" Mr Khosla, the Amnesty spokesman, told the BBC. ""Amnesty India is in full compliance with all domestic legal requirements and international legal requirements as well,"" he said. This video can not be played Delhi riots: 'No-one who saw the photo thought I would survive' Amnesty has repeatedly condemned what it says is a crackdown on dissent in India. The group, which has faced scrutiny by different government agencies over the past few years, says the freezing of its bank accounts earlier this month was the final straw. In August 2016, a case of sedition was filed against Amnesty India over allegations that anti-India slogans were raised at one of its events. Three years later, a court ordered the charges to be dropped. Amnesty International accuses India police of rights abuses Article 370: What happened with Kashmir and why it matters In October 2018, the group's offices in the southern city of Bangalore were raided by the Enforcement Directorate, which investigates financial crimes. Its accounts were frozen then too, but Amnesty says it was able to access them after seeking a court's intervention. In early 2019, the group says dozens of its small donors were sent letters by the country's income tax department. And later in the same year, Amnesty's offices were raided again, this time by the Central Bureau of Investigation, based on a case registered by India's home affairs ministry. India has had a fraught relationship with Kashmir for decades Successive governments in India have been wary of foreign-funded non-profit organisations, particularly in the human rights field.

Amnesty International to halt India operations,"The watchdog says it has had to suspend its campaign and research work in India (file photo) Amnesty International says it has been forced to halt its India operations due to ""reprisals"" from the government. The watchdog also accused the government of pursuing a ""witch-hunt"" against human rights organisations. Amnesty said its bank accounts had been frozen and it had been forced to lay off staff in the country and suspend all its campaign and research work. India's government said in a statement that the accusations were ""unfortunate, exaggerated and far from the truth"". Rajat Khosla, Amnesty's senior director of research, advocacy and policy, told the BBC: ""We are facing a rather unprecedented situation in India. Amnesty International India has been facing an onslaught of attacks, bullying and harassment by the government in a very systematic manner. ""This is all down to the human rights work that we were doing and the government not wanting to answer questions we raised, whether it's in terms of our investigations into the Delhi riots, or the silencing of voices in Jammu and Kashmir."" In a report released last month,the group said police in the Indian capital, Delhi, committed human rights violationsduring deadly religious riots between Hindus and Muslims in February. Rebutting the claims, the Delhi police told The Hindu newspaper that Amnesty's report was ""lopsided, biased and malicious"". Earlier in August, on the first anniversary of the revocation of Indian-administered Kashmir's special status,Amnesty had called for the release of all detained political leaders, activists and journalists,external, and for the resumption of high-speed internet services in the region. In 2019, the watchdog testified before the US Foreign Affairs Committee during a hearing on human rights in South Asia, where it highlighted its findings on arbitrary detentions, and the use of excessive force and torture in Kashmir. Responding to Amnesty's announcement on Tuesday, the government said the group had broken the law by circumventing rules around foreign donations. ""India, by settled law, does not allow interference in domestic political debates by entities funded by foreign donations."" the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement. ""This law applies equally to all and it shall apply to Amnesty International as well."" The current government has previously stated that Amnesty was being investigated over suspicions that the group was violating foreign funding laws. ""That's a blatant lie,"" Mr Khosla, the Amnesty spokesman, told the BBC. ""Amnesty India is in full compliance with all domestic legal requirements and international legal requirements as well,"" he said. This video can not be played Delhi riots: 'No-one who saw the photo thought I would survive' Amnesty has repeatedly condemned what it says is a crackdown on dissent in India. The group, which has faced scrutiny by different government agencies over the past few years, says the freezing of its bank accounts earlier this month was the final straw. In August 2016, a case of sedition was filed against Amnesty India over allegations that anti-India slogans were raised at one of its events. Three years later, a court ordered the charges to be dropped. Amnesty International accuses India police of rights abuses Article 370: What happened with Kashmir and why it matters In October 2018, the group's offices in the southern city of Bangalore were raided by the Enforcement Directorate, which investigates financial crimes. Its accounts were frozen then too, but Amnesty says it was able to access them after seeking a court's intervention. In early 2019, the group says dozens of its small donors were sent letters by the country's income tax department. And later in the same year, Amnesty's offices were raided again, this time by the Central Bureau of Investigation, based on a case registered by India's home affairs ministry.

"Flu jab delays amid high demandOfficials in England say there will be enough stock to protect the vulnerable, but some will have to wait.Health","Some GPs and pharmacies have run out of flu jabs and are asking people to wait until more stock can be delivered. Boots says it has seen very high demand for the vaccine and has now had to suspend bookings. Government officials say there is no national shortage and there will be enough doses in the coming weeks and months to vaccinate the 30 million people deemed most vulnerable to flu. Available stocks are being given to the over-65s and high risk groups. Once those groups have been immunised, healthy 50 to 64-year-olds in England will, for the first time, be eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS. This is to help protect against the double threat of flu and coronavirus this winter - research shows people can catch both diseases at the same time, with serious and sometimes deadly consequences. There is currently no vaccine for coronavirus. How can I get a flu jab? Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Flu: Why we still need to worry about it this winter How bad will winter really be? Boots pharmacy said it had increased its order of flu jabs by around a fifth in anticipation of a very busy period, but the level of demand it had seen in the last few weeks was unprecedented. Flu vaccine ordering is done many months in advance of the flu season and the delivery is phased over the autumn and into winter. Head of the Royal College of GPs Prof Martin Marshall urged people to ""sit tight"" and stressed it was important that all those eligible for the flu jab came forward when told to do so. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: ""It is usual for manufacturers to stagger deliveries of the vaccine. Every year, there is a phased roll-out and vaccinations continue throughout the autumn. Some GP practices and pharmacies may ask people to wait until they receive further deliveries."" Helen Concilia from Seqirus, the company that supplies the type of flu vaccine used to immunise over 65s, said: ""We can confirm that there is no supply issue."" Jessica Kirby, Head of Health Advice at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: ""We'd urge people who are unable to book via their pharmacy or GP at this stage not to give up and to keep trying. Flu season lasts until spring, so whilst we'd encourage vaccination as early as possible, there is still time."" This year,the free vaccination is being offered,externalin England to: people who were required toshield from coronavirusand anyone they live with people withsome medical conditions,externalincluding diabetes, heart failure and asthma pregnant women pre-school children over the age of two all primary school children, as last year, and, for the first time, Year 7 pupils initially all people over 65, before the programme is extended to the over-50s healthcare and social care staff people living in a residential or nursing home people who are the main carer for an elderly or disabled person The NHS will get in contact with those who are eligible. Flu, like coronavirus, is a viral infection that is passed on through coughs and sneezes. Social distancing, masks and hand-washing should help reduce the spread. Most people with flu recover at home in a week, but people with chronic conditions or who are over 65 should call NHS 111. Anyone who thinks they have either flu or Covid-19 should stay at home and self-isolate.

Early pub closing 'putting shop workers at risk',"Shop workers are being put at greater risk of violence, verbal abuse and coronavirus infection by pubs shutting at 10pm, a retail union has warned. Usdaw said stores remaining open until later in England were likely to become ""very busy"" with people buying alcohol, ""triggering"" antisocial behaviour. Early pub closing was brought in last week in an effort to curb increasing rates of coronavirus. The government said it had taken ""immediate action"" to ""save lives"". What's the evidence for 10pm pub closing time? Call for 'urgent review' of early closures Parliament stops alcohol sales after 10pm Under the restrictions, which also apply in Scotland, pubs, bars and restaurants must shut no later than 10pm. Shops in England can continue selling alcohol until later. On Monday, Greater Manchester's Labour mayor Andy Burnham said supermarkets, convenience stores and off-licences were now ""packed out to the rafters"" after closing time. Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis told the BBC the situation had left him ""deeply concerned"" for staff. He added: ""Sale of alcohol has always been a major flashpoint for violence, threats and abuse against shop workers, whether it's age-identification or refusing a sale to someone who is already drunk, which are both legal requirements. ""Additional problems arise when licensing laws are not the same as shop opening hours or off-sales licensing hours are longer than on-sales."" Pub hours have been cut in England, Scotland and Wales In Wales, under current rules, pubs must stop serving by 10pm andclose 20 minutes after that.Shops also have to stop selling alcohol by 10pm. Mr Lillis urged the government and councils in England to ""ensure that when they bring in new rules they consider the impact on retail and the staff"". ""Stores in town and city centres are particularly at risk of becoming very busy late at night and that could make it more difficult for our members to enforce social distancing, which is essential for keeping staff and customers safe,"" he said. Restricting coronavirus transmission would ""not be achieved by filling shops with late-night revellers"", Mr Lillis added. Labour has questioned whether closing pubs earlier will help contain the spread of coronavirus. But a government spokesperson said: ""These measures strike a balance between saving lives by protecting our NHS and the most vulnerable and minimising the wider impact on the economy and schools. ""The latest data suggests a considerable rise in the infection rate from within the hospitality sector in recent weeks, so we have taken immediate action to cut the transmission rate and save lives. As with all measures, we will keep them under constant review."" Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""What we've seen from the evidence is that the spread of the disease does tend to happen later at night after more alcohol has been consumed."" From Wednesday,pubs in Northern Ireland will have to close by 11pm,with no alcohol being served after 10.30pm.

"NHS faces pandemic 'triple whammy' this winterHealth bosses warn about rising Covid-19 cases, a major backlog in treatment and reduced capacity.Health","The NHS is facing a ""triple whammy"" of rising Covid-19 cases, a major backlog in treatment and reduced capacity due to infection-control measures, according to health bosses. The NHS Confederation report on the English NHS said more investment was desperately needed. The NHS bosses also called on ministers to be ""honest and realistic"" about waiting lists for treatment. It comes despite the government promising an extra Â£3bn this winter. That money - announced over the summer - was intended to: help hospitals cope with the extra-infection control measures required pay for patients to be treated privately for routine treatment, such as knee and hip replacements But hospitals are still performing only half the number of routine operations they normally would. Two million patients have already waited longer than 18 weeks for treatment, the highest number since records began, in 2007. And services in other areas, such as cancer care, are running at about three-quarters capacity. Of the more than 250 bosses who responded to the confederation's survey: fewer than one in 10 said the current level of funding allowed them to deliver safe and effective care nearly nine in 10 said a lack of funding would be a significant barrier to achieving waiting-time targets for everything from mental-health care to cancer treatment and routine operations SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? NHS Confederation  chief executive Danny Mortimer said a sustainable plan had to be found for the NHS. ""No-one can be in any doubt that the road to recovery for the NHS and social-care services will be long,"" he said. ""Despite dire predictions that it would not be able to cope, the NHS has not only managed a huge wave of Covid patients but also continued to treat millions not infected with the virus. ""We have learned much and are in a better position to manage the virus than first time round, despite still not having an effective test-and-trace system."" Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, called the report ""deeply concerning"". A ""serious shortage"" of nursing staff was putting a strain on services and the people who worked in them, she added.

"Greggs hints at job cuts as furlough scheme endsThe baker is consulting with its 25,000 staff to minimise cuts by putting people on fewer hours.","Staff at around half of Greggs' stores will have to accept fewer hours or face losing their jobs as the government's furlough scheme comes to an end. The bakery chain, which employs 25,000 workers, expects business activity to ""remain below normal for the foreseeable future"". Chief executive Roger Whiteside said ""about 50%"" of its shops have staffing that was too high for customer demand. He added there was ""no chance"" reducing hours would be enough to stop job cuts. ""Some stores have staff hours which are just off what's needed for current demand,"" said Mr Whiteside. ""But others are a long way off and will need significant change."" It is not clear if the company will usethe government's new Job Support Schemewhere employers and the state top up workers' pay who are on fewer hours. The scheme will replace the existing furlough programme which is coming to an end on 31 October. The vast majority of Greggs 25,000 workforce had been placed on furlough during lockdown and a quarter remained on the scheme when the company announced its interim results in July. Greggs declined to comment on how many jobs could potentially go from its shops, of which there are more than 2,000 across the UK. Mr Whiteside said: ""Some shops are well down and, unsurprisingly, these are the city centre stores or public transport sites."" But he said he did not expect cuts to be as steep as those already announced by Pret a Manager, where 3,000 are losing their jobs, or Upper Crust-owner SSP, which is making up to 5,000 people redundant. Pret A Manger to cut 3,000 jobs in the UK CUpper Crust owner SSP to cut up to 5,000 UK jobs ""Those businesses are very concentrated in the areas worst hit by the pandemic - we've got a much better spread of locations,"" he said. Greggs said it was currently consulting with unions and employee representatives about the changes. In a trading statement, it said that since reopening all its shops in July, like-for-like sales in the three months to 26 September have averaged 71.2% of the levels recorded in the same period last year. Greggs said sales in September were above that average, with a recovery in customer visits. However, it said August was a difficult month because of high temperatures and it was unable to take part in the government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme because its shops with seating were closed. In addition, average sales remain below the 80% level whichGreggs said in July was needed for the company to break even. Nevertheless, Greggs is moving ahead with opening a net 20 new shops this year, which it said will be ""predominantly in locations accessed by car"". The company said it had increased its digital investment during lockdown and ""click & collect"" - which allows customers pre-order and pay online before picking up food at a shop - has now been rolled out at all its stores. It has also launched food deliveries with delivery app Just East and said it was ""seeing encouraging participation levels"". By Dearbail Jordan, business reporter Greggs is facing a dilemma that many businesses are currently grappling with. Act now to deal with the current trading environment? Or hang on to see if the trends started by the pandemic - such as the accelerated shift to online - become permanent? It is little wonder that the bakery chain hasn't given any figures on how many jobs it may cut or how many workers will be placed on reduced hours. When it began consultations with its staff, the government's Job Support Scheme hadn't even been announced. Greggs was still working on the assumption that the furlough scheme would end on 31 October. Throw in the government's changed stance on people working from home and the spectre of a second wave of coronavirus cases and it is nearly impossible for companies to get a steady enough footing on which to make long-term decisions. Hotel Chocolat's boss Angus Thirlwell says the pandemic has simply sped up changes in the way that people are shopping. But that doesn't mean running a company at the moment is any less precarious. For Hotel Chocolat, that means avoiding knee-jerk reactions. For businesses everywhere, it will mean navigating a minefield. ""Greggs will undoubtedly survive and be able to thrive once again,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at business consultancy Begbies Traynor. ""But its struggles tell the story of every business in the UK. ""What worked before the pandemic may not work during it. It, like many others, must adapt and change to the way that the world now works."" Separately, confectioner Hotel Chocolat announced that after a strong first half, sales and profits tumbled in the second six months of its financial year as lockdown was imposed. Overall annual sales for the year to 28 June rose by 3% to Â£136.2m. Revenue grew 14% in the first six months before sinking by 14% in the second half. Lockdown meant Hotel Chocolat's physical shops were closed for Easter, one of its key trading periods. It reported a Â£6.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£10.9m profit in the previous year. The company said that it had been able to react quickly to the changing circumstances. When its shops  - which typically generate 70% of sales in the second half of its financial year - were closed two weeks before Easter, it recalled its inventory to its distribution centres and was able to grow sales online and through partners who sell its goods. But Angus Thirlwell, Hotel Chocolat's co-founder and chief executive, said that since reopening its shops, ""we are seeing a very patchy picture"". He told the BBC's Today programme that while tourist spots such as Shrewsbury, Hitchin, Truro and Chichester were doing well, ""the places that are tougher are city centres, transit and tourist-based locations... which is no surprise"". ""All we're trying to do is disentangle the very short-term kind of impact from the more longer-term shift towards online,"" he added. Asked whether the shift from High Street shops to online was permanent or not, and whether retailers should be changing their business models, Mr Thirlwell said: ""I think there is going to be a lasting legacy from this which is that five years of what was going to happen anyway has just happened in five months."" He said it could have implications on ""where we should have our Hotel Chocolat locations"", but the company was also trying to ""avoid doing knee-jerk reactions"".

Covid: Public spending rise could last longer,"The government must choose this autumn between more austerity and permanently higher spending, experts warn. Although the Autumn Budget has been cancelled, the Treasury is still set to publish a Spending Review containing government expenditure plans. Because of Covid-19, public spending is likely to rise to the highest share of national income in more than a decade, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies. If not, another bout of austerity will hit many public services, it warns. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The Spending Review will proceed this autumn, as planned. The chancellor has already confirmed that departmental spending will increase above inflation - both for day-to-day spending and longer-term investment."" The IFS forecasts come in a newly published advance chapter of its Green Budget 2020, which will be released in full next month. ""Plans will depend crucially on how much of the additional Â£70bn of public service spending - that's an increase of 20% on original plans - allocated this year to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic will need to be repeated in future years,"" the IFS said. ""Even if only a quarter of it is needed, for example to maintain purchases of personal protective equipment (PPE) and to keep a track-and-trace system going, then overall spending would have to rise well ahead of the plans set out in the last Budget, or another bout of austerity will be visited upon many public services."" The think tank said there would be other financial pressures, including on working-age social security spending and adult social care, while the economy was likely to be smaller than expected for a long period. ""The next set of spending decisions is likely therefore to result in public spending settling at a higher share of national income than it was after 10 years of Labour government back in 2007-08,"" it added. The IFS said the UK had been through the longest sustained squeeze in public spending on record, but despite this, on the eve of the pandemic, public spending was at 39.8% of national income, much the same as it was in 2007â08. Measures in Mr Sunak's Budget announced in March would have increased public spending by 10.7% over the next four years, but those plans had already been rendered obsolete by the coronavirus crisis, the think tank said. Ben Zaranko, a research economist at IFS and the author of the research, said the pandemic and the looming end of the Brexit transition period made it an ""extraordinarily difficult time"" for the chancellor to be formulating public spending plans. Some programmes brought in to fight the pandemic could ""swallow up huge amounts of money"" and leave some public services facing another round of budget cuts. ""Avoiding that scenario would require the chancellor to find billions of extra funding, paid for at some point through higher taxes,"" he added. Governments normally set spending priorities for several years ahead, but given ""the huge amount of economic uncertainty"", the IFS said Chancellor Rishi Sunak would be ""ill-advised"" to embark on a multi-year Spending Review. ""Instead, it would be sensible to limit this year's Spending Review to a single year (2021â22), and delay decisions on spending in future years until a point when some of the uncertainty over Covid-19, Brexit and the future of the economy has dissipated,"" it added.

Here are the main stories we've been covering, both here in the UK and around the world.  Mike Coupe, former chief executive at Sainsbury's istaking over as director of Covid-19 testing at England's Test and Trace agency. He left the supermarket chain in May and replaces Sarah-Jane Marsh, who earlier this monthissued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the coronavirus testing system. Mr Coupe has experience in running supply chains and logistics, said the Department for Health and Social Care. But Labour shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it would make more sense to put ""those trained in actual infectious disease control in charge"". At Test and Trace, Mr Coupe will be joining other former retail executives. The head of the service, Dido Harding, worked at Tesco and Sainsbury's before spending seven years as boss of TalkTalk. As we've been reporting, the rate of infections in many parts of the world appears to be picking up. So here is a reminder on what simple measures we all need to take to stay safe - beginning with washing the hands. Simple guide to staying safe. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Covid-19 cases in parts of Canada have been rising at an
alarming rate and last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned the
country was experiencing a second wave. Some regions are now further tightening restrictions. Quebec will close
bars and restaurants for 28 days, in three âred zonesâ across the country,
including the city of Montreal. Indoor home
gatherings will also be forbidden. The province saw 750 new cases on Monday,
and 896 on Sunday, its highest tally since the spring. In Ontario, where
about 40% of the countryâs population lives, new cases reached an all-time
peak, with 700 new cases. Thatâs 60 cases higher than the previous high of 640
on 24 April. The milestone
renewed calls to scale back reopening â the Ontario Hospital Association urged
the province to go back to Stage 2, which would shutter restaurants and bars
except for outdoor dining, and other businesses like gyms. Ontario Premier
Doug Ford did not announce such measures on Monday, the same day casinos
reopened across the province. Last week, with cases rising, the province issued
an earlier closing time for bars and shut down strip clubs. Chief Medical
Officer of Health Dr David Williams said the province may consider further
âtargetedâ closures as needed. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The rules people are being told to follow are becoming a lot more complicated and can vary significantly in different parts of the UK. But at the same time the government is ramping up enforcement - creating criminal offences and introducing fines for those who don't follow them. That's why it's so important that ministers can explain to the public what the rules are and the rationale behind them. On two occasions today, the prime minister and a junior minister have beenunable to do so. Opposition parties accuse the government of not being in control - and not understanding the rules it is enforcing. But at the same time the PM is facing pressure from within his own party - with a significant bloc of Tory backbenchers demanding Parliament has more of a say when new restrictions are brought in. They fear some of the decisions go too far - and perhaps don't make sense. The PM being unable to explain them won't help. Restrctions have already been tightened in other parts of Wales - and now four councils in north Wales are to go into ""local lockdown"". The new measures for Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham come into effect at 18:00 BST on Thursday. Vaughan Gething, Wales' health minister, made the announcement in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday evening. He said a similar pattern of transmission was being seen in the four areas as had happened in the south, but rates in neighbouring Gwynedd and Anglesey currently ""remain low"". Travel to and from the areas will not be permitted unless people have a ""reasonable excuse"", such as work or for buying essentials. It will be illegal to meet others indoors who are not within your immediate household. You can read more about it here. Some GPs and pharmacies haverun out of flu jabs in the UKamid high demand - and are asking people to wait until more stock can be delivered. Boots says it has had to suspend bookings. But there is no national shortage, government officials say, and there are enough doses to vaccinate the 30 million people who are deemed most vulnerable to flu. The over-65s, and those in higher risk groups, are being given priority. Once those groups have been immunised, healthy 50 to 64-year-olds in England will, for the first time, be eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS. This is to help protect against the double threat of flu and coronavirus this winter. Research shows people can catch both diseases at the same time, with serious and sometimes deadly consequences. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter On-the-spot coronavirus tests â 120 million of them â which
give results within minutes are being made available to low- and middle-income
countries by the World Health Organization. One of the tests â the South Korean-made SD BioSensor â is
 already in use in Italy to screen people at airports. But these speedy tests are not currently available in the
UK. Thatâs partly because different countries have different
ways of approving tests, and hold them to different standards. And the UK has generally erred on the side of caution in
this arena. Apart from a natural risk aversion, these very quick tests
are considerably less sensitive than the standard test used in the NHS. That
means they pick up fewer cases and tell more people theyâre negative when they
do in fact have the virus. For countries that donât have the infrastructure to run big
labs and currently have very little access to any testing at all, these kits
could be a game-changer. The UK is instead focusing its energy on two other rapid
tests, which take more like 90 minutes to process than ten and are roughly as
sensitive as the standard diagnostic test. South Africa lost 2.2 million jobs during the country's coronavirus lockdown earlier this year - one of the strictest in the world. This is the biggest fall in job numbers since 2008, when the country's employment survey began. Most businesses were shut for five weeks from 27 March, and as a result the economy shrank at an unprecedented level. Read the full story of South Africa's unemployment crisishere. Updated to include the data released earlier this afternoon... Primary schools in New York have reopened and welcomed children for in-person lessons, after being closed for six months. The reopening of primary schools is the second stage in a three-part plan for reopening education. Last week, nursery-age children and some children with special educational needs were allowed back into buildings. Middle and High School pupils are expected to return to in-person classes on Thursday. But this comes as Mayor Bill de Blasio warns that New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". He also says anyone who refuses to wear a mask in public will be fined. A village in southern Romania has re-elected a beloved local mayor, Ion Aliman, 10 days after his death of Covid-19. His death was so close to the election that it was too late to remove his name from the ballot, Associated Press news agency reports. Because of this, residents of Deveselu village paid their respects by casting their votes for him anyway. Aliman won 1,057 of the 1,600 votes cast in the village, which is home to just 3,000 people. His victory was a landslide, meaning that had he been alive he would have won an unprecedented third term. The popular mayor would have celebrated his 57th birthday on election day. The landlord said his decision to allow the funeral to take place on the pubs grounds ""was led by a personal friendship"" with the biker who had died A pub landlord has apologised after 300 people turned up for a biker's funeral, ""far exceeding"" the number expected.  Police visited The Gate Hangs Well, in Syston, Leicestershire, on Friday where a service was being held in a marquee.  Publican Neil Henderson said it was set up to seat 30 people but he was ""naive"" to think numbers ""would be manageable"" and voluntarily closed when regulations were no longer met.  Police said the group was dispersed and a fixed penalty notice was issued.  Mr Henderson said he did not know how much the fine would be but Charnwood Police said in a tweet it could be ""up to Â£10k"".  Read more here Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent While the number of new infections and deaths will cause
alarm â both are up on previous days â the data on hospital admissions is more
encouraging.  For the fourth day in a row, the numbers have come down in
England.  On Sunday there were 241 admissions, down from 314 on
Wednesday.  To put that in context, at the peak England was seeing 3,000
admissions a day.  This mirrors what has been seen in France and Spain â a
gradual upward trend in serious Covid cases, but not the rapid increase that
was seen in the spring.  Even the number of new daily cases â the highest on record
at over 7,000 â is still below the doomsday trajectory the governmentâs senior
advisers warned about last week when they said there could be 50,000 cases a
day by mid October.  It all points to a second wave, but one that is more
manageable than feared by some.  It is, though, still early days. The areas with the highest
rates in the North West and North East are causing concern.  And we are just at the start of the autumn and winter season
when respiratory viruses circulate more.  Another unknown is the impact the problems with testing are
having on the ability of the system to pick up on cases.  Last week surveillance suggested perhaps less than half of
cases were being picked up.  That is why, arguably, it is more important to pay close
attention to hospital cases in the coming days and weeks to measure the true
impact Covidâs second wave is having.  Last Tuesday, 22 September, there were 37 deaths recorded - which has now nearly doubled, to 71. And the number of cases recorded that day was 4,926, whereas it is now over 7,000. But it's important to note cases had dropped for the past three days, while deaths had dropped for the past two days. Here's the overall picture of how things have changed in the past seven days.  There were lower numbers for deaths and cases at the weekend and on Monday - but that's usually the case, due to the fact more are recorded during the week. Officials in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, are preparing a burial site that will have 6,000 additional graves for people who've died of Covid-19. Indonesia has the highest virus death toll in South East Asia, and is currently dealing with another surge in deaths. It has now had more than 280,000 reported infections, and more than 10,000 deaths. The country has recorded more than 4,000 new cases of the virus each day for almost 10 days, despite limited testing. Gravediggers have told local media that they've been rushing to bury as many bodies as possible during daylight hours. Cemeteries in the capital have been running out of space. From today people in New York City will be fined if they refuse to wear masks, Mayor Bill de Blasio says. Officials will first offer free masks to anyone not wearing one. If that person then refuses, then they will be fined. De Blasio didn't specify how much the fine would be. He also says New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". ""Obviously everyone is concerned about that,"" he says. ""That is something we all have to work on together to address."" New York City was the original epicentre of the US outbreak, during the country's first wave of the virus in spring. While the 7,143 lab-confirmed cases recorded in the UK is the highest since the outbreak began, experts have previously warned that describing the daily figure as a record could be ""misleading"". That's because it is not clear how many people were actually infected at the height of the first wave due to a lack of mass testing in the community. Coronavirus cases have been rising again since July, but the rate of growth has increased since the end of August. The 71 deaths recorded were the highest UK total announced since1 July.,external Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been nearly 57,900 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.

BTS members to become multi-millionairesThe South Korean K-pop group will become multi-millionaires after their label Big Hit goes public.Business,"BTS perform at the MTV Video Music Awards on 31 August in New York All seven members of South Korean K-pop group BTS are set to become multi-millionaires, when their label Big Hit Entertainment goes public in October. Soaring demand for shares in Big Hit has given it a market valuation of Â£3.2bn ($4.1bn), with shares priced at the top of the expected price range. Big Hit boss Bang Si-hyuk, who owns 43% of the management label, will become a billionaire. In August, he gave each BTS member 68,385 shares, worth Â£6.2m in total. Currently priced at between 105,000-135,000 won (Â£70.03-Â£88.70) per share, Big Hit expects to raise about Â£638.3m with the sale of 7.13 million new shares when it is listed on Korea's Stock Exchange, the KOSPI, on 15 October. BTS set a new record on Monday when it took just hours for underwriters to find investors to take a stake in the firm when order books opened, with demand 1,000 times higher than the available stock. BTS tell fans to 'stay strong' during difficult year BTS: K-pop group reacts with 'tears' after making Billboard history BTS's Dynamite shatters YouTube records - and heads for UK number one According toCNBC,external, die-hard BTS fans in South Korea are hoping to buy at least one share in the management label to support their favourite members. What is even more striking is that this is South Korea's largest IPO in three years. It's a sign that BTS' popularity has not waned, despite the group being forced to cancel their world tour due to the coronavirus pandemic, and the risk that some of the members may soon have to do two years of compulsory military service. ""One of the top reasons for going public now is related to the company's effort to diversify its business and stream of revenue,"" says Damyoung Hong, who reports on K-pop news for the Korea Herald. She told me that the coronavirus pandemic has hardly affected Big Hit's success: ""Despite the cancelled tours, Big Hit managed to achieve record sales from strong digital and physical album sales, as well as BTS' paid online concert in June. Considering such growth momentum, Big Hit would have considered now as the right time to go public."" In 2019, BTS generated 97% of Big Hit's sales last year, and 88% this year. BTS have set multiple records this summer, including topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart with their single Dynamite BTS has repeatedly broken records in their seven-year history. In August, its single Dynamite became the most viewed YouTube video in 24 hours, amassing 101.1 million views in a day. The K-pop band also became the first Korean artists to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart with that single, drawing praise from South Korea's President Moon Jae-in, who said were writing a ""new chapter in K-pop history"". And an online concert held in June set another Guinness World record for the most viewed music concert live stream, with 756,000 fans joining from over 100 countries. The group is made up of Kim Tae-hyung (known as V), Jung Ho-seok (J-Hope), Kim Nam-joon (RM), Kim Seok-jin (Jin), Park Ji-min, Jeon Jung-kook and Min Yoon-gi (Suga). They have credited much of their success to their loyal international fan base, known as ARMY, who have helped make BTS the most tweeted-about music group from March to September this year. ""I believe the group will be in the limelight as long as they keep making good music. Even if a few of its members halt their career due to military service, the bandmates have already proven their solo prowess,"" Ms Hong says. ""The scale of BTS's fandom and the world-building empire tightly built around them are so powerful,"" she adds. Fans are now eagerly awaiting the upcoming release of BE, BTS' second album of the year, on 20 November.

Soaring demand for shares in Big Hit has given it a market valuation of Â£3.2bn ($4.1bn), with shares priced at the top of the expected price range. Big Hit boss Bang Si-hyuk, who owns 43% of the management label, will become a billionaire. In August, he gave each BTS member 68,385 shares, worth Â£6.2m in total. Currently priced at between 105,000-135,000 won (Â£70.03-Â£88.70) per share, Big Hit expects to raise about Â£638.3m with the sale of 7.13 million new shares when it is listed on Korea's Stock Exchange, the KOSPI, on 15 October. BTS set a new record on Monday when it took just hours for underwriters to find investors to take a stake in the firm when order books opened, with demand 1,000 times higher than the available stock. BTS tell fans to 'stay strong' during difficult year BTS: K-pop group reacts with 'tears' after making Billboard history BTS's Dynamite shatters YouTube records - and heads for UK number one According toCNBC,external, die-hard BTS fans in South Korea are hoping to buy at least one share in the management label to support their favourite members. What is even more striking is that this is South Korea's largest IPO in three years. It's a sign that BTS' popularity has not waned, despite the group being forced to cancel their world tour due to the coronavirus pandemic, and the risk that some of the members may soon have to do two years of compulsory military service. ""One of the top reasons for going public now is related to the company's effort to diversify its business and stream of revenue,"" says Damyoung Hong, who reports on K-pop news for the Korea Herald. She told me that the coronavirus pandemic has hardly affected Big Hit's success: ""Despite the cancelled tours, Big Hit managed to achieve record sales from strong digital and physical album sales, as well as BTS' paid online concert in June. Considering such growth momentum, Big Hit would have considered now as the right time to go public."" In 2019, BTS generated 97% of Big Hit's sales last year, and 88% this year. BTS have set multiple records this summer, including topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart with their single Dynamite BTS has repeatedly broken records in their seven-year history. In August, its single Dynamite became the most viewed YouTube video in 24 hours, amassing 101.1 million views in a day. The K-pop band also became the first Korean artists to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart with that single, drawing praise from South Korea's President Moon Jae-in, who said were writing a ""new chapter in K-pop history"". And an online concert held in June set another Guinness World record for the most viewed music concert live stream, with 756,000 fans joining from over 100 countries. The group is made up of Kim Tae-hyung (known as V), Jung Ho-seok (J-Hope), Kim Nam-joon (RM), Kim Seok-jin (Jin), Park Ji-min, Jeon Jung-kook and Min Yoon-gi (Suga). They have credited much of their success to their loyal international fan base, known as ARMY, who have helped make BTS the most tweeted-about music group from March to September this year. ""I believe the group will be in the limelight as long as they keep making good music. Even if a few of its members halt their career due to military service, the bandmates have already proven their solo prowess,"" Ms Hong says. ""The scale of BTS's fandom and the world-building empire tightly built around them are so powerful,"" she adds. Fans are now eagerly awaiting the upcoming release of BE, BTS' second album of the year, on 20 November.

LiveLiveCovid deaths cross 'agonising' 1m milestone1 minute ago,"The UK announces 7,143 new cases and 71 more Covid-related deaths The cases are a daily record since mass testing began - but experts believe the figure was much higher in the spring The daily deaths announcement was the highest since 1 July, when 97 deaths were confirmed But hospital admissions fall in England for fourth day in a row PM Boris Johnson apologises for ""misspeaking"" about new virus rules in north-east England The world's coronavirus death toll crosses one million, with the US, Brazil and India making up nearly half of the total The UN secretary general calls it a ""mind-numbing"" figure and ""an agonising milestone"" New York City introduces fines for people who refuse to wear masks Edited by Owen Amos The virus live page is closing - but there will be live coverage of theUS presidential debate here. Our writers were Toby Luckhurst, Ashitha Nagesh, Alice Evans, and Lauren Turner. The editors were Paulin Kola and Owen Amos.  We're closing our virus live page soon. Here are the main stories we've been covering, both here in the UK and around the world.  Mike Coupe, former chief executive at Sainsbury's istaking over as director of Covid-19 testing at England's Test and Trace agency. He left the supermarket chain in May and replaces Sarah-Jane Marsh, who earlier this monthissued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the coronavirus testing system. Mr Coupe has experience in running supply chains and logistics, said the Department for Health and Social Care. But Labour shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it would make more sense to put ""those trained in actual infectious disease control in charge"". At Test and Trace, Mr Coupe will be joining other former retail executives. The head of the service, Dido Harding, worked at Tesco and Sainsbury's before spending seven years as boss of TalkTalk. As we've been reporting, the rate of infections in many parts of the world appears to be picking up. So here is a reminder on what simple measures we all need to take to stay safe - beginning with washing the hands. Simple guide to staying safe. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Covid-19 cases in parts of Canada have been rising at an
alarming rate and last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned the
country was experiencing a second wave. Some regions are now further tightening restrictions. Quebec will close
bars and restaurants for 28 days, in three âred zonesâ across the country,
including the city of Montreal. Indoor home
gatherings will also be forbidden. The province saw 750 new cases on Monday,
and 896 on Sunday, its highest tally since the spring. In Ontario, where
about 40% of the countryâs population lives, new cases reached an all-time
peak, with 700 new cases. Thatâs 60 cases higher than the previous high of 640
on 24 April. The milestone
renewed calls to scale back reopening â the Ontario Hospital Association urged
the province to go back to Stage 2, which would shutter restaurants and bars
except for outdoor dining, and other businesses like gyms. Ontario Premier
Doug Ford did not announce such measures on Monday, the same day casinos
reopened across the province. Last week, with cases rising, the province issued
an earlier closing time for bars and shut down strip clubs. Chief Medical
Officer of Health Dr David Williams said the province may consider further
âtargetedâ closures as needed. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The rules people are being told to follow are becoming a lot more complicated and can vary significantly in different parts of the UK. But at the same time the government is ramping up enforcement - creating criminal offences and introducing fines for those who don't follow them. That's why it's so important that ministers can explain to the public what the rules are and the rationale behind them. On two occasions today, the prime minister and a junior minister have beenunable to do so. Opposition parties accuse the government of not being in control - and not understanding the rules it is enforcing. But at the same time the PM is facing pressure from within his own party - with a significant bloc of Tory backbenchers demanding Parliament has more of a say when new restrictions are brought in. They fear some of the decisions go too far - and perhaps don't make sense. The PM being unable to explain them won't help. Restrctions have already been tightened in other parts of Wales - and now four councils in north Wales are to go into ""local lockdown"". The new measures for Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham come into effect at 18:00 BST on Thursday. Vaughan Gething, Wales' health minister, made the announcement in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday evening. He said a similar pattern of transmission was being seen in the four areas as had happened in the south, but rates in neighbouring Gwynedd and Anglesey currently ""remain low"". Travel to and from the areas will not be permitted unless people have a ""reasonable excuse"", such as work or for buying essentials. It will be illegal to meet others indoors who are not within your immediate household. You can read more about it here. Some GPs and pharmacies haverun out of flu jabs in the UKamid high demand - and are asking people to wait until more stock can be delivered. Boots says it has had to suspend bookings. But there is no national shortage, government officials say, and there are enough doses to vaccinate the 30 million people who are deemed most vulnerable to flu. The over-65s, and those in higher risk groups, are being given priority. Once those groups have been immunised, healthy 50 to 64-year-olds in England will, for the first time, be eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS. This is to help protect against the double threat of flu and coronavirus this winter. Research shows people can catch both diseases at the same time, with serious and sometimes deadly consequences. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter On-the-spot coronavirus tests â 120 million of them â which
give results within minutes are being made available to low- and middle-income
countries by the World Health Organization. One of the tests â the South Korean-made SD BioSensor â is
 already in use in Italy to screen people at airports. But these speedy tests are not currently available in the
UK. Thatâs partly because different countries have different
ways of approving tests, and hold them to different standards. And the UK has generally erred on the side of caution in
this arena. Apart from a natural risk aversion, these very quick tests
are considerably less sensitive than the standard test used in the NHS. That
means they pick up fewer cases and tell more people theyâre negative when they
do in fact have the virus. For countries that donât have the infrastructure to run big
labs and currently have very little access to any testing at all, these kits
could be a game-changer. The UK is instead focusing its energy on two other rapid
tests, which take more like 90 minutes to process than ten and are roughly as
sensitive as the standard diagnostic test. South Africa lost 2.2 million jobs during the country's coronavirus lockdown earlier this year - one of the strictest in the world. This is the biggest fall in job numbers since 2008, when the country's employment survey began. Most businesses were shut for five weeks from 27 March, and as a result the economy shrank at an unprecedented level. Read the full story of South Africa's unemployment crisishere. Updated to include the data released earlier this afternoon... Primary schools in New York have reopened and welcomed children for in-person lessons, after being closed for six months. The reopening of primary schools is the second stage in a three-part plan for reopening education. Last week, nursery-age children and some children with special educational needs were allowed back into buildings. Middle and High School pupils are expected to return to in-person classes on Thursday. But this comes as Mayor Bill de Blasio warns that New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". He also says anyone who refuses to wear a mask in public will be fined. A village in southern Romania has re-elected a beloved local mayor, Ion Aliman, 10 days after his death of Covid-19. His death was so close to the election that it was too late to remove his name from the ballot, Associated Press news agency reports. Because of this, residents of Deveselu village paid their respects by casting their votes for him anyway. Aliman won 1,057 of the 1,600 votes cast in the village, which is home to just 3,000 people. His victory was a landslide, meaning that had he been alive he would have won an unprecedented third term. The popular mayor would have celebrated his 57th birthday on election day. The landlord said his decision to allow the funeral to take place on the pubs grounds ""was led by a personal friendship"" with the biker who had died A pub landlord has apologised after 300 people turned up for a biker's funeral, ""far exceeding"" the number expected.  Police visited The Gate Hangs Well, in Syston, Leicestershire, on Friday where a service was being held in a marquee.  Publican Neil Henderson said it was set up to seat 30 people but he was ""naive"" to think numbers ""would be manageable"" and voluntarily closed when regulations were no longer met.  Police said the group was dispersed and a fixed penalty notice was issued.  Mr Henderson said he did not know how much the fine would be but Charnwood Police said in a tweet it could be ""up to Â£10k"".  Read more here Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent While the number of new infections and deaths will cause
alarm â both are up on previous days â the data on hospital admissions is more
encouraging.  For the fourth day in a row, the numbers have come down in
England.  On Sunday there were 241 admissions, down from 314 on
Wednesday.  To put that in context, at the peak England was seeing 3,000
admissions a day.  This mirrors what has been seen in France and Spain â a
gradual upward trend in serious Covid cases, but not the rapid increase that
was seen in the spring.  Even the number of new daily cases â the highest on record
at over 7,000 â is still below the doomsday trajectory the governmentâs senior
advisers warned about last week when they said there could be 50,000 cases a
day by mid October.  It all points to a second wave, but one that is more
manageable than feared by some.  It is, though, still early days. The areas with the highest
rates in the North West and North East are causing concern.  And we are just at the start of the autumn and winter season
when respiratory viruses circulate more.  Another unknown is the impact the problems with testing are
having on the ability of the system to pick up on cases.  Last week surveillance suggested perhaps less than half of
cases were being picked up.  That is why, arguably, it is more important to pay close
attention to hospital cases in the coming days and weeks to measure the true
impact Covidâs second wave is having.  Last Tuesday, 22 September, there were 37 deaths recorded - which has now nearly doubled, to 71. And the number of cases recorded that day was 4,926, whereas it is now over 7,000. But it's important to note cases had dropped for the past three days, while deaths had dropped for the past two days. Here's the overall picture of how things have changed in the past seven days.  There were lower numbers for deaths and cases at the weekend and on Monday - but that's usually the case, due to the fact more are recorded during the week. Officials in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, are preparing a burial site that will have 6,000 additional graves for people who've died of Covid-19. Indonesia has the highest virus death toll in South East Asia, and is currently dealing with another surge in deaths. It has now had more than 280,000 reported infections, and more than 10,000 deaths. The country has recorded more than 4,000 new cases of the virus each day for almost 10 days, despite limited testing. Gravediggers have told local media that they've been rushing to bury as many bodies as possible during daylight hours. Cemeteries in the capital have been running out of space. From today people in New York City will be fined if they refuse to wear masks, Mayor Bill de Blasio says. Officials will first offer free masks to anyone not wearing one. If that person then refuses, then they will be fined. De Blasio didn't specify how much the fine would be. He also says New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". ""Obviously everyone is concerned about that,"" he says. ""That is something we all have to work on together to address."" New York City was the original epicentre of the US outbreak, during the country's first wave of the virus in spring. While the 7,143 lab-confirmed cases recorded in the UK is the highest since the outbreak began, experts have previously warned that describing the daily figure as a record could be ""misleading"". That's because it is not clear how many people were actually infected at the height of the first wave due to a lack of mass testing in the community. Coronavirus cases have been rising again since July, but the rate of growth has increased since the end of August. The 71 deaths recorded were the highest UK total announced since1 July.,external Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been nearly 57,900 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.

Clubs are being given promotional material to help them to publicise the ban Health Minister Vaughan Gething praised the ban by the FAW and its trust, which supports grassroots football. ""Voluntary bans like this one help protect children from seeing smoking as an acceptable and normal behaviour and can help prevent them from taking up smoking in the first place,"" he said. Dr David Adams, from the FAW Trust, said: ""As a parent of children who take part in grassroots football, I am delighted with our partnership with ASH Wales, and that the FAW and FAW Trust are leading the way to help the next generation of children grow up recognising the health risks associated with smoking."" Donna Williams, Su Griffith, Liam Jones and Evelyn Roberts shared their views on the streets in Porthmadog Former smoker Su Griffith agrees with the ban, saying ""losing two hours not being able to have a cigarette isn't going to kill them"". Liam Jones said it was a ""good idea"" to protect people from second-hand smoke. ""It can affect kids' minds as well, thinking it's OK to smoke,"" he added. Evelyn Roberts said the ban was ""fine as long as there is a smoking shed or somewhere else for them to smoke"". And non-smoker Donna Williams said: ""For the health of young children, I agree with banning it."" George Oliver, Gemma Walsh and Rob Morville give their views in Cardiff Parents at a children's football training session in Cardiff supported the move. George Oliver said he did not see most parents smoking on the sidelines, but anything which re-enforced the message ""has got to be a really positive thing"". Gemma Walsh said the move was ""a good idea"", while Rob Morville agreed, adding: ""If you've got parents on the sidelines smoking, that's only going to give a bad impression to the children."" Suzanne Cass, from ASH Wales, said there was ""an urgent need to address youth smoking prevalence which is still at an unacceptable level"". ""This policy will make a big difference to children's perception of smoking and we very much hope that this will prevent many of them from taking up the habit in later life,"" she said. Simon Clark, director of smokers' lobby group Forest, said ""smoking in the open air does not put anyone else's health at risk"". ""This is virtue-signalling by the FAW and further evidence that the war on tobacco is now a moral crusade with unintended consequences for tolerance and moderation,"" he said. ""A genuine problem at children's football matches is pushy parents screaming abuse at referees.""

Our writers were Toby Luckhurst, Ashitha Nagesh, Alice Evans, and Lauren Turner. The editors were Paulin Kola and Owen Amos.  We're closing our virus live page soon. Here are the main stories we've been covering, both here in the UK and around the world.  Mike Coupe, former chief executive at Sainsbury's istaking over as director of Covid-19 testing at England's Test and Trace agency. He left the supermarket chain in May and replaces Sarah-Jane Marsh, who earlier this monthissued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the coronavirus testing system. Mr Coupe has experience in running supply chains and logistics, said the Department for Health and Social Care. But Labour shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it would make more sense to put ""those trained in actual infectious disease control in charge"". At Test and Trace, Mr Coupe will be joining other former retail executives. The head of the service, Dido Harding, worked at Tesco and Sainsbury's before spending seven years as boss of TalkTalk. As we've been reporting, the rate of infections in many parts of the world appears to be picking up. So here is a reminder on what simple measures we all need to take to stay safe - beginning with washing the hands. Simple guide to staying safe. Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Toronto Covid-19 cases in parts of Canada have been rising at an
alarming rate and last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned the
country was experiencing a second wave. Some regions are now further tightening restrictions. Quebec will close
bars and restaurants for 28 days, in three âred zonesâ across the country,
including the city of Montreal. Indoor home
gatherings will also be forbidden. The province saw 750 new cases on Monday,
and 896 on Sunday, its highest tally since the spring. In Ontario, where
about 40% of the countryâs population lives, new cases reached an all-time
peak, with 700 new cases. Thatâs 60 cases higher than the previous high of 640
on 24 April. The milestone
renewed calls to scale back reopening â the Ontario Hospital Association urged
the province to go back to Stage 2, which would shutter restaurants and bars
except for outdoor dining, and other businesses like gyms. Ontario Premier
Doug Ford did not announce such measures on Monday, the same day casinos
reopened across the province. Last week, with cases rising, the province issued
an earlier closing time for bars and shut down strip clubs. Chief Medical
Officer of Health Dr David Williams said the province may consider further
âtargetedâ closures as needed. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The rules people are being told to follow are becoming a lot more complicated and can vary significantly in different parts of the UK. But at the same time the government is ramping up enforcement - creating criminal offences and introducing fines for those who don't follow them. That's why it's so important that ministers can explain to the public what the rules are and the rationale behind them. On two occasions today, the prime minister and a junior minister have beenunable to do so. Opposition parties accuse the government of not being in control - and not understanding the rules it is enforcing. But at the same time the PM is facing pressure from within his own party - with a significant bloc of Tory backbenchers demanding Parliament has more of a say when new restrictions are brought in. They fear some of the decisions go too far - and perhaps don't make sense. The PM being unable to explain them won't help. Restrctions have already been tightened in other parts of Wales - and now four councils in north Wales are to go into ""local lockdown"". The new measures for Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham come into effect at 18:00 BST on Thursday. Vaughan Gething, Wales' health minister, made the announcement in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday evening. He said a similar pattern of transmission was being seen in the four areas as had happened in the south, but rates in neighbouring Gwynedd and Anglesey currently ""remain low"". Travel to and from the areas will not be permitted unless people have a ""reasonable excuse"", such as work or for buying essentials. It will be illegal to meet others indoors who are not within your immediate household. You can read more about it here. Some GPs and pharmacies haverun out of flu jabs in the UKamid high demand - and are asking people to wait until more stock can be delivered. Boots says it has had to suspend bookings. But there is no national shortage, government officials say, and there are enough doses to vaccinate the 30 million people who are deemed most vulnerable to flu. The over-65s, and those in higher risk groups, are being given priority. Once those groups have been immunised, healthy 50 to 64-year-olds in England will, for the first time, be eligible for a free flu jab on the NHS. This is to help protect against the double threat of flu and coronavirus this winter. Research shows people can catch both diseases at the same time, with serious and sometimes deadly consequences. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter On-the-spot coronavirus tests â 120 million of them â which
give results within minutes are being made available to low- and middle-income
countries by the World Health Organization. One of the tests â the South Korean-made SD BioSensor â is
 already in use in Italy to screen people at airports. But these speedy tests are not currently available in the
UK. Thatâs partly because different countries have different
ways of approving tests, and hold them to different standards. And the UK has generally erred on the side of caution in
this arena. Apart from a natural risk aversion, these very quick tests
are considerably less sensitive than the standard test used in the NHS. That
means they pick up fewer cases and tell more people theyâre negative when they
do in fact have the virus. For countries that donât have the infrastructure to run big
labs and currently have very little access to any testing at all, these kits
could be a game-changer. The UK is instead focusing its energy on two other rapid
tests, which take more like 90 minutes to process than ten and are roughly as
sensitive as the standard diagnostic test. South Africa lost 2.2 million jobs during the country's coronavirus lockdown earlier this year - one of the strictest in the world. This is the biggest fall in job numbers since 2008, when the country's employment survey began. Most businesses were shut for five weeks from 27 March, and as a result the economy shrank at an unprecedented level. Read the full story of South Africa's unemployment crisishere. Updated to include the data released earlier this afternoon... Primary schools in New York have reopened and welcomed children for in-person lessons, after being closed for six months. The reopening of primary schools is the second stage in a three-part plan for reopening education. Last week, nursery-age children and some children with special educational needs were allowed back into buildings. Middle and High School pupils are expected to return to in-person classes on Thursday. But this comes as Mayor Bill de Blasio warns that New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". He also says anyone who refuses to wear a mask in public will be fined. A village in southern Romania has re-elected a beloved local mayor, Ion Aliman, 10 days after his death of Covid-19. His death was so close to the election that it was too late to remove his name from the ballot, Associated Press news agency reports. Because of this, residents of Deveselu village paid their respects by casting their votes for him anyway. Aliman won 1,057 of the 1,600 votes cast in the village, which is home to just 3,000 people. His victory was a landslide, meaning that had he been alive he would have won an unprecedented third term. The popular mayor would have celebrated his 57th birthday on election day. The landlord said his decision to allow the funeral to take place on the pubs grounds ""was led by a personal friendship"" with the biker who had died A pub landlord has apologised after 300 people turned up for a biker's funeral, ""far exceeding"" the number expected.  Police visited The Gate Hangs Well, in Syston, Leicestershire, on Friday where a service was being held in a marquee.  Publican Neil Henderson said it was set up to seat 30 people but he was ""naive"" to think numbers ""would be manageable"" and voluntarily closed when regulations were no longer met.  Police said the group was dispersed and a fixed penalty notice was issued.  Mr Henderson said he did not know how much the fine would be but Charnwood Police said in a tweet it could be ""up to Â£10k"".  Read more here Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent While the number of new infections and deaths will cause
alarm â both are up on previous days â the data on hospital admissions is more
encouraging.  For the fourth day in a row, the numbers have come down in
England.  On Sunday there were 241 admissions, down from 314 on
Wednesday.  To put that in context, at the peak England was seeing 3,000
admissions a day.  This mirrors what has been seen in France and Spain â a
gradual upward trend in serious Covid cases, but not the rapid increase that
was seen in the spring.  Even the number of new daily cases â the highest on record
at over 7,000 â is still below the doomsday trajectory the governmentâs senior
advisers warned about last week when they said there could be 50,000 cases a
day by mid October.  It all points to a second wave, but one that is more
manageable than feared by some.  It is, though, still early days. The areas with the highest
rates in the North West and North East are causing concern.  And we are just at the start of the autumn and winter season
when respiratory viruses circulate more.  Another unknown is the impact the problems with testing are
having on the ability of the system to pick up on cases.  Last week surveillance suggested perhaps less than half of
cases were being picked up.  That is why, arguably, it is more important to pay close
attention to hospital cases in the coming days and weeks to measure the true
impact Covidâs second wave is having.  Last Tuesday, 22 September, there were 37 deaths recorded - which has now nearly doubled, to 71. And the number of cases recorded that day was 4,926, whereas it is now over 7,000. But it's important to note cases had dropped for the past three days, while deaths had dropped for the past two days. Here's the overall picture of how things have changed in the past seven days.  There were lower numbers for deaths and cases at the weekend and on Monday - but that's usually the case, due to the fact more are recorded during the week. Officials in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, are preparing a burial site that will have 6,000 additional graves for people who've died of Covid-19. Indonesia has the highest virus death toll in South East Asia, and is currently dealing with another surge in deaths. It has now had more than 280,000 reported infections, and more than 10,000 deaths. The country has recorded more than 4,000 new cases of the virus each day for almost 10 days, despite limited testing. Gravediggers have told local media that they've been rushing to bury as many bodies as possible during daylight hours. Cemeteries in the capital have been running out of space. From today people in New York City will be fined if they refuse to wear masks, Mayor Bill de Blasio says. Officials will first offer free masks to anyone not wearing one. If that person then refuses, then they will be fined. De Blasio didn't specify how much the fine would be. He also says New York City's positive Covid-19 test rate was higher than 3% ""for the first time in months"". ""Obviously everyone is concerned about that,"" he says. ""That is something we all have to work on together to address."" New York City was the original epicentre of the US outbreak, during the country's first wave of the virus in spring. While the 7,143 lab-confirmed cases recorded in the UK is the highest since the outbreak began, experts have previously warned that describing the daily figure as a record could be ""misleading"". That's because it is not clear how many people were actually infected at the height of the first wave due to a lack of mass testing in the community. Coronavirus cases have been rising again since July, but the rate of growth has increased since the end of August. The 71 deaths recorded were the highest UK total announced since1 July.,external Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show there have now been nearly 57,900 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.

Adults without A-levels to be offered free coursesThe government offer will be available from April and aims to support jobseekers during the pandemic.UK Politics,"This video can not be played PM: Covid has âmassively accelerated changes that were already happening"". Boris Johnson has vowed ""radical"" changes to the adult education system in England to help boost the post-Covid economy. The prime minister said the pandemic had ""massively accelerated"" changes to the world of work, and made training gaps ""painfully apparent"". He said funding changes could help end the ""bogus distinction"" between academic and vocational learning. But Labour said the plans would not make up for ""a decade of cuts"". Speaking at a further education college in Exeter, Mr Johnson said the government cannot ""save every job"" amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But he added that better training would ""give people the skills to find and create new and better jobs"". Seven ways covid changed the workplace Jobs scheme 'won't stop major rise in unemployment' How many people could become unemployed? He said a new ""lifetime skills guarantee"" would offer a fully funded college course to all people over 18 in England without an A-level or equivalent qualification. Currently, only people aged under 23 qualify for a fully-funded qualification at this level. The commitment will be paid for under an already-announced Â£2.5bn boost to England's National Skills Fund coming into effect next April. Funding will be offered for courses offering ""skills valued by employers"" - with full list to be announced next month. The prime minister added that the government would make higher education loans more flexible, to allow people to ""space out their study across their lifetimes"". Whether it's Boris Johnson's ""levelling up"" agenda or previous governments' promises to tackle the skills gap, some of what we've heard today may sound familiar. For example, that the supply of skilled workers in certain industries simply isn't meeting demand, and calls to end the ""snootiness"" between academic and vocational qualifications. Also familiar was the suggestion that the economy is evolving, at speed, as technology changes the way we live. Coronavirus has, it's argued, accelerated the latter trend with, for example, more working from home and online shopping. And that therefore the task of re-directing workers into industries where there's a shortage of workers has been made more urgent. With fears unemployment will continue to rise, particularly in hospitality and retail, the government is saying that there will be more support for retraining. But this announcement also comes a week after ministers opted for measures such as the 10pm curfew in bars and pubs. That's led to accusations that this government is actually causing job losses in already hard-hit sectors. With that in mind, and amid all the gloomier headlines, Boris Johnson may want to be the person offering some help and some hope. The question is whether it's enough and in time. Mr Johnson said the pandemic had ""compressed"" a ""revolution"" to the jobs market caused by trends such as online shopping. He added that although some jobs would fall away, he wanted people to take advantage of ""new opportunities opening up with dizzying speed"". Meanwhile, the government's Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) said care workers, butchers, and bricklayers should go on the UK's""shortage occupation list"",external. The recommended move would be easier for migrants to get a work visa for those jobs after the post-Brexit transition period ends in January. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? In other plans, small businesses will be offered financial incentives to take on apprentices and Â£8m will be spent on skills ""boot camps"" in West Yorkshire, south-west England, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire to cover sectors like construction and engineering. This follows pilots in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands that focused on digital skills. And the government's online Skills Toolkit, a collection of training resources launched in the spring to help people acquire jobs skills ahead of businesses reopening, will be expanded to include 62 additional courses. Seven ways covid changed the workplace Jobs scheme 'won't stop major rise in unemployment' How many people could become unemployed? Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green called the new funding announcement ""a mix of reheated old policies and funding that won't be available until April"". ""By then many workers could have been out of work for nearly a year, and the Tories still think that they will need to take out loans to get the training they will need to get back in work."" Her party has previously called for the money in the National Skills Fund to be brought forward to tackle the crisis. Paul from Leeds lost his job at the start of lockdown and then saw several job opportunities fall through as the pandemic took hold. But he says he eventually got a job as a site manager at his local primary school, after taking a course in children's mental health funded by the Yorkshire Cricket Foundation. The qualification was his first experience of formal training since he took a glasswork and glazing apprenticeship around 20 years ago. ""Having the time is something I've never had before,"" said the father of three. ""If I hadn't done the course, I don't think I would have had the answers to the questions in the interview,"" he adds. ""It's given me the confidence to walk into a school and believe I can get the job."" CBI director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the ""significant"" unemployment coronavirus is leaving in its wake ""only accelerates the need for people to develop new skills and adapt to new ways of working"". ""The lifetime skills guarantee and flexible loans to support bitesize learning are a strong start but to really shift gears, this must be backed up by meaningful progress on evolving the apprenticeship levy into a flexible skills levy,"" she added. The apprenticeship levy - introduced in 2017 - takes 0.5% of the salary bill from major employers that have an annual pay bill over Â£3m, with the intention of using the money to improve skills and provide training.

"Covid: Public spending rise could last longerThe government must choose between more austerity and permanently higher spending, a think tank warns.Business","The government must choose this autumn between more austerity and permanently higher spending, experts warn. Although the Autumn Budget has been cancelled, the Treasury is still set to publish a Spending Review containing government expenditure plans. Because of Covid-19, public spending is likely to rise to the highest share of national income in more than a decade, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies. If not, another bout of austerity will hit many public services, it warns. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The Spending Review will proceed this autumn, as planned. The chancellor has already confirmed that departmental spending will increase above inflation - both for day-to-day spending and longer-term investment."" The IFS forecasts come in a newly published advance chapter of its Green Budget 2020, which will be released in full next month. ""Plans will depend crucially on how much of the additional Â£70bn of public service spending - that's an increase of 20% on original plans - allocated this year to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic will need to be repeated in future years,"" the IFS said. ""Even if only a quarter of it is needed, for example to maintain purchases of personal protective equipment (PPE) and to keep a track-and-trace system going, then overall spending would have to rise well ahead of the plans set out in the last Budget, or another bout of austerity will be visited upon many public services."" The think tank said there would be other financial pressures, including on working-age social security spending and adult social care, while the economy was likely to be smaller than expected for a long period. ""The next set of spending decisions is likely therefore to result in public spending settling at a higher share of national income than it was after 10 years of Labour government back in 2007-08,"" it added. The IFS said the UK had been through the longest sustained squeeze in public spending on record, but despite this, on the eve of the pandemic, public spending was at 39.8% of national income, much the same as it was in 2007â08. Measures in Mr Sunak's Budget announced in March would have increased public spending by 10.7% over the next four years, but those plans had already been rendered obsolete by the coronavirus crisis, the think tank said. Ben Zaranko, a research economist at IFS and the author of the research, said the pandemic and the looming end of the Brexit transition period made it an ""extraordinarily difficult time"" for the chancellor to be formulating public spending plans. Some programmes brought in to fight the pandemic could ""swallow up huge amounts of money"" and leave some public services facing another round of budget cuts. ""Avoiding that scenario would require the chancellor to find billions of extra funding, paid for at some point through higher taxes,"" he added. Governments normally set spending priorities for several years ahead, but given ""the huge amount of economic uncertainty"", the IFS said Chancellor Rishi Sunak would be ""ill-advised"" to embark on a multi-year Spending Review. ""Instead, it would be sensible to limit this year's Spending Review to a single year (2021â22), and delay decisions on spending in future years until a point when some of the uncertainty over Covid-19, Brexit and the future of the economy has dissipated,"" it added.
