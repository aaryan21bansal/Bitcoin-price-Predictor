Bacteria in water at children's hospital,"NHSGGC said patients in four wards had been given antibiotics Three children are being treated for infections that may be linked to bacteria in the water supply at a Glasgow hospital. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is investigating after the microorganisms were discovered at the Royal Hospital for Children. Health officials said the bacteria could pose harm to patients with ""compromised"" immunity. The source of the bacteria is not yet known. The health board said the bacteria posed ""very low risk"" to anyone with a healthy immune system. It said tests were ongoing to confirm if the infections the three children have are linked to the water contamination issue. Dr Teresa Inkster, infection control doctor, said: ""It's not unusual for children in this type of ward to suffer infections but we are carrying out tests to determine whether these bacteria are linked to any of the three patients. ""However, we can confirm none of the three patients are giving any cause for concern as a consequence of their infection."" The hospital has sought advice from Health Protection Scotland, Health Facilities Scotland and Scottish Water. Alternatives to tap water supplies have been brought in for paediatric patients in wards 2A, 2B, 3C and the hospital's intensive care unit. The health board has also given out oral antibiotics due to the low immune system of patients on these wards. Sterilised water is being supplied for drinking and bottled water for brushing teeth. Portable sinks stocked with bottled water have been supplied to all patient rooms in the affected wards. The health board said: ""Staff and others in these wards are able to use the tap water safely although we have taken an extra precaution of fitting taps and showers with filters to ensure no cross transmission from staff and visitors to patients.""

Hacker who gave up Wikileaks source dies,"Adrian Lamo was behind hack attacks on Microsoft and the New York Times Adrian Lamo, a computer hacker best known for passing on information that led to the arrest of Chelsea Manning, has died aged 37. In online messaging conversations, Manning confided in him, describing confidential military material Manning had sent to Wikileaks. Wikileaks published the video of a US helicopter strike that killed seven people, including a journalist working for the Reuters news agency. The cause of Lamoâs death, confirmed to the BBC by the Sedgwick County coroner in Kansas, has not yet been made public. On Facebook, his father Mario wrote: âWith great sadness and a broken heart I have to let know all of Adrian's friends and acquittances [sic] that he is dead. A bright mind and compassionate soul is gone, he was my beloved son.â Lamo's own record as a hacker included some high-profile targets, such as Microsoft and the New York Times. Speaking to the Guardian newspaper in 2011,external, Lamo described his decision to give up Manning as ânot one I decided to make, but was thrust upon meâ. Lamo said he would have ""lasting regret"" if Manning was handed a long sentence. Manning, known at the time as Bradley Manning, was eventually sentenced to 35 years in prison. However, President Barack Obama later commuted her sentence and she was released in May 2017. She is now attempting to become the Senator for Maryland, her home state. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on Friday described Lamo as a âpetty conman and betrayer of basic human decencyâ.

"Botswana leader: Trump encouraging poachingOverturning a ban on importing hunting trophies threatens elephants, says Ian Khama.6h6 hours agoAfrica","Ian Khama says that US policy is encouraging poaching of endangered animals The outgoing president of Botswana has attacked his US counterpart Donald Trump for ""encouraging poaching"" by overturning a ban on the import of hunting trophies. Speaking at an anti-poaching summit in Botswana, two weeks before he steps down, President Ian Khama told the BBC it was not just Mr Trump's attitude towards wildlife he was concerned about, but his ""attitude towards the whole planet"". The US government recently made a U-turn on the import of animal heads from Africa - the ""trophies"" prized by American hunters travelling to the continent. Mr Khama said that his government had ""actually banned hunting"" but that Mr Trump's lifting of the trophy ban was ""encouraging poaching in this country"". This video can not be played Counting Africa's elephants from the air Mr Khama was speaking at the Giant's Club Summit in Kasane, which is discussing efforts to tackle the poaching epidemic which is killing tens of thousands of elephants every year. Although the number of animals being poached for ivory has been dropping over the past few years, more elephants are being killed for their tusks than are being born, leaving them in danger. ""We haven't passed the worst of the poaching crisis,"" said Mike Chase, director and founder of Elephants Without Borders. ""The political will to address these issues is unfortunately not there. It has been in Botswana, and if our neighbours can learn from Botswana's example I feel we can address this poaching crisis."" The war on elephants 'Elephant refugee' problem in Africa The summit is showcasing ways of improving anti-poaching measures, borrowing from counter-terrorism. ""The focus now is on intelligence-led patrol work, intelligence-led investigations,"" said Kevin Vallack, a former British policeman and intelligence officer, now with the conservation group Space for Giants. ""So the same principles apply as in counter-terrorism and organised crime - countering terrorists, traffickersâ¦ and wildlife poachers."" Preventing human-wildlife conflict, and helping elephants have more value to communities alive than dead are key areas of discussion, but many conservationists believe a total ban on ivory trade is the only way to save the elephants. Fitting a tracker to monitor elephant movements can help prevent human-wildlife conflict The EU, and the UK specifically, are the biggest exporters of legal ivory - much of it labelled as antique - and three African presidents have now put their name to a million-signature global petition asking for a ban on this legal trade in ivory. President Khama praised China for implementing a ban on their domestic ivory trade earlier this year, and called on Britain and the EU to do likewise. ""When you look at the other countries coming on board - for example China - I think they are setting a wonderful example to follow, whether it's the UK or the European Union."" The UK Minister for Africa, Harriett Baldwin, who is attending the summit said: ""Our aim is to ban antique ivory sales in the UK this year."" ""People in the UK really care passionately about this issue and they want to make sure we save these magnificent elephants in the wild for future generations,"" she said. A consultation period on how the UK should implement any ban, and what the exceptions might be, ended recently, and an announcement on the new government policy is expected in the coming weeks.

Exodus as Syrian war rages on two fronts,"This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta evacuees are staying at a school under government control More than 60,000 people have fled two separate offensives in Syria in recent days, the UN says. Up to 16,000 people have fled Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, where Russian air strikes are supporting Syrian government attempts to retake the area. Nearly 50,000 fled the northern town of Afrin, where Turkey is fighting a US-backed Kurdish militia that it considers a terrorist group. Dozens of people were killed in air strikes on Friday, activists said. Seven years of civil war have driven nearly 12 million Syrians from their homes: At least6.1 millionare internally displaced Another5.6 millionhave fled abroad More than400,000are believed to have been killed or are missing, presumed dead On Friday, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations said the estimates of those who fled the rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta could be more than twice as high as reported, with up to 40,000 leaving on Thursday alone. The number could not be verified. Why is there a war in Syria? Russian air strikes killed 80 people including 14 children on Friday in the Eastern Ghouta towns of Kafr Batna, Saqba and Harasta, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. Despite international calls for a ceasefire, there has been no let-up in the offensive and the Syrian army is now pushing into densely populated areas, backed by Russian air support. Residents have told BBC News there has been intense street fighting between rebels and government soldiers in some parts of the enclave. Humanitarian corridors controlled by the Syrian government reportedly allowed about 4,000 more people to leave the enclave on Friday despite the fighting. The UN children's agency Unicef is sending representatives to assess the needs of evacuees in temporary shelters in Damascus. A Unicef spokeswoman said its current response plan could deal with up to 50,000 people. This video can not be played Seven-year-old Rouaa has lived most of her life in a refugee camp Pro-government forces are believed to have recaptured 70% of the region after three weeks of intense fighting against rebels there. The crushing of the rebel enclave outside Damascus would be a major victory for President Assad. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Falling hair and eating inedible plants to survive Afrin, a town populated mainly by ethnic Kurds near the Turkish border, has been under bombardment from the air and the ground by Turkish forces and their local Syrian allies. Turkish bombing reportedly killed at least 43 people on Friday, including seven children and at least 16 people who died in an air strike on the town's main hospital, the Syrian Observatory said. ""It was the only functioning hospital in Afrin city,"" a Kurdish Red Crescent official told the AFP news agency. An estimated 48,000 people have fled the city and nearby villages, according to Linda Tom, a UN humanitarian spokeswoman in Syria. They headed towards villages held by Syrian government forces. Turkey is targeting the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), a militia that it regards as an extension of the Kurdish forces on its own territory - a banned group that Turkey considers a terrorist organisation. But Kurdish fighters in Syria have been a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State group, and have received support from the United States to that end. This video can not be played Afrin: What is going on in Syria's other battle? Brusk Hasakeh, a YPG spokesman, told Reuters news agency that Turkish forces and their Syrian militia allies were trying to storm Afrin from the north but the YPG andits women's affiliate, the YPJ, were fighting back. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told a gathering in Ankara that his country would not stop until its mission to capture Afrin had been completed. While Turkey is opposed to President Assad, Russia and Iran are the Syrian leader's closest allies. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sought to portray the talks in Kazakhstan as an opportunity to bring lasting peace to Syria, saying ""millions of Syrians are looking in the direction of Astana"". Referring to the Eastern Ghouta, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the bombing of civilians was unacceptable.

Shirt withdrawn amid Hillsborough anger,"The shirt was on sale on the Topman website, with almost 200 sold on Thursday Retailer Topman has withdrawn a shirt after criticism it could be seen referring to the Hillsborough disaster. The red shirt with a large number 96 is being seen by some Liverpool fans as a reference to the club's kit and number of victimskilled in the 1989 disaster. Louise Brookes, whose brother Andrew died in the tragedy, and MP for Wirral South Alison McGovern were among those calling for it to be removed from sale. Topman apologised ""unreservedly"" saying it was based on a Bob Marley track. The shirt is no longer on sale online or in stores, the shop said. In a tweet, Labour MP Ms McGovern said the shirt was ""very unfortunate"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Under the number 96 on the back of the long-sleeved red top, the design includes the words, ""What goes around comes back around"". On one sleeve of the Â£20 top is the word ""Karma"". Ms Brookes, whose 26-year-old brother died at the stadium, said ""karma"" and ""what goes around comes around"" were used by some rival fans who claimed Hillsborough was ""God's punishment"" forthe Heysel disasterin which 39 people, mostly Juventus supporters, died at a match against Liverpool. Margaret Aspinall's son James died in the Hillsborough disaster She also said the red colour, the number 96 and the rose were all symbols she associated with Hillsborough. Chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, said she could ""quite understand the fans and the families being upset about this"". She urged those who approved the design to be made to ""look up on Hillsborough because they've got to learn"". Ninety-six people died in the Hillsborough disaster Some Twitter users had initially said the top referenced the Bob Marley song What Goes Around Comes Around, a remix of which was released in 1996. Others said Karma was a brand. The shop said in a statement: ""Topman apologises unreservedly for any offence caused by this T-shirt. ""The design was inspired by a Bob Marley track with the number referring to the year of re-release. The garment has been removed from sale online and in stores."" Ms Brookes said whatever the shirt's original message, ""people will use it now as a way of antagonising Liverpool fans"". She added: ""Our 96 were decent human beings who did nothing wrong. ""How would people feel if it was their loved ones being mocked?"" London College of Fashion's Professor Kate Fletcher said her mind was ""boggling"" at ""the lack of ethical oversight"" by Topman, adding: ""It's a complete mystery to me how they came up with this design."" ""The speed and volume of the fashion industry means it's making the clothes in distant areas. ""The local knowledge and expertise is gone and the cultural context of where it is worn is not known.""

Who was Nikolai Glushkov?,"Unlike the death of his close friend in 2013, Glushkov's case is being treated as murder Nikolai Glushkov, the Russian business magnate, staunch opponent of President Vladimir Putin and political exile living in the UK, was found dead in his London home on 12 March. The city's police have now launched a murder investigation, saying he died from ""compression to the neck"". That has echoes of the unexplained death of his close friend, Boris Berezovsky, almost exactly five years ago. But who was Glushkov? Murder inquiry over Russian's London death Russian links examined in up to 14 deaths The 14 deaths under scrutiny Glushkov was born in Russia in 1949 and grew up in the Soviet Union. He became a prominent businessman in the early- to mid-1990s as the deputy director of Russia's AutoVAZ car company - which also had links to his friend, Berezovsky. In 1992, the New York Times interviewed Glushkov, then 42, identifying him as a ""former physicist and English teacher"" turned business magnate. But by the mid-1990s, Glushkov had risen to become deputy director of Aeroflot, Russia's state airline. It was then that rumours began to swirl about him - usually as a sideline to concerns about the power of Berezovsky. It was at Aeroflot that Glushkov became most well known - before his imprisonment One 1996 article by Forbes suggested Berezovsky was ""the most powerful man in Russia"", and raised questions about the management of both AutoVAZ and Aeroflot. Glushkov made a brief appearance, with the author writing: ""This gentleman has an interesting background"" and claimed he was convicted in 1982 for theft of state property in Russia. ""Are Glushkov and Berezovsky in cahoots to siphon money from Aeroflot?"" the author asked. The article and its allegations resulted in a libel case against Forbes in London's High Court, which was eventually settled out of court. But those allegations - proven or not - would surface again in 1999. Aeroflot was raided in 1999 in what The Moscow Times called ""a continuing offensive... against politically connected tycoon Boris Berezovsky"". The allegations, levelled against both men, involved laundering hundreds of millions of dollars from the airline, and connected fraud. The Aeroflot raids were headlines on the BBC news website in 1999 Glushkov was jailed over charges stemming from funds that flowed from Aeroflot through his payments firm Andava. He was convicted in 2004 and sentenced to time served - about five years since the raids. Berezovsky remained free and soon fled to the UK in self-imposed exile. Berezovsky had fallen out with Russia's rising new leader, Vladimir Putin, when he attempted to fund political opposition in the Liberal Russia party - two members of which were assassinated. Both men were deeply critical of President Putin in the years that followed. Glushkov, once free, was soon handed a suspended sentence for another count of fraud in 2006. He followed his old friend and business partner to Britain, seeking political asylum. He would remain a wanted man in Russia until his death. In the UK, the pair retained some notoriety as Russians in exile. When Britain wanted to extradite ex-KGB agent Andrei Lugovoi over the death of Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko, the press noted that Mr Lugovoi had been linked to a supposed escape attempt for Glushkov in 2001. Berezovsky made headlines again in 2011 when he became embroiled in a high-profile court case with another Russian oligarch - and owner of Chelsea Football Club - Roman Abramovich. The eventual outcome in Mr Abramovich's favour is understood to have severely hit Berezovsky's finances, and possibly led to depression. Berezovsky's high-profile court cases kept him in the media spotlight - unlike his friend Glushkov When he was found dead at his home in March 2013 with a piece of material tied around his neck, police said there was no sign of foul play. But the coroner's inquest disagreed and returned an open verdict. The coroner said it could not be proved either way whether the businessman had taken his own life or been killed. Glushkov, however, was certain. ""I will never believe in the natural death of Boris Berezovsky,"" he told the Guardian in 2013. Five years later, on 12 March 2018, Glushkov himself was found dead in his home in south-west London. Glushkov's home in New Malden, London, was quickly sealed off by police The death of another known critic of Vladimir Putin comes as a former double agent,Sergei Skripal, was apparently poisoned by the use of a Russian nerve agentin Salisbury - prompting a major counter-terrorism operation and political crisis. An investigation by Buzzfeed News into14 suspicious deaths involving Russians, published last year, is now receiving renewed attention. Boris Berezovsky is one. In the wake of recent events, UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd said some deaths would be reinvestigated. And now, with the death of Glushkov, specialist counter-terrorism police are investigating, rather than the normal homicide team.

"JFK's lost speech brought to lifeAudio technology was used to recreate JFK's voice so that the 55-year-old speech could be heard.4h4 hours agoEdinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on 22 November 1963 The voice of John F Kennedy has been heard for the first time giving the speech he was due to deliver on the day he was assassinated.

Edinburgh company CereProc used audio and text from 831 of his speeches to recreate his words from that day. They were able to reproduce all 2,590 words from the 20-minute speech. This video can not be played JFK's lost speech recreated The company said it took them eight weeks to put the speech together, during which JFK discusses America's standing in the world and the cost of maintaining its security. The project to create the recording was commissioned by Irish company Rothco and completed in partnership withThe Times newspaper,external. CereProc said that they analysed recordings of hundreds of JFK's speeches and split them into smaller ""phonetic units"" to reproduce the 55-year-old speech. He had been due to give a speech at the Dallas Trade Mart when he was killed Lead voice engineer Chris Pidcock told Radio Scotland'sJohn Beattieprogramme: ""We use machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques just to try and figure out how he moves his pitch and the duration of his sounds through his sentences. ""That was a big part of the project because we didn't want his intonation to be a boring and standard intonation.

Plant pot urine DNA snares rapistTwo unsolved rapes were linked to Eric McKenna after police were called to a neighbour dispute.,"Eric McKenna was cautioned following the dispute with his neighbour, but more serious consequences were to follow A rapist who evaded capture for more than 30 years until he urinated in a neighbour's plant pot - leading to a DNA match - has been jailed. Eric McKenna, 59, raped two women in separate attacks in the North East in 1983 and 1988. Police had not linked the assaults until they were called to the neighbour dispute in 2016 and took swabs from McKenna which matched the cold cases. McKenna, of Clarewood Court, Newcastle, has been jailed for 23 years. Newcastle Crown Court was told analysis of the DNA showed it to be an exact match for samples recovered after both rapes. McKenna attacked a 21-year-old woman as she walked home near the High Level Bridge in Gateshead in April 1983. Then, in March 1988, he targeted an 18-year-old student in the Manors area of Newcastle. He approached both victims from behind as they walked alone and threatened them with a knife. Det Con Mick Wilson, of Northumbria Police, described it as ""a very unusual case"" and said McKenna had ""failed to show a glimmer of remorse"". He added: ""His crimes were calculated, planned and were horrific experiences for the two victims involved. ""In the 1980s we did not have the same forensic techniques available that we do now and we have secured a conviction thanks to those developments. ""McKenna thought he had got away with his crimes, but a neighbourly dispute and a moment of stupidity has landed him in prison for 23 years."" The force apologised to the two women after admitting they did not receive the support they should have when they reported the attacks. Jackie Wilkinson, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said McKenna had ""evaded justice for two brutal rapes for over 30 years"" until an ""overwhelming case"" was built against him. She added: ""The attacks had pronounced and lasting effects on his victims throughout their lives and they have both spoken of their distress during the original investigations.

'Give menopausal commuters M badges',"TV presenter Andrea McLean has said menopausal women should be offered ""M"" badges to wear on public transport, similar to badges for pregnant women. Ms McLean, 48, who reached early menopause in her 30s, told theDaily Mail,externalthat fellow passengers should cut those suffering symptoms ""some slack"". ITV's Loose Women anchor said menopause was ""as natural as pregnancy"" and that the badges would improve awareness. She had a hysterectomy in 2016 after being diagnosed with endometriosis. Ms McLean said she was still dealing with menopause symptoms a decade later, which can include hot flushes, night sweats, anxiety, reduced libido and difficulty sleeping. The menopause is when a woman stops having periods and is no longer able to get pregnant naturally as oestrogen levels decline. The presenter, who had her first hot flush at 37, said badges with ""M"" or ""hot flush"" could help, comparable to Transport for London's ""Baby on Board!"" and ""Please offer me a seat"" badges. But whereas a pregnant woman may want a seat, she said someone experiencing a hot flush may want a window to be opened. ""If there was more knowledge out there I think male commuters would say, 'OK, it's fine, she's burning up like a furnace, let her open the window, cut her a bit of slack,'"" she said. This video can not be played 'Hot, old and hyperactive': The menopause in 60 seconds Ms McLean, who has two children, recently spoke tothe Sun,externalabout commuting to work with sweat ""running down her back"" and battling ""brain fog"" symptoms while presenting. She added: ""Women wear badges now on the train that say baby on board and people let them have a seat. ""Nobody bats an eyelid and says, 'Oh my God that's horrendous, she's got a baby in there - that's so gross.'"" Her comments follow a recent BBC survey which found that70% of women did not tell their bossesthey were experiencing menopause symptoms. Ms McLean has also appeared as a contestant in talent shows, including BBC One's Tumble Ms McLean recently started a project aimed at changing stereotypes surrounding women in their 40s and 50s. Her website, This is Fifty, said that perceptions of the menopause were ""bang out of date"".

Analysis: Response going to plan,"Among senior ministers and officials, there's quiet satisfaction that the Russia crisis seems to be going according to plan. Maybe even better. According to one senior government source, ""it's gone at least as well as we'd hoped"". He didn't add, ""...so far, anyway"". But then he hardly needed to. As Britain ponders its new post-Brexit role in the world, we're now witnessing the start of a new and defining phase. Judging the high and the low politics of the Russia crisis objectively, Theresa May and her team have been able to tick a series of boxes. So far, anyway. The UK sits front and centre of a solid front ranging from the EU through NATO and Donald Trump's White House. (Tick). Johnson blames Putin for nerve agent attack Labour row over Corbyn's Russia stance The response of the US President was always the least predictable. But as one well placed figure told me: ""The US relationship is about more than the contacts between our two principals. We have good lines of communication to people who are in the room with the President. They've been paying off."" So a crisis which had the potential to divide the western alliance appears to have achieved the opposite. (Tick) So far, anyway. Ministers, I am told, are ready to escalate the level of action if Moscow's expected countermeasures are seen as ""disproportionate"". For Britain, these could include further expulsions, asset freezes against the Russian president's close associates - ""the kind of people who have Putin on speed dial"" - and more. There's no present wish in government to see the Kremlin funded TV network RT, formerly Russia Today, banned. It would ultimately be a decision for the independent watchdog Ofcom anyway. But Theresa May is said to be keener to pointedly demonstrate her support for the principle of free expression. Moscow's inevitable response to Britain's expulsions and planned sanctions will test the UK's resolve and the strength of the alliance against Russian aggression. At Westminster, MPs on all sides have offered unqualified support for Theresa May's response. (Tick). The most notable exception has been Jeremy Corbyn, backed by some but not all of his closest colleagues. From a Conservative point of view this perhaps merits a double-tick. In government, and among many Labour MPs and shadow ministers, the Labour leader is judged to have placed himself on what Tony Blair was fond of calling ""the wrong side of the argument"". No-one has conclusively proved that the Russian-made poison was administered by a Russian state assassin. But that is now the unqualified conclusion of the UK, its allies and MPs on both sides of the House of Commons. To the discomfort of Labour MPs who privately condemn their leader's equivocation about the identity and motive of the would-be assassin, MPs from the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats have begun signing a House of Commons motion supporting Mrs May and blaming Moscow. There've been no resignations among Labour's team of shadow ministers, though a number have shared their deep sense of unease with friends and close associates. There's absolutely no sign of a repetition of the mass revolt among Labour MPs which took place before the last general election and which failed to remove the leader. Many members of that rebellion were subsequently heard joining in the chorus of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" after the party defied all the worst expectations of Labour's performance. More settled into sullen acceptance of the fact that their party was now in the secure control of a leader and a strain of politics they had always opposed, or seen as irrelevant. Now, though, Labour is experiencing its most serious schism in thinking since the party split for and against launching air strikes against so-called Islamic State in Syria in December 2015. Mr Corbyn's conviction is unwavering. He declares he is pro-sensible caution, not pro-Russia. Simply opposed to a slide into a new Cold War. His close allies in the Parliamentary party are vitriolic about the disloyalty, as they see it, of fellow MPs. Lloyd Russell Moyle, MP for Kemptown called them ""right-wing sods"" who want to ""beat the drum of war without a plan"". Another, Chris Williamson, described the Labour MPs who had backed Theresa May as ""baying for blood"" and deserving of de-selection. For all the fiery rhetoric, the quiet, off-the-record muttering is perhaps more significant. Labour MPs who had become resigned, if not reconciled, to the leadership and the direction of their party are now saying they're unable to see how they can campaign to install Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister, with responsibility for the security of the UK. As one said: ""Last time we could say 'vote Labour, and you needn't worry because Labour won't win.' Now what do we say?"" So, a crisis in the Labour Party. Another one. But a quiet crisis. Theresa May and the Conservative hierarchy can sit back, enjoy it and hope to reap their reward in opinion poll ratings. Against the backdrop of global instability and a 21st Century Cold War, the latest upheaval in British party politics at Westminster may seem a little parochial. But it matters; a significant sub-plot to the wider drama. This week, NATO'S Secretary General spoke of a new order in which lines had been blurred between peace, crisis and war. It sounded alarming. It was also a fair description of the Her Majesty's Official Opposition at Westminster.

Iraqi teenager convicted over Tube bomb,"Ahmed Hassan, 18, was found guilty on ""overwhelming evidence"", the judge said A teenager who showed warning signs to authorities that he could carry out a terrorist attack has been found guilty of 2017's Parsons Green Tube bombing. Ahmed Hassan's bomb partially exploded on a London Underground train on 15 September, injuring about 50 people. A jury at the Old Bailey took just a day to find the 18-year-old, from Surrey, guilty of attempted murder. The Iraqi teenager had been referred to the government's deradicalisation programme prior to the attack. Hassan, who arrived in the UK as a child asylum seeker, claimed to immigration officials that he had been groomed by the Islamic State group and ""trained to kill"". Bomb: Hassan carried it in a supermarket bag on to a mainline train - and then on to the Underground The BBC understands that while a local official from the government's Prevent counter-extremism programme was brought in to look at his case in early 2016, Hassan did not receive any deradicalisation support for months. He was eventually referred to specialists to try to change his mindset - and he had not been given the all-clear by the time he carried out the attack. The Iraqi fantasist who wanted attention Security minister Ben Wallace said: ""It is clear that there are some lessons to be learned in this particular case. ""The police and local council have conducted an internal review into how it was handled and we are working with our partners to review the findings and to identify where further improvements can be made."" Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner David Munro said there were ""opportunities missed"" in preventing Hassan from carrying out the attack. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""As far as Surrey is concerned, it is obvious we were too slow - all the organisations involved."" This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball After the verdict, the judge, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, told the court Hassan had been found guilty on ""overwhelming evidence"" as the teenager sat with his head bowed and gave no reaction. Hassan built his bomb in the home of his foster parents in Sunbury, Surrey, while they were away. From there, he travelled on a mainline train to Wimbledon station and then left the device, which had a timer, on a westbound District Line train. It partially exploded at 08:20am after the train arrived at Parsons Green Station, leaving 23 people with burn injuries and 28 suffering crush injuries in the aftermath. Hassan had got off the carriage at the preceding station and went on the run. He was caught the following morning at Dover. By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani: When Ahmed Hassan told immigration officers he'd been groomed by the Islamic State group, the information only got to the police thanks to the charity Barnardo's. An official from Surrey County Council's Preventing Violent Extremism team assigned to the case told his carers to look for warning signs, such as a black flag on his bedroom wall. A month later, a Prevent panel deemed the teenager's case to be so serious that he became one of just 380 people referred that year to the Channel deradicalisation scheme. That often leads to months of intensive mentoring from a highly-experienced Home Office-approved specialist, but not in Hassan's case. The Home Office wasn't asked to provide an approved ""intervention provider"". Why remains a mystery. An internal review hasn't been published but it's likely security chiefs will devise a system to more closely monitor how councils carry out this sensitive work. The Home Office has also conceded immigration teams must improve how they communicate with counter-terrorism units. The bomb, made from 400g of TATP explosive that Hassan had mixed himself, was packed with 2kg of screwdrivers, knives, nuts and bolts. Witnesses recalled a loud bang and a fireball rolling across the ceiling of the carriage.  One passenger was burnt on their face and limbs and others were injured as they tried to run away. During his defence, the former media student told jurors he had only wanted to cause a fire because he was ""bored and stressed"". But Metropolitan Police Commander Dean Haydon described Hassan as ""devious and cunning"" during the trial, saying the teenager hid his plans from Prevent workers in Surrey. He said it was ""only through good fortune"" that the bomb did not fully explode, adding: ""If it had, without a doubt we would have been dealing with many fatalities."" Shrapnel: Some of the metal parts recovered from the bomb The trial heard that Hassan arrived in the UK in a lorry after having spent time in the migrant camp in Calais known as the Jungle and he was referred to Surrey County Council's social services - a standard procedure for unaccompanied child asylum seekers. In his January 2016 immigration interview, the teenager told officials he had been in contact with the IS group and had been ""trained to kill"". Care workers at the home where he was initially placed reported these concerns. A local Prevent officer visited a week later - and the county's Prevent ""Panel"" - a team of experts who assess what to do with each reported case of extremism, decided in February that Hassan should receive specialist deradicalisation support. The BBC understands it may not have started before the end of July. Hassan's foster parents were not aware of the concerns that he harboured extremist views. Following the verdict, Surrey County Council apologised, saying its work ""wasn't as good as it should have been"" in helping to stop individuals from being drawn to terrorism. A spokesman from the council also said sorry to his foster parents - describing Hassan's case as ""difficult"" and in ""tough circumstances"".

Johnson blames Putin for nerve agent attack,"This video can not be played ""Our quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin,"" Boris Johnson says. Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""overwhelmingly likely"" to have ordered the nerve agent attack on an ex-spy and his daughter, Boris Johnson has said. The foreign secretary said ""our quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin, and with his decision"" over the Salisbury incident. Russia denies involvement and said the accusations against Mr Putin were ""shocking and unforgivable"". Meanwhile, the head of Nato told the BBC that Russia has underestimated the ""resolve and unity"" of the UK's allies. Speaking during a visit to a west London military museum with the Polish foreign minister, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin"". ""We think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK, on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the Second World War,"" he said. Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital, after they were found unconscious on a bench in the Wiltshire city on 4 March. The UK government says they were poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok, and PM Theresa May said she believed Moscow was ""culpable"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Mrs May has said the UKwill expel 23 Russian diplomatsas part of a ""full and robust"" response - prompting Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to say it will ""certainly"" expel British diplomats in response. Conspiracy theories and denial in Russia Why does UK think it was Russia? What are Novichok agents and what do they do? How is the UK retaliating against Russia? Russian spy attack: What we know so far UK Russia response going to plan so far Russia's investigative committee said it had opened a criminal case investigation into the ""attempted murder"" of Ms Skripal and ""the murder"" of Nikolai Glushkov, aRussian exile who was found deadin his home in London on Monday. According to Russian news agency Tass, the Russian ambassador to Britain, Alexander Yakovenko, said the UK claimed the nerve agent used was A-234, but this has not been confirmed. A Downing Street spokesman said the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has been invited to come to the UK to take a sample of the nerve agent - that process is expected to begin ""imminently"". By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The implication of the ambassador's comments is that the Russians have been told by the British the exact nerve agent deployed. So far, British officials have not confirmed that they have communicated this to Moscow or that A-234 was the exact agent deployed. Based on public sources, A-234 is one of the Novichok family of agents. It has been reported that it is at least five to eight and possibly 10 times as strong as VX. Little is known about it but the symptoms are very similar to those which eyewitnesses attributed to Sergei and Yulia Skripal. In military handbooks it is described as a ""delayed casualty agent"" - its persistence depends upon how it is used, as well as the weather. On Friday, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had ""no reason to doubt the findings and assessments by the British government"" which suggested Russian responsibility. He said the ""UK is not alone"" and Nato allies gave ""strong political support"" to Britain, followinga joint statement from the US, France and Germanybacking Mrs May's government and a pledge of support from Australia. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Stoltenberg said the incident was part of a ""pattern of reckless behaviour"" from Russia, following allegations of cyber attacks and election meddling in recent years. ""It is important that Russia gets a clear signal that it costs to behave the way they behave,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. This video can not be played The BBC's Gordon Corera considers how likely is it Russia poisoned Sergei Skripal and his daughter ""I'm absolutely certain that Russia has underestimated the resolve and unity of Nato allies when we have implemented different kinds of sanctions over the last years,"" Mr Stoltenberg added. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was not worried by international expressions of support for the UK and challenged Britain to ""provide some confirmation"". He said: ""Sooner or later, the British will have to show some proof to those 'colleagues' who say they are with UK on this; sooner or later will have to stand up its accusations."" Ahead of an EU leaders' summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said discussions of a potential boycott of the World Cup in Russia are ""not an immediate priority"". It comes as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written in the Guardianwarning against ""hasty judgements"", and not to ""rush ahead of the evidence"". Wiltshire Police said 131 people had been identified as potentially being exposed to the nerve agent - but none has shown any symptoms. Salisbury District Hospital has also assessed 46 people who came forward expressing health concerns but they were not admitted. In a letter to the Times, Salisbury NHS Trust emergency medical consultant Stephen Davies said only three people - the Skripals and Det Sgt Nick Bailey - had needed treatment. Det Sgt Bailey remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital after being contaminated with the chemical. Public Health England said the risk posed to the public remains low but theyrepeated their advice for anyone who had been to the Mill pub or Zizzito wash their clothes and possessions. A spokesperson said while it was clear a ""significant dose"" could have a ""serious immediate effect"", anyone in either venue ""could only have been exposed to extremely small traces"" and no further cases of illness have been reported. Defence secretary tells Russia: Shut up Laura Kuenssberg: Spy row stokes Labour foreign policy divisions Allies condemn nerve agent attack May visits Salisbury after 'brazen' attack Corbyn aide queries proof of Russian guilt Russia's ambassador to Britain Alexander Yakovenko claimed the UK had angled allegations against Russia to ""divert attention from Brexit"". He criticised the lack of transparency and said: ""Nobody saw even the pictures of these people in a hospital, whether they are alive or maybe they are in good health. Nobody talked to the doctors."" And Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had asked the UK to take action under the Chemical Weapons Convention. He also responded to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - whopreviously said Russia should ""go away"" and ""shut up""- saying: ""Maybe he lacks education."" Some 220 police officers from 16 forces, 80 ambulance staff, 50 fire officers, 200 armed forces personnel and 250 specialist officers have so far been deployed as part of the investigation, Wiltshire Police said. Police cordons remain in place in parts of Salisbury, 12 days on from the attack Zizzi restaurant, the Mill pub and the bench where the Skripals sat are among locations taped off by police On Thursday,Mrs May visited Salisburyto speak to emergency service workers, public health experts and local business owners who are affected by the police cordons. Wiltshire Council has announced measures to help affected businesses, including free park and ride journeys and waived business rates. Mr Skripalis a retired colonel in the Russian military intelligence service. He was jailed by Moscow in 2006 for secretly working for Britain's MI6 but was later released and allowed to come to the UK.

'Nobody asked me any questions',"Grooming, rape, trafficking, or the many other ways children are being sexually abused, the subject of child sexual exploitation - or CSE as it is known by professionals in the field - is in the headlines with depressing regularity. Telford is currently in the spotlight - but is by no means the first place and will not be the last. There were so many opportunities - in Rotherham, in Rochdale, in Oxford - to step in and help. No-one did. The exploitation continued. Not only did the cycle of abuse grind on, but the message given to the victims must have been that ""we don't care about you"". One 13-year-old girl, ""with disrupted clothing"", was found by police in a house in the early hours with a group of men who had given her vodka. A neighbour had called the police after hearing the girl scream. The teenager was arrested for being drunk and disorderly. The men were not questioned. A 12-year-old girl was found, being plied with alcohol, in a car with a 22-year-old man. He had indecent images of her on his phone. No action was taken. Rather than being offered protection, teenagers groomed and coerced into having sexfaced criminal charges of prostitution. A major factor was the public - and professional - perception of the abused girls, who were often dismissed as troublemakers. As the Children's Society 1995Game's Up report,externalasked: ""Is it acceptable that a child abused at home is protected, whereas a child abused on the street is criminalised?"" Lucy Lowe was 16 and pregnant with her second child when she was murdered And the media unwittingly helped to obscure the scale of the abuse, referring to children as the ""girlfriends"" of adult men. When in 2001, Lucy Lowe was murdered in Telford - along with her mother and sister - by the 26-year-old man who had groomed and abused her, news outlets - including the BBC -described the adult killer as Lucy's ""boyfriend"",external. She was 16 and pregnant with her second child by Azhar Ali Mehmood, who set fire to the Lowe family home. The infant, who had been in the house, was later found wrapped in a blanket in the garden. In court, the prosecution barrister Adrian Redgrave QC said: ""There had also been occasions when he had been, in one way or another, humiliated in front of others by things that Lucy had said or done. He was jealous and possessive."" The court heard they had a ""stormy relationship and argued frequently, sometimes about her relationships with other men"". It makes for difficult reading. At no point is a suggestion made that this was not a ""relationship"" and that Lucy was a victim of rape. Targeted by Mehmood aged 12 and giving birth to her first child at 14, she was legally incapable of consent. It was later to emerge that Lucy's situation was far from unusual. Operation Chalice, launched by West Mercia Police, led to the jailing of a group of Asian men, mostly of Pakistani origin, whom police said may have targeted more than 100 girls. Telford grooming gangs 'tip of iceberg' Why Three Girls is one of TV's toughest watches White working class girls 'traded for sex' ""Even five years ago, people were talking about the 'lifestyle choices' these young people were making,"" says Adele Gladman, the Home Office researcher whoreported the scale of abuse in Rotherham. As recently as 2012, when 24-year-old Ahdel Ali was convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl and jailed for 18 years, his barrister asked the judge to be lenient because ""this type of rape is not like other horrible types of rapes"". It now seems astonishing, but lawyer Tayyab Khan stood up in court and said the child ""had loved"" Ali, who had been ""pleasant to her"" and it had been ""a consensual relationship"". A message both damaging and dangerous. But the language used to describe young people in abusive situations is slowly changing. A significant factor was the abolishment of the term ""child prostitution"" in favour of the term child sexual exploitation, first used in 2009 in a Department for Education document. A small change, perhaps, but it shifted the focus and clarified that the children involved were victims, not perpetrators, of crimes. According to research carried out by Barnardo's, describing victims as a ""girlfriend"" or ""boyfriend"" can make it more difficult for them to realise they are in an abusive situation. The Jay Report,externalcites cases in which abusers targeted children when they knew there was a chance the victim might be especially vulnerable, such as those living in local authority residential units, and who have ""a desperate need for attention and affection"". Those in local authority care are often deliberately targeted for exploitation as they may not have the same support in their lives, with adults who can spot that they are at risk. The Barnardo's research indicates ""perpetrators of this type of CSE will particularly draw on children's feelings of loneliness, their need for care, and their desire to be loved"". A girl starved of attention and kindness is more likely to believe she is in a caring relationship, leaving the perpetrator free to coerce her to have sex with friends or associates. As a result, children will often protect the perpetrator, even when they recognise their behaviour as exploitative and abusive. ""I know he loves me. He has other girlfriends, but I'm special,"" was a sentiment often uttered in the investigation into what happened in Rotherham. Many victims do not want to co-operate with the criminal justice system. A care worker, who was employed at children's homes from 2003-2007,spoke anonymously to the BBC in 2014. He said men would arrive almost ""every night"" to collect girls, who escaped using a range of methods and were then usually driven off in taxis. ""Children who have been abused do not blame their attacker simply because they ""are struggling for love"". ""But you cannot provide love in a children's unit. It's one thing that you can't provide, and as a corporate parent it's where we fail. ""And if [the abusers] are providing that, plus drugs, and alcohol and freedoms, or perceived freedoms, then we're never going to be able to keep them safe."" Dr Helen Beckett, director at the University of Bedfordshire centre of researching CSE says: ""What is common across all forms of CSE is the rarity with which young people disclose what is happening to them. ""There are many different reasons for this - many young people don't even realise the abusive nature of what is happening. Some may even feel in some way complicit in the abuse because there has been some kind of 'reward' or receipt of something."" That can be gifts, alcohol, drugs, or affection. In some cases victims are so traumatised they use drink or drugs to cope. But they then need the means to get the drink or drugs. It's a vicious circle. Ms Gladman says this is one area in which ""nothing has changed"". ""The grooming is so good, so targeted and tailored that the girls - and boys - involved don't understand they are being exploited. They don't listen to warnings. They're desperate for love and attention and it's up to the experts to recognise that, to spot who is vulnerable, and almost follow the grooming process themselves. ""We have to engage with the young people and make them feel worthwhile, give them life skills."" There is, however, a danger in thinking the only people at risk are those with difficult histories. As Ms Gladman points out: ""Parents tend to believe it's kids from troubled families who are at risk. ""Any child can be vulnerable if not protected."" While some of the most high-profile cases of CSE have involved gangs of men with Pakistani heritage abusing white girls, Dr Beckett points out that there is ""no typical CSE case"". ""It exists across every ethnic grouping, both in terms of those perpetrating and in terms of those experiencing the abuse. Research tells us that both males and females are abused through CSE. Similarly, both males and females perpetrate the abuse. ""Whilst most of our focus historically has been on adults abusing children, we are increasingly learning about peer-on-peer abuse and the risk that young people face within their own social settings."" One example is that of Laura Wilson, a 17-year-old murdered by Ashtiaq Asghar - also 17 - in Rotherham in 2010. He stabbed her multiple times and pushed her into a canal to die. Once again, the pressdescribed the killer as her ""boyfriend""at the same time as reporting that Laura had a four-month-old daughter with Asghar's friend, and that they ""treated white girls as 'sexual targets' and not like human beings"". Peter Grigg from the Children's Society says there has been a gradual change in attitudes towards the nature of exploitation, and the exposure of the abuse in Rotherham, Rochdale and other places ""has certainly ensured decision-makers and the public pay attention to issues"". But how is the issue tackled? Everybody involved in child protection agrees there is no single solution. No one agency holds the answers. According to theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse,external, systematic grooming and sexual abuse of children by groups of offenders in cities and towns of England and Wales is ""widespread"". Adele Gladman says that over the past 12 years in which she has been working in the field, there is no geographical location where it is not a problem. Peter Grigg says it's ""very likely that many other victims exist that haven't yet felt able to speak out"". The charity'sOld Enough to Know better?,externalreport showed that 50,000 females aged 16 and 17 experienced sexual offences against them but only around 5,000 of them were reported to the police. The actual figures are impossible to accurately predict, says Cassi Harrison, director of the Centre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse. ""Due to data limitations, we are making decisions in a fog. We just can't say if more children are being sexually abused. We know we are identifying more of it, but this the tip of the iceberg. ""Reported numbers are increasing, but that could be because of increased willingness of victims to report linked to confidence they will be taken seriously, increased professional awareness of the signs of abuse and commitment to take action - or because recording has improved."" Holly - not her real name - was a victim of a group of men in Telford. She told the BBC what happened to her ""He started violently raping me, he would beat me with his belt if I didn't let him rape me. Afterwards he would try to make me feel better - or make himself feel better - by giving me money or topping up my mobile phone. ""It quickly moved on to being sold to men maybe two or three times a night. I was taken to a place I can only describe as a 'rape house' which was set up for the purpose of young girls being sold to men. ""The reason I kept going back was that they kept threatening me with burning my house down, which was a real threat in Telford as that had actually happened previously. They said they'd rape my mum and rape my sisters. They knew all about my family. There was just no escape at all. ""I was gang-raped just after I turned 16 and that was probably the worst thing that has ever happened to me. After that I tried to commit suicide. People would say to me 'was that a cry for help?' and I would say 'no - I genuinely wanted to die' because I thought that was the only way out. ""I was in cars that were stopped and searched by police with older men and it was never questioned why I was in there or who I was. My name was never asked. I just think if they had been more proactive at points like that, things could have changed earlier. ""I was also going to the doctor and the youth sexual health clinic a couple of times a week for three years and getting the morning-after pill. ""Nobody asked any questions. ""I had two abortions and again, no questions were asked as to what was going on in my life."" Identifying at-risk children is done by various organisations - charities, social workers, and police all have child welfare personnel who are out on the streets at night. Outreach sessions are held in parks and other areas popular with children. Some children are already in contact with social services, for example those who are in local authority care. Workers use methods including regular texting, calls and cards, as well as by arranging to meet on the young person's ""home ground"" or at venues where they feel comfortable. Ms Gladman, now an independent safeguarding children trainer and consultant, says legislation has been made more sophisticated in order to deal with the impact of grooming - and importantly, every local authority now has a protocol to identify and prevent CSE. ""We've become more aware of abuse and better at spotting it. In some ways, we've made huge strides. We're reaching out to parents and communities - we're engaging with what's called the 'night-time economy', taxi drivers, takeaways, off licences, places like that."" Staff at such premises have proved a valuable - if unofficial - resource when it comes to safeguarding children.  Last year, taxi driver Satbir Aroraraised the alarm after he drove a teenager alone to a railway station. ""Often, people let their guard down when they're out and about or in shops. Children talk to each other, and they may be overheard by the shopkeeper who can get in touch with the police about what they suspect,"" says Ms Gladman. Cassi Harrison agrees public awareness is changing for the better. ""Over the past few years, we've seen an increased understanding of CSE; the complexity of the relationships between the abuser and the victim, and the way the abuser can control and manipulate the victim. ""Our ambition should be to prevent abuse before it happens, not wait until a child has been abused. There are many ways we can do this. For example, we should support young people to have expectations of healthy relationships and provide support for children when they display harmful sexual behaviour. ""It is never the responsibility of a child to keep themselves safe; the blame lies with the perpetrator. ""As adults, it's our responsibility to spot the signs and take action to safeguard children, not rely on children to tell us they are being abused."" If you're worried that a child or young person is at risk or is being abused you can contact the children's social care team at their local council. You can choose not to give your details. You canreport it online,externalto the Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (CEOP). Or you can call the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 for expert advice and support. If a child is at immediate risk call 999, or call the police on 101 if you think a crime has been committed. Children and young people can call Childline free on 0800 1111 where trained counsellors are available 24 hours a day, every day.

"Exodus as Syrian war rages on two frontsSome 50,000 people are said to have fled separate advances by the Turkish and Syrian military.","This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta evacuees are staying at a school under government control More than 60,000 people have fled two separate offensives in Syria in recent days, the UN says. Up to 16,000 people have fled Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, where Russian air strikes are supporting Syrian government attempts to retake the area. Nearly 50,000 fled the northern town of Afrin, where Turkey is fighting a US-backed Kurdish militia that it considers a terrorist group. Dozens of people were killed in air strikes on Friday, activists said. Seven years of civil war have driven nearly 12 million Syrians from their homes: At least6.1 millionare internally displaced Another5.6 millionhave fled abroad More than400,000are believed to have been killed or are missing, presumed dead On Friday, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations said the estimates of those who fled the rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta could be more than twice as high as reported, with up to 40,000 leaving on Thursday alone. The number could not be verified. Why is there a war in Syria? Russian air strikes killed 80 people including 14 children on Friday in the Eastern Ghouta towns of Kafr Batna, Saqba and Harasta, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. Despite international calls for a ceasefire, there has been no let-up in the offensive and the Syrian army is now pushing into densely populated areas, backed by Russian air support. Residents have told BBC News there has been intense street fighting between rebels and government soldiers in some parts of the enclave. Humanitarian corridors controlled by the Syrian government reportedly allowed about 4,000 more people to leave the enclave on Friday despite the fighting. The UN children's agency Unicef is sending representatives to assess the needs of evacuees in temporary shelters in Damascus. A Unicef spokeswoman said its current response plan could deal with up to 50,000 people.

The crushing of the rebel enclave outside Damascus would be a major victory for President Assad. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Falling hair and eating inedible plants to survive Afrin, a town populated mainly by ethnic Kurds near the Turkish border, has been under bombardment from the air and the ground by Turkish forces and their local Syrian allies. Turkish bombing reportedly killed at least 43 people on Friday, including seven children and at least 16 people who died in an air strike on the town's main hospital, the Syrian Observatory said. ""It was the only functioning hospital in Afrin city,"" a Kurdish Red Crescent official told the AFP news agency. An estimated 48,000 people have fled the city and nearby villages, according to Linda Tom, a UN humanitarian spokeswoman in Syria. They headed towards villages held by Syrian government forces. Turkey is targeting the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), a militia that it regards as an extension of the Kurdish forces on its own territory - a banned group that Turkey considers a terrorist organisation. But Kurdish fighters in Syria have been a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State group, and have received support from the United States to that end. This video can not be played Afrin: What is going on in Syria's other battle? Brusk Hasakeh, a YPG spokesman, told Reuters news agency that Turkish forces and their Syrian militia allies were trying to storm Afrin from the north but the YPG andits women's affiliate, the YPJ, were fighting back. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told a gathering in Ankara that his country would not stop until its mission to capture Afrin had been completed. While Turkey is opposed to President Assad, Russia and Iran are the Syrian leader's closest allies. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sought to portray the talks in Kazakhstan as an opportunity to bring lasting peace to Syria, saying ""millions of Syrians are looking in the direction of Astana"". Referring to the Eastern Ghouta, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the bombing of civilians was unacceptable.

Corbyn: Avoid hasty judgements,"This video can not be played Corbyn: Evidence points towards Russia Jeremy Corbyn's warning not to ""rush ahead of the evidence"" over the nerve agent attack has ""muddied the waters"", a Labour MP has said. The UK government says the Russian state is responsible for the poisoning of a former spy and his daughter. Mr Corbyn has condemned the attack but says the involvement of Russian ""mafia-like groups"" can not be ruled out. More than 30 Labour MPs have signeda motion,externalwhich ""unequivocally"" accepts the Russian state's ""culpability"". Pienaar: UK Russia response going to plan so far Russia 'underestimates UK allies' - Nato Why does UK think it was Russia? On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May told the Commons that Russia was ""culpable"" for the attack and that she was expelling 23 Russian diplomats - but Moscow has denied all involvement. On Thursday, amid calls for him to be firmer in his condemnation of Russia, Mr Corbynsaid the ""evidence points towards Russia on this"". But later inan article for the Guardian newspaper,external, he drew a link with the build-up to the war in Iraq and warned that ""clear thinking in an international crisis"" could be ""overwhelmed by emotion and hasty judgement"". Labour backbencher Stephen Kinnock told the BBC Mr Corbyn's first statement, on Thursday, was ""a step in right direction"" but added: ""I think the article he wrote after that then muddied the waters somewhat. ""I think what we need is a very clear line from our leadership stating very clearly that we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies and with the government in the action it's taken."" Labour MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Two's Newsnight that ""clearly it looks like the evidence points to Russia"", but said the UK needs to ""make sure we get our facts right"" before ""leaping into action"". He said his leader's approach was ""not about being nice to Russia"" but about taking ""a statesman-like approach"". And he dismissed those criticising Mr Corbyn's stance as ""a tiny minority of irrelevant malcontents"" who are ""fighting a proxy war"" to undermine the party leader. Allies condemn nerve agent attack Russian spy attack: What we know so far Russian former spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital, 11 days after they were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire. An Early Day Motion, sponsored by Labour backbencher John Woodcock, who has criticised Mr Corbyn's leadership of the party in the past, states that the signatories ""fully support the statement made by the prime minister on 14 March 2018 in response to Russia's illegal attack on the UK"". Whether there is specific direct proof that there was Russian state involvement in the attack or not, the majority of MPs in the House of Commons agree that there is enough evidence and a pattern of behaviour that make this an appropriate moment to take some diplomatic moves against the Putin regime. While not opposing those specific actions, Mr Corbyn's tone and reaction to those moves have cracked open Labour's political truce. His comments have stoked worries about the leader's foreign policy views that have been one of the sources of division in the Labour Party since he became its top pick. Read more from Laura In his Guardian article, Mr Corbyn wrote that he agrees with the expulsion of the diplomats and describes the use of a military-grade nerve agent as ""barbaric and beyond reckless"". But he says that although the evidence points to Russia - the public deserve ""calm heads and a measured response"" from the government. ""To rush way ahead of the evidence being gathered by the police, in a fevered parliamentary atmosphere, serves neither justice nor our national security,"" he writes. Mr Corbyn says if Moscow is not to blame ""a connection to Russian mafia-like groups"" cannot be excluded. He said Russian authorities should be ""held to account on the basis of evidence"", adding: ""But let us not manufacture a division over Russia where none exists."" Others in his shadow cabinet have been more explicit in blaming the Russian state. Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith said the party accepted that ""Russia is responsible"" while Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberryis reported to have said,externalthere was ""prima facie evidence"" against the Russian government, which ""must face the consequences"". Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""the right conclusion"" for the prime minister to determine that there was ""no alternative explanation other than that responsibility lies with Russia"". He said it was an ""attack on our sovereignty"" and, referencing the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London, in which he acted as a lawyer to bring a case against Russia: ""This is not the first time and it needs to be called out with no ifs and no buts."" Spy row stokes Labour's foreign policy divisions Corbyn: Spy evidence points towards Russia Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far May visits scene of 'brazen' spy attack Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

UK Russia response going to plan,"Among senior ministers and officials, there's quiet satisfaction that the Russia crisis seems to be going according to plan. Maybe even better. According to one senior government source, ""it's gone at least as well as we'd hoped"". He didn't add, ""...so far, anyway"". But then he hardly needed to. As Britain ponders its new post-Brexit role in the world, we're now witnessing the start of a new and defining phase. Judging the high and the low politics of the Russia crisis objectively, Theresa May and her team have been able to tick a series of boxes. So far, anyway. The UK sits front and centre of a solid front ranging from the EU through NATO and Donald Trump's White House. (Tick). Johnson blames Putin for nerve agent attack Labour row over Corbyn's Russia stance The response of the US President was always the least predictable. But as one well placed figure told me: ""The US relationship is about more than the contacts between our two principals. We have good lines of communication to people who are in the room with the President. They've been paying off."" So a crisis which had the potential to divide the western alliance appears to have achieved the opposite. (Tick) So far, anyway. Ministers, I am told, are ready to escalate the level of action if Moscow's expected countermeasures are seen as ""disproportionate"". For Britain, these could include further expulsions, asset freezes against the Russian president's close associates - ""the kind of people who have Putin on speed dial"" - and more. There's no present wish in government to see the Kremlin funded TV network RT, formerly Russia Today, banned. It would ultimately be a decision for the independent watchdog Ofcom anyway. But Theresa May is said to be keener to pointedly demonstrate her support for the principle of free expression. Moscow's inevitable response to Britain's expulsions and planned sanctions will test the UK's resolve and the strength of the alliance against Russian aggression. At Westminster, MPs on all sides have offered unqualified support for Theresa May's response. (Tick). The most notable exception has been Jeremy Corbyn, backed by some but not all of his closest colleagues. From a Conservative point of view this perhaps merits a double-tick. In government, and among many Labour MPs and shadow ministers, the Labour leader is judged to have placed himself on what Tony Blair was fond of calling ""the wrong side of the argument"". No-one has conclusively proved that the Russian-made poison was administered by a Russian state assassin. But that is now the unqualified conclusion of the UK, its allies and MPs on both sides of the House of Commons. To the discomfort of Labour MPs who privately condemn their leader's equivocation about the identity and motive of the would-be assassin, MPs from the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats have begun signing a House of Commons motion supporting Mrs May and blaming Moscow. There've been no resignations among Labour's team of shadow ministers, though a number have shared their deep sense of unease with friends and close associates. There's absolutely no sign of a repetition of the mass revolt among Labour MPs which took place before the last general election and which failed to remove the leader. Many members of that rebellion were subsequently heard joining in the chorus of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" after the party defied all the worst expectations of Labour's performance. More settled into sullen acceptance of the fact that their party was now in the secure control of a leader and a strain of politics they had always opposed, or seen as irrelevant. Now, though, Labour is experiencing its most serious schism in thinking since the party split for and against launching air strikes against so-called Islamic State in Syria in December 2015. Mr Corbyn's conviction is unwavering. He declares he is pro-sensible caution, not pro-Russia. Simply opposed to a slide into a new Cold War. His close allies in the Parliamentary party are vitriolic about the disloyalty, as they see it, of fellow MPs. Lloyd Russell Moyle, MP for Kemptown called them ""right-wing sods"" who want to ""beat the drum of war without a plan"". Another, Chris Williamson, described the Labour MPs who had backed Theresa May as ""baying for blood"" and deserving of de-selection. For all the fiery rhetoric, the quiet, off-the-record muttering is perhaps more significant. Labour MPs who had become resigned, if not reconciled, to the leadership and the direction of their party are now saying they're unable to see how they can campaign to install Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister, with responsibility for the security of the UK. As one said: ""Last time we could say 'vote Labour, and you needn't worry because Labour won't win.' Now what do we say?"" So, a crisis in the Labour Party. Another one. But a quiet crisis. Theresa May and the Conservative hierarchy can sit back, enjoy it and hope to reap their reward in opinion poll ratings. Against the backdrop of global instability and a 21st Century Cold War, the latest upheaval in British party politics at Westminster may seem a little parochial. But it matters; a significant sub-plot to the wider drama. This week, NATO'S Secretary General spoke of a new order in which lines had been blurred between peace, crisis and war. It sounded alarming. It was also a fair description of the Her Majesty's Official Opposition at Westminster.

No Dover checks after Brexit - Grayling,"This video can not be played Chris Grayling: No post-Brexit lorry checks at Dover Theresa May has been accused of planning to ""throw open"" Britain's borders after Brexit, by a cross-party group of pro-European MPs. It comes after Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said there won't be any border checks at Dover when Britain leaves the EU in March next year. He said it would be ""utterly unrealistic"" to have checks and trade would be managed electronically. The Open Britain group has written to the PM to demand clarification. In their letter, the Labour, Lib Dem and Green MPs, who campaign against a ""hard Brexit"", say: ""It is extraordinary that a government that says it aims to 'take back control' now admits it is not even going to try to control the transfer of goods across our borders, in the event we leave the customs union. ""This has major implications for our businesses, our infrastructure and our trade."" Brexit border checks 'may triple queues' HMRC 'needs Â£7.3m' to avoid customs delays Such a plan would not avoid a hard border ""because the EU would have to enforce checks on goods entering its common market"", the MPs say. And, in the event of no trade deal being reached with the EU, ""it would be in breach of WTO rules to apply no tariffs on EU goods whilst continuing to apply tariffs on goods from outside the EU"". The MPs also call for the government to make its post-Brexit border plans public afterSky News reported,externalthat companies have been asked to sign non-disclosure agreements about briefings on the impact on freight traffic if there is no Brexit agreement as well as other possible scenarios. The Department for Exiting the EU said while a trade deal was ""by far and away the highest probability"", it made sense to prepare for all possible outcomes. More than 2.5 million lorries passed through Dover in 2017 The UK currently has a free-flowing border in Kent where lorries travelling within the EU do not complete customs declarations and passport checks are minimal. Researchers estimate it takes an average of about two minutes for each vehicle at Dover to be processed. There have been warnings that if additional customs checks are imposed after the UK leaves on 29 March 2019, it will add about 10 miles to the queues at peak times for every additional minute's worth of checks. A study by Imperial College London earlier this week found that two extra minutes of checks on vehicles could more than triple the existing queues, potentially leading to motorway tailbacks up to 29 miles long. But Mr Grayling told BBC One's Question Time it was ""absolutely clear"" that this ""cannot happen"". ""We will maintain a free flowing border at Dover - we will not impose checks in the port. We don't check lorries now - we're not going to be checking lorries in Dover in the future. ""The only reason we would have queues at the border is if we put in place restrictions that created those queues - we are not going to do that."" The government has said leaving the EU will allow the UK to take back control of its borders. MPs warn of Brexit customs 'catastrophe' 'Inland' customs checks after Brexit The UK is set to the leave the customs union, but ministers are hoping to negotiate a new customs partnership with the EU as part of a transition arrangement likely to last about two years after the UK's official exit from the union next March. Mr Grayling said goods moved seamlessly across national borders elsewhere in the world and there was no reason this would not happen after Brexit. ""Go to our ports on the east coast that take goods from outside the European Union where goods... depart pretty much as soon as they arrive. That is what is going to happen. ""We will manage trade electronically. Trucks will move through the border without stopping. We will manage them electronically. In the way it happens between Canada and the US."" Labour said a new customs union with the EU was the only way to avoid ""gridlock"" at British ports. ""Chris Grayling let the cat out of the bag by exposing how unprepared the government are for leaving the EU,"" said shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald. ""The government said leaving the EU is about regaining control of our borders but the transport secretary's plan would achieve the exact opposite."" He warned of chaos unless the UK was able to negotiate a new arrangement replicating all the benefits of the existing customs union, which removes tariffs and other trade barriers between its members. Under the terms of the Le Touquet agreement, in which juxtaposed border and immigration controls are in force on either side of the Channel, France has the power to carry out checks on outbound vehicles at Dover. When France increased security checks in the summer of 2016, in the wake of a series of terror attacks in the country, it led to days of lengthy queues on the roads approaching the port as staff shortages meant checks on passenger coaches were taking 40 minutes.

Wetherspoon surviving the 'trendy-types',"Pub chain JD Wetherspoon is weathering tough times in the restaurant trade, according to boss Tim Martin.

But althoughhalf-year sales and profits rose more than expected,external, future trading would be tougher, he said. The group posted a 36.1% rise in pre-tax profit to Â£54.3m in the 26 weeks to 28 January, with revenue rising 3.6% to Â£830.4m. However, higher costs for the remainder of the financial year mean he is wary about the future. ""The company anticipates higher costs in the second half of the financial year, in areas including pay, taxes and utilities,"" he said. ""In view of these additional costs, and our expectation that growth in like-for-like sales will be lower in the next six months, the company remains cautious about the second half of the year."" The casual food trade has seen a wave of closures and restructuring, with Prezzo, Jamie's Italian, Byron and Carluccio's among chains to hit trouble. Mr Martin said: ""I think that a lot of trendy-type, restaurant-type companies have all opened up at around the same time in the last 10 years, pay huge rents and the glitter has worn off a bit and they've suffered a backlash from customers. ""In the more prosaic world of Greggs or McDonald's or Starbucks, I think things are going reasonably well."" Tim Martin said rising taxes ""makes life more difficult"" He took a swipe atthe sugar tax on fizzy drinks coming into force next month, something chef Jamie Oliver has campaigned for. The higher taxes Wetherspoon faces included ""Jamie Oliver's sugar tax, which he got us to pay but couldn't pay himself"". It had already cost his company about Â£3m, he said. ""So, it's an era of rising taxes for pub and restaurant companies, which makes life more difficult."" Analysts agreed that Wetherspoon could face tougher trading for the remainder of the year. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said Mr Martin's ""guarded outlook""  was ""somewhat troubling"" despite Wetherspoon being ""a rare success story on the UK High Street"".

Film of assault death woman incidentMariam Moustafa died three weeks after she was attacked in Nottingham.21m21 minutes agoNottingham,"This video can not be played Footage has emerged of Mariam Moustafa Film has emerged of an incident involving a teenager who died three weeks after being assaulted by a group of women as she was waiting for a bus. Egyptian national Mariam Moustafa, 18,died on Wednesday after the attack in Nottingham three weeks earlier. Nottinghamshire Police said Miss Moustafa was ""punched several times"" outside the Victoria Centre in Parliament Street on 20 February. The force confirmed the footage showed part of the attack. In a statement, police said she got on a bus but was followed ""by the same group of women who were threatening and abusive towards her before they got off"". Mariam Moustafa was in a coma in hospital for three weeks after the attack Live updates and more from the East Midlands Bus company Nottingham City Transport (NCT) said one of its drivers helped Miss Moustafa by ""acting as a barrier between the attackers and the young lady"". NCT said Miss Moustafa did not inform the driver of ""any concerns she may have about other people in the queue for the bus"". There was also ""no physical contact between Mariam and anyone else on our vehicle,"" NCT added. A 17-year-old girl was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm and was released on conditional bail. Police said they were keeping an ""open mind"" about whether the attack on Miss Moustafa, which has sparked outrage in Egypt, was racially motivated. Her family says an incident in August involving the same attackers, which left Mariam hurt and her teenage sister with a broken leg, was not sufficiently acted upon by police. Egypt's embassy said those responsible should be ""brought to justice swiftly"". Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeted to say he had spoken with Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry about the investigation into Miss Moustafa's death. Allow Twitter content?

Mariam Moustafa, 18, was an engineering student at Nottingham College Talking about the alleged attack in August, Miss Moustafa's sister Mallak, 16, told The Times: ""No-one did anything. Something could've been done, and if the police did then she would still be here. ""I do think vital warnings were missed. The police should've done something after the first attack, but they did nothing. A complaint was filed and that was it."" In response to claims about the alleged incident in August, Nottinghamshire Police said it was confident an appropriate investigation had taken place. The force said it was ""reviewing the circumstances surrounding this to ensure this was the case"". Miss Moustafa's father, Hatim, 50, said: ""I want justice for my daughter, not just my daughter but also so this doesn't happen to another girl or another boy."" The results from a post-mortem examination to establish the cause of Miss Moustafa's death are awaited.

The Iraqi fantasist who wanted attention,"Ahmed Hassan had an interest in photography - this picture of his was shown to the jury A teenage Iraqi asylum seeker has been found guilty of attempted murder after planting a bomb that partially exploded on a Tube train at Parsons Green. Ahmed Hassan had been in the UK for almost two years when he left a homemade bomb on a busy District Line train in London during the morning rush hour. The 18-year-old, who had been living with foster parents in Sunbury, Surrey, had been studying media at college and had ambitions to become a wildlife photographer ""like David Attenborough"". Describing himself as very shy, he said he ""enjoyed being behind the camera rather than in front of the camera"". He was religious, a Sunni Muslim, and prayed five times a day. Hassan was considered a clever pupil at college, according to his teacher, and had been named student of the year just three months earlier, winning a gift card. But he used the gift card to buy five litres of hydrogen peroxide in order to make a bomb. He was bored, wanted attention and, the teenager said, it was part of his fantasy. Influenced by action films, he said he wanted to be chased as a fugitive - and not get caught. It was not his intention to cause an explosion on the Tube train, he said. He only wanted to cause a fire. But prosecutor Alison Morgan called him ""calculated and clever"", saying that it was a ""matter of luck"" that there had not been a full explosion that day. Ms Morgan said his actions were ""an act of anger and hatred designed to cause death and destruction of property"". Hassan blamed the UK for the death of his father in Iraq, she said, highlighting that he had previously told Home Office officials that he had been captured by the Islamic State group and was ""trained to kill"". But Hassan claimed this was a story he made up to improve his chances of staying in the UK and denied ever having contact with IS. He said he did not hold the UK responsible for his father's death, saying he expressed anger at Britain's involvement in Iraq so people would not see him as a coward. Hassan slept rough at the makeshift ""jungle"" camp in Calais in 2015, before arriving in the UK on the back of a lorry, aged 16 In court, with his head cast downwards, and speaking quietly, Hassan began his defence by describing his background and his journey from Iraq to the UK. He was born Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali in Baghdad in 1999. He had an older brother, Fallah, who is now about 25 and is still in Iraq. His parents died when he was younger, he said. He was too young when his mother died to remember her. His father, a taxi driver, died in an explosion in 2006, he said. ""He used to go to work and come back evenings, and then he did not come back. ""It was very difficult. I did not understand what was going on. I was in a state of confusion because of fighting, because of bombing."" Hassan was brought up by his uncle. He said he was about 12 years old when he began working part-time as a labourer, moving vegetables and other goods on the Iraq-Iran border. He left school at 15 to work full-time in the same job - 16 hours a day, seven days a week. ""I was bored in my job and I wanted a better life,"" he told the jury. He wanted to learn English and study, so he headed to Europe. Prosecutors said Hassan's actions were ""an act of anger and hatred"" The teenager said he travelled to Turkey and paid a smuggler to get him to Italy. He was picked up by the authorities there, but was released. He eventually ended up at the infamous makeshift migrant camp, the Jungle, in Calais, France. Then only 16, he stayed there for about two months before reaching the UK in the back of a lorry in October 2015. He was found by police near Gatwick Airport. He was taken to Bay Tree - a home in Horley, Surrey, run by the children's charity Barnardo's - which he said was a relief after the refugee camp. It was while he was at Bay Tree, in January 2016, that Hassan attended a Home Office immigration interview. During that interview Hassan claimed he had been recruited by the Islamic State group in Iraq and had been ""trained to kill"". Alarmed by what he said, Barnardo's staff alerted the police and the Home Office Prevent programme. A week later, an official from the local Surrey Prevent programme visited Bay Tree and told staff there was ""no cause for concern."" Staff were told to watch out for any unusual behaviour such as him hanging an IS ""black flag"" in his room. There is no record of any discussion between the Prevent official and Hassan himself. From there, he was moved to a hostel in Epsom. He said he was not happy and told the court he had ended up in hospital for a few days under suicide watch. Hassan started studying a media course at Brooklands College in Weybridge, Surrey, in May 2016, and he went on to complete the National Citizen Service programme. Kayte Cable, a lecturer and mentor of his, said he was in ""the worst state"" she had seen a student. She said he seemed ""incredibly conflicted, frightened, confused"". The jury was shown a picture of Hassan's bedroom door, with the word ""bored"" written over it a number of times Hassan went to live with foster parents, Penny and Ron Jones, in Surrey. He said: ""I never spoke to them. We never had a close relationship."" Sarah Anderson, the Chair of the Foster Carers Union, was contacted by Penny and Ron Jones soon after the incident at Parsons Green. She says the police raid on the Jones's home was a huge shock for the elderly couple, who have been foster carers for more than 40 years. ""They were really taken from the house very suddenly, I think the police were very nice to them, but it was absolutely shocking. She couldn't take her walking stick or her medicationâ¦ it was a most horrendous shock."" Ms Anderson, a foster carer herself, is sure that Ron and Penny Jones were never told about Hassan's claim to be a trained IS killer. ""I can honestly sayâ¦ I doubt there are any carers... knowing that information that would take those childrenâ¦ I would doubt very much that they knew that. Very much"" Hassan also ran a business selling mobile phones online, making about Â£100 a week. He said he had trouble sleeping over the summer of 2017, having bad dreams. The restless teenager said he would run to exhaust himself to help him fall asleep. But other times he would have five or six energy drinks a day to avoid sleep because of the nightmares. He would watch films and TV for hours, he said. One picture seen by the jury during the trial showed that Hassan had repeatedly written ""I am bored"" on his bedroom door. He said he had considered suicide ""many, many times"". The court heard how the device contained 2.2kg of shrapnel It was this boredom that was partly to blame for his actions, he told the jury. He apologised, said he regretted it and wished he could travel back in time. But prosecutor Ms Morgan called it ""a very calculated act of anger"". She said Hassan had packed the bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause ""maximum carnage"". He ""left nothing to chance"" in his planning, she said. When she asked why he had done it, he said: ""I had a fantasy in my head.... The fantasy was not about the explosive, it was about getting away from police."" He was asked why again. ""It was a fantasy. I was bored. I wanted attention."" But Ms Morgan told the jury: ""You can be sure it was not an act of attention-seeking or boredom. ""This was someone who wanted to cause death and damage and make good his escape."" CCTV of Parsons Green Tube bomb fireball.

Nato: Russia underestimates UK allies,"This video can not be played ""Our quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin,"" Boris Johnson says. Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""overwhelmingly likely"" to have ordered the nerve agent attack on an ex-spy and his daughter, Boris Johnson has said. The foreign secretary said ""our quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin, and with his decision"" over the Salisbury incident. Russia denies involvement and said the accusations against Mr Putin were ""shocking and unforgivable"". Meanwhile, the head of Nato told the BBC that Russia has underestimated the ""resolve and unity"" of the UK's allies. Speaking during a visit to a west London military museum with the Polish foreign minister, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin"". ""We think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK, on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the Second World War,"" he said. Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital, after they were found unconscious on a bench in the Wiltshire city on 4 March. The UK government says they were poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok, and PM Theresa May said she believed Moscow was ""culpable"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Mrs May has said the UKwill expel 23 Russian diplomatsas part of a ""full and robust"" response - prompting Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to say it will ""certainly"" expel British diplomats in response. Conspiracy theories and denial in Russia Why does UK think it was Russia? What are Novichok agents and what do they do? How is the UK retaliating against Russia? Russian spy attack: What we know so far UK Russia response going to plan so far Russia's investigative committee said it had opened a criminal case investigation into the ""attempted murder"" of Ms Skripal and ""the murder"" of Nikolai Glushkov, aRussian exile who was found deadin his home in London on Monday. According to Russian news agency Tass, the Russian ambassador to Britain, Alexander Yakovenko, said the UK claimed the nerve agent used was A-234, but this has not been confirmed. A Downing Street spokesman said the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has been invited to come to the UK to take a sample of the nerve agent - that process is expected to begin ""imminently"". By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The implication of the ambassador's comments is that the Russians have been told by the British the exact nerve agent deployed. So far, British officials have not confirmed that they have communicated this to Moscow or that A-234 was the exact agent deployed. Based on public sources, A-234 is one of the Novichok family of agents. It has been reported that it is at least five to eight and possibly 10 times as strong as VX. Little is known about it but the symptoms are very similar to those which eyewitnesses attributed to Sergei and Yulia Skripal. In military handbooks it is described as a ""delayed casualty agent"" - its persistence depends upon how it is used, as well as the weather. On Friday, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had ""no reason to doubt the findings and assessments by the British government"" which suggested Russian responsibility. He said the ""UK is not alone"" and Nato allies gave ""strong political support"" to Britain, followinga joint statement from the US, France and Germanybacking Mrs May's government and a pledge of support from Australia. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Stoltenberg said the incident was part of a ""pattern of reckless behaviour"" from Russia, following allegations of cyber attacks and election meddling in recent years. ""It is important that Russia gets a clear signal that it costs to behave the way they behave,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. This video can not be played The BBC's Gordon Corera considers how likely is it Russia poisoned Sergei Skripal and his daughter ""I'm absolutely certain that Russia has underestimated the resolve and unity of Nato allies when we have implemented different kinds of sanctions over the last years,"" Mr Stoltenberg added. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was not worried by international expressions of support for the UK and challenged Britain to ""provide some confirmation"". He said: ""Sooner or later, the British will have to show some proof to those 'colleagues' who say they are with UK on this; sooner or later will have to stand up its accusations."" Ahead of an EU leaders' summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said discussions of a potential boycott of the World Cup in Russia are ""not an immediate priority"". It comes as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written in the Guardianwarning against ""hasty judgements"", and not to ""rush ahead of the evidence"". Wiltshire Police said 131 people had been identified as potentially being exposed to the nerve agent - but none has shown any symptoms. Salisbury District Hospital has also assessed 46 people who came forward expressing health concerns but they were not admitted. In a letter to the Times, Salisbury NHS Trust emergency medical consultant Stephen Davies said only three people - the Skripals and Det Sgt Nick Bailey - had needed treatment. Det Sgt Bailey remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital after being contaminated with the chemical. Public Health England said the risk posed to the public remains low but theyrepeated their advice for anyone who had been to the Mill pub or Zizzito wash their clothes and possessions. A spokesperson said while it was clear a ""significant dose"" could have a ""serious immediate effect"", anyone in either venue ""could only have been exposed to extremely small traces"" and no further cases of illness have been reported. Defence secretary tells Russia: Shut up Laura Kuenssberg: Spy row stokes Labour foreign policy divisions Allies condemn nerve agent attack May visits Salisbury after 'brazen' attack Corbyn aide queries proof of Russian guilt Russia's ambassador to Britain Alexander Yakovenko claimed the UK had angled allegations against Russia to ""divert attention from Brexit"". He criticised the lack of transparency and said: ""Nobody saw even the pictures of these people in a hospital, whether they are alive or maybe they are in good health. Nobody talked to the doctors."" And Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had asked the UK to take action under the Chemical Weapons Convention. He also responded to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - whopreviously said Russia should ""go away"" and ""shut up""- saying: ""Maybe he lacks education."" Some 220 police officers from 16 forces, 80 ambulance staff, 50 fire officers, 200 armed forces personnel and 250 specialist officers have so far been deployed as part of the investigation, Wiltshire Police said. Police cordons remain in place in parts of Salisbury, 12 days on from the attack Zizzi restaurant, the Mill pub and the bench where the Skripals sat are among locations taped off by police On Thursday,Mrs May visited Salisburyto speak to emergency service workers, public health experts and local business owners who are affected by the police cordons. Wiltshire Council has announced measures to help affected businesses, including free park and ride journeys and waived business rates. Mr Skripalis a retired colonel in the Russian military intelligence service. He was jailed by Moscow in 2006 for secretly working for Britain's MI6 but was later released and allowed to come to the UK.

Banksy's protest art unveiled in New York,"Provocative artist Banksy has revealed a 20m high artwork in New York to draw attention to the imprisonment of Zehra Dogan, a Kurdish painter from Turkey. His image of her behind bars depicts the last bar as a pencil, and next to the mural is a call for her release. Dogan was jailed for two years and nine months last year in Turkey, for her painting of the Kurdish town Nusaybin. Her picture, copied from a newspaper photograph, showed the town reduced to rubble during conflict. The photograph was taken by government forces in the area where they had fought Kurdish militants. It features Turkish flags draped over destroyed buildings. Dogan posted her watercolour painting to social media and was subsequently arrested and sentenced. Banksy's mural, highlighting her first year in custody, has been painted on the historic Bowery Wall made famous by artist Keith Haring during the 80s. The image was created with another artist, known as Borf, who has served time in prison for his graffiti. Dogan has yet to hear about the mural, according to Banksy's publicist. The jailed artist is said to share a cell with 40 inmates, receiving only periodic visits. An image of her painting was projected above the artwork on the evening of 15 March.

Blackberry modified to 'help drug cartels'Five people arrested accused of running a secure smartphone company designed solely to aid criminal organisations.9h9 hours agoTechnology,"The chief executive of a company that created highly-secure smartphones allegedly used by some of the world's most notorious criminals has been indicted. Canadian-based Phantom Secure made ""tens of millions of dollars"" selling the modified Blackberry devices for use by the likes of the Sinaloa Cartel, investigators said. The charges marked the first time US authorities have targeted a company for knowingly making encrypted technology for criminals. The Department of Justice arrested Vincent Ramos in Seattle last week. He was indicted on Thursday along with four associates. The BBC has been unable to reach Phantom Secure. They are charged with racketeering and conspiracy to aid the distribution of drugs. Both crimes have a maximum penalty of life in prison. Mr Ramos is the only one of the group currently in custody. ""This organisation Phantom Secure was designed to facilitate international drug trafficking all throughout the entire world,"" US attorney Adam Braverman told the BBC. ""These traffickers, including members of the Sinaloa Cartel, would use these fully-encrypted devices to facilitate their drug trafficking activities in order to avoid law enforcement scrutiny."" Blackberry did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday - and investigators would not say whether the firm had worked with them on this case. Mr Braverman said Blackberry was not alone in having its handsets altered for illegal purposes. Facebook bans Britain First pages Stephen Hawking: A life in pictures United Airlines responsible for dog death ""Our understanding is there are a handful of other organisations that exist like this. The FBI, and our office, will continue investigating not only Phantom Secure but any other company that provides this kind of communication device to criminal organisations."" He added that while almost every smartphone on the market offers hard-to-crack encryption - as well as apps from Facebook, Google and Apple - Phantom Secure should be held culpable for what the users of its services were doing. ""The difference is this company was specifically-designed to aid international drug trafficking organisations,"" he said. ""The only way that you're able to actually utilize one of these devices and obtain one of these devices is if somebody else vouched for you."" Phantom Secure sold devices on a subscription basis at a cost of $2,000-$3,000 for around six months of use. In order to become a customer, an existing user must vouch for the new person. That system, authorities said, was a way of preventing law enforcement from getting hold of the devices. Agents estimated as many as 20,000 Phantom Secure-modified handsets are in use around the world. Communications through the phones are automatically routed to servers in Panama and Hong Kong, according to court documents, making data more difficult to trace. Phantom Secure could also remove key functionality from the devices to lock them down, such as voice communication, microphone, GPS, camera, internet and messaging apps, leaving just the text functionality. Law enforcement authorities have repeatedly been frustrated by encryption technology making it harder to access communications between suspects. In 2016, Apple refused to provide a tool that would allow the FBI to unlock an iPhone belonging to Syed Farook, a man involved in a mass shooting that resulted in the death of 14 people. On Thursday, a spokesman for the FBI reiterated the agency's concern about criminals being able to ""go dark"" and hide behind these sophisticated technologies. Privacy and open rights activists argue that removing or just weakening encryption would put everyone at risk of data theft and surveillance - not just criminals.

"No Dover checks after Brexit - GraylingTalk of long queues is unfounded, transport secretary says, as goods will continue to flow seamlessly.16m17 minutes agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Chris Grayling: No post-Brexit lorry checks at Dover Theresa May has been accused of planning to ""throw open"" Britain's borders after Brexit, by a cross-party group of pro-European MPs. It comes after Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said there won't be any border checks at Dover when Britain leaves the EU in March next year. He said it would be ""utterly unrealistic"" to have checks and trade would be managed electronically. The Open Britain group has written to the PM to demand clarification. In their letter, the Labour, Lib Dem and Green MPs, who campaign against a ""hard Brexit"", say: ""It is extraordinary that a government that says it aims to 'take back control' now admits it is not even going to try to control the transfer of goods across our borders, in the event we leave the customs union. ""This has major implications for our businesses, our infrastructure and our trade."" Brexit border checks 'may triple queues' HMRC 'needs Â£7.3m' to avoid customs delays Such a plan would not avoid a hard border ""because the EU would have to enforce checks on goods entering its common market"", the MPs say. And, in the event of no trade deal being reached with the EU, ""it would be in breach of WTO rules to apply no tariffs on EU goods whilst continuing to apply tariffs on goods from outside the EU"". The MPs also call for the government to make its post-Brexit border plans public afterSky News reported,externalthat companies have been asked to sign non-disclosure agreements about briefings on the impact on freight traffic if there is no Brexit agreement as well as other possible scenarios. The Department for Exiting the EU said while a trade deal was ""by far and away the highest probability"", it made sense to prepare for all possible outcomes. More than 2.5 million lorries passed through Dover in 2017 The UK currently has a free-flowing border in Kent where lorries travelling within the EU do not complete customs declarations and passport checks are minimal. Researchers estimate it takes an average of about two minutes for each vehicle at Dover to be processed. There have been warnings that if additional customs checks are imposed after the UK leaves on 29 March 2019, it will add about 10 miles to the queues at peak times for every additional minute's worth of checks. A study by Imperial College London earlier this week found that two extra minutes of checks on vehicles could more than triple the existing queues, potentially leading to motorway tailbacks up to 29 miles long. But Mr Grayling told BBC One's Question Time it was ""absolutely clear"" that this ""cannot happen"". ""We will maintain a free flowing border at Dover - we will not impose checks in the port. We don't check lorries now - we're not going to be checking lorries in Dover in the future. ""The only reason we would have queues at the border is if we put in place restrictions that created those queues - we are not going to do that."" The government has said leaving the EU will allow the UK to take back control of its borders. MPs warn of Brexit customs 'catastrophe' 'Inland' customs checks after Brexit The UK is set to the leave the customs union, but ministers are hoping to negotiate a new customs partnership with the EU as part of a transition arrangement likely to last about two years after the UK's official exit from the union next March. Mr Grayling said goods moved seamlessly across national borders elsewhere in the world and there was no reason this would not happen after Brexit. ""Go to our ports on the east coast that take goods from outside the European Union where goods... depart pretty much as soon as they arrive. That is what is going to happen. ""We will manage trade electronically. Trucks will move through the border without stopping. We will manage them electronically. In the way it happens between Canada and the US."" Labour said a new customs union with the EU was the only way to avoid ""gridlock"" at British ports. ""Chris Grayling let the cat out of the bag by exposing how unprepared the government are for leaving the EU,"" said shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald. ""The government said leaving the EU is about regaining control of our borders but the transport secretary's plan would achieve the exact opposite."" He warned of chaos unless the UK was able to negotiate a new arrangement replicating all the benefits of the existing customs union, which removes tariffs and other trade barriers between its members. Under the terms of the Le Touquet agreement, in which juxtaposed border and immigration controls are in force on either side of the Channel, France has the power to carry out checks on outbound vehicles at Dover. When France increased security checks in the summer of 2016, in the wake of a series of terror attacks in the country, it led to days of lengthy queues on the roads approaching the port as staff shortages meant checks on passenger coaches were taking 40 minutes.

"At least six dead in US bridge collapseMultiple cars are crushed under the concrete, and the operation is moving from rescue to recovery.1han hour agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played Miami rescue workers search for survivors At least six people have been killed and nine others hurt after a footbridge collapsed near Florida International University in Miami. Police announced the deaths after rescuers spent the night searching for victims trapped beneath the structure. The 862-tonne, 174ft (53m) bridge fell over an eight-lane street on Thursday afternoon, crushing at least eight vehicles, police said. The bridge was erected on Saturday in just six hours. It was built using a method called ""accelerated bridge construction"" to avoid traffic disruption. A major section of the bridge was assembled on the side of the road and then raised into place. Announcing the deaths early on Friday, Miami-Dade police spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta said the operation was now moving from rescue to recovery. Workers at the site were having to take extreme care because of the possibility of finding more victims and for their own safety. At one point during the operation, police ordered TV helicopters to leave the area so rescue teams could hear for any sounds of people calling for help under the wreckage, CBS Miami television reported. FIU students are currently on their spring break until 17 March. They told local media that vehicles were stopped at a traffic light when the structure collapsed at about 13:30 local time (17:30 GMT). This video can not be played Florida officials: We found eight trapped cars and multiple fatalities One witness told ABC News,externalthat the screams coming from the cars were ""terrifying"". ""As soon as I looked outside, I saw dust flying everywhere,"" Tiona Page said. ""I knew the bridge had collapsed."" Another witness, Damany Reed, told CBS News: ""I heard a big kaboom... it sounded continuous. We look outside... we thought something had fallen but it was the bridge that collapsed. It was just surreal at that moment and pretty scary."" This video can not be played Miami bridge collapse witness: 'This is crazy' ""I saw there were multiple cars crushed under the bridge. It was just terrible,"" Jacob Miller, an FIU student, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.

""There will clearly be an investigation to find out exactly what happened and why this happened,"" Gov Scott said. ""But the most important thing we can do right now is pray for the individuals that ended up in the hospital for their full recovery. Pray for the family members that have lost loved ones,"" he said. ""Just last week we were celebrating the expanse being completed and now we are here dealing with a tragedy,"" Sweetwater Mayor Orlando Lopez said.

Corbyn: Avoid hasty spy case judgements,"This video can not be played Corbyn: Evidence points towards Russia Jeremy Corbyn's warning not to ""rush ahead of the evidence"" over the nerve agent attack has ""muddied the waters"", a Labour MP has said. The UK government says the Russian state is responsible for the poisoning of a former spy and his daughter. Mr Corbyn has condemned the attack but says the involvement of Russian ""mafia-like groups"" can not be ruled out. More than 30 Labour MPs have signeda motion,externalwhich ""unequivocally"" accepts the Russian state's ""culpability"". Pienaar: UK Russia response going to plan so far Russia 'underestimates UK allies' - Nato Why does UK think it was Russia? On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May told the Commons that Russia was ""culpable"" for the attack and that she was expelling 23 Russian diplomats - but Moscow has denied all involvement. On Thursday, amid calls for him to be firmer in his condemnation of Russia, Mr Corbynsaid the ""evidence points towards Russia on this"". But later inan article for the Guardian newspaper,external, he drew a link with the build-up to the war in Iraq and warned that ""clear thinking in an international crisis"" could be ""overwhelmed by emotion and hasty judgement"". Labour backbencher Stephen Kinnock told the BBC Mr Corbyn's first statement, on Thursday, was ""a step in right direction"" but added: ""I think the article he wrote after that then muddied the waters somewhat. ""I think what we need is a very clear line from our leadership stating very clearly that we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies and with the government in the action it's taken."" Labour MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Two's Newsnight that ""clearly it looks like the evidence points to Russia"", but said the UK needs to ""make sure we get our facts right"" before ""leaping into action"". He said his leader's approach was ""not about being nice to Russia"" but about taking ""a statesman-like approach"". And he dismissed those criticising Mr Corbyn's stance as ""a tiny minority of irrelevant malcontents"" who are ""fighting a proxy war"" to undermine the party leader. Allies condemn nerve agent attack Russian spy attack: What we know so far Russian former spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital, 11 days after they were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire. An Early Day Motion, sponsored by Labour backbencher John Woodcock, who has criticised Mr Corbyn's leadership of the party in the past, states that the signatories ""fully support the statement made by the prime minister on 14 March 2018 in response to Russia's illegal attack on the UK"". Whether there is specific direct proof that there was Russian state involvement in the attack or not, the majority of MPs in the House of Commons agree that there is enough evidence and a pattern of behaviour that make this an appropriate moment to take some diplomatic moves against the Putin regime. While not opposing those specific actions, Mr Corbyn's tone and reaction to those moves have cracked open Labour's political truce. His comments have stoked worries about the leader's foreign policy views that have been one of the sources of division in the Labour Party since he became its top pick. Read more from Laura In his Guardian article, Mr Corbyn wrote that he agrees with the expulsion of the diplomats and describes the use of a military-grade nerve agent as ""barbaric and beyond reckless"". But he says that although the evidence points to Russia - the public deserve ""calm heads and a measured response"" from the government. ""To rush way ahead of the evidence being gathered by the police, in a fevered parliamentary atmosphere, serves neither justice nor our national security,"" he writes. Mr Corbyn says if Moscow is not to blame ""a connection to Russian mafia-like groups"" cannot be excluded. He said Russian authorities should be ""held to account on the basis of evidence"", adding: ""But let us not manufacture a division over Russia where none exists."" Others in his shadow cabinet have been more explicit in blaming the Russian state. Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith said the party accepted that ""Russia is responsible"" while Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberryis reported to have said,externalthere was ""prima facie evidence"" against the Russian government, which ""must face the consequences"". Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""the right conclusion"" for the prime minister to determine that there was ""no alternative explanation other than that responsibility lies with Russia"". He said it was an ""attack on our sovereignty"" and, referencing the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London, in which he acted as a lawyer to bring a case against Russia: ""This is not the first time and it needs to be called out with no ifs and no buts.""

Russia 'underestimates UK allies' - Nato,"This video can not be played ""Our quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin,"" Boris Johnson says. Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""overwhelmingly likely"" to have ordered the nerve agent attack on an ex-spy and his daughter, Boris Johnson has said. The foreign secretary said ""our quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin, and with his decision"" over the Salisbury incident. Russia denies involvement and said the accusations against Mr Putin were ""shocking and unforgivable"". Meanwhile, the head of Nato told the BBC that Russia has underestimated the ""resolve and unity"" of the UK's allies. Speaking during a visit to a west London military museum with the Polish foreign minister, Mr Johnson said the UK's ""quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin"". ""We think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK, on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the Second World War,"" he said. Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital, after they were found unconscious on a bench in the Wiltshire city on 4 March. The UK government says they were poisoned with a nerve agent of a type developed by Russia called Novichok, and PM Theresa May said she believed Moscow was ""culpable"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Mrs May has said the UKwill expel 23 Russian diplomatsas part of a ""full and robust"" response - prompting Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to say it will ""certainly"" expel British diplomats in response. Conspiracy theories and denial in Russia Why does UK think it was Russia? What are Novichok agents and what do they do? How is the UK retaliating against Russia? Russian spy attack: What we know so far UK Russia response going to plan so far Russia's investigative committee said it had opened a criminal case investigation into the ""attempted murder"" of Ms Skripal and ""the murder"" of Nikolai Glushkov, aRussian exile who was found deadin his home in London on Monday. According to Russian news agency Tass, the Russian ambassador to Britain, Alexander Yakovenko, said the UK claimed the nerve agent used was A-234, but this has not been confirmed. A Downing Street spokesman said the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has been invited to come to the UK to take a sample of the nerve agent - that process is expected to begin ""imminently"". By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The implication of the ambassador's comments is that the Russians have been told by the British the exact nerve agent deployed. So far, British officials have not confirmed that they have communicated this to Moscow or that A-234 was the exact agent deployed. Based on public sources, A-234 is one of the Novichok family of agents. It has been reported that it is at least five to eight and possibly 10 times as strong as VX. Little is known about it but the symptoms are very similar to those which eyewitnesses attributed to Sergei and Yulia Skripal. In military handbooks it is described as a ""delayed casualty agent"" - its persistence depends upon how it is used, as well as the weather. On Friday, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had ""no reason to doubt the findings and assessments by the British government"" which suggested Russian responsibility. He said the ""UK is not alone"" and Nato allies gave ""strong political support"" to Britain, followinga joint statement from the US, France and Germanybacking Mrs May's government and a pledge of support from Australia. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Stoltenberg said the incident was part of a ""pattern of reckless behaviour"" from Russia, following allegations of cyber attacks and election meddling in recent years. ""It is important that Russia gets a clear signal that it costs to behave the way they behave,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. This video can not be played The BBC's Gordon Corera considers how likely is it Russia poisoned Sergei Skripal and his daughter ""I'm absolutely certain that Russia has underestimated the resolve and unity of Nato allies when we have implemented different kinds of sanctions over the last years,"" Mr Stoltenberg added. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was not worried by international expressions of support for the UK and challenged Britain to ""provide some confirmation"". He said: ""Sooner or later, the British will have to show some proof to those 'colleagues' who say they are with UK on this; sooner or later will have to stand up its accusations."" Ahead of an EU leaders' summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said discussions of a potential boycott of the World Cup in Russia are ""not an immediate priority"". It comes as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written in the Guardianwarning against ""hasty judgements"", and not to ""rush ahead of the evidence"". Wiltshire Police said 131 people had been identified as potentially being exposed to the nerve agent - but none has shown any symptoms. Salisbury District Hospital has also assessed 46 people who came forward expressing health concerns but they were not admitted. In a letter to the Times, Salisbury NHS Trust emergency medical consultant Stephen Davies said only three people - the Skripals and Det Sgt Nick Bailey - had needed treatment. Det Sgt Bailey remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital after being contaminated with the chemical. Public Health England said the risk posed to the public remains low but theyrepeated their advice for anyone who had been to the Mill pub or Zizzito wash their clothes and possessions. A spokesperson said while it was clear a ""significant dose"" could have a ""serious immediate effect"", anyone in either venue ""could only have been exposed to extremely small traces"" and no further cases of illness have been reported. Defence secretary tells Russia: Shut up Laura Kuenssberg: Spy row stokes Labour foreign policy divisions Allies condemn nerve agent attack May visits Salisbury after 'brazen' attack Corbyn aide queries proof of Russian guilt Russia's ambassador to Britain Alexander Yakovenko claimed the UK had angled allegations against Russia to ""divert attention from Brexit"". He criticised the lack of transparency and said: ""Nobody saw even the pictures of these people in a hospital, whether they are alive or maybe they are in good health. Nobody talked to the doctors."" And Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had asked the UK to take action under the Chemical Weapons Convention. He also responded to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - whopreviously said Russia should ""go away"" and ""shut up""- saying: ""Maybe he lacks education."" Some 220 police officers from 16 forces, 80 ambulance staff, 50 fire officers, 200 armed forces personnel and 250 specialist officers have so far been deployed as part of the investigation, Wiltshire Police said. Police cordons remain in place in parts of Salisbury, 12 days on from the attack Zizzi restaurant, the Mill pub and the bench where the Skripals sat are among locations taped off by police On Thursday,Mrs May visited Salisburyto speak to emergency service workers, public health experts and local business owners who are affected by the police cordons. Wiltshire Council has announced measures to help affected businesses, including free park and ride journeys and waived business rates. Mr Skripalis a retired colonel in the Russian military intelligence service. He was jailed by Moscow in 2006 for secretly working for Britain's MI6 but was later released and allowed to come to the UK.

How is the UK retaliating against Russia?,"UK Prime Minister Theresa May has announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats in retaliation for the attack on a former spy and his daughter who were poisoned on British soil with a military-grade nerve agent. ""There is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable,"" Mrs May told Parliament, calling it ""an unlawful use of force"". Russia has denied involvement in the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, on 4 March. The 23 diplomats identified as ""undeclared intelligence officers"" were given one week to leave, in the largest mass expulsion in the UK in more than 30 years. The Russian embassy said the decision was ""unacceptable, unjustified and short-sighted"". Other measures included: Increased checks on private flights, customs and freight The freezing of Russian state assets where there is evidence they may be used to threaten the life or property of UK nationals or residents Ministers and Royal Family members to boycott the World Cup in Russia later this year The suspension of all planned high level bilateral contacts between the UK and Russia Plans to consider new laws to increase defences against ""hostile state activity"". This could come through a British version of the 2012 US Magnitsky act, which punishes Russians involved in corruption and human rights violations with asset freezes and travel bans. MPs have pushed for a Magnitsky amendment to be added to the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill going through Parliament Take some sort of action to bar wealthy Russian oligarchs from accessing their mansions and other luxuries in London, as suggested by Tory MP and House of Commons foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat. One way this could happen is through the use of Unexplained Wealth Orders, which allow government officials to seize assets including property until they have been properly accounted for Taking Russian broadcasters such as RT (formerly Russia Today) off the air.

Current sanctions on Russia that Britain supports,externalare imposed via the European Union, and target Russia's state finances, energy and arms sectors. They were first passed after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and backed rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine, and include: The exclusion of state banks from raising long-term loans in the EU A ban on exports of dual-use equipment that could be put to military use and a ban on EU-Russia arms deals A ban on exports of a wide range of oil industry technology Asset freezes and travel bans on 150 people and 38 companies This video can not be played Vladimir Putin is challenged by the BBC over the Skripal poisoning EU countries are already divided on the sanctions and some doubt whether Britain could convince the bloc to further toughen its measures, especially as it prepares to leave the union. The bloc will discuss the issue in a meeting next week, European Council President Donald Tusk said, calling it a ""brutal attack inspired most likely by Moscow"". More on EU sanctions Oligarchs in UK told to explain wealth By framing the poisoning as a possible ""unlawful use of force"" by Russia, Theresa May prompted questions as to whether this could be a matter for Nato, the military alliance of 29 countries. The alliance's policy of collective defence - under Article 5 - states that an attack on any one ally is seen as an attack on all. It was invoked for the first and only time by the United States after the 9/11 attacks. This video can not be played Theresa May: Spy poisoned by ""military-grade nerve agent"" But Downing Street has played down suggestions that this is an Article 5 matter. For its part, Nato urged Russia to answer the UK's questions, expressing ""deep concern"" over the ""first offensive use of a nerve agent on alliance territory"" since its foundation. Sergei Skripal - the spy at centre of poison mystery What are Novichok nerve agents? The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting at the UK's request,where British deputy ambassador Jonathan Allen said Russia had used ""a weapon so horrific that it is banned in war"". At the meeting US Ambassador Nikki Haley said: ""The credibility of this council will not survive if we fail to hold Russia accountable."" And US President Donald Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has accused Russia of undermining the security of countries worldwide. Mrs May has had phone discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron, and a statement from the country's embassy said ""there is no other plausible explanation"" than Russian involvement. It added France expressed ""solidarity regarding its ally"". Police guard the Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury where traces of the nerve agent were found The UK has asked Russia to provide a ""full and complete disclosure"" of the Novichok nerve agent programme to an international agency, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

Mass exodus from twin offensives in Syria,"This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta evacuees are staying at a school under government control More than 60,000 people have fled two separate offensives in Syria in recent days, the UN says. Up to 16,000 people have fled Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, where Russian air strikes are supporting Syrian government attempts to retake the area. Nearly 50,000 fled the northern town of Afrin, where Turkey is fighting a US-backed Kurdish militia that it considers a terrorist group. Dozens of people were killed in air strikes on Friday, activists said. Seven years of civil war have driven nearly 12 million Syrians from their homes: At least6.1 millionare internally displaced Another5.6 millionhave fled abroad More than400,000are believed to have been killed or are missing, presumed dead On Friday, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations said the estimates of those who fled the rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta could be more than twice as high as reported, with up to 40,000 leaving on Thursday alone. The number could not be verified. Why is there a war in Syria? Russian air strikes killed 80 people including 14 children on Friday in the Eastern Ghouta towns of Kafr Batna, Saqba and Harasta, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. Despite international calls for a ceasefire, there has been no let-up in the offensive and the Syrian army is now pushing into densely populated areas, backed by Russian air support. Residents have told BBC News there has been intense street fighting between rebels and government soldiers in some parts of the enclave. Humanitarian corridors controlled by the Syrian government reportedly allowed about 4,000 more people to leave the enclave on Friday despite the fighting. The UN children's agency Unicef is sending representatives to assess the needs of evacuees in temporary shelters in Damascus. A Unicef spokeswoman said its current response plan could deal with up to 50,000 people. This video can not be played Seven-year-old Rouaa has lived most of her life in a refugee camp Pro-government forces are believed to have recaptured 70% of the region after three weeks of intense fighting against rebels there. The crushing of the rebel enclave outside Damascus would be a major victory for President Assad. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Falling hair and eating inedible plants to survive Afrin, a town populated mainly by ethnic Kurds near the Turkish border, has been under bombardment from the air and the ground by Turkish forces and their local Syrian allies. Turkish bombing reportedly killed at least 43 people on Friday, including seven children and at least 16 people who died in an air strike on the town's main hospital, the Syrian Observatory said. ""It was the only functioning hospital in Afrin city,"" a Kurdish Red Crescent official told the AFP news agency. An estimated 48,000 people have fled the city and nearby villages, according to Linda Tom, a UN humanitarian spokeswoman in Syria. They headed towards villages held by Syrian government forces. Turkey is targeting the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), a militia that it regards as an extension of the Kurdish forces on its own territory - a banned group that Turkey considers a terrorist organisation. But Kurdish fighters in Syria have been a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State group, and have received support from the United States to that end. This video can not be played Afrin: What is going on in Syria's other battle? Brusk Hasakeh, a YPG spokesman, told Reuters news agency that Turkish forces and their Syrian militia allies were trying to storm Afrin from the north but the YPG andits women's affiliate, the YPJ, were fighting back. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told a gathering in Ankara that his country would not stop until its mission to capture Afrin had been completed. While Turkey is opposed to President Assad, Russia and Iran are the Syrian leader's closest allies. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sought to portray the talks in Kazakhstan as an opportunity to bring lasting peace to Syria, saying ""millions of Syrians are looking in the direction of Astana"". Referring to the Eastern Ghouta, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the bombing of civilians was unacceptable.

Blackberry modified to 'help drug cartels',"The chief executive of a company that created highly-secure smartphones allegedly used by some of the world's most notorious criminals has been indicted. Canadian-based Phantom Secure made ""tens of millions of dollars"" selling the modified Blackberry devices for use by the likes of the Sinaloa Cartel, investigators said. The charges marked the first time US authorities have targeted a company for knowingly making encrypted technology for criminals. The Department of Justice arrested Vincent Ramos in Seattle last week. He was indicted on Thursday along with four associates. The BBC has been unable to reach Phantom Secure. They are charged with racketeering and conspiracy to aid the distribution of drugs. Both crimes have a maximum penalty of life in prison. Mr Ramos is the only one of the group currently in custody. ""This organisation Phantom Secure was designed to facilitate international drug trafficking all throughout the entire world,"" US attorney Adam Braverman told the BBC. ""These traffickers, including members of the Sinaloa Cartel, would use these fully-encrypted devices to facilitate their drug trafficking activities in order to avoid law enforcement scrutiny."" Blackberry did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday - and investigators would not say whether the firm had worked with them on this case. Mr Braverman said Blackberry was not alone in having its handsets altered for illegal purposes.

The FBI, and our office, will continue investigating not only Phantom Secure but any other company that provides this kind of communication device to criminal organisations."" He added that while almost every smartphone on the market offers hard-to-crack encryption - as well as apps from Facebook, Google and Apple - Phantom Secure should be held culpable for what the users of its services were doing. ""The difference is this company was specifically-designed to aid international drug trafficking organisations,"" he said. ""The only way that you're able to actually utilize one of these devices and obtain one of these devices is if somebody else vouched for you."" Phantom Secure sold devices on a subscription basis at a cost of $2,000-$3,000 for around six months of use. In order to become a customer, an existing user must vouch for the new person. That system, authorities said, was a way of preventing law enforcement from getting hold of the devices. Agents estimated as many as 20,000 Phantom Secure-modified handsets are in use around the world. Communications through the phones are automatically routed to servers in Panama and Hong Kong, according to court documents, making data more difficult to trace. Phantom Secure could also remove key functionality from the devices to lock them down, such as voice communication, microphone, GPS, camera, internet and messaging apps, leaving just the text functionality. Law enforcement authorities have repeatedly been frustrated by encryption technology making it harder to access communications between suspects. In 2016, Apple refused to provide a tool that would allow the FBI to unlock an iPhone belonging to Syed Farook, a man involved in a mass shooting that resulted in the death of 14 people. On Thursday, a spokesman for the FBI reiterated the agency's concern about criminals being able to ""go dark"" and hide behind these sophisticated technologies. Privacy and open rights activists argue that removing or just weakening encryption would put everyone at risk of data theft and surveillance - not just criminals.

At least four dead in US bridge collapse,"This video can not be played Miami rescue workers search for survivors At least six people have been killed and nine others hurt after a footbridge collapsed near Florida International University in Miami. Police announced the deaths after rescuers spent the night searching for victims trapped beneath the structure. The 862-tonne, 174ft (53m) bridge fell over an eight-lane street on Thursday afternoon, crushing at least eight vehicles, police said. The bridge was erected on Saturday in just six hours. It was built using a method called ""accelerated bridge construction"" to avoid traffic disruption. A major section of the bridge was assembled on the side of the road and then raised into place. Announcing the deaths early on Friday, Miami-Dade police spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta said the operation was now moving from rescue to recovery. Workers at the site were having to take extreme care because of the possibility of finding more victims and for their own safety. At one point during the operation, police ordered TV helicopters to leave the area so rescue teams could hear for any sounds of people calling for help under the wreckage, CBS Miami television reported. FIU students are currently on their spring break until 17 March. They told local media that vehicles were stopped at a traffic light when the structure collapsed at about 13:30 local time (17:30 GMT). This video can not be played Florida officials: We found eight trapped cars and multiple fatalities One witness told ABC News,externalthat the screams coming from the cars were ""terrifying"". ""As soon as I looked outside, I saw dust flying everywhere,"" Tiona Page said. ""I knew the bridge had collapsed."" Another witness, Damany Reed, told CBS News: ""I heard a big kaboom... it sounded continuous. We look outside... we thought something had fallen but it was the bridge that collapsed. It was just surreal at that moment and pretty scary."" This video can not be played Miami bridge collapse witness: 'This is crazy' ""I saw there were multiple cars crushed under the bridge. It was just terrible,"" Jacob Miller, an FIU student, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday night he was monitoring ""the heartbreaking bridge collapse"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Florida Governor Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio were at the scene on Thursday night, along with a team of specialists from the National Transportation Safety Board. ""There will clearly be an investigation to find out exactly what happened and why this happened,"" Gov Scott said. ""But the most important thing we can do right now is pray for the individuals that ended up in the hospital for their full recovery. Pray for the family members that have lost loved ones,"" he said.

'More Telford victims coming forward',"This video can not be played Lucy Allan MP says 'many young girls' have come to her to share their experiences. More child grooming victims in Telford have come forward in the wake of reports about the scandal, its MP said. Conservative Lucy Allan said she had been ""inundated"" with reports since speaking about the issue in Parliament. West Mercia Police said it was currently working with about 46 people who were victims or at risk. The police and crime commissioner (PCC) has ""sought clarification"" on reports a 2013 force memo said some child sexual abuse victims had ""consented"". The Sunday Mirror reported that up to 1,000 girls in the Shropshire town could have been victims of child sexual exploitation (CSE) since the 1980s. 'It's not the responsibility of a child to stay safe' Midlands Live: Sink hole causes canal collapse; Dying junior football coach pens 'enjoy life' letter The wording of the memo has beencriticised in the Mirror,externalfor appearing to blame victims and PCC John Campion said he thought it was a ""poor choice of words"". Since her speech in Parliament, Ms Allan told the BBC she had been ""inundated with emails saying, 'This has happened to me'"". She said: ""I have also spoken to a consultant psychiatrist who has had many patients who have experienced this issue and are dealing with the mental health consequences of this terrible crime. ""It is clear this has been going on for many years and a significant number of girls have been affected."" Telford abuse team cases 'near doubled' Telford chief disputes abuse scale reports White working class girls 'traded for sex' On Thursday it emerged members of Telford's Cate (Children Abused Through Exploitation) team, whicha 2016 council report said were overworked and under-resourced, had raised concerns in preceding months about the lack of time they were able to spend on high-risk cases. Meanwhile, children's charity the NSPCC said demand for its services had risen in the past year. It delivered 3,122 counselling sessions about CSE via its Childline service in 2016/17, compared with 2,340 in 2015/16 - a 33% increase. Barnardo's said it had been working in Shropshire since last October to provide counselling sessions to young people who are ""at high risk of sexual exploitation"". A spokesman for Telford and Wrekin Council said it had not received any new reports of CSE Chief executive Javed Khan said: ""The scale of the abuse in Telford is deeply shocking and those responsible must be held accountable for any failings uncovered. ""Our specialist services see every day the damage caused by these horrific crimes."" A spokesman for Telford and Wrekin Council said it had not received any new reports of CSE but added the council was not the only route for victims who might want to contact the authorities. Ms Allan has raised an Early Day Motion in Parliament to call on the council to commission aRotherham-styleindependent inquiry into the situation. The council says it wants the government to commission the report rather than itself because its ""independence and scope could be called into question"". Some of the cases also pre-date the local authority, which was formed in 1998. The Home Office has said the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse will be looking at Telford in itsinvestigation into child sexual exploitation,external, but it is down to local authorities to decide whether a further review is necessary. West Mercia Police Supt Tom Harding, who is in overall charge of policing in Telford, said police and authorities in the town were working with ""approximately 46 young people"" who were victims of CSE or considered ""at risk"". He added: ""Therefore, I significantly dispute the 1,000-plus figure, and do feel it is sensationalised. ""Read the headlines, read the reports. What are they actually discussing? They're discussing cases from 20 or 30 years ago, offending back in the 1990s."" Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali Seven men were jailed in 2012 as part of West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice, including brothers Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali. The force said more than 100 girls could have been targeted by the gang between 2007 and 2009. Many of the seven men worked for or had connections with fast food restaurants across Telford. Update 16 March 2018: An earlier version of this story referred to the Cate team receiving 2,000 calls for assistance in the past two years.

'It's not the responsibility of a child to stay safe',"Grooming, rape, trafficking, or the many other ways children are being sexually abused, the subject of child sexual exploitation - or CSE as it is known by professionals in the field - is in the headlines with depressing regularity. Telford is currently in the spotlight - but is by no means the first place and will not be the last. There were so many opportunities - in Rotherham, in Rochdale, in Oxford - to step in and help. No-one did. The exploitation continued. Not only did the cycle of abuse grind on, but the message given to the victims must have been that ""we don't care about you"". One 13-year-old girl, ""with disrupted clothing"", was found by police in a house in the early hours with a group of men who had given her vodka. A neighbour had called the police after hearing the girl scream. The teenager was arrested for being drunk and disorderly. The men were not questioned. A 12-year-old girl was found, being plied with alcohol, in a car with a 22-year-old man. He had indecent images of her on his phone. No action was taken. Rather than being offered protection, teenagers groomed and coerced into having sexfaced criminal charges of prostitution. A major factor was the public - and professional - perception of the abused girls, who were often dismissed as troublemakers. As the Children's Society 1995Game's Up report,externalasked: ""Is it acceptable that a child abused at home is protected, whereas a child abused on the street is criminalised?"" Lucy Lowe was 16 and pregnant with her second child when she was murdered And the media unwittingly helped to obscure the scale of the abuse, referring to children as the ""girlfriends"" of adult men. When in 2001, Lucy Lowe was murdered in Telford - along with her mother and sister - by the 26-year-old man who had groomed and abused her, news outlets - including the BBC -described the adult killer as Lucy's ""boyfriend"",external. She was 16 and pregnant with her second child by Azhar Ali Mehmood, who set fire to the Lowe family home. The infant, who had been in the house, was later found wrapped in a blanket in the garden. In court, the prosecution barrister Adrian Redgrave QC said: ""There had also been occasions when he had been, in one way or another, humiliated in front of others by things that Lucy had said or done. He was jealous and possessive."" The court heard they had a ""stormy relationship and argued frequently, sometimes about her relationships with other men"". It makes for difficult reading. At no point is a suggestion made that this was not a ""relationship"" and that Lucy was a victim of rape. Targeted by Mehmood aged 12 and giving birth to her first child at 14, she was legally incapable of consent. It was later to emerge that Lucy's situation was far from unusual. Operation Chalice, launched by West Mercia Police, led to the jailing of a group of Asian men, mostly of Pakistani origin, whom police said may have targeted more than 100 girls. Telford grooming gangs 'tip of iceberg' Why Three Girls is one of TV's toughest watches White working class girls 'traded for sex' ""Even five years ago, people were talking about the 'lifestyle choices' these young people were making,"" says Adele Gladman, the Home Office researcher whoreported the scale of abuse in Rotherham. As recently as 2012, when 24-year-old Ahdel Ali was convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl and jailed for 18 years, his barrister asked the judge to be lenient because ""this type of rape is not like other horrible types of rapes"". It now seems astonishing, but lawyer Tayyab Khan stood up in court and said the child ""had loved"" Ali, who had been ""pleasant to her"" and it had been ""a consensual relationship"". A message both damaging and dangerous. But the language used to describe young people in abusive situations is slowly changing. A significant factor was the abolishment of the term ""child prostitution"" in favour of the term child sexual exploitation, first used in 2009 in a Department for Education document. A small change, perhaps, but it shifted the focus and clarified that the children involved were victims, not perpetrators, of crimes. According to research carried out by Barnardo's, describing victims as a ""girlfriend"" or ""boyfriend"" can make it more difficult for them to realise they are in an abusive situation. The Jay Report,externalcites cases in which abusers targeted children when they knew there was a chance the victim might be especially vulnerable, such as those living in local authority residential units, and who have ""a desperate need for attention and affection"". Those in local authority care are often deliberately targeted for exploitation as they may not have the same support in their lives, with adults who can spot that they are at risk. The Barnardo's research indicates ""perpetrators of this type of CSE will particularly draw on children's feelings of loneliness, their need for care, and their desire to be loved"". A girl starved of attention and kindness is more likely to believe she is in a caring relationship, leaving the perpetrator free to coerce her to have sex with friends or associates. As a result, children will often protect the perpetrator, even when they recognise their behaviour as exploitative and abusive. ""I know he loves me. He has other girlfriends, but I'm special,"" was a sentiment often uttered in the investigation into what happened in Rotherham. Many victims do not want to co-operate with the criminal justice system. A care worker, who was employed at children's homes from 2003-2007,spoke anonymously to the BBC in 2014. He said men would arrive almost ""every night"" to collect girls, who escaped using a range of methods and were then usually driven off in taxis. ""Children who have been abused do not blame their attacker simply because they ""are struggling for love"". ""But you cannot provide love in a children's unit. It's one thing that you can't provide, and as a corporate parent it's where we fail. ""And if [the abusers] are providing that, plus drugs, and alcohol and freedoms, or perceived freedoms, then we're never going to be able to keep them safe."" Dr Helen Beckett, director at the University of Bedfordshire centre of researching CSE says: ""What is common across all forms of CSE is the rarity with which young people disclose what is happening to them. ""There are many different reasons for this - many young people don't even realise the abusive nature of what is happening. Some may even feel in some way complicit in the abuse because there has been some kind of 'reward' or receipt of something."" That can be gifts, alcohol, drugs, or affection. In some cases victims are so traumatised they use drink or drugs to cope. But they then need the means to get the drink or drugs. It's a vicious circle. Ms Gladman says this is one area in which ""nothing has changed"". ""The grooming is so good, so targeted and tailored that the girls - and boys - involved don't understand they are being exploited. They don't listen to warnings. They're desperate for love and attention and it's up to the experts to recognise that, to spot who is vulnerable, and almost follow the grooming process themselves. ""We have to engage with the young people and make them feel worthwhile, give them life skills."" There is, however, a danger in thinking the only people at risk are those with difficult histories. As Ms Gladman points out: ""Parents tend to believe it's kids from troubled families who are at risk. ""Any child can be vulnerable if not protected."" While some of the most high-profile cases of CSE have involved gangs of men with Pakistani heritage abusing white girls, Dr Beckett points out that there is ""no typical CSE case"". ""It exists across every ethnic grouping, both in terms of those perpetrating and in terms of those experiencing the abuse. Research tells us that both males and females are abused through CSE. Similarly, both males and females perpetrate the abuse. ""Whilst most of our focus historically has been on adults abusing children, we are increasingly learning about peer-on-peer abuse and the risk that young people face within their own social settings."" One example is that of Laura Wilson, a 17-year-old murdered by Ashtiaq Asghar - also 17 - in Rotherham in 2010. He stabbed her multiple times and pushed her into a canal to die. Once again, the pressdescribed the killer as her ""boyfriend""at the same time as reporting that Laura had a four-month-old daughter with Asghar's friend, and that they ""treated white girls as 'sexual targets' and not like human beings"". Peter Grigg from the Children's Society says there has been a gradual change in attitudes towards the nature of exploitation, and the exposure of the abuse in Rotherham, Rochdale and other places ""has certainly ensured decision-makers and the public pay attention to issues"". But how is the issue tackled? Everybody involved in child protection agrees there is no single solution. No one agency holds the answers. According to theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse,external, systematic grooming and sexual abuse of children by groups of offenders in cities and towns of England and Wales is ""widespread"". Adele Gladman says that over the past 12 years in which she has been working in the field, there is no geographical location where it is not a problem. Peter Grigg says it's ""very likely that many other victims exist that haven't yet felt able to speak out"". The charity'sOld Enough to Know better?,externalreport showed that 50,000 females aged 16 and 17 experienced sexual offences against them but only around 5,000 of them were reported to the police. The actual figures are impossible to accurately predict, says Cassi Harrison, director of the Centre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse. ""Due to data limitations, we are making decisions in a fog. We just can't say if more children are being sexually abused. We know we are identifying more of it, but this the tip of the iceberg. ""Reported numbers are increasing, but that could be because of increased willingness of victims to report linked to confidence they will be taken seriously, increased professional awareness of the signs of abuse and commitment to take action - or because recording has improved."" Holly - not her real name - was a victim of a group of men in Telford. She told the BBC what happened to her ""He started violently raping me, he would beat me with his belt if I didn't let him rape me. Afterwards he would try to make me feel better - or make himself feel better - by giving me money or topping up my mobile phone. ""It quickly moved on to being sold to men maybe two or three times a night. I was taken to a place I can only describe as a 'rape house' which was set up for the purpose of young girls being sold to men. ""The reason I kept going back was that they kept threatening me with burning my house down, which was a real threat in Telford as that had actually happened previously. They said they'd rape my mum and rape my sisters. They knew all about my family. There was just no escape at all. ""I was gang-raped just after I turned 16 and that was probably the worst thing that has ever happened to me. After that I tried to commit suicide. People would say to me 'was that a cry for help?' and I would say 'no - I genuinely wanted to die' because I thought that was the only way out. ""I was in cars that were stopped and searched by police with older men and it was never questioned why I was in there or who I was. My name was never asked. I just think if they had been more proactive at points like that, things could have changed earlier. ""I was also going to the doctor and the youth sexual health clinic a couple of times a week for three years and getting the morning-after pill. ""Nobody asked any questions. ""I had two abortions and again, no questions were asked as to what was going on in my life."" Identifying at-risk children is done by various organisations - charities, social workers, and police all have child welfare personnel who are out on the streets at night. Outreach sessions are held in parks and other areas popular with children. Some children are already in contact with social services, for example those who are in local authority care. Workers use methods including regular texting, calls and cards, as well as by arranging to meet on the young person's ""home ground"" or at venues where they feel comfortable. Ms Gladman, now an independent safeguarding children trainer and consultant, says legislation has been made more sophisticated in order to deal with the impact of grooming - and importantly, every local authority now has a protocol to identify and prevent CSE. ""We've become more aware of abuse and better at spotting it. In some ways, we've made huge strides. We're reaching out to parents and communities - we're engaging with what's called the 'night-time economy', taxi drivers, takeaways, off licences, places like that."" Staff at such premises have proved a valuable - if unofficial - resource when it comes to safeguarding children.  Last year, taxi driver Satbir Aroraraised the alarm after he drove a teenager alone to a railway station. ""Often, people let their guard down when they're out and about or in shops. Children talk to each other, and they may be overheard by the shopkeeper who can get in touch with the police about what they suspect,"" says Ms Gladman. Cassi Harrison agrees public awareness is changing for the better. ""Over the past few years, we've seen an increased understanding of CSE; the complexity of the relationships between the abuser and the victim, and the way the abuser can control and manipulate the victim. ""Our ambition should be to prevent abuse before it happens, not wait until a child has been abused. There are many ways we can do this. For example, we should support young people to have expectations of healthy relationships and provide support for children when they display harmful sexual behaviour. ""It is never the responsibility of a child to keep themselves safe; the blame lies with the perpetrator. ""As adults, it's our responsibility to spot the signs and take action to safeguard children, not rely on children to tell us they are being abused."" If you're worried that a child or young person is at risk or is being abused you can contact the children's social care team at their local council. You can choose not to give your details. You canreport it online,externalto the Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (CEOP). Or you can call the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 for expert advice and support. If a child is at immediate risk call 999, or call the police on 101 if you think a crime has been committed. Children and young people can call Childline free on 0800 1111 where trained counsellors are available 24 hours a day, every day.

"'The NHS is creating drug addicts'GPs prescribed nearly 24 million potentially addictive painkillers, equivalent to 2,700 an hour.15h15 hours agoEngland","Opioid painkillers include tramadol, codeine and morphine Doctors warn the NHS is fuelling an addiction crisis because of an increase in the prescribing of powerful painkillers. Nearly 24 million opioids, such as morphine, were prescribed in 2017 - equivalent to 2,700 packs an hour. A drugs counsellor and former user told the BBC the NHS was ""creating drug addicts"". The Royal College of GPs said doctors would not prescribe opioid painkillers as a ""quick fix"". Opioids such as morphine, tramadol and fentanyl are super-strength painkillers, which can be highly addictive and can kill if misused. An investigation by BBC News has found: More than two million working age people in England are estimated to have taken a prescription painkiller that was not prescribed for them in 2016-17. GPs in England prescribed 23.8  million opioid-based painkillers in 2017, the equivalent of 2,700 items every hour. This was 10 million more prescriptions than in 2007. The prescribing rate of opioid painkillers in parts of northern England is four times higher than in London. The latest figures show the number of people dying from opioid-related drug misuse has reached a record high in England and Wales. About 3,700 people died in 2016 because of drug misuse. More than 2,000 of these deaths involved an opioid, according tothe Office for National Statistics,external(ONS). However these figures also included deaths from heroin, which is made from morphine. Nicki Hari says some doctors do not ask enough questions before prescribing powerful painkillers Abuse of opioids can start at an early age. ""I got my first taste of prescription painkillers when I was 14,"" said Nicki Hari. ""After having my tonsils out I remember thinking opioid based painkillers are great. They give you a floaty feeling, like you're on pink fluffy cloud."" Ms Hari, from Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, said a 25-year addiction saw her ""manipulate"" doctors into prescribing her painkillers and various types of surgery she said she did not need. ""I must have had over 10 operations on different parts of my body just so I could get more painkillers,"" she said. Ms Hari now works forUK Addiction Treatment,,externalwhich runs a network of recovery centres. ""Most doctors will give you tablets like Tramadol without asking too many questions,"" she said. ""GPs are just feeding people with pills, and the result is that the NHS is creating drug addicts."" More than three million prescriptions were issued in 2016 for the opioid Buprenorphine Analysis of theEngland and Wales crime survey,externalby the BBC England data unit suggests about 2.3 million people aged 16 to 59 in England took a prescription painkiller that had not been prescribed for them in 2016-17. Doctors and addiction experts have reported seeing a rise in the number patients seeking help for opioid prescription addictions. ""I'd say in the last five years the number of patients I'm treating has doubled,"" said Professor Jonathan Chick fromCastle Craig Hospital,external, a rehabilitation clinic in Peeblesshire, Scotland that treats people from across the UK. ""There is definitely a link between rising numbers of prescriptions and an increase in the number of opioid addicts and related deaths."" 1.5 million painkillers stolen from lorry Parents fined for children's truancy and holidays 'I take 'smart drugs'...despite risks A study by thePublic Health Research Consortium, published in 2017 found the proportion of patients being prescribed opioid painkillers by their GP had doubled in 15 years. Data held byNHS Digital,externalfor 2017 shows 23.8 million opioid painkillers were prescribed to patients across the country. Prescription rates for opioid drugs in the North East and Cumbria were four times higher than in London. It is not known how many prescriptions there were per individual patient. Dr Luke Mordecai, from University College London Hospitals, said communities that are poor or have a large elderly population often have higher prescribing rates. ""We also have to remember that GPs are often under pressure and patients demand they get given these strong painkillers,"" he added. In January the government orderedPublic Health England to conduct a review of prescribing levels,external. The Royal College of GPs said doctors would not prescribe opioid painkillers irresponsibly. ""GPs take prescribing any medication incredibly seriously and will never prescribe opioids as a 'quick fix',"" said chairwoman Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard. ""GPs will continue to work closely with patients in chronic pain by inviting them for regular medication reviews, and prescribing opioids when they are deemed to be the best treatment option, at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time."" An NHS England spokesman said: ""GPs and other health professionals make decisions about what, if any, medication to prescribe based on each individual patient's specific condition and circumstances. GPs and hospitals are working to ensure every prescription is both safe and effective, and the Care Quality Commission can investigate instances where these drugs appear to be given too frequently.""

'More Telford victims coming forward'MP Lucy Allan says she has been contacted about historic and recent cases of child grooming.4h4 hours agoShropshire,"This video can not be played Lucy Allan MP says 'many young girls' have come to her to share their experiences. More child grooming victims in Telford have come forward in the wake of reports about the scandal, its MP said. Conservative Lucy Allan said she had been ""inundated"" with reports since speaking about the issue in Parliament. West Mercia Police said it was currently working with about 46 people who were victims or at risk. The police and crime commissioner (PCC) has ""sought clarification"" on reports a 2013 force memo said some child sexual abuse victims had ""consented"". The Sunday Mirror reported that up to 1,000 girls in the Shropshire town could have been victims of child sexual exploitation (CSE) since the 1980s. 'It's not the responsibility of a child to stay safe' Midlands Live: Sink hole causes canal collapse; Dying junior football coach pens 'enjoy life' letter The wording of the memo has beencriticised in the Mirror,externalfor appearing to blame victims and PCC John Campion said he thought it was a ""poor choice of words"". Since her speech in Parliament, Ms Allan told the BBC she had been ""inundated with emails saying, 'This has happened to me'"". She said: ""I have also spoken to a consultant psychiatrist who has had many patients who have experienced this issue and are dealing with the mental health consequences of this terrible crime. ""It is clear this has been going on for many years and a significant number of girls have been affected."" Telford abuse team cases 'near doubled' Telford chief disputes abuse scale reports White working class girls 'traded for sex' On Thursday it emerged members of Telford's Cate (Children Abused Through Exploitation) team, whicha 2016 council report said were overworked and under-resourced, had raised concerns in preceding months about the lack of time they were able to spend on high-risk cases. Meanwhile, children's charity the NSPCC said demand for its services had risen in the past year. It delivered 3,122 counselling sessions about CSE via its Childline service in 2016/17, compared with 2,340 in 2015/16 - a 33% increase. Barnardo's said it had been working in Shropshire since last October to provide counselling sessions to young people who are ""at high risk of sexual exploitation"". A spokesman for Telford and Wrekin Council said it had not received any new reports of CSE Chief executive Javed Khan said: ""The scale of the abuse in Telford is deeply shocking and those responsible must be held accountable for any failings uncovered. ""Our specialist services see every day the damage caused by these horrific crimes."" A spokesman for Telford and Wrekin Council said it had not received any new reports of CSE but added the council was not the only route for victims who might want to contact the authorities. Ms Allan has raised an Early Day Motion in Parliament to call on the council to commission aRotherham-styleindependent inquiry into the situation. The council says it wants the government to commission the report rather than itself because its ""independence and scope could be called into question"". Some of the cases also pre-date the local authority, which was formed in 1998. The Home Office has said the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse will be looking at Telford in itsinvestigation into child sexual exploitation,external, but it is down to local authorities to decide whether a further review is necessary. West Mercia Police Supt Tom Harding, who is in overall charge of policing in Telford, said police and authorities in the town were working with ""approximately 46 young people"" who were victims of CSE or considered ""at risk"". He added: ""Therefore, I significantly dispute the 1,000-plus figure, and do feel it is sensationalised. ""Read the headlines, read the reports. What are they actually discussing? They're discussing cases from 20 or 30 years ago, offending back in the 1990s.""

The force said more than 100 girls could have been targeted by the gang between 2007 and 2009. Many of the seven men worked for or had connections with fast food restaurants across Telford.

"'Sharp rise' in secondary schools in deficitThere has been a ""trebling"" of the number of secondaries in England which have gone into deficit.6h6 hours agoFamily & Education","The number of state secondary schools falling into deficit in England has almost trebled in the last four years to more than a quarter, research says. Analysis by independent think tank the Education Policy Institute (EPI) found the proportion of local authority secondaries in deficit rose from 8.8% in 2013-14 to 26.1% in 2016-2017. Its study of official figures also found a significant increase in the number primary schools in deficit. The government disputed the findings. The EPI report focuses on local authority schools because the data is publicly available. It excludes academies, which account for about 60% of secondaries and 20% of primaries in England. The research adds to growing evidence of the financial struggles faced by a significant minority of schools. This was highlighted during the General Election campaign as a major issue for voters. The report also found two-thirds of council schools spent more than their income in 2016-17, while  40% have had balances in decline for at least two years in a row. ""For a significant proportion of schools in England, being able to meet the cost of annual staff pay increases from a combination of government funding and their own reserves looks highly unlikely, even in the short term,"" said the report. Jon Andrews, EPI's director for school system and performance, said: ""We are seeing an increasing number of schools spending more money than they have coming in and our analysis shows that increasing costs on staff are going to add to that pressure, even with the additional funding being delivered by the National Funding Formula."" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""With most schools overspending their income, it is clear that schools' needs are not being met by the government. ""This includes the need to invest in teachers and support staff.  As recent research by the School Cuts coalition of unions has shown, class sizes have been increasing as a result of government underfunding."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that many schools are so cash-strapped they are unable to afford even a meagre pay rise of 1% for their staff next year without having to make further cuts. ""The government has failed to provide schools with funding for pay awards over the course of several years, and this is one of a series of additional cost pressures which have pushed school finances to breaking point,"" he said. ""Staffing cuts are not just likely in the future, as the EPI report suggests, but have already taken place in many schools."" The Local Government Association said funding for children with high needs had been hit and urged the government to provide additional and ongoing funding to meet this need. ""Otherwise councils may not be able to meet their statutory duties and children with high needs or disabilities could miss out on a mainstream education,"" he added. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We do not recognise these findings. The fact is, thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers, standards are rising in our schools. ""Latest figures show schools hold surpluses of more than Â£4bn and we are providing support to help them get the most out of every pound they spend.""

Corbyn: Avoid 'hasty judgements' in spy case,"This video can not be played Corbyn: Evidence points towards Russia Jeremy Corbyn's warning not to ""rush ahead of the evidence"" over the nerve agent attack has ""muddied the waters"", a Labour MP has said. The UK government says the Russian state is responsible for the poisoning of a former spy and his daughter. Mr Corbyn has condemned the attack but says the involvement of Russian ""mafia-like groups"" can not be ruled out. More than 30 Labour MPs have signeda motion,externalwhich ""unequivocally"" accepts the Russian state's ""culpability"". Pienaar: UK Russia response going to plan so far Russia 'underestimates UK allies' - Nato Why does UK think it was Russia? On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May told the Commons that Russia was ""culpable"" for the attack and that she was expelling 23 Russian diplomats - but Moscow has denied all involvement. On Thursday, amid calls for him to be firmer in his condemnation of Russia, Mr Corbynsaid the ""evidence points towards Russia on this"". But later inan article for the Guardian newspaper,external, he drew a link with the build-up to the war in Iraq and warned that ""clear thinking in an international crisis"" could be ""overwhelmed by emotion and hasty judgement"". Labour backbencher Stephen Kinnock told the BBC Mr Corbyn's first statement, on Thursday, was ""a step in right direction"" but added: ""I think the article he wrote after that then muddied the waters somewhat. ""I think what we need is a very clear line from our leadership stating very clearly that we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies and with the government in the action it's taken."" Labour MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Two's Newsnight that ""clearly it looks like the evidence points to Russia"", but said the UK needs to ""make sure we get our facts right"" before ""leaping into action"". He said his leader's approach was ""not about being nice to Russia"" but about taking ""a statesman-like approach"". And he dismissed those criticising Mr Corbyn's stance as ""a tiny minority of irrelevant malcontents"" who are ""fighting a proxy war"" to undermine the party leader. Allies condemn nerve agent attack Russian spy attack: What we know so far Russian former spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital, 11 days after they were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire. An Early Day Motion, sponsored by Labour backbencher John Woodcock, who has criticised Mr Corbyn's leadership of the party in the past, states that the signatories ""fully support the statement made by the prime minister on 14 March 2018 in response to Russia's illegal attack on the UK"". Whether there is specific direct proof that there was Russian state involvement in the attack or not, the majority of MPs in the House of Commons agree that there is enough evidence and a pattern of behaviour that make this an appropriate moment to take some diplomatic moves against the Putin regime. While not opposing those specific actions, Mr Corbyn's tone and reaction to those moves have cracked open Labour's political truce. His comments have stoked worries about the leader's foreign policy views that have been one of the sources of division in the Labour Party since he became its top pick. Read more from Laura In his Guardian article, Mr Corbyn wrote that he agrees with the expulsion of the diplomats and describes the use of a military-grade nerve agent as ""barbaric and beyond reckless"". But he says that although the evidence points to Russia - the public deserve ""calm heads and a measured response"" from the government. ""To rush way ahead of the evidence being gathered by the police, in a fevered parliamentary atmosphere, serves neither justice nor our national security,"" he writes. Mr Corbyn says if Moscow is not to blame ""a connection to Russian mafia-like groups"" cannot be excluded. He said Russian authorities should be ""held to account on the basis of evidence"", adding: ""But let us not manufacture a division over Russia where none exists."" Others in his shadow cabinet have been more explicit in blaming the Russian state. Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith said the party accepted that ""Russia is responsible"" while Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberryis reported to have said,externalthere was ""prima facie evidence"" against the Russian government, which ""must face the consequences"". Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""the right conclusion"" for the prime minister to determine that there was ""no alternative explanation other than that responsibility lies with Russia"". He said it was an ""attack on our sovereignty"" and, referencing the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London, in which he acted as a lawyer to bring a case against Russia: ""This is not the first time and it needs to be called out with no ifs and no buts.""

N Korean minister in surprise Sweden visit,"North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho (C) arrived in Sweden late on Thursday with his delegation North Korea's foreign minister has attended talks in Stockholm with Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, ahead of a possible meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. Pyongyang said Ri Yong-ho's trip was for ""bilateral relations and issues of mutual concern"". Sweden has a long history of mediating between Washington and Pyongyang. Mr Ri had already met his Swedish counterpart Margot Wallstrom late on Thursday and early on Friday. Sweden's foreign ministry said their discussions would focus on tensions between the two Koreas, and Sweden's diplomatic work on behalf of the US in North Korea. Mr Ri's visit has been extended from the scheduled two days, and he will now stay in Sweden until Sunday, Sweden's SVT Nyheter reports. The agenda of the talks has broadened, the news site says. One topic is said to be confidence-building measures with the US, including the release of US citizens from North Korean detention. The political gamble of the 21st Century US-N Korea talks: What could happen now? North Korea-Trump talks in 400 words Donald Trump last week accepted an invitation for direct talks with Mr Kim, a shock announcement from the two leaders who have traded threats and insults for months. There has been no official word from North Korea since the invitation was delivered via South Korean officials in Washington. Gearing up for the summit of the decade? Sweden's prime minister told his country's news agency TT that ""if the main actors want Sweden to play a role then we are ready to do that"". ""We are a country that is militarily non-aligned and have a longstanding presence in North Korea, and with the trust we enjoy we think we can play a role. But it has to be the main actors who decide which role Sweden will play."" No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. Such a summit, which Pyongyang has long wanted, has previously been seen as possible only after major concessions from the North Koreans. North Korea's defiant nuclear and missile programme has led to severe international sanctions against Pyongyang in the hope they would force the regime to abandon its military threats. Sweden has longstanding ties with Pyongyang, and its embassy in North Korea was one of the first Western diplomatic missions there in the 1970s. Sweden was also the first country in the world to declare neutrality, in 1814. It takes the position that it is best to be free of military alliances in peacetime, so it can stay neutral if war breaks out. However, it has engaged in peacekeeping missions for the UN, and has a close partnership with Nato, sending troops to support Afghanistan's security forces. Because of its non-alignment policy, Sweden sometimes acts as a proxy for states whose diplomatic relations are strained. It performed that role for the UK when relations with Iran broke down, including in 1989 when Iran's supreme leader issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill the novelist Salman Rushdie. The same has happened with the US and North Korea. As the US has no North Korean consulate, Sweden has previously stood in as its representative.That includes helping with the release of US citizens held by the North. The plans for the meeting between Mr Trump and the North Korean leader took the world by surprise last Friday. It followed a year of heated rhetoric between North Korea and the US, and growing global concern that the hostilities might escalate into military confrontation. North Korea's military threat has worried the world for decades In the invitation relayed by South Korean officials, Mr Kim said he was ""committed to denuclearisation"". However uncertainty remains over what would be a landmark summit. It is not yet clear: Where the talks will take place. North Korea and the US are considered unlikely. More likely places are the border between the two Koreas, China, a neutral country - like Sweden - or international waters What North Korea wants in exchange for the meeting and for promising denuclearisation Whether the offer from Pyongyang is serious or just intended as a propaganda boost Whether the summit will ultimately take place at all Uncertainty over the summit has also been fuelled by the departure of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who was seen as a moderating voice favouring diplomacy over military threats.

'Sharp rise' in secondary schools in deficit,"The number of state secondary schools falling into deficit in England has almost trebled in the last four years to more than a quarter, research says. Analysis by independent think tank the Education Policy Institute (EPI) found the proportion of local authority secondaries in deficit rose from 8.8% in 2013-14 to 26.1% in 2016-2017. Its study of official figures also found a significant increase in the number primary schools in deficit. The government disputed the findings. The EPI report focuses on local authority schools because the data is publicly available. It excludes academies, which account for about 60% of secondaries and 20% of primaries in England. The research adds to growing evidence of the financial struggles faced by a significant minority of schools. This was highlighted during the General Election campaign as a major issue for voters. The report also found two-thirds of council schools spent more than their income in 2016-17, while  40% have had balances in decline for at least two years in a row. ""For a significant proportion of schools in England, being able to meet the cost of annual staff pay increases from a combination of government funding and their own reserves looks highly unlikely, even in the short term,"" said the report. Jon Andrews, EPI's director for school system and performance, said: ""We are seeing an increasing number of schools spending more money than they have coming in and our analysis shows that increasing costs on staff are going to add to that pressure, even with the additional funding being delivered by the National Funding Formula."" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""With most schools overspending their income, it is clear that schools' needs are not being met by the government. ""This includes the need to invest in teachers and support staff.  As recent research by the School Cuts coalition of unions has shown, class sizes have been increasing as a result of government underfunding."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that many schools are so cash-strapped they are unable to afford even a meagre pay rise of 1% for their staff next year without having to make further cuts. ""The government has failed to provide schools with funding for pay awards over the course of several years, and this is one of a series of additional cost pressures which have pushed school finances to breaking point,"" he said. ""Staffing cuts are not just likely in the future, as the EPI report suggests, but have already taken place in many schools."" The Local Government Association said funding for children with high needs had been hit and urged the government to provide additional and ongoing funding to meet this need. ""Otherwise councils may not be able to meet their statutory duties and children with high needs or disabilities could miss out on a mainstream education,"" he added. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We do not recognise these findings. The fact is, thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers, standards are rising in our schools. ""Latest figures show schools hold surpluses of more than Â£4bn and we are providing support to help them get the most out of every pound they spend.""

"BBC game challenges young people to spot ""fake news""","The iReporter game can be used by pupils in lessons and complements English and citizenship UPDATE 7 November 2024: The BBC iReporter interactive game is no longer available. Other media literacy resources for schools and young people can be found on the BBC Teach website. Can you separate the fact from the fiction? The new interactive BBC iReporter game - aimed at youngsters aged 11 to 18 - gives you the chance to take on the role of a journalist in the BBC newsroom. It is a ""choose your own adventure"" game, created by Aardman Animations, which challenges you to make your own decisions on which sources, political claims, social media comments and pictures should be trusted as you contribute to the day's news output. See more from young journalists working with the BBC The game is part of a BBC initiative to help young people identify false storiesby giving students and teachers resourcesto use in classrooms across the UK. This video can not be played An introduction to different types of fake and false information The resources also look at the issues of trust. In an era when people get their information from a much wider range of sources, how do young people gain confidence in deciding what they should trust? Hints and tips on how to spot false information on social media and online are included, as well as lesson plans for teachers to use in school. This video can not be played A guide to help you decide which sources to trust and which not to The BBC has also teamed up with the Centre for Argument Technology at the University of Dundee to create the""Evidence Toolkit"",external- a programme aimed at 16-to-18-year-olds. It combines complex algorithms and archive material fromBBC Radio 4's Moral Maze,externalto help students identify the claims made and the reasoning in any news article and how the two are connected. This video can not be played If you want to be sure a story is right, check the evidence. Professor Chris Reed, director of the centre, said: ""Dissecting news articles to determine their anatomy and figure out how they're working is a delicate business. ""The Evidence Toolkit equips users with a set of razor-sharp tools to go about it."" John Lawrence, lead developer on the project, explained: ""The Toolkit employs state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques for argument mining. This is the first time AI has been unleashed on understanding the reasoning in news articles."" Amol Rajan is the BBC's media editor and was previously editor of the Independent newspaper. Let me tell you how I decide whether or not I can trust a news source. First of all, have they shown a commitment to accuracy over a long period of time? Have they consistently got things right? And the second thing - which is related - is: do they admit when they get things wrong? You know, if you put your hand up and say 'Sorry, I made an error, there were factual mistakes in the piece that we published', then people like me are much more likely to believe you when you say another time that you got things right. Numbers are often used to tell all sorts of stories too. They can help show the scale of a particular problem or issue, illustrating whether it's big or small. In this short animation you'll learn how just because a number looks big doesn't mean it really is and that a really small number might turn out to be much bigger than it first appears.

Adapt or die: How to cope when the bots take your job,"Will smart virtual assistants take our jobs or make them more fulfilling? Reports that robots, automation and artificial intelligence are going to put millions of us out of work may sound troubling, but should we believe them? That largely depends on whether we're technology optimists or pessimists. In our Future of Work series we look at how jobs might change in the future. The Snewing family lived in 62 Falkner Street, Liverpool, for more than four decades. They were saddlers working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. And while the horse-drawn economy dominated, they enjoyed a brisk trade. But then,as the BBC Two series A House Through Time relates, along came the motor car. Rival saddlery businesses saw the lie of the land and turned to making leather footballs, handbags and luggage instead. The Snewings sadly carried on regardless and eventually went out of business. That, in a nutshell, is the challenge we face when new technologies come along. Adapt or die. But it is the pace of technological change that is unprecedented in the modern era and which poses the greatest challenge for jobs. Ford's Model-T motorcar symbolised the death-knell for the horse-drawn economy Saddlers didn't disappear completely as engines replaced horses, but businesses had to adapt These days algorithms dictate the automated trading of trillions of dollars' worth of assets in the financial markets. Artificially intelligent chatbots are taking over from humans in call centres. And soon, planes and cars could be operating autonomously, putting in jeopardy the livelihoods of those who drive professionally. Robots have been doing the repetitive drudge work in our factories for decades. But now they can flip burgers, flick away unripe tomatoes on a high-speed sorting machine using image recognition, lay bricks, even co-operate to open doors and escape. Giant 3D printers can make houses out of concrete in a fraction of the time humans can. Burger-flipping robot taken offline What happens when AI meets robotics? Robots to 'take 800 million jobs by 2030' How long will it take for your job to be automated? The International Federation of Robotics says in manufacturing there are now 74 robot units per 10,000 employees on average, compared with 66 units in 2015. The highest growth rate is in Asia, China in particular. And software automation, informed by machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), will have a profound effect on our workplaces and the jobs we do. ""AI is a big threat to low-skilled jobs, no question,"" says Bernard Louvat, general manager of digital customer engagement solutions at tech firm Nuance. Will robots really be able to help around the house or care for the elderly? ""I don't think we're ready to handle this problem yet."" He thinks clever chatbots will replace most call centre staff within 10 years. ""A virtual assistant can handle 60%-80% of all customer conversations now without any need for a human agent to intervene - five years ago it would have been 25%-30%,"" he says. ""Chatbots are certainly eliminating jobs - we need fewer and fewer human agents each year. The ones that are left will be highly skilled super-agents looking after the most complicated cases."" BBC News is looking at how technology is changing the way we work, and how it is creating new job opportunities. How to become a professional shopper Is cryonics the key to immortality? Why Finland is experimenting with 'free money' More Future of Work stories Research firm Gartner predicts that by 2020, 85% of questions will be answered by virtual assistants. When you think that a huge telecoms company like AT&T employs about 100,000 call centre agents to look after its 120 million customers, that's a lot of jobs that could disappear pretty quickly. But the cost-savings are too big for large corporations to ignore. And they say customer satisfaction increases as these chatbots learn from the millions of previous customer conversations and become smarter. Some experts fear that self-replicating AI could run out of control Consultancy Accenture says 81% of executives it interviewed think that within two years AI will be working next to humans in their organisation as ""a co-worker, collaborator and trusted adviser"". A recent report by the McKinsey Global Institute,externalconcluded that nearly two thirds of all jobs could have a significant chunk - at least 30% - of their activities automated by 2030. That could affect 800 million roles, it said. But McKinsey also acknowledged that this new technology ""will also create new occupations that do not exist today, much as technologies in the past have done"". Could the saddler of the past ever have imagined the roles of car mechanic, smartphone app developer or drone pilot? The Industrial Revolution from the late 17th Century onwards saw mechanisation sweep through many industries. Farming in particular, which accounted for around 50% of all jobs across Europe, saw that percentage dwindle to less than 5% now. The mechanisation of farming saw many agricultural jobs move to other sectors Such upheaval was undoubtedly painful for those unable to adapt, but new types of employment came along eventually. More recently, there have seismic changes to the global economy. In the last 30 years, we've had digital transformation, the rise of the internet, globalisation.But figures from the World Bank show,externalthat global unemployment as a percentage of total labour force has actually fallen from 6.1% in 1991 to 5.8% in 2017, despite the population rising from 5.4 billion to 7.6 billion over the same period. Robotic process automation - RPA - will remove the need for staff to do boring, repetitive, rules-based activities, such as inputting data or handling payroll, tech optimists say. ""This is an evolution of work - the type of work we do will change,"" says Ian Barkin, co-founder of Symphony Ventures, an RPA specialist with clients such as Lloyds Banking Group and US payroll giant ADP. Polycom boss Mary McDowell thinks new technologies will make us more productive ""RPA doesn't have to lead to a culling of staff, it can empower them and unleash their creativity. It's freeing them from doing the unproductive stuff."" Mary McDowell, chief executive of video-conferencing provider Polycom, envisages a time where AI will effectively run virtual meetings for us, using facial recognition to identify who's speaking and calling up relevant documents and statistics to support points being made. ""The management of sound and video will be so much better,"" she says. ""Participants will feel like they're actually present and augmented reality will help us collaborate and annotate documents much more productively. ""Meetings will be about the ideas, not the mechanics. Without technical barriers we can focus on the work at hand, whether that's providing telemedicine or distance learning services."" But even the optimists admit that as low-skilled jobs disappear, people will need to learn new skills to compensate. ""This calls on us all to focus on up-skilling,"" says Mr Barkin. ""There's an urgent need for education reform - people need to learn design thinking, creativity, analytics, programming."" Research by job site Indeed finds that in the last three years demand from UK employers for AI specialists has almost tripled. ""Technology can lead to job reductions, but it doesn't have to. This could be a huge good news story,"" concludes Mr Barkin. Just don't carry on making saddles when the car is driving down the street towards you. In the rest of this series we will look at the new types of job that could emerge in the age of robots, AI and automation. Follow Matthew onTwitter,external.

Is cryonics the key to immortality?,"Technology is changing the way we work and the jobs we do. Will artificial intelligence and robots relieve us of humdrum tasks, making our working lives easier, or will they take our jobs away altogether? As part of our Future of Work series, we look at the cryonics technicians - who are trying to help their clients cheat death. Are you open minded about the future? Do you have a medical background and can you complete tasks under time pressure? Are you comfortable working in the presence of a dead body? This is not the job description for a Victorian grave snatcher. Instead, it's the ideal attributes of a cryonics technician; someone who preserves the bodies of the recently deceased in the hope they will one day be revived. What are the ethics of cryonic preservation? Cryonics: The people who believe in a chance to come back Terminally ill teen won historic ruling to preserve body Advocates describe it as an ""ambulance to the future"". They say that as medical science develops, these technicians could become a common sight in our hospitals, purporting to offer believers a second chance at life. However, most highly doubt it will work. Cryonics seeks to freeze someone after they have legally died in order to keep their body and mind as undamaged as possible. This aims to buy the patient time until future medical science can bring them back to life, and cure them of whatever it is they died from. Second chance? Cryonics attempts to protect the body from decay by storing it at extremely low temperatures As soon as the patient dies, the clock is ticking to start the procedure. The heart has stopped pumping and the brain is no longer receiving oxygen, meaning within minutes it will lose the ability to make new memories, and soon after that the cells will begin to die. This means the technician must get to work immediately after the individual is declared legally dead, cooling their body in an ice bath in order to slow down the process of degeneration. BBC News is looking at how technology is changing the way we work, and how it is creating new job opportunities. How to cope when the bots take your job Staying one step ahead of the cyber-spies How to become a professional shopper Why Finland is experimenting with 'free money' More Future of Work stories After this blood is drained from the body and replaced with cryoprotectant agents - similar to antifreeze - in an attempt to stop ice crystals forming in the blood cells. The body is then placed in a storage tank and brought down to the temperature of liquid nitrogen (-196C) in an attempt to preserve the organs and tissue. While cryonics has been practised since the 1970s, only the US and Russia actually have small storage facilities. In the US state of Michigan, the Cryonics Institute has about 2,000 living people signed up, and 165 patients who have already gone through the process. Dennis Kowalski is a paramedic by training, which he says is a perfect fit for the cryonics procedure Dennis Kowalski is the institute's president and performs some of the cryonic procedures. By day, he is a paramedic. ""The training to become a paramedic is perfect to become a standby in cryonics,"" he says. ""You also need someone with a funeral director's licence (because you are still legally handling dead bodies), experience running a perfusion pump, and basic surgical skills."" The Cryonics Institute is a co-operative with just three full-time members of staff, but Mr Kowalski thinks this will grow as medical science evolves. So far just 5,000 people around the globe have signed up but the numbers are growing so funeral homes may start to offer this as an option, he says. ""Artificial intelligence, genetic modification, stem cell engineering - all these fields are vindicating what we are doing, which is giving people the greatest opportunity possible."" Dr Anders Sandberg has elected to have his head cryonically preserved after death, even though he puts the chance of revival at only 3% One of the 5,000 is Dr Anders Sandberg, a senior research fellow at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute. He is on the board of the Brain Preservation Foundation and has elected to have only his head preserved after death, even though he estimates a success rate of just 3%. Like Mr Kowalski, he argues the skills needed to become a cryonics technician are already in use in many medical professions. ""Right now cryonics feels a little too cold or impersonal and it relies on the admission that it is uncertain, but I do think it will grow. ""In the future, wouldn't having a cryogenicist at the hospital make sense? When you do heart or brain surgery you lower the body temperature to buy more time and I imagine that over time we will start doing more low temperature surgery. ""This is a job that you might want to do if you started out as a nurse or a perfusion specialist. It would not be a big leap from a technical standpoint, only from a social one, as it's using arguments from within medicine. ""There's a lot of resistance to overcome but from a practical perspective it makes sense and might save us from a lot of wasteful medicine."" Although they sound similar, cryonics and cryogenics are viewed very differently by the scientific community. Cryonics specifically relates to the preservation of the human body after death. Most supporters of the process admit they do not know if or when the technology will exist to revive people, or whether the techniques used to prepare the body for storage will have worked. Cryogenics has many applications in present day medicine, and can be used in stem cell research Cryogenics, on the other hand, has many applications in today's society. It involves the freezing of matter at temperatures of -150C or lower. In medicine, this includes the freezing of embryos, eggs, sperm, skin, and tissue in order to preserve them for future use. Clive Coen, professor of neuroscience at King's College, London, suggests applying validated cryogenic techniques to the brain or whole body is doomed to failure. That's because the application of antifreeze during the preservation process fails to reach all of the brain, and it would be impossible to defrost each part of the body at the same time, he says ""Advocates of cryonics are naive in comparing their wishful thinking with the successes achieved in storing loosely packed cells - such as sperm - at low temperatures. ""And they shouldn't forget that any resuscitation process that isn't instantaneous will merely set the process of decay running again."" Cryogenicists are currently working on freezing other organs But Prof Coen says cryogenics is an exciting field ripe for expansion. Although the brain is far too complex, cryogenicists are currently working on freezing other organs. This could revolutionise the process of transplantation, which would no longer have to take place immediately. ""People are tremendously hard at work in this field trying to store organs such as the kidney, and even the heart on a long term basis. That would be a tremendous boon to our health and wellbeing,"" Prof Coen says. ""But a whole body? Forget it.""

How to become a professional shopper,"A daigou or remote shopper, buys things on the behalf of others Technology is changing the way we work and the jobs we do. Will artificial intelligence and robots relieve us of humdrum tasks, making our working lives easier, or will they take our jobs away altogether? As part of a new series called the Future of Work, we look at the growing popularity of ""daigou"" - Chinese expats who buy consumer goods for people back home in China. Sandra Lee describes herself as part of a ""global phenomenon"". A 37-year-old Chinese expat who lives in Central Coast, Australia, she makes money by selling Australian goods to people back in China. Connecting with buyers via Chinese social messaging app WeChat, Ms Lee purchases items from Australian supermarkets and other retailers on their behalf, and then posts them to China. An overseas personal shopper, she is known in China as a daigou, and Ms Lee is far from alone. More than a million people globally are now working as daigou, according to some estimates. Commentators say this booming trade was born as a result of mistrust in the authenticity of products sold in China. In particular, they point to the spate of scandals involving tainted or fake baby formula milk over the last decade. There are now an estimated one million daigou around the world In one of the worst cases, at least six babies died back in 2008, and tens of thousands became sick, after their formula milk was found to contain melamine, a toxic compound. As a result, many people from Chinese cities greatly prefer to buy foreign brands, which have preferably been bought overseas. At a basic level, a daigou makes his or her money by charging a small fee to the people buying the products. But there are now those who have grown their businesses into mini empires. BBC News is looking at how technology is changing the way we work, and how it is creating new job opportunities. Staying one step ahead of the cyber-spies Is cryonics the key to immortality? How to cope when the bots take your job Why Finland is experimenting with 'free money' More Future of Work stories Ms Lee, who juggles her daigou work with being a housewife, says: ""I have lots of friends selling American products such as luxury bags. ""I have friends in Germany selling knives, and my classmate who now lives in Japan sells home appliances."" She explains that the phenomenon only really took off seven years ago, and is especially appealing to Chinese expats who are struggling to learn the language of their new home. ""This job doesn't require you to speak any English, as long as you sell authentic products at a reasonable price,"" she says. ""You basically sell all these products to your friends, relatives or your friends' friends. It's a trust-based business."" China's 2008 baby milk scandal is said to have greatly increased demand for products bought outside the country Today individual daigou in Australia can make upwards of $100,000 (Â£72,000) a year selling Australian products to customers in China. Some daigou even use their garages as their stock warehouses, and hire several people to do their customer service. AuMake, a husband-and-wife run daigou business in Sydney, has gone even further, much further. It now has a chain of physical retail stores across the city that caters to daigou shoppers. And last year it floated on the Australian stock exchange, becoming the first daigou business to list in Australia. AuMake also now has a ""daigou hub"", a space where local companies can connect directly to individual daigous and visiting Chinese tourists. It has plans to establish hubs in other capital cities as it expands. Daigous in Australia have been urged not to buy up all stocks of baby formula milk Benjamin Cavender, a Shanghai-based analyst from China Market Research, says that the daigou phenomenon has been fuelled by the development of mobile phone and payment technology. ""With the ubiquity of smartphones and live streaming apps it will be easy for consumers to continue to involve themselves in the idea of 're-commerce',"" he says. ""The neat thing about this is that it can give a lot of power to the re-seller. An enterprising individual, who has an audience to sell to in China, can earn a lot of money."" Although these new jobs only exist because of technology developed in mobile messaging and payments applications, the skills involved are entirely human rather than automated - at least for now. Shane Oliver, chief economist at Sydney-based investment house AMP Capital, says: ""The new jobs are mainly in sourcing and authenticating the product, something that is hard for machines to do with absolute credibility. ""In fact the desire for authenticity that daigous satisfy is anti-technology."" Australia-based daigous can now apply for official certification Some of the additional tasks carried out by daigous include answering customers' queries, live-streaming on WeChat and other social media platforms, and video posting their product evaluations. ""The daigous are trusted advocates on behalf of their communities in China, and their input gives it that authenticity,"" says Jessica Bragdon, co-founder of Koala Eco, an Australian cleaning product firm that sells to daigous. ""They lend a sense of trust, and people believe in it because they are representing it."" Matt McDougall, founder of marketplace Daigousales.com, is also the president of the Australia China Daigou Association, a trade body for the sector. ""We get a lot of brands coming to us asking if we can get daigous to tell them about pricing, look at their products and see if they like them,"" he says. As the industry grows in Australia, new ideas are emerging to professionalise it. A number of websites now exist to help daigous do their business The Australia China Daigou Association is currently drawing up a code of conduct to implement a common standard of behaviour for daigous. These include not filling supermarket trolleys full of infant formula, and not leaving marks on unpurchased products in shops. ""We are looking to improve the status of this community, and bridge relationships between Australian brands and daigou buying agents,"" says Mr McDougall. The Australian government has also recently thrown its support behind the movement, recognising the job-creating potential this grey industry brings. It sent federal and state ministers to cheer the launch of the newly-formed association. However the way ahead for this new economy may not be all smooth-sailing. Professor Hans Hendrischke from the University of Sydney's Business School, cautions that China may start regulating the daigou sector, which might mean that big players will evolve and push out the smaller ones. Sandra Lee though is far more optimistic about the prospects for her job. ""The association gives you a certificate with your name on it,"" she says.

Blackberry modified to 'help drug cartels'Five people arrested accused of running a secure smartphone company designed solely to aid criminal organisations.2h2 hours agoTechnology,"The chief executive of a company that created highly-secure smartphones allegedly used by some of the world's most notorious criminals has been indicted. Canadian-based Phantom Secure made ""tens of millions of dollars"" selling the modified Blackberry devices for use by the likes of the Sinaloa Cartel, investigators said. The charges marked the first time US authorities have targeted a company for knowingly making encrypted technology for criminals. The Department of Justice arrested Vincent Ramos in Seattle last week. He was indicted on Thursday along with four associates. The BBC has been unable to reach Phantom Secure. They are charged with racketeering and conspiracy to aid the distribution of drugs. Both crimes have a maximum penalty of life in prison. Mr Ramos is the only one of the group currently in custody. ""This organisation Phantom Secure was designed to facilitate international drug trafficking all throughout the entire world,"" US attorney Adam Braverman told the BBC. ""These traffickers, including members of the Sinaloa Cartel, would use these fully-encrypted devices to facilitate their drug trafficking activities in order to avoid law enforcement scrutiny."" Blackberry did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday - and investigators would not say whether the firm had worked with them on this case. Mr Braverman said Blackberry was not alone in having its handsets altered for illegal purposes. Facebook bans Britain First pages Stephen Hawking: A life in pictures United Airlines responsible for dog death ""Our understanding is there are a handful of other organisations that exist like this. The FBI, and our office, will continue investigating not only Phantom Secure but any other company that provides this kind of communication device to criminal organisations."" He added that while almost every smartphone on the market offers hard-to-crack encryption - as well as apps from Facebook, Google and Apple - Phantom Secure should be held culpable for what the users of its services were doing. ""The difference is this company was specifically-designed to aid international drug trafficking organisations,"" he said. ""The only way that you're able to actually utilize one of these devices and obtain one of these devices is if somebody else vouched for you."" Phantom Secure sold devices on a subscription basis at a cost of $2,000-$3,000 for around six months of use. In order to become a customer, an existing user must vouch for the new person. That system, authorities said, was a way of preventing law enforcement from getting hold of the devices. Agents estimated as many as 20,000 Phantom Secure-modified handsets are in use around the world. Communications through the phones are automatically routed to servers in Panama and Hong Kong, according to court documents, making data more difficult to trace. Phantom Secure could also remove key functionality from the devices to lock them down, such as voice communication, microphone, GPS, camera, internet and messaging apps, leaving just the text functionality. Law enforcement authorities have repeatedly been frustrated by encryption technology making it harder to access communications between suspects. In 2016, Apple refused to provide a tool that would allow the FBI to unlock an iPhone belonging to Syed Farook, a man involved in a mass shooting that resulted in the death of 14 people. On Thursday, a spokesman for the FBI reiterated the agency's concern about criminals being able to ""go dark"" and hide behind these sophisticated technologies. Privacy and open rights activists argue that removing or just weakening encryption would put everyone at risk of data theft and surveillance - not just criminals.
