Pregnant woman hurt in hospital bombing gives birth,"A pregnant woman photographed escaping from the wreckage of a hospital bombed by Russia has given birth to a daughter, reports say. The image of heavily-pregnant Mariana Vishegirskaya, her face bloodied, descending rubble-strewn steps was widely shared amid outrage at the attack, which killed three people. She gave birth the following day, her niece in Turkey told local media. Ukraine's ambassador to the UN said the baby had been named Veronika. Sergiy Kyslytsya, who held up a picture of Ms Vishegirskaya and her newborn daughter during remarks at the UN, hit out at ""Russian lies"" about her in the aftermath of the attack. Ms Vishegirskaya became the subject of a Russian disinformation campaign after the bombing. The Russian embassy in the UK tweeted a conspiracy theory that Ms Vishegirskaya was an actress and the aftermath of the attack had been staged. However,the BBC's disinformation team found evidence which contradicted the unfounded claims, including that she had somehow pretended to be several women photographed at the scene. Twitter later removed the Russian embassy's tweets, saying they violated rules ""related to the denial of violent events"". Further claims circulating online suggested that Ms Vishegirskaya was not even pregnant. However, the beauty blogger revealed she was pregnant in January to her followers - weeks before the invasion - and later asked them if whether they thought she would have a girl or a boy.

Mr Kyslytsya produced the photo of Ms Vishegirskaya on Friday afternoon, telling those assembled he wanted to share ""very good news"". ""Miss Mariana, the pregnant woman gave birth to a healthy daughter last night. Her name is Veronika. Here she is with her father. No matter what the Russian lies are about herself, her family, and the incident,"" he said. He also said that more than 1,500 civilians had been killed by Russia in Mariupol, which has been without water or electricity for days after being surrounded by Russian forces and where several attempts to establish evacuation corridors had failed. Ukraine has said three people, including a child, had been killed in the hospital strike alone. ""For the first time since World War Two people are being buried in mass graves in Ukrainian cities,"" Mr Kyslytsya said. Numerous tech companies have begun blocking Russian state media channels in an attempt to tackle disinformation. On Friday, YouTube became the latest tech giant to block channels associated with Russian state-funded media. The video streaming service said it had a policy ""prohibit content denying, minimizing or trivializing well-documented violent events"".

Bitcoin cash machines ordered to shut down,"All UK crypto-currency cash machines (ATMs) are operating illegally and must be shut down, the Financial Conduct Authority has announced. Crypto-ATMs look like regular cash machines and let people buy crypto-currency, such as Bitcoin, using their bank cards. But no company offering crypto-currency services in the UK has a licence to operate a crypto-ATM. The FCA said all such machines must be shut down or it will take action. According to crypto-ATM directory Coin ATM Radar, there are 81 functional crypto-ATMS in the UK. The FCA said: ""We regularly warn consumers that crypto-assets are unregulated and high-risk which means people are very unlikely to have any protection if things go wrong. ""People should be prepared to lose all their money if they choose to invest in them."" The FCApublishes a list of companies that appear to be involved in crypto-currency,externalbut have not registered their business with the regulator for anti-money-laundering checks. It said that since the publication of its list, 110 of the crypto companies had ceased trading. This video can not be played Are crypto-currencies the future of money? What is Bitcoin?

"Iâm not a UK security risk, Russian-born peer says","Evgeny Lebedev is the owner of the Independent and the London Evening Standard newspapers Russian-British businessman Evgeny Lebedev has denied posing a ""security risk"" to the UK, declaring ""I am not some agent of Russia"" in an article. It follows reports that the security services had raised concerns about him being made a peer in 2020. Writing in the London Evening Standard,external, which he owns, Lord Lebedev said he had ""no option but to respond"". He said it was ""crucial we do not descend into Russophobia"" during the war in Ukraine. The UK government has been ratcheting up sanctions against individuals and companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin since his invasion of Ukraine was launched on 24 February. Seven oligarchs including Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovichand386 Russian MPswere among the latest to be sanctioned by the UK. In this climate, some people with ties to Russia are coming under closer scrutiny in the UK as the war in Ukraine escalates. Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Who is not on the UK sanctions list? Last week,the Sunday Times reported,externalthat in March 2020, the commission that vets peerage appointments advised Prime Minister Boris Johnson against granting Mr Lebedev a seat in the House of Lords on security grounds. The newspaper said the assessment was withdrawn after Mr Johnson - a long-time friend of Lord Lebedev - personally intervened. The commission can advise but has no veto over peerage appointments, which are ultimately decided by prime minsters and formalised by the Queen. Asked at prime minister's questions this week, if he had ""overruled"" security service advice, Boris Johnson said ""no"". Lord Lebedev, the owner of the Independent and the London Evening Standard newspapers, was given a peerage in July 2020, for philanthropy and services to the media, after being nominated by Mr Johnson. Boris Johnson with his sister Rachel and Lord Lebedev at an Evening Standard party in 2012 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee to investigate the appointment, calling it a ""matter of national security"". But in his article on Friday, Lord Lebedev, who holds both Russian and British citizenship, said ""I am not a security risk to this country, which I love"". The son of Alexander Lebedev, a billionaire Russian banker and former KGB officer, he came to London at the age of eight when his father began working in the Soviet embassy. In his article, Lord Lebedev said he was educated in the UK and was ""proud to be a British citizen and consider Britain my home"". He acknowledged his father ""was a foreign intelligence agent of the KGB, but I am not some agent of Russia"". He said his father ""spent his time campaigning against corruption and illegal financial dealings"" and his family ""has a record of standing up for press freedom"" in Russia. Having a Russian name, he said, ""does not automatically make one an enemy of the state"". ""It is crucial we do not descend into Russophobia, like any other phobia, bigotry or discrimination,"" he added. The article is the second Lord Lebedev has published in the Evening Standard since the war in Ukraine started. At the end of February,he wrote a letter to Mr Putin,external, in which he urged the Russian president to ""bring this terrible conflict in Ukraine to an end"".

US to ban Russian diamond and vodka imports,"US President Joe Biden has announced a ban on imports of Russian diamonds, seafood and vodka in the latest response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The US, European Union and other allies also plan to revoke Russiaâs status as an equal trade partner, paving the way for further economic punishment. The moves add to sanctions that have isolated Russia economically since the invasion. Its currency has collapsed, while global firms rush to exit the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin has likened Western sanctions on banks and oligarchs to a declaration of war. Moscow has also threatened to nationalise production plants or factories where work has been suspended. Western allies announced further economic retaliation on Friday. The European Union said it would ban imports of key Russian iron and steel products and bar new energy investments in the country, while theUK put sanctions on hundreds of Russian politicians. The US, EU and UK also said they would cut off shipments of luxury goods to Russia. Mr Biden said the latest steps will be ""another crushing blow to the Russian economy"". What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? How Asia is divided over Russia sanctions Under international rules, designating a country a ""most favoured nation"" provides reciprocal trade privileges such as lower tariffs, taxes imposed at the border. Stripping Russia of that status clears the way for higher tariffs on key products it sells such as mineral fuels, fertilisers and metals. Mr Biden said he was coordinating the plans with the European Union and other advanced economies, including Canada and Japan, each of which will take similar steps. In the US, Congress, which must act for the move to go into effect, has already declared itself in favour of the move. Most Favoured Nation (MFN) is a status conferred by membership of the World Trade Organisation. It might sound as though it confers special advantages, but that's not really the case. In fact, it is a baseline designed to ensure all World Trade Organisation members are treated equally, unless they are members of a specific free trade area or agreement. Under normal circumstances, it limits countries' ability to impose trade barriers against one another - or offer individual countries special concessions. By removing this status from Russia, G7 countries will be able to target its exports with punitive tariffs, or taxes. In fact one of them, Canada, has already done so. Last week it imposed tariffs of 35% on all products coming from Russia and its compliant ally, Belarus. In order to do this, Canada relied on an exemption contained in one of the WTO agreements, which allows members to take action they consider necessary to protect their ""essential security interests"". It is likely the others will do the same. In addition, Western allies said they planned to cut Russia off from accessing finance from international organisations such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. ""Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order,"" the G7, a group of seven advanced economies including the UK, said in a statement. The US ban on key Russian imports will deny Mr Putin more than $1bn in revenue, the White House said, while the ban on US exports of luxury goods hits trade worth about $550m per year. That is just a fraction of the roughly $28bn worth of trade the US and Russia exchanged in 2019. Mr Biden promised further measures, including tightening sanctions on oligarchs and their families. ""We're going to continue to squeeze Putin,"" Mr Biden said. ""He is the aggressor and... must pay the price."" Economists say the sanctions previously announced will throw Russia into a severe economic recession this year. But it is not clear that the economic disarray has altered Mr Putin's military ambitions. At a press conference on Thursday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked when the weight of the sanctions might lead to a change in Mr Putin's actions. ""Our objective of course is to bring an end to this conflict, she said. ""In terms of when that will happen, I'm unfortunately not in the mind of President Putin.... When it will change his calculus, I can't give a prediction of that.""

Disney apologises for 'silence' on new sex-ed bill,"Walt Disney's CEO has apologised for his ""painful silence"" on a Florida sex education bill critics warn will isolate LGBT youth. ""You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry,"" Bob Chapek told employees. His comments come amid internal complaints that ""gay affection"" is routinely cut from some Disney films. The so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill is due to become law. It bans discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten to third grade classes (aged 8-9) or when ""not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards"". Formally known as the Parental Rights in Education bill, it also allows private citizens to sue and seek unspecified damages if they believe a school district has violated the law. The White House has decried its passage as ""hateful legislation targeting vulnerable students"". Florida lawmakers pass 'Don't Say Gay' bill Biden blasts Florida 'Don't Say Gay' school bill LGBT leaders at Disney have been clamouring for the company to speak out against the bill. In a letter to Disney leadership, a copy of which was obtained by the BBC, LGBT employees at Pixar - the company's computer animation division - accused the parent company of stepping back from public debate around ""bigoted legislation"" while continuing to profit from the LGBT community. They also levelled a more serious charge: that Disney has cut ""nearly every moment of overtly gay affection"" from its content ""regardless of when there is protest from both the creative teams and executive leadership at Pixar"". The company did not reply to BBC's requests for comment. On Friday, Mr Chapek told employees in a memo that he was wrong to have been silent on the 'Don't Say Gay' bill. The admission came after he had claimed earlier in the week that he believed ""corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds"" and Disney's involvement would make it ""a political football"" - a statement that was denounced by animators on social media, who called it a ""momentous misstep"".

Amid the public criticism, Mr Chapek backtracked, telling shareholders on Wednesday that Disney had been ""opposed to the bill from the outset"" and he had phoned Florida Governor Ron DeSantis - who plans to approve the bill - to express his concerns. Mr Chapek also pledged a $5m (Â£3.8m) donation to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) LGBT advocacy group. But the volte-face created even more fallout. HRC turned down Disney's donation and called on the entertainment giant to take ""meaningful action"" against the bill. The company is a major tourism driver in the state, drawing some 58 million people per year to its flagship Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando. It also employs 77,000 Floridians. And at a rally, Governor DeSantis told supporters the company has fallen for ""phony hysteria"" and wants to appease angry liberals. His office confirmed to the BBC the governor took a call from Mr Chapek but intends to sign the bill.

UK sanctions Russian MPs over Ukraine invasion,"The sanctions will hit members of the Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament The UK government has imposed sanctions on hundreds of Russian parliamentarians as part of its response to the war in Ukraine. Some 386 MPs who voted to recognise two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine as independent last month have been hit by asset freezes and UK travel bans. The UK said their recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk gave Russia a ""pretext"" for its subsequent invasion. Labour welcomed the move but said it should have happened ""weeks ago"". It follows a similar move by the European Union, which announced sanctions against hundreds of Russian MPs last month. The UK signalled it would impose sanctions of its own last month, but said more time was needed to pass new legislation before it could happen. The latest announcement means 400 of the 450 members of the Duma - the lower house of the Russian parliament - are now subject to British sanctions. They also prevent them from conducting business in the UK. Downing Street declined to say whether any of the sanctioned politicians had any assets in the UK. Ministers are yet to also target members of the Federation Council, the Russian parliament's upper house, who voted for recognition. The Foreign Office signalled its intention to do so last month. Meanwhile, No 10 said details of a UK ban on exporting luxury goods to Russia would be announced in the coming days. The product ban is part of a series ofadditional trade sanctionsannounced by the G7 group of wealthy Western nations on Friday. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? People can welcome refugees into own homes - PM Satellites show Russia convoy regrouping near Kyiv Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK was targeting ""those complicit in Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine and those who support this barbaric war"". ""We will not let up the pressure and will continue to tighten the screw on the Russian economy through sanctions,"" she added. The move against Russian MPs follows sanctions on Russian banks, companies and oligarchs in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month. On Thursday the UK announced sanctions on a further seven Russian oligarchs,including Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. The UK government says it means 18 Russian oligarchs, worth a combined Â£30bn, have been sanctioned since the Russian invasion began. Russia's Duma approved ""friendship treaties"" with Luhansk and Donetsk at a vote on 22 February Ministers have been coming under mounting pressure from opposition parties to increase both the speed and scale of sanctions in recent weeks. Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the latest sanctions against Duma members were welcome, but ""should have happened weeks ago"". Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran also backed the move, but said the UK had been ""moving at a snail's pace"". The government has also faced criticism over its response to the refugee crisis, amid accusations the process to apply for visas is slow and bureaucratic. The United Nations said more than 2.5 million people have now fled Ukraine, but as of Thursday morning the UK had issued 1,305 visas, Home Office Minister Baroness Williams of Trafford said on Friday. The government has announced plans to allow Ukrainians with family in the UK to apply for visas online, without having to visit a visa centre in-person. Details of a second scheme allowing individuals and businesses to sponsor refugee visas are set to be confirmed on Monday, having originally been announced on 1 March.

Chelsea credit card facilities suspended,"Roman Abramovich has been in charge of Chelsea since 2003 Chelsea's credit card facilities have been temporarily suspended while banks assess the implications of sanctions imposed on Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich. The club has been given a special licence to operate despite Abramovich having his assets frozen by the UK government. Banks want to assess the licence criteria to ensure it does not breach the government's sanctions and Chelsea do not know when the suspension will be lifted. As part of the licence terms, Chelsea cannot receive money for match tickets which have not already been sold, future gate receipts for FA Cup games or merchandise from the club shop. That is likely to leave the club with a huge shortfall, with their monthly wage bill amounting to Â£28m a month. In discussions with the government on Thursday and Friday Chelsea made applications to change the terms of the licence which would allow the club to receive money for ticket sales, and also boost its limits on spending. The current licence allows Â£500,000 to be spent on home matches and allows a Â£20,000 limit on away travel. Talks were also held regarding an amendment to the licence about a potential sale of the club and included Raine Group - the American investment firm instructed to handle the sale before Abramovich was sanctioned. This video can not be played The Football News Show: What do sanctions mean for the sale of Chelsea? On Friday, a spokesman for the Prime Minister later said the government was ""in constant contact"" with Chelsea and the Premier League and said the Blues could apply for an ""amended licence"". They added: ""I believe Chelsea have said that they will do that, and we'll obviously work with the club and the league to consider any operationally necessary changes."" The club has already sold tickets for its game at home to Newcastle on Sunday and Chelsea are set to travel to Lille for a Champions League tie on Wednesday. The home match against Brentford on 2 April is sold out, but tickets will not be able to be sold for games after that. It is unclear what would happen to gate receipts for the club's FA Cup quarter-final against Championship side Middlesbrough on 19 March, with 45% going to each team. Q&A: What do UK government sanctions on Abramovich mean for Chelsea? The Sports Desk: Life after Abramovich - what's next for Chelsea and English football? Chelsea face uncertain future - Tuchel Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel raised the prospect of his players wearing a ""message for peace"" on their shirts, after mobile network provider Three suspended its shirt sponsorship deal with the club. ""Maybe the worry is more to find enough shirts that we can play in, with the sanctions,"" Tuchel added. ""But as long as we have enough shirts, and as long as the bus is full of fuel, we will arrive and we will be competitive. This video can not be played Manager Thomas Tuchel expresses hope for Chelsea in light of sanctions ""This is what everybody can be sure of and this is what we demand of ourselves and when it's a big storm, you dig in, you are all together and then you stay strong and go through it. ""But messages for peace can never be wrong."" Meanwhile, Chelsea fans have been urged tostop chantingin support of Abramovich, after supporters sang the Russian's name during Chelsea's win at Norwich on Thursday. Technology minister Chris Philp told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that fans need to remember Abramovich has close ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin, whose regime has committed ""barbaric acts"" in Ukraine. Premier League managers gave their views on the sanctioning of Abramovich for the first time on Friday. Former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte - now in charge at Tottenham - said: ""It's very sad that this serious situation, this war between Russia and Ukraine, is affecting football and the sporting world. ""To know that Russia athletes are banned from competition is very sad. I think it's not fair. I know very well the work that they do every day for this competition. ""You have to pay for this situation, I think it's not right. Honestly, I hoped the situation is going to be solved, because it's creating a lot of damage. We're in 2022 and to see this is horrible for everybody."" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp sympathised with employees at Chelsea but believes the government was ""right"" to sanction Abramovich because ""he is close"" to Putin. Newcastle manager Eddie Howe believes the sanctions will not change how Chelsea perform, while Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers - who previously worked at Chelsea as a youth and reserve-team coach - said Tuchel's situation is challenging. ""I've total empathy for him and for the players, but they're very professional,"" said Rodgers. ""They're an outstanding team and I'm sure they'll focus on that element between now and the end of the season.""

She said: ""I will do everything in my power to deliver recommendations as soon as possible, to ensure that in any future pandemic, the suffering and hardship many of you have experienced is reduced or prevented."" Baroness Hallett has launched a consultation on the draft terms of reference of the inquiry, running until 7 April, which will set out the scope of its investigation. She said her team would be visiting towns and cities across the four nations of the UK to gather the views of bereaved families, community and support groups. Baroness Hallett pledged to run ""an independent, thorough and open inquiry"" and said that the pandemic had had an ""unprecedented impact on everyone"" in the UK. Under the current draft terms of reference, the inquiry aims to produce ""a factual, narrative account"" covering decision-making at all levels of government and the response of the health and care sector as well as identifying the ""lessons to be learned"". The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group welcomed the publication of the terms of reference as a ""huge step forward"" and said it looked forward to contributing to the consultation on the terms. The Scottish government has itsown Covid-19 inquiry, to be led by Judge Lady Poole, but Northern Ireland is not holding its own at this stage. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has resisted calls to hold a Wales-specific inquiry and has encouraged people to contribute to the consultation on the UK inquiry. On Friday a further 72,898 coronavirus cases were reported across the UK with a further 114 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It comes as the Office for National Statistics saidinfections are rising across the UK, with about one-in-25 people infected, according to the latest estimates. Several reports have already put the UK government's handling of the pandemic under the spotlight. A report by MPs onthe Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committeelast October said the UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures. Meanwhile,spending watchdog the National Audit Officefound ministers were not properly prepared for a pandemic like Covid-19 and lacked detailed plans on shielding, job support schemes and school disruption. The government said the unprecedented pandemic had challenged health systems around the world - not just the UK.

Satellites show Russia convoy regrouping near Kyiv,"Satellite images taken by a US firm of a large Russian military convoy near Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, show it has ""largely dispersed and redeployed"". The convoy was last seen near Antonov Airport, north-west of Kyiv, and its movement could signal a renewed push towards the city. The firm that took the photos, Maxar Technologies, said parts of the convoy were in positions in surrounding towns. Other parts are further north, with artillery now in firing positions. The apparent redeployment came as Russian forces in Ukraine began attacking new targets in different areas of the country: An airfield and jet engine factory were targeted in Lutsk, in the north-west Explosions also hit airfields at Ivano-Frankivsk, in the south-west, according to Russian defence officials In Dnipro, a major stronghold in central eastern Ukraine, one person was reported dead in air strikes Sarah Rainsford, Eastern Europe correspondent, Dnipro The air raid sirens went off at 04:30 and wailed for more than three hours. We now know the danger was real. Officials here say there were three air strikes, hitting a small shoe factory, an apartment block and a kindergarten. This city is full of heavy industry, including a rocket factory. There is a metalworks nearby the site that was hit, but no obvious military target. Dnipro has been bracing for this since the war began. All the bridges and main roads here are heavily guarded. Residents have got used to scrambling to underground shelters when the sirens sound. Even so, the city has been something of a safe haven, for people fleeing cities under sustained Russian attack. In the past few days, residents here had begun leaving: we saw giant queues for evacuation trains and the roads west out of town have been heavily congested. Now the city has been directly hit, I suspect more will be thinking of getting out. ""Ukrainian big cities are again subjected to devastating blows,"" said Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak. He added that the shelling in Lutsk had shut down two central heating compounds. ""Russia's destructive war against civilians and major cities continues,"" he said. Russian state media reported that the Ukrainian city of Volnovakha had been captured by Russian-backed separatist forces. There is no independent confirmation of the capture of the city, which is a northern gateway to the besieged port city of Mariupol. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground OCCUPIED CITY:'We are not co-operating' RUSSIA MOTHERS:'How do I get my soldier son back?' EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected Russian claims that chemical weapons or weapons of mass destruction were developed in Ukraine. In a video address, he also warned that Russia would get ""the most severe sanctions response"" if it were to use such weapons against Ukraine. The US said earlier that Russia's claims of Ukraine hosting US-backed chemical weapons facilities was a ""false flag"", intended to justify Russia's possible use of such weapons. Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday to discuss the alleged manufacture of biological weapons in Ukraine. Russian forces moved three miles (5km) closer to Kyiv in the past 24 hours, a senior US defence official said on Thursday. That meant Russian troops advancing from the north-west were now just nine miles from the city centre, the official - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told reporters. Russian forces were also trying to close in on the city from the north-east, and were now about 25 miles (40km) away, the official said. The northern city of Chernihiv was now ""isolated"" the official added. Why has Russia's 64km convoy stopped moving? The convoy was earlier seen stalled not far from the capital, where US officials said it was targeted by Ukrainian troops with anti-tank missiles. It is not clear how many of the vehicles currently seen on the move may have been an initial part of that first group. Fierce battles have been raging in recent days in Irpin and Bucha, satellite towns just a few kilometres north-west of Kyiv. Thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes. On Thursday, footage emerged apparently showing a Russian military column being hit by Ukrainian forces near the city of Brovary, just outside the capital. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko says that half the population of the city of about three million has already fled, adding that Kyiv ""has been transformed into a fortress"". ""Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified,"" the mayor said. Tens of thousands of civilians have formed Territorial Defence units to help the Ukrainian armed forces defend the capital.

On the front line of the battle for Kharkiv,"Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky In the early days of the invasion, Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine fought back a Russian armoured column. Since then, it has suffered nightly Russian airstrikes and shelling, with dozens of civilians killed and hundreds injured. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway have spent the week with the Ukrainian forces as they fight to stop a further Russian advance. This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing The first casualty of war is time. Ask the young soldier at the front when the attack happened, or the old lady in the hospital bed when her home was shelled, and they look at you confused. Was it 24 hours ago, or 48? The days have become one, they tell you. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, time is elastic. It's close to the border with Russia and the nightly shelling from Russian artillery and warplanes gives no rest. The past two weeks have seemed like an eternity, yet peace can be remembered as if it were yesterday. In a frozen landscape on the city's north-eastern edge, 21-year-old Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky stands with hands outstretched. There are trenches dug in nearby.  ""Outgoing,"" he says, lifting his right hand to accompany the thump of fire from his positions. ""Incoming,"" he says, and his left hand ticks up. With a crump, Russian shells are fired from their positions 900m away across snow-covered fields. The shelling continues like clockwork at the edge of this bombed-out village - ""Incoming, outgoing, incoming, outgoing,"" Lt Gromadsky flicks his hands with each report. We met only this afternoon, but already I know that just last week, his father Oleg was killed defending the city, and Lt Gromadsky is the seventh generation of military in his family. He plans for an eighth, in a free Ukraine. He describes the fight so far, ""Sabotage groups are probing our lines out, we have direct tank battles. They shoot with mortar shells at first, and then tanks fire at our positions."" We move along the front lines from position to position. Inside his armoured vehicle, a Russian army hat - a trophy from their first capture - hanging from the ceiling, he continues, ""We are shooting back with anti-tank guided missiles and also the usual small arms. They dismount, they scatter, there's always a lot of people."" Inside the truck there are Mexican Day of the Dead air fresheners. Grinning skulls hanging from every corner as we bounce along rutted dirt road. On the floor, rocket-propelled grenade launchers roll around. From the front passenger seat Lt Gromadsky says, ""Sometimes they use this tactic - first, they raise a white flag above their equipment, then come closer to our positions. When we come up and kind of take them as prisoners of war, they start to open fire on our troops."" The position was attacked on Monday (or was it the day before, he wonders), two Russian tanks and an armoured vehicle. ""Don't worry, we are well defended,"" he says as he gestures to a pile of American-made Javelin guided anti-tank missiles. ""Lockheed Martin, Texas,"" is written on their casing. Nearby, is a pile of British next-generation light anti-tank weapon (NLAW) missiles. ""Eliminates even the most advanced tanks,"" its manufacturer Saab promises on its website. It is bitterly cold and two puppies are playing around Lt Gromadsky's feet. His shoes are a pair of white Puma trainers - ""You need to be fast out here,"" he says. The Ukrainians are improvising in this war. Their government has been criticised for being ill-prepared, and now there is a rush to bring men forward to the front. The regular army is being merged with civilian defence forces. At a marshalling point on the city's eastern edge, I watch as buses arrive with hundreds of freshly equipped soldiers. ""Where's my body armour?"" asks one. ""You'll get it at the front,"" yells an officer, and moments later they are gone. This video can not be played Watch: Our correspondent on the front line, with Ukraineâs troops - this report contains graphic images of casualties Some will be joining Lt Gromadsky's unit and working alongside a medic who goes by the name of Reaper. ""You've heard of the grim reaper, right?"" he asks. He's also in command of this defence line at the edge of a village. Many of the homes there have been destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. How are the Russians fighting, I ask. ""They fight like stupid animals,"" says Reaper. ""They fight like it's 1941 - they have no manoeuvrability, they just come to the front and that's all. They have a lot of people, a lot of tanks, a lot of vehicles, but we are fighting for our land, and we are protecting our families. it doesn't matter how they fight because we fight like lions and they won't win."" Back in the rear, the field kitchen is in a coffee shop. The army cook is reassuringly large with a knitted hat atop his head. He offers bowls of steaming hot borscht - ""Have sour cream with it,"" he insists. There are piles of cakes and biscuits, made by local factories for the troops. I sit beside a 30-year-old battalion commander, Sergey. ""We see the enemy, we kill the enemy, there's no conversation, that's it,"" he says. He wants to know where I'm from. I tell him and he asks if it's true that British volunteers have come to fight for Ukraine. ""What aircraft have you given us,"" he says as he finishes his borscht. Battalion commander Sergey But across the east and south of Ukraine, Russia has been advancing. The Russian army has met more determined resistance than it expected, but cities continue to fall. And for all their front-line courage, there is a recognition that their abilities on the ground will not be enough. Soldier after soldier says they need air defence, a no-fly zone. I get inside another armoured vehicle, which two weeks ago was doing cash pickups at the city's banks. It, too, has now been put into the war effort. As we drive through the city, with its wide boulevards, and fine buildings, we reach a Soviet-Era apartment complex. And there I meet Eugene, a great Viking of a man, heavily tattooed with an orange beard. Eugene is part of a reconnaissance team ""If Kharkiv falls, then all of Ukraine falls,"" Eugene, 36,  tells me. He's a part of a reconnaissance team working near apartment blocks. Some of the flats have taken direct hits and in the car park, a car lies ripped apart from another grad missile strike. What there isn't here in Kharkiv, is any surprise at the Russian attack. ""Since 2014 we knew they would come, maybe in a year, 10 years, or 1,000 years, but we knew they would come"". At 04:55 on 24 February, Eugene received a call from a friend saying the attack was about to begin. ""Then I heard the rockets attack our city,"" he says. Like everyone else he hasn't been home since. Viewers in the UK can watch an extended report from Kharkiv on BBC iPlayer Leaving the front to return to the centre of the city is almost like entering another world. The relentless Russian shelling has meant that most of the 1.5m population has fled. Few neighbourhoods have escaped some kind of damage. Early in the mornings, queues can still be seen at pharmacies, banks, supermarkets and petrol stations, as those who stayed behind stock up on supplies. A huge logistical and humanitarian effort is going on behind the scenes to keep Kharkiv running. Before curfew I make my way to the city's Hospital Number 4 to meet Dr Alexander Dukhovskyi, head of paediatrics. Underneath his hospital whites, he's wearing a Miami Beach 2015 T-shirt, with the American flag. He hasn't gone home in weeks. This video can not be played Watch: How Russia is using tactics refined over a decade in Syria He laughs when I say that Russia says it isn't targeting civilians. Then, silently, he takes me down corridor after corridor of victims of Russian attacks. They are in the hallways because Russian shells have landed nearby, so the patients aren't safe in the wards with large windows. Most here were injured while at home. The children's intensive care unit is on the ground floor. Its narrow windows catch the brilliant light from the snow outside and glint over the golden icons of saints above the nurses' station. Dmitry in intensive care In a bed nearby is eight-year-old Dmitry. His toes poke out from under the blanket and a hand, bruised and bloodied peeks out too. His face is scraped and scarred with hundreds of marks, his right eye is not quite closed. A few days ago, the doctors removed a bullet from under his skull and vertebrae. It is hoped he'll make a full recovery, but for the moment he's in a sorry state, with tubes taking out fluids from his small body in plastic bottles hanging beneath his bed. The thin blanket with tiny roses on it, rises and falls with his mechanical breathing. This video can not be played Watch: Doctors removed a bullet from between Dmitriy's skull and vertebrae Vladimir Putin said he wanted to demilitarise Ukraine, instead he's creating a no-man's land. At night the city is in near total blackout. A steady beat of Russian strikes fall through the night. Kharkiv was once Ukraine's capital - it has the parks, cathedrals, museums and theatres you would expect, as well as the Antonov aircraft factory and tank and turbine manufacturers. All of the city is now a front line. And this, too, should come as no surprise. The Russian war-playbook has been perfected in Syria over the past 10 years. Surround, besiege, and terrorise the population. In Ukraine, as in Syria, the population is being bussed out of their home cities as Russian forces continue their advance. But still Ukraine resists. I meet an intelligence team, who drive with anti-tank missiles ready to use in the back of their vehicles. Again, I head to the city's edge, and pass through the front lines into a wasteland. Two petrol stations just outside the city that have been destroyed by shelling and gunfire. Lying in the snow, are a dozen or so frozen Russian corpses. The men lie like wax figures, some with hands reaching out, their matted beards frozen stiff in the cold. The guts of one are spilled across the forecourt. There are blood-red footprints around his corpse. Their weapons have been taken, and I ask Uta, one of the officers, what will happen to the bodies. ""What do you think will happen, we will leave them for the dogs,"" he says with a shrug. And at this miserable spot on Kharkiv's edge, unremarkable for its ordinariness two weeks ago, surrounded by frozen corpses, it's as if time is standing still. Are you or your family in Ukraine?

Fact-checking Russia's biological weapons claims,"Russian state TV has been showing sites which officials say are being used to develop bioweapons Russia has claimed without any evidence that biological weapons are being developed in laboratories in Ukraine with support from the United States. It says material is being destroyed to conceal the country's weapons programme, but the US says this is ""total nonsense"" and that Russia is inventing false narratives to justify its actions in Ukraine. Russia has accused the US and Ukraine of working with ""pathogens of dangerous infections"" in 30 laboratories across the country. Pathogens are microorganisms that can cause disease. Ukraine has dozens of public health laboratories that work to research and mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases. Some of these labs receive financial and other support from the US, the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO) - as is the case in many other countries. Despite Russian claims that these are ""secret"" labs, details of US involvement can be found on the US embassy's website. The US says it funds work in Ukrainian labs to tackle dangerous diseases Additionally, the US set up its ""Biological Threat Reduction Program,external"" in the 1990s following the fall of the Soviet Union to reduce the risk from biological weapons that had been left behind in countries including Ukraine. Under this programme certain labs receive funding from the US for modernisation and equipment, but are managed locally, not by the US. The US Department of Defense has been working inpartnership with Ukraine's Ministry of Health since 2005,externalto improve the country's public health laboratories. The US provides technical support and, according to the US Embassy in Ukraine, ""works with partner countries to counter the threat of outbreaks (intentional, accidental or natural) of the world's most dangerous infectious diseases"". There is no evidence that they work to produce biological weapons. In January,the US said its programme does the opposite,externaland in fact aims to ""reduce the threat of biological weapons proliferation"". There have beensimilar unsubstantiated claims by Russia in the past,externalabout US-backed biolabs operating in its neighbouring countries. This video can not be played The BBC's Steve Rosenberg investigates Russian disinformation and the Georgian 'lab of death' In 2018, there were reports in Russian state media that untested drugs were given to citizens at a lab funded by the US in neighbouring Georgia. The BBC visited the site and spoke to individuals involved in the research andfound no evidence to support the claims. What are chemical weapons and could Russia use them? Russian officials have also claimed Ukraine has tried to conceal evidence of prohibited activities. Gen Igor Kirillov said documents uncovered by the Russian military in Ukraine on 24 February - the day the Russian invasion started - ""show that the Ministry of Health of Ukraine has set the task of completely destroying bio-agents in laboratories"". ""The Pentagon knows that if these documents fall into the hands of Russian experts, then it's highly likely that Ukraine and the United States will be found to have violated the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons,"" he said. One of the documents Russian officials say they recovered from Ukraine BBC News has been unable to independently verify the documents cited by General Kirillov. The WHO has told BBC News that it had advised Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens stored at the country's public health labs to prevent ""any potential spills"" that would spread disease among the population. The agency said it had collaborated with Ukrainian public health labs for several years to enhance biosafety and biosecurity and help prevent ""accidental or deliberate release of pathogens"". The WHO did not say when the recommendation had been made nor whether it was followed. It also did not provide details of the kind of pathogens stored at Ukrainian labs. However, the US said Ukraine's health ministry had ordered the ""safe and secure disposal of samples"" after Russia's invasion to limit the risk in the event of a Russian military attack. ""There are no indications that Ukrainian labs have been involved in any nefarious activity, or any research or development in contravention of the Biological Weapons Convention,"" says Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity expert at King's College London. She adds that pathogens stored at biological labs are simply bacteria and viruses, and ""not blueprints or components of biological weapons"". ""The reason they are kept in secure facilities is for bio-safety, so people don't make themselves sick by getting access to them."" The documents listing destroyed pathogens which Russian officials have presented as evidence of nefarious activity at several Ukrainian labs contain no highly dangerous pathogens, microbiologist Yevgeny Levitintold Sibir Realii, a regional outlet of Radio Liberty,external. ""Everything listed in the published documents are only notional pathogens, with the exception of Clostridium diphtheriae, but even that is not considered highly hazardous"". Gen Kirillov also claimed that the highly militarised nature of the work at Ukrainian bio-labs is confirmed by ""excess number of bio-pathogens"" stored there. But Dr Lentzos says this argument does not follow any logical science. ""The numbers don't really matter, you can easily grow pathogens in a lab"" starting from a small sample. ""These labs publish in openly available literature. They collaborate on many public health projects with global partners,"" says Brett Edwards, a senior lecturer in security and public policy at the University of Bath. ""Devoting considerable sums of money and significant resources to conducting bioweapons research makes no strategic sense for  Ukraine given the difficulty in using them in a conflict,"" argues Dan Kaszeta, a former US serviceman and expert on defence against biological weapons. ""Conventional warfare weapons are much easier and more effective to use for countries like Ukraine,"" he said. Moscow's claims about the Ukrainian labs were echoed by China this week, with foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian accusing the US of using the facilities to""conduct bio-military plans"",external. Similar accusations have also been made by Iranian and Syrian officials. Although the allegations have been echoed elsewhere, ""most of the Russian messaging is meant to target their own population"", according to Milton Leitenberg, a senior research associate at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland (CISSM). He said the claims were meant to ""muddy up the minds of Russian citizens"" who did not know they were false and had no access to alternative information.

India accidentally fires missile into Pakistan,"Both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons India says it accidentally fired a missile into Pakistan on Wednesday, blaming the incident on a ""technical malfunction"" during routine maintenance. Delhi said it was ""deeply regrettable"" and expressed relief no one was killed. Pakistan's military said a ""high-speed flying object"" had crashed near the eastern city of Mian Channu and its flight path had endangered passenger flights. Both countries have nuclear weapons. In a statement, India's defence ministry said: ""On 9 March 2022, in the course of routine maintenance, a technical malfunction led to the accidental firing of a missile. The Government of India has taken a serious view and ordered a high-level Court of Enquiry."" Islamabad warned Delhi to ""be mindful of the unpleasant consequences of such negligence"" and to avoid a repeat. The object had been launched from Sirsa in Haryana state, it said. Pakistan's air force said the missile travelled at Mach 3 - three times the speed of sound - at an altitude of 12,000m (40,000ft) and flew 124km (77 miles) in Pakistani airspace before crashing. ""The flight path of this object endangered many national and international passenger flights both in Indian and Pakistani airspace, as well as human life and property on the ground,"" said Pakistani military spokesman Major-General Babar Iftikhar on Thursday. On Friday, Pakistan's foreign ministry said it had summoned India's chargÃ© d'affaires to complain about the incident. Pakistan also urged India to share the findings of its investigation into what happened.

Sunak warns of 'significant economic uncertainty',"Russia's invasion of Ukraine means significant uncertainty for the UK economy, the chancellor has warned. This is despite UK growth bouncing back in January as the effects of the Omicron Covid variant began to ease. The economy grew by 0.8% compared with a 0.2% contraction in Decemberthe Office for National Statistics said,external. But one industry body warned the UK faced a higher risk of recession as the impact of the Ukraine conflict would add to the sharp rise in living costs. UK households were already facing sharply rising costs before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in part due to soaring energy costs. The conflict in Ukraine pushed the price of oil to its highest level for nearly 14 years at one point and this has had a knock-on impact on fuel costs, with UK petrol prices hitting record highs. Gas prices have also soared, leading to warnings thataverage energy bills could reach Â£3,000 per yearin October, after rising to Â£2,000 in April when the energy price cap is raised. Grain prices have also jumped as both Russia and Ukraine are major global producers, particularly of wheat. ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased the risk of a recession in the UK by exacerbating the already acute inflationary squeeze on consumers and businesses and derailing the supply of critical commodities to many sectors of the economy,"" said Suren Thiru from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). Mr Thiru said January's growth was now like looking into a rear-view mirror. What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? What is GDP and how does it affect me? Borrow billions or see incomes hit, Sunak told The bounce back in the economy in January was not just stronger than expected, it was also seen in buoyant tax revenues. The effect of the Omicron Covid variant proved to be a blip, as wholesalers, retailers and IT and communication services pushed growth up. Consumer-facing services - restaurants, bars, entertainment, and travel - are still 6.8% below the level before the pandemic. All in all, the economy was on course to maintain its return to normal after the pandemic. However, the cost of living and energy squeeze was already weighing on the economy. The economic consequences of the Ukraine invasion are pushing both inflation and growth in the wrong direction. While a line may now thankfully be drawn under the pandemic's economic hit, the inflationary cloud is now looking very dark indeed. The ONS figures show the UK's economy rebounded in January, with wholesaling, retailing, restaurants and takeaways all performing well. While supply chain issues continued to dog some sectors, construction and manufacturing both grew, the ONS said. Computer programming and film and TV production also had a good start to the year, said Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics. ""GDP bounced back from the hit it took in December due to the Omicron wave and is now 0.8% above its pre-pandemic peak,"" he said. ""All sectors grew in January with some industries that were hit particularly hard in December now performing well."" Mr Sunak said that Russia's invasion ""is creating significant economic uncertainty"", but ""it is vital that we stand with the people of Ukraine to uphold our shared values of freedom and democracy and ensure Putin fails"". He added that the government had ""provided unprecedented support"" throughout the Covid pandemic, ""which has put our economy in a strong position to deal with current cost of living challenges"". Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said households were facing ""a year of surging inflation, weak earnings growth and tax rises"". He called for the government to halt a plannedNational Insurance increasein April. Mr McFadden also said the government ""must look again at Labour's proposal for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut household energy bills by up to Â£600"". National Insurance: What's the new Health and Social Care tax and what will it cost me? Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the economy had ""rebounded with vigour"" in January, ""the cost of living crisis and the influence of the war in Ukraine probably means this is as good as it gets for the year"". He added that growth ""will probably slow throughout the year"". Despite this, Mr Dales still expects the Bank of England to increase interest rates at its meeting on Thursday next week, with the main Bank rate likely to rise from 0.5% to 0.75%.

"Covid inquiry's public hearings to begin in 2023The inquiry will gather evidence this year and give recommendations ""as soon as possible"", its chair says.UK","The inquiry aims to produce ""a factual, narrative account"" covering decision-making at all levels of government The inquiry into the UK government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic will not hold public hearings until 2023, its chair has said. Baroness Hallett said her team would gather evidence throughout this year and she would try to deliver recommendations ""as soon as possible"". Thedraft terms of referencefor the inquiry were published on Thursday. More than 162,000 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid case across the UK since the pandemic began. The inquiry, which is due to begin in the spring, will look at preparedness for the pandemic, as well as the health, care and economic response. Covid infections rising again across UK - ONS Covid-tracking app funding loss 'a big mistake' Ex-judge to chair Covid pandemic inquiry When will the UK's Covid public inquiry happen? In an open letter,externalBaroness Hallett, a former High Court judge, said that once it had officially begun there would be a chance for people to share their experiences of the pandemic. She said: ""I will do everything in my power to deliver recommendations as soon as possible, to ensure that in any future pandemic, the suffering and hardship many of you have experienced is reduced or prevented."" Baroness Hallett has launched a consultation on the draft terms of reference of the inquiry, running until 7 April, which will set out the scope of its investigation. She said her team would be visiting towns and cities across the four nations of the UK to gather the views of bereaved families, community and support groups. Baroness Hallett pledged to run ""an independent, thorough and open inquiry"" and said that the pandemic had had an ""unprecedented impact on everyone"" in the UK. Under the current draft terms of reference, the inquiry aims to produce ""a factual, narrative account"" covering decision-making at all levels of government and the response of the health and care sector as well as identifying the ""lessons to be learned"". The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group welcomed the publication of the terms of reference as a ""huge step forward"" and said it looked forward to contributing to the consultation on the terms. The Scottish government has itsown Covid-19 inquiry, to be led by Judge Lady Poole, but Northern Ireland is not holding its own at this stage. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has resisted calls to hold a Wales-specific inquiry and has encouraged people to contribute to the consultation on the UK inquiry. On Friday a further 72,898 coronavirus cases were reported across the UK with a further 114 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It comes as the Office for National Statistics saidinfections are rising across the UK, with about one-in-25 people infected, according to the latest estimates. Several reports have already put the UK government's handling of the pandemic under the spotlight. A report by MPs onthe Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committeelast October said the UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures. Meanwhile,spending watchdog the National Audit Officefound ministers were not properly prepared for a pandemic like Covid-19 and lacked detailed plans on shielding, job support schemes and school disruption.

"India accidentally fires missile into PakistanDelhi blames a ""technical malfunction"" for the incident, which it called ""deeply regrettable"".India","Both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons India says it accidentally fired a missile into Pakistan on Wednesday, blaming the incident on a ""technical malfunction"" during routine maintenance. Delhi said it was ""deeply regrettable"" and expressed relief no one was killed. Pakistan's military said a ""high-speed flying object"" had crashed near the eastern city of Mian Channu and its flight path had endangered passenger flights. Both countries have nuclear weapons. In a statement, India's defence ministry said: ""On 9 March 2022, in the course of routine maintenance, a technical malfunction led to the accidental firing of a missile. The Government of India has taken a serious view and ordered a high-level Court of Enquiry."" Islamabad warned Delhi to ""be mindful of the unpleasant consequences of such negligence"" and to avoid a repeat. The object had been launched from Sirsa in Haryana state, it said. Pakistan's air force said the missile travelled at Mach 3 - three times the speed of sound - at an altitude of 12,000m (40,000ft) and flew 124km (77 miles) in Pakistani airspace before crashing. ""The flight path of this object endangered many national and international passenger flights both in Indian and Pakistani airspace, as well as human life and property on the ground,"" said Pakistani military spokesman Major-General Babar Iftikhar on Thursday. On Friday, Pakistan's foreign ministry said it had summoned India's chargÃ© d'affaires to complain about the incident. Pakistan also urged India to share the findings of its investigation into what happened.

US moves to ban Russian diamonds and vodka,"US President Joe Biden has announced a ban on imports of Russian diamonds, seafood and vodka in the latest response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The US, European Union and other allies also plan to revoke Russiaâs status as an equal trade partner, paving the way for further economic punishment. The moves add to sanctions that have isolated Russia economically since the invasion. Its currency has collapsed, while global firms rush to exit the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin has likened Western sanctions on banks and oligarchs to a declaration of war. Moscow has also threatened to nationalise production plants or factories where work has been suspended. Western allies announced further economic retaliation on Friday. The European Union said it would ban imports of key Russian iron and steel products and bar new energy investments in the country, while theUK put sanctions on hundreds of Russian politicians. The US, EU and UK also said they would cut off shipments of luxury goods to Russia. Mr Biden said the latest steps will be ""another crushing blow to the Russian economy"". What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? How Asia is divided over Russia sanctions Under international rules, designating a country a ""most favoured nation"" provides reciprocal trade privileges such as lower tariffs, taxes imposed at the border. Stripping Russia of that status clears the way for higher tariffs on key products it sells such as mineral fuels, fertilisers and metals. Mr Biden said he was coordinating the plans with the European Union and other advanced economies, including Canada and Japan, each of which will take similar steps. In the US, Congress, which must act for the move to go into effect, has already declared itself in favour of the move. Most Favoured Nation (MFN) is a status conferred by membership of the World Trade Organisation. It might sound as though it confers special advantages, but that's not really the case. In fact, it is a baseline designed to ensure all World Trade Organisation members are treated equally, unless they are members of a specific free trade area or agreement. Under normal circumstances, it limits countries' ability to impose trade barriers against one another - or offer individual countries special concessions. By removing this status from Russia, G7 countries will be able to target its exports with punitive tariffs, or taxes. In fact one of them, Canada, has already done so. Last week it imposed tariffs of 35% on all products coming from Russia and its compliant ally, Belarus. In order to do this, Canada relied on an exemption contained in one of the WTO agreements, which allows members to take action they consider necessary to protect their ""essential security interests"". It is likely the others will do the same. In addition, Western allies said they planned to cut Russia off from accessing finance from international organisations such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. ""Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order,"" the G7, a group of seven advanced economies including the UK, said in a statement. The US ban on key Russian imports will deny Mr Putin more than $1bn in revenue, the White House said, while the ban on US exports of luxury goods hits trade worth about $550m per year. That is just a fraction of the roughly $28bn worth of trade the US and Russia exchanged in 2019. Mr Biden promised further measures, including tightening sanctions on oligarchs and their families. ""We're going to continue to squeeze Putin,"" Mr Biden said. ""He is the aggressor and... must pay the price."" Economists say the sanctions previously announced will throw Russia into a severe economic recession this year. But it is not clear that the economic disarray has altered Mr Putin's military ambitions. At a press conference on Thursday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked when the weight of the sanctions might lead to a change in Mr Putin's actions. ""Our objective of course is to bring an end to this conflict, she said. ""In terms of when that will happen, I'm unfortunately not in the mind of President Putin.... When it will change his calculus, I can't give a prediction of that.""

Petrol price hits new record above Â£1.60 a litre,"Petrol prices have risen above Â£1.60 a litre on average for the first time as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to affect the cost of oil worldwide. Unleaded petrol hit Â£1.61 a litre on Thursday, having risen by 8p in a week, while diesel reached Â£1.70 a litre. The RAC said wholesale fuel costs had dropped for two days in a row, but warned prices at the pump are set to remain high for some time. The rise in fuel costs has led to a squeeze on margins for businesses. North East Coach Travel, based in Newcastle upon Tyne, warned it could end up running its services at a loss. Jenna Rush, the firm's managing director, said most of its bookings were agreed last year and did not take into account such a sharp rise in costs sparked by the economic fallout from the Ukraine war. ""It's just awful, it's a very, very stressful time,"" Ms Rush told the BBC's Today programme. ""We tendered as far back as last year for this type of work, no one envisaged that the fuel prices would increase as much as they have. ""At the moment we're scared that we are going to be running at a loss when it keeps increasing."" Ms Rush warned the rising costs could lead to some operators pulling out of contracts. She said the company was trying to renegotiate prices with customers, but added it was proving ""very, very difficult"". ""The profit margins are too small that we just can't absorb them costs ourselves, not coming off the back of Covid anyway. It's been a very hard two years. We've been beginning to see the green shoots of recovery coming through but now this is just another kick in the teeth."" The RAC motoring group said it was costing over Â£88 on average to fill up a car with petrol. It called on the government to reduce VAT on fuel, which it said added 28p on the cost of petrol or diesel per litre. How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices? Fuel price jump will hit food bills, industry says Customers abusing forecourt staff over fuel prices Fuel prices have been rising amid fears of a global economic shock from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Oil prices are mainly determined by the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate, as agreements are made in dollars. Russia is the third largest oil exporter and some Western countries, for example the US and Canada, decided to halt imports from the country in response to Russia's actions. It means demand for oil from other producers has increased, leading to increased prices. At one point Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices -  jumped to $139 a barrel, the highest level for almost 14 years. The UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, so is not as dependent on Russia for the commodity supply as other European countries are and has said it plans to phase it out. It is, however, affected by the global shifts in price. But early on Friday the price of Brent crude was on track for its biggest weekly drop since November and was trading at about $107. The drop in price is party due to reduced fears of a European ban on Russian oil, and partly due to speculation that extra supplies could come onto the market from Iran, Venezuela and the UAE. Yet higher prices at the pumps are likely to remain in the coming weeks, due to the way retailers buy the fuel, Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for the RAC said. ""There is a real hope that these prices will filter through,"" he said. ""We would really hope these drops will take some of the heat out of the rising prices so we won't have records set on a daily basis."" But Mr Williams said there was a concern retailers might be reluctant to lower their prices for fear of ""catching a cold"" if wholesale costs jump back up again. It means for the time being, firms such as North East Coach Travel will have to continue to bare the brunt of higher fuel prices. ""This could be the straw that breaks the camel's back with some operators where they just hand the contracts back and say, 'I'm done, I can't continue anymore',"" said Ms Rush. ""People are already stressing about how they're going to manage themselves with filling their own car up, paying their own gas and electric that's increasing at home. How are they going to keep managing to pay out for further things?"" The UK is experiencing rising prices for energy, food as well as fuel as the economy recovers from the pandemic, and some expect the inflation rate to reach 8% later this year.

Sunak warns of 'significant economic uncertainty'The UK economy rebounds in January but the chancellor warns of uncertainty due to the invasion of Ukraine.BusinessComments,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine means significant uncertainty for the UK economy, the chancellor has warned. This is despite UK growth bouncing back in January as the effects of the Omicron Covid variant began to ease. The economy grew by 0.8% compared with a 0.2% contraction in Decemberthe Office for National Statistics said,external. But one industry body warned the UK faced a higher risk of recession as the impact of the Ukraine conflict would add to the sharp rise in living costs. UK households were already facing sharply rising costs before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in part due to soaring energy costs. The conflict in Ukraine pushed the price of oil to its highest level for nearly 14 years at one point and this has had a knock-on impact on fuel costs, with UK petrol prices hitting record highs. Gas prices have also soared, leading to warnings thataverage energy bills could reach Â£3,000 per yearin October, after rising to Â£2,000 in April when the energy price cap is raised. Grain prices have also jumped as both Russia and Ukraine are major global producers, particularly of wheat. ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased the risk of a recession in the UK by exacerbating the already acute inflationary squeeze on consumers and businesses and derailing the supply of critical commodities to many sectors of the economy,"" said Suren Thiru from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).

On the front line of the battle for KharkivQuentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway are with Ukrainian forces fighting to stop the Russian advance on the country's second city.Europe,"Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky In the early days of the invasion, Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine fought back a Russian armoured column. Since then, it has suffered nightly Russian airstrikes and shelling, with dozens of civilians killed and hundreds injured. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway have spent the week with the Ukrainian forces as they fight to stop a further Russian advance. This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing The first casualty of war is time. Ask the young soldier at the front when the attack happened, or the old lady in the hospital bed when her home was shelled, and they look at you confused. Was it 24 hours ago, or 48? The days have become one, they tell you. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, time is elastic. It's close to the border with Russia and the nightly shelling from Russian artillery and warplanes gives no rest. The past two weeks have seemed like an eternity, yet peace can be remembered as if it were yesterday. In a frozen landscape on the city's north-eastern edge, 21-year-old Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky stands with hands outstretched. There are trenches dug in nearby.  ""Outgoing,"" he says, lifting his right hand to accompany the thump of fire from his positions. ""Incoming,"" he says, and his left hand ticks up. With a crump, Russian shells are fired from their positions 900m away across snow-covered fields. The shelling continues like clockwork at the edge of this bombed-out village - ""Incoming, outgoing, incoming, outgoing,"" Lt Gromadsky flicks his hands with each report. We met only this afternoon, but already I know that just last week, his father Oleg was killed defending the city, and Lt Gromadsky is the seventh generation of military in his family. He plans for an eighth, in a free Ukraine. He describes the fight so far, ""Sabotage groups are probing our lines out, we have direct tank battles. They shoot with mortar shells at first, and then tanks fire at our positions."" We move along the front lines from position to position. Inside his armoured vehicle, a Russian army hat - a trophy from their first capture - hanging from the ceiling, he continues, ""We are shooting back with anti-tank guided missiles and also the usual small arms. They dismount, they scatter, there's always a lot of people."" Inside the truck there are Mexican Day of the Dead air fresheners. Grinning skulls hanging from every corner as we bounce along rutted dirt road. On the floor, rocket-propelled grenade launchers roll around. From the front passenger seat Lt Gromadsky says, ""Sometimes they use this tactic - first, they raise a white flag above their equipment, then come closer to our positions. When we come up and kind of take them as prisoners of war, they start to open fire on our troops."" The position was attacked on Monday (or was it the day before, he wonders), two Russian tanks and an armoured vehicle. ""Don't worry, we are well defended,"" he says as he gestures to a pile of American-made Javelin guided anti-tank missiles. ""Lockheed Martin, Texas,"" is written on their casing. Nearby, is a pile of British next-generation light anti-tank weapon (NLAW) missiles. ""Eliminates even the most advanced tanks,"" its manufacturer Saab promises on its website. It is bitterly cold and two puppies are playing around Lt Gromadsky's feet. His shoes are a pair of white Puma trainers - ""You need to be fast out here,"" he says. The Ukrainians are improvising in this war. Their government has been criticised for being ill-prepared, and now there is a rush to bring men forward to the front. The regular army is being merged with civilian defence forces. At a marshalling point on the city's eastern edge, I watch as buses arrive with hundreds of freshly equipped soldiers. ""Where's my body armour?"" asks one. ""You'll get it at the front,"" yells an officer, and moments later they are gone. This video can not be played Watch: Our correspondent on the front line, with Ukraineâs troops - this report contains graphic images of casualties Some will be joining Lt Gromadsky's unit and working alongside a medic who goes by the name of Reaper. ""You've heard of the grim reaper, right?"" he asks. He's also in command of this defence line at the edge of a village. Many of the homes there have been destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. How are the Russians fighting, I ask. ""They fight like stupid animals,"" says Reaper. ""They fight like it's 1941 - they have no manoeuvrability, they just come to the front and that's all. They have a lot of people, a lot of tanks, a lot of vehicles, but we are fighting for our land, and we are protecting our families. it doesn't matter how they fight because we fight like lions and they won't win."" Back in the rear, the field kitchen is in a coffee shop. The army cook is reassuringly large with a knitted hat atop his head. He offers bowls of steaming hot borscht - ""Have sour cream with it,"" he insists. There are piles of cakes and biscuits, made by local factories for the troops. I sit beside a 30-year-old battalion commander, Sergey. ""We see the enemy, we kill the enemy, there's no conversation, that's it,"" he says. He wants to know where I'm from. I tell him and he asks if it's true that British volunteers have come to fight for Ukraine. ""What aircraft have you given us,"" he says as he finishes his borscht. Battalion commander Sergey But across the east and south of Ukraine, Russia has been advancing. The Russian army has met more determined resistance than it expected, but cities continue to fall. And for all their front-line courage, there is a recognition that their abilities on the ground will not be enough. Soldier after soldier says they need air defence, a no-fly zone. I get inside another armoured vehicle, which two weeks ago was doing cash pickups at the city's banks. It, too, has now been put into the war effort. As we drive through the city, with its wide boulevards, and fine buildings, we reach a Soviet-Era apartment complex. And there I meet Eugene, a great Viking of a man, heavily tattooed with an orange beard. Eugene is part of a reconnaissance team ""If Kharkiv falls, then all of Ukraine falls,"" Eugene, 36,  tells me. He's a part of a reconnaissance team working near apartment blocks. Some of the flats have taken direct hits and in the car park, a car lies ripped apart from another grad missile strike. What there isn't here in Kharkiv, is any surprise at the Russian attack. ""Since 2014 we knew they would come, maybe in a year, 10 years, or 1,000 years, but we knew they would come"". At 04:55 on 24 February, Eugene received a call from a friend saying the attack was about to begin. ""Then I heard the rockets attack our city,"" he says. Like everyone else he hasn't been home since. Viewers in the UK can watch an extended report from Kharkiv on BBC iPlayer Leaving the front to return to the centre of the city is almost like entering another world. The relentless Russian shelling has meant that most of the 1.5m population has fled. Few neighbourhoods have escaped some kind of damage. Early in the mornings, queues can still be seen at pharmacies, banks, supermarkets and petrol stations, as those who stayed behind stock up on supplies. A huge logistical and humanitarian effort is going on behind the scenes to keep Kharkiv running. Before curfew I make my way to the city's Hospital Number 4 to meet Dr Alexander Dukhovskyi, head of paediatrics. Underneath his hospital whites, he's wearing a Miami Beach 2015 T-shirt, with the American flag. He hasn't gone home in weeks. This video can not be played Watch: How Russia is using tactics refined over a decade in Syria He laughs when I say that Russia says it isn't targeting civilians. Then, silently, he takes me down corridor after corridor of victims of Russian attacks. They are in the hallways because Russian shells have landed nearby, so the patients aren't safe in the wards with large windows. Most here were injured while at home. The children's intensive care unit is on the ground floor. Its narrow windows catch the brilliant light from the snow outside and glint over the golden icons of saints above the nurses' station. Dmitry in intensive care In a bed nearby is eight-year-old Dmitry. His toes poke out from under the blanket and a hand, bruised and bloodied peeks out too. His face is scraped and scarred with hundreds of marks, his right eye is not quite closed. A few days ago, the doctors removed a bullet from under his skull and vertebrae. It is hoped he'll make a full recovery, but for the moment he's in a sorry state, with tubes taking out fluids from his small body in plastic bottles hanging beneath his bed. The thin blanket with tiny roses on it, rises and falls with his mechanical breathing. This video can not be played Watch: Doctors removed a bullet from between Dmitriy's skull and vertebrae Vladimir Putin said he wanted to demilitarise Ukraine, instead he's creating a no-man's land. At night the city is in near total blackout. A steady beat of Russian strikes fall through the night. Kharkiv was once Ukraine's capital - it has the parks, cathedrals, museums and theatres you would expect, as well as the Antonov aircraft factory and tank and turbine manufacturers. All of the city is now a front line. And this, too, should come as no surprise. The Russian war-playbook has been perfected in Syria over the past 10 years. Surround, besiege, and terrorise the population. In Ukraine, as in Syria, the population is being bussed out of their home cities as Russian forces continue their advance. But still Ukraine resists. I meet an intelligence team, who drive with anti-tank missiles ready to use in the back of their vehicles. Again, I head to the city's edge, and pass through the front lines into a wasteland. Two petrol stations just outside the city that have been destroyed by shelling and gunfire. Lying in the snow, are a dozen or so frozen Russian corpses. The men lie like wax figures, some with hands reaching out, their matted beards frozen stiff in the cold. The guts of one are spilled across the forecourt. There are blood-red footprints around his corpse. Their weapons have been taken, and I ask Uta, one of the officers, what will happen to the bodies. ""What do you think will happen, we will leave them for the dogs,"" he says with a shrug. And at this miserable spot on Kharkiv's edge, unremarkable for its ordinariness two weeks ago, surrounded by frozen corpses, it's as if time is standing still. Are you or your family in Ukraine?

Global Covid deaths probably three times higher,"More than 18 million people - three times higher than official records suggest - have probably died because of Covid, say researchers. Their report comes two years to the day from when the World Health Organization first declared the pandemic. The Covid-19 excess mortality team at the US's Washington University studied 191 countries and territories for what they call the true global death figure. Some deaths were from the virus, while others were linked to the infection. This is because catching Covid might worsen other pre-existing medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease, for example. The measure used is called excess deaths - how many more people have been dying than would be expected compared to recent years, before the pandemic hit. How are different countries faring with Covid? How new drugs are finally taming the virus To calculate this, the researchers gathered data through searches of various government websites, theWorld Mortality Database,,externaltheHuman Mortality Database,,externaland theEuropean Statistical Office.,external Rates of excess deaths are estimated to have varied dramatically by country and region, but the overall global rate calculated in the study is 120 deaths per 100,000 people. That would mean about 18.2 million deaths have happened because of Covid in the two years between the start of 2020 and the end of 2021 - three times as many as the official 5.9 million that have actually been recorded. Excess death estimates were calculated for the full study period only, and not by week or month, because of lags and inconsistencies in reporting of Covid death data that could drastically alter the estimates, the investigators stress. According to the research,which is published in The Lancet,,externalthe highest rates were in lower income countries in Latin America, Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. But deaths were also fairly high in some high-income countries, such as Italy and parts of the US. The five countries with the highest estimated excess death rates were: Bolivia Bulgaria Eswatini North Macedonia Lesotho The five with the lowest were: Iceland Australia Singapore New Zealand Taiwan For the UK, the estimated total number of Covid-related deaths in 2020 and 2021 was similar to official records at about 173,000, with an excess mortality rate of 130 people per 100,000. Lead author Dr Haidong Wang, from theInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation,,externalsaid: ""Understanding the true death toll from the pandemic is vital for effective public health decision-making. ""Studies from several countries, including Sweden and the Netherlands, suggest Covid was the direct cause of most excess deaths, but we currently don't have enough evidence for most locations. ""Further research will help to reveal how many deaths were caused directly by Covid, and how many occurred as an indirect result of the pandemic.""

UK economy grew in January as Omicron eased,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine means significant uncertainty for the UK economy, the chancellor has warned. This is despite UK growth bouncing back in January as the effects of the Omicron Covid variant began to ease. The economy grew by 0.8% compared with a 0.2% contraction in Decemberthe Office for National Statistics said,external. But one industry body warned the UK faced a higher risk of recession as the impact of the Ukraine conflict would add to the sharp rise in living costs. UK households were already facing sharply rising costs before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in part due to soaring energy costs. The conflict in Ukraine pushed the price of oil to its highest level for nearly 14 years at one point and this has had a knock-on impact on fuel costs, with UK petrol prices hitting record highs. Gas prices have also soared, leading to warnings thataverage energy bills could reach Â£3,000 per yearin October, after rising to Â£2,000 in April when the energy price cap is raised. Grain prices have also jumped as both Russia and Ukraine are major global producers, particularly of wheat. ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased the risk of a recession in the UK by exacerbating the already acute inflationary squeeze on consumers and businesses and derailing the supply of critical commodities to many sectors of the economy,"" said Suren Thiru from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). Mr Thiru said January's growth was now like looking into a rear-view mirror. What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? What is GDP and how does it affect me? Borrow billions or see incomes hit, Sunak told The bounce back in the economy in January was not just stronger than expected, it was also seen in buoyant tax revenues. The effect of the Omicron Covid variant proved to be a blip, as wholesalers, retailers and IT and communication services pushed growth up. Consumer-facing services - restaurants, bars, entertainment, and travel - are still 6.8% below the level before the pandemic. All in all, the economy was on course to maintain its return to normal after the pandemic. However, the cost of living and energy squeeze was already weighing on the economy. The economic consequences of the Ukraine invasion are pushing both inflation and growth in the wrong direction. While a line may now thankfully be drawn under the pandemic's economic hit, the inflationary cloud is now looking very dark indeed. The ONS figures show the UK's economy rebounded in January, with wholesaling, retailing, restaurants and takeaways all performing well.

""GDP bounced back from the hit it took in December due to the Omicron wave and is now 0.8% above its pre-pandemic peak,"" he said. ""All sectors grew in January with some industries that were hit particularly hard in December now performing well."" Mr Sunak said that Russia's invasion ""is creating significant economic uncertainty"", but ""it is vital that we stand with the people of Ukraine to uphold our shared values of freedom and democracy and ensure Putin fails"". He added that the government had ""provided unprecedented support"" throughout the Covid pandemic, ""which has put our economy in a strong position to deal with current cost of living challenges"". Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said households were facing ""a year of surging inflation, weak earnings growth and tax rises"". He called for the government to halt a plannedNational Insurance increasein April.

National Insurance: What's the new Health and Social Care tax and what will it cost me? Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the economy had ""rebounded with vigour"" in January, ""the cost of living crisis and the influence of the war in Ukraine probably means this is as good as it gets for the year"". He added that growth ""will probably slow throughout the year"". Despite this, Mr Dales still expects the Bank of England to increase interest rates at its meeting on Thursday next week, with the main Bank rate likely to rise from 0.5% to 0.75%.

MI5 spy Donaldson threat 'not properly evaluated',"Denis Donaldson was shot dead in April 2006 months after he was exposed as a Security Service spy Police failed to properly evaluate the threat informer Denis Donaldson was under before he was shot dead in County Donegal, a report has found. However, Police Ombudsman Marie Anderson said she could not conclude the former Sinn FÃ©in official's murder in 2006 could have been prevented. His family said the police had been negligent in a duty of care to him ""for reasons that remain unexplained"". Mr Donaldson's murder was claimed by the dissident republican Real IRA. Read the ombudsman's report,external The 55 year old, who once held a key administrative role for Sinn FÃ©in at Stormont, admitted in December 2005 that he had been working for MI5 and the police for 20 years. He then moved to a family cottage in Glenties, where he was murdered in April 2006. Mr Donaldson was shot dead at a cottage in Glenties, County Donegal Two weeks before his killing, the Sunday World newspaper published a story on him that included a photograph of him standing outside the property. The Police Ombudsman found no evidence police had leaked information on his whereabouts. Shortly after the story appeared, the PSNI received information indicating Mr Donaldson's life ""may be at increased risk"". This information was shared with An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police). But Mrs Anderson found no evidence of a PSNI risk assessment having been carried out following the Sunday World article. ""It is likely that this important measure to assess the threat to Mr Donaldson's life was not undertaken,"" her report stated. ""I am of the view the family's concerns about the steps taken by PSNI in management of this threat are legitimate and justified."" In a BBC News NI interview, Ms Anderson added: ""I believe it was a corporate failing, but I cannot say if they carried out the risk assessment Denis's murder would have been preventable. Ombudsman Marie Anderson said Donaldson family concerns over the PSNI's management of the threat were ""legitimate and justified"" ""There is certainly an indication others in County Donegal knew of his whereabouts."" Mr Donaldson's family issued a statement through their lawyers. It read: ""For reasons that remain unexplained and unaccounted for, the PSNI abandoned its routine practice of risk assessments. ""This course of action was taken at precisely the moment when the risk to Denis's life was at its greatest. ""The key question has always been: 'Did the PSNI do enough to protect Denis's life?' The ombudsman's answer today was no, they did not."" The PSNI said it recognised ""the pain and suffering"" of the Donaldson family. Ass Ch Con Mark McEwan added: ""We note the findings of the investigation and will now take some time to review her comprehensive report. ""We have reviewed our operational policies and service procedure regarding the management of threats to life and will continue to do so on a regular basis."" The ombudsman's report also found that the PSNI had provided ""a high-level of co-operation and assistance"" to the the Garda's murder inquiry. During the course of its investigation, the ombudsman's office questioned one officer under caution and he denied sharing information about Mr Donaldson's whereabouts. As he has subsequently retired, the issue of disciplinary proceedings could not be considered by the ombudsman. A DUP assembly member who sits on the Policing Board, Trevor Clarke, said: ""The ombudsman has been oddly critical of the PSNI for not carrying out a full risk assessment after the Sunday World had identified where Mr Donaldson was living. ""This is despite the PSNI advising the Garda of the potential increased risk and the victim living outside of their jurisdiction. ""Now that this investigation is complete, our sights must be firmly fixed on identifying those responsible for this brutal murder as well as those in the republican movement who have something to hide.'' By the time the Troubles erupted in 1969, Denis Donaldson was in the IRA. In the 1970s he was jailed for explosives offences and during his time in the Maze prison became close friends with Bobby Sands. His double-life began in the next decade. He was recruited as an agent in the 1980s, at a time when he was becoming more prominent in Sinn FÃ©in. He was its candidate in the 1983 Westminster election in his native east Belfast. Later, he travelled widely as a representative of Sinn FÃ©in to the likes of the Middle East and United States. Denis Donaldson pictured with Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness (left) and Gerry Adams After the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, he assumed a key backroom role for the party based at Parliament Buildings in Stormont. In what was dubbed Stormont-gate, Mr Donaldson was one of three men arrested in 2002 over an alleged IRA intelligence gathering operation. Three years later, charges were dropped on the grounds that prosecutions were not in the public interest. Within a matter of days, Mr Donaldson admitted having been an informer. He said he had been paid to work for MI5 and the police ""after compromising myself during a vulnerable time in my life"". Four months later, he was murdered in Donegal.

UK economy grew in January as Omicron easedThe economy grew by 0.8% in January as the effects of Omicron started to ease.Business,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine means significant uncertainty for the UK economy, the chancellor has warned. This is despite UK growth bouncing back in January as the effects of the Omicron Covid variant began to ease. The economy grew by 0.8% compared with a 0.2% contraction in Decemberthe Office for National Statistics said,external. But one industry body warned the UK faced a higher risk of recession as the impact of the Ukraine conflict would add to the sharp rise in living costs. UK households were already facing sharply rising costs before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in part due to soaring energy costs. The conflict in Ukraine pushed the price of oil to its highest level for nearly 14 years at one point and this has had a knock-on impact on fuel costs, with UK petrol prices hitting record highs. Gas prices have also soared, leading to warnings thataverage energy bills could reach Â£3,000 per yearin October, after rising to Â£2,000 in April when the energy price cap is raised. Grain prices have also jumped as both Russia and Ukraine are major global producers, particularly of wheat. ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased the risk of a recession in the UK by exacerbating the already acute inflationary squeeze on consumers and businesses and derailing the supply of critical commodities to many sectors of the economy,"" said Suren Thiru from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). Mr Thiru said January's growth was now like looking into a rear-view mirror. What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? What is GDP and how does it affect me? Borrow billions or see incomes hit, Sunak told The bounce back in the economy in January was not just stronger than expected, it was also seen in buoyant tax revenues. The effect of the Omicron Covid variant proved to be a blip, as wholesalers, retailers and IT and communication services pushed growth up. Consumer-facing services - restaurants, bars, entertainment, and travel - are still 6.8% below the level before the pandemic. All in all, the economy was on course to maintain its return to normal after the pandemic. However, the cost of living and energy squeeze was already weighing on the economy.

UK Covid inquiry draft terms of reference set outThe probe will look at areas including preparedness and the public health response to the pandemic.UKComments,"A volunteer from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group paints a heart on the National Covid Memorial Wall opposite the Palace of Westminster in central London The draft terms of reference for the UK public inquiry into the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic have been published. It will look at preparedness, the public health response, the health and care sector response and the economic response, the Cabinet Office said. The probe will play a key role in ""learning lessons"" from the pandemic and for the future, it said. The inquiry is due to start in the spring. The terms of reference werepublished,externalafter a consultation with inquiry chairwoman and former High Court judge Baroness Hallett, and with ministers in the devolved nations. Representatives of the inquiry will travel to towns and cities across the UK in the coming weeks to meet with people impacted by the pandemic and hear their views on what should be investigated. The Scottish government has already published the terms of reference for itsown Covid-19 inquiry, to be led by Judge Lady Poole. The UK-wide inquiry proposes examining a broad range of issues including: the UK's preparedness for the pandemic the use of lockdowns and other 'non-pharmaceutical' interventions such as social distancing and the use of face coverings the management of the pandemic in hospitals and care homes the procurement and provision of equipment like personal protective equipment and ventilators support for businesses and jobs, including the furlough scheme, as well as benefits and sick pay. The inquiry aims to produce ""a factual, narrative account"" covering decision-making at all levels of government and the response of the health and care sector as well as identifying the ""lessons to be learned"". The draft document said the inquiry would ""produce its reports (including interim reports) and any recommendations in a timely manner"". In the UK, more than 162,000 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus since the start of the pandemic in early 2020. The Cabinet Office said the UK-wide inquiry would ""reflect the importance of understanding the experiences of those most affected by the pandemic"" such as bereaved families and examine any ""disparities"" in the impact of the pandemic and the government's response. It said there would now be a further public consultation led by Baroness Hallett to consider any changes to the terms before they are finalised. Baroness Hallett said she would open the public consultation into the scope of the inquiry, which will run until 7 April. In a statement, she reiterated it was independent and urged people across the UK to share their views on what it should cover, especially those ""who have been bereaved, experienced hardship or suffered other harm"". Ex-judge to chair Covid pandemic inquiry When will the UK's Covid public inquiry happen? Judge appointed to lead Scottish Covid-19 inquiry Becky Kummer, spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said the publication was a ""huge step forward"" and the organisation looked forward to contributing to the consultation on the terms. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said there was much the NHS did well during the pandemic but: ""It is right the inquiry looks at areas where there were major challenges - such as infection prevention and control, access to PPE, testing, and robust epidemiological modelling."" He said trust leaders welcomed the inquiry covering ""the nation's preparedness, initial capacity, and resilience ahead of, and during the pandemic, and the important focus on inequalities"". Emma Norris, director of research at the Institute for Government think tank,said on Twitter,externalthe inquiry's ""huge remit"" had ""likely implications for the length and timeliness of the inquiry"", adding: ""A wide scope usually means a longer inquiry."" To avoid a lengthy inquiry, she said a large team would be needed to probe different issues concurrently, but that the mention of interim reports was ""positive"". Barrister and Covid lockdown regulations expert Adam Wagner also said on first look, the draft terms of reference appeared to be ""very wide"". In aTwitter thread,external, he said they failed to mention explicitly the policing of the pandemic, the government's hotel quarantine policy for people arriving in the UK from abroad and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on human rights. He said these elements would ""hopefully"" be covered by the items ""the use of lockdowns"" and ""travel and borders"". As the terms stand, he predicted it would be ""a massive, long and difficult"" inquiry with ""many strands and elements"". Several reports have already put the UK government's handling of the pandemic under the spotlight. A report by MPs onthe Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committeelast October said the UK's failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country's worst public health failures. It said the government approach - backed by its scientists - was to try to manage the situation and in effect achieve herd immunity by infection. The MPs said this led to a delay in introducing the first lockdown, costing thousands of lives. A report byspending watchdog the National Audit Office (NAO) last Novemberfound ministers were not properly prepared for a pandemic like Covid-19 and lacked detailed plans on shielding, job support schemes and school disruption.

Roman Abramovich sanctioned by UK,"Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the UK government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He isone of seven oligarchs to be hit with fresh sanctions,external, including asset freezes and travel bans. The list also includes billionaires Igor Sechin and Oleg Deripaska, both seen as allies of Vladimir Putin. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""there can be no safe havens"" for those who have supported the invasion. Live: Latest developments in Ukraine war Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Chelsea FC cannot sell any more tickets for games, its merchandise shop will be closed, and it will be unable to buy or sell players on the transfer market. The government said it would issue a special licence that allows fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches. Ministers have come under pressure to sanction Mr Abramovich, whosaid he had made the ""difficult decision"" to sell Chelsea FCearlier this month. The football club is among the assets frozen as part of the sanctions against Mr Abramovich and its sale has now been stalled. Roman Abramovich and Vladimir Putin pictured together at an event in Russia in 2016 But the BBC understands the government would consider allowing Mr Abramovich to apply for a special licence to sell the club, providing he can prove he would not benefit from the sale. Mr Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. The government says Mr Abramovich, who has an estimated net worth of Â£9.4bn, is ""one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin"". Mr Abramovich has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel. He sold a 73% stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for Â£9.87bn in 2005. He is believed to own a number of properties in the UK, including a 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens in west London, reportedly valued at more than Â£150m. While the sanctions against him throw Chelsea's future in doubt, ministers sought to reassure the club it would not be ""unnecessarily harmed"". In a tweet,external, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said holding those who have ""enabled the Putin regime to account"" was the priority. Tuchel criticises fans' Abramovich chants Abramovich says he will sell Chelsea Abramovich sanctions halt Chelsea sale ""I know this brings some uncertainty, but the government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended,"" she wrote. When asked if being unable to sell tickets and merchandise would hit Chelsea's finances, the culture secretary said: ""Sanctions have consequences and that's a fact."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan expressed support for the government's actions but said Chelsea fans were ""completely innocent"" and that it was important to ensure the club was not ""sold off in a fire sale"". This video can not be played Nadine Dorries says her focus is to protect Chelsea FC, its fans and the ""national game"" Telecommunications company Three, said it would temporarily suspend its sponsorship of the club and would ""request the removal of our brand from shirts and around the stadium until further notice"". Chelsea has enjoyed major success since Mr Abramovich bought the club in 2003 for Â£140m, winning major titles including the Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup. The club's fans were heard chanting Mr Abramovich's name during a match against Norwich on Thursday evening. Mr Abramovich has previously said that proceeds of the club's sale would be donated to victims of war. On Wednesday, there were 20 credible interested parties looking at a potential Chelsea takeover, includingBritish businessman Nick Candy. Analysis from BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford Like all the Russian billionaires who still run businesses in their motherland, Roman Abramovich has had to remain on good terms with President Putin, even though he no longer spends much time in the country. This is what led to him being sanctioned, with the UK government saying he is a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch"" who had has a ""close relationship"" with Vladimir Putin for decades and has obtained ""financial benefit"" and ""preferential treatment"" from that relationship. One example given of that is the contracts he received in the run up to the FIFA 2018 World Cup. More specifically on Ukraine and the Russian army, the UK government claims one of Mr Abramovich's companies, Evraz Plc, may ""potentially"" have been involved in providing steel which ""may have been used in the production of tanks"". It is probably now too late for Roman Abramovich to recover his position and he may find himself being sanctioned by the US and the EU as well. Like many Russian businessmen he is now likely to turn to China. The UK and its western allies have been ratcheting up sanctions against individuals and companies linked to President Putin since the invasion of Ukraine was launched on 24 February. The government said Thursday's sanctions against ""seven of Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs"" were part of the UK's ""efforts to isolate Putin and those around him"". Among those sanctioned wasOleg Deripaska, a leading industrialist who has had links with British politicians. Once one of the richest men linked to President Putin, Mr Deripaska made billions from his stake in Russia's aluminium industries, including EN+ Group, and has a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK. Media reports have named Mr Deripaska as the owner of a property on Belgrave Square, one of London's most exclusive neighbourhoods. His net worth is now an estimated Â£2bn, according to the Foreign Office, and he has beensubject to US sanctions since 2018,external. Unlike other Russian oligarchs, who have remained silent on the war in Ukraine so far, Mr Deripaska has called for ""peace as soon as possible""in a tweet,external. Mr Deripaska (left) pictured with President Putin in 2014 Igor Sechinis another wealthy businessman who is said to have deep ties to President Putin. Named Putin's right-hand man by the UK, Mr Sechin worked with the president when he was mayor in St Petersburg in the 1990s. Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, a Russian state oil company, and has been sanctioned by the US and EU. In its statement,external, the government said the four others sanctioned included: Andrey Kostin, chairman of VTB bank. He ""has long supported Kremlin objectives"" through the bank, which has already been sanctioned by the UK Alexei Miller, CEO of energy company Gazprom. An ally of Mr Putin from his St Petersburg days, he is ""one of the most important executives supporting the Russian government"" Nikolai Tokarev, president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft, He served with Mr Putin as a KGB officer in Dresden in East Germany in the 1980s and the pair have ""remained closely associated ever since"" Dmitri Lebedev, chairman of the board of directors of Bank Rossiya. Sanctioned by the UK, IS ""widely considered to be the Kremlin's private bank"" The UK has now sanctioned 18 oligarchs since the invasion of Ukraine began, a Downing Street spokesperson said. In addition to President Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and four Belarusian generals, 23 high-profile Russian oligarchs were now on the UK's sanctions list, the spokesperson said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the government had targeted the oligarchs to ""ramp up the pressure on the Putin regime and choke off funds to his brutal war machine"". She said: ""With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression. ""The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame."" Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the sanctions were the ""right decision"" but ""should not have taken the government weeks"". ""Too few oligarchs linked to Putin's rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK government,"" Mr Lammy said. The government has been accused of moving slower than western allies the US and the EU in its sanctioning of individuals linked to President Putin. The government'sEconomic Crime Bill, which is expected to become law later this month, is designed to harden and quicken these sanctions. The government says the bill will also stop wealthy Russians using the City of London for money laundering and hiding gains linked to organised crime.

"Satellites show Russia convoy regrouping near KyivThe convoy has now largely dispersed, with artillery set up in firing positions, a US company says.Europe","Satellite images taken by a US firm of a large Russian military convoy near Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, show it has ""largely dispersed and redeployed"". The convoy was last seen near Antonov Airport, north-west of Kyiv, and its movement could signal a renewed push towards the city. The firm that took the photos, Maxar Technologies, said parts of the convoy were in positions in surrounding towns. Other parts are further north, with artillery now in firing positions. The apparent redeployment came as Russian forces in Ukraine began attacking new targets in different areas of the country: An airfield and jet engine factory were targeted in Lutsk, in the north-west Explosions also hit airfields at Ivano-Frankivsk, in the south-west, according to Russian defence officials In Dnipro, a major stronghold in central eastern Ukraine, one person was reported dead in air strikes Sarah Rainsford, Eastern Europe correspondent, Dnipro The air raid sirens went off at 04:30 and wailed for more than three hours. We now know the danger was real. Officials here say there were three air strikes, hitting a small shoe factory, an apartment block and a kindergarten. This city is full of heavy industry, including a rocket factory. There is a metalworks nearby the site that was hit, but no obvious military target. Dnipro has been bracing for this since the war began. All the bridges and main roads here are heavily guarded. Residents have got used to scrambling to underground shelters when the sirens sound. Even so, the city has been something of a safe haven, for people fleeing cities under sustained Russian attack. In the past few days, residents here had begun leaving: we saw giant queues for evacuation trains and the roads west out of town have been heavily congested. Now the city has been directly hit, I suspect more will be thinking of getting out. ""Ukrainian big cities are again subjected to devastating blows,"" said Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak. He added that the shelling in Lutsk had shut down two central heating compounds. ""Russia's destructive war against civilians and major cities continues,"" he said. Russian state media reported that the Ukrainian city of Volnovakha had been captured by Russian-backed separatist forces. There is no independent confirmation of the capture of the city, which is a northern gateway to the besieged port city of Mariupol. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground OCCUPIED CITY:'We are not co-operating' RUSSIA MOTHERS:'How do I get my soldier son back?' EXPLAINED:Why Putin has invaded Ukraine? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected Russian claims that chemical weapons or weapons of mass destruction were developed in Ukraine. In a video address, he also warned that Russia would get ""the most severe sanctions response"" if it were to use such weapons against Ukraine. The US said earlier that Russia's claims of Ukraine hosting US-backed chemical weapons facilities was a ""false flag"", intended to justify Russia's possible use of such weapons. Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday to discuss the alleged manufacture of biological weapons in Ukraine. Russian forces moved three miles (5km) closer to Kyiv in the past 24 hours, a senior US defence official said on Thursday. That meant Russian troops advancing from the north-west were now just nine miles from the city centre, the official - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told reporters. Russian forces were also trying to close in on the city from the north-east, and were now about 25 miles (40km) away, the official said. The northern city of Chernihiv was now ""isolated"" the official added. Why has Russia's 64km convoy stopped moving? The convoy was earlier seen stalled not far from the capital, where US officials said it was targeted by Ukrainian troops with anti-tank missiles. It is not clear how many of the vehicles currently seen on the move may have been an initial part of that first group. Fierce battles have been raging in recent days in Irpin and Bucha, satellite towns just a few kilometres north-west of Kyiv. Thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes. On Thursday, footage emerged apparently showing a Russian military column being hit by Ukrainian forces near the city of Brovary, just outside the capital. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko says that half the population of the city of about three million has already fled, adding that Kyiv ""has been transformed into a fortress"". ""Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified,"" the mayor said. Tens of thousands of civilians have formed Territorial Defence units to help the Ukrainian armed forces defend the capital.

Farmers warn Ukraine war will hit UK food pricesFarmers are calling for urgent government action to help them produce enough to feed the nation.,"UK food prices will rise as a result of the war in Ukraine, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned. Some 30% of the world's wheat comes from Ukraine and Russia and exports will stop during the conflict, it says. In addition, the price of gas - which is used to heat greenhouses and to make fertiliser - has soared. The union has written to the government to call for urgent action to help UK farmers produce enough food to keep supermarkets stocked and affordable. ""The government must act now, with a clear signal that food security is a priority for the nation,"" the NFU said. Its letter warned that disruption to food production, supply chains and the availability and affordability of food in the shopscould last for years.,external Earlier this week, the boss of one of the world's biggest fertiliser companies, Yara International, warned thatthe war in Ukraine would deliver a shock to the global supply and cost of food. The Federation of Wholesale Distributors has also warned that the increase in fuel prices will lead topeople paying more for food in shops and restaurants. NFU president Minette Batters said the government must work with farmers to address food supply issues NFU president Minette Batters told the BBC that the rising cost of producing fruit, vegetables and meat could cause farmers to make less at a time when the nation needs more. ""I think the whole world has got to recognise that this is not something we've faced before, we are going to see wheat price inflation levels that have never happened,"" she said. ""The real danger is that farmers contract, they decide not to invest, they hold back from planting, and we produce less food,"" she said. Ms Batters said the shortage of crops would also affect meat production as farmers need it to feed their livestock. The cost of producing a chicken was 50% higher than it was a year ago but farmers were absorbing much of these costs, she said. UK feed wheat prices are already 39% up on March 2021 at Â£279.40 a tonne, according to theAgriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB),external Russia and Ukraine produce 80% of the world's sunflower oil exports and 20% of corn exports, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Another factor affecting food production in the UK is that Ukrainian workers have accounted for 60% of recruits under the UK's Seasonal Workers Scheme, the NFU said. These workers carry out essential roles such as planting, picking, packing and grading fresh produce. The NFU is asking the government to release an additional 10,000 visas under the Seasonal Workers Scheme, in addition to the 30,000 already granted. Farmer Dan Wallis says he will be growing more wheat Dan Wallis, who runs Rookery Farms in Newbury, Berkshire, said he decided this week to sow spring wheat on land that was not due to be planted on until next autumn. ""Given the current crisis in Ukraine the demand for food is ever increasing,"" he told the BBC. ""There's going to be a shortage of wheat and barley, predominantly wheat, so today we are planting spring wheat into some fallow land which should have remained fallow until next autumn. ""I made the decision in the last week or 10 days - it's the right thing to do."" This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries The Environment Secretary, George Eustice, told MPs that in early January he had set up teams to make contingency plans for the UK's food security. He told the House of Commons that he would attend a special meeting of the G7 group of the world's largest economies to discuss the issues further on Friday. Commons Leader Mark Spencer said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was ""across the threats that we face"". ""There is no prospect of food shortages at any point in the future, and Defra are working with Treasury to try and make sure that that continues to be the case,"" he said.

Russia hits back at sanctions with export bansRussia will halt exports of some types of timber and other goods until the end of 2022.,"Russia has banned exports of auto equipment Russia has hit back at western sanctions for invading Ukraine by imposing export bans on a string of products until the end of 2022. The ban covers exports of telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, and electrical equipment, as well as some forestry products such as timber. The economy ministry said further measures could include restricting foreign ships from Russian ports. It said: ""These measures are a logical response to those imposed on Russia."" The ministry added that the bans on countries that have ""committed unfriendly actions"" were ""aimed at ensuring uninterrupted functioning of key sectors of the economy"". The export ban includes more than 200 products. The measures will last until the end of the year. Western governments have imposed a string of sanctions on Russia, notably on buying oil, and against billionaire oligarchs seen as close to President Vladimir Putin. About 48 countries will be affected, including the US and in the EU. The order said that export exemptions can be made for Georgia's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and for members of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said the ban would include exports of goods made by foreign companies operating in Russia. Items include cars, railway carriages, and containers. It comes as Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev warned that assets owned by western companies that have pulled out of Russia could be nationalised. Firms have been leaving en masse or halting investment, including industrial and mining giants such as Caterpillar and Rio Tinto, Starbucks, Sony, Unilever and Goldman Sachs. On Wednesday, Moscow approved legislation that took the first step towards nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave the country. And in a statement on Thursday Mr Medvedev said: ""The Russian government is already working on measures, which include bankruptcy and nationalisation of the property of foreign organisations. ""Foreign companies should understand that returning to our market will be difficult."" He accused foreign investors of creating ""panic"" for ordinary Russians who could now lose their livelihoods. According to the most recent figures, Russia is the UK's nineteenth largest trading partner, with trade between the two nations totalling Â£15.9bn over a year from the end of September 2020. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? It's an impressive-sounding list, but how much harm will these counter-sanctions actually cause? The bulk of what western nations buy from Russia is made up of raw materials. Oil and gas, of course, but also metals like aluminium and nickel, not to mention potash and phosphates, widely used in fertilisers. The conflict has already pushed the prices of these goods sharply upwards, amid fears supplies could be disrupted - and if they remain high, that will cause economic pain, particularly in Europe. But a ban on the sale of railway cars and locomotives from Russia is unlikely to cause much hardship. Nor will restrictions on the sale of agricultural machinery, for example. These products are exported - but mainly to countries like Belarus and Kazakhstan. The inclusion of vehicles on the list is a problem for the likes of Stellantis - the owner of Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroen. It had been planning to export vans made in Russia to Europe and other parts of the world. But overall, the impact of the counter-sanctions looks more symbolic than significant. Restrictions on exports of raw materials on the other hand - if Russia were to introduce them - could have a much more dramatic effect. After Britain banned Russian-operated ships from its ports last week a retaliatory proposal to restrict foreign ships from entering Russian ports could also come into force. President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that there would be ""negative consequences"" for the world's food markets due to the West's sanctions because Russia is a major producer of agricultural fertilisers. ""It is clear that at such moments people's demand for certain groups of goods always increases, but we have no doubt that we will solve all these problems while working in a calm fashion,"" he said.

White House officials hosted a private Zoom briefing for about 30 influential TikTok creators to keep them informed of the latest US messaging regarding Ukraine, according to the Washington Post. The briefing was conducted by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and National Security Council adviser Matt Miller. Several of the social media stars have since gone on to post about Ukraine. The topic included the US ""strategic goals in the region"", according to the Post, such as how the US would respond to a Russian nuclear escalation and how US aid dollars are being spent to help Ukraine. TikTok has been widely embraced by the Biden administration as a way to reach younger Americans who get much of their news from social media.

Two hours later, she was crammed into a small van with her husband, her best friend and four strangers, to begin what turned into an 18-hour journey from Kyiv to the relative safety of Rivne, in the west of Ukraine. ""We packed the most important stuff - documents, laptops, chargers. My husband filled my backpack with books and said: 'It might be heavy but will protect you in case of shelling'."" Olha's laptop was important because she, like many Ukrainians, wanted to carry on working despite the complete upheaval of her life and the dreadful circumstances she found herself in.

File photo: An estimated 2.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the Russian invasion on 24 February Guatemala has received its first arrivals on Friday of Ukrainian refugees, according to a Reuters report. Eight Ukrainians were the first to arrive in the Central American country for ""humanitarian reasons"". A further 10 Ukrainians were expected to arrive later in the day, Reuters quoted officials as saying. It is unclear how many may have arrived privately to Guatemala since the Russian attacks onUkraine began. Guatemala announced its decision to throw open its doors to Ukrainian war refugees on 6 March, when President Alejandro Giammattei said they would be ""assured refuge"" in the country. It is now slightly past 06:00 in Kyiv, and air raid sirens have blared across more than 15 regions and multiple cities in Ukraine, BBC Ukrainian has reported. They have sounded in the capital Kyiv, along with key cities like Odesa in the south, Sumy in the north, Kharkiv in the east and Dnipro in the south-east. The aftermath of shelling in Sumy More humanitarian corridors have been agreed for the embattled northeastern city of Sumy on Saturday morning, said Sumy Regional Military Administration Dmitry Zhyvytsky in a post on Telegram. According to Zhyvytsky, evacuation efforts starting at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT) will see vehicles departing from six destinations around the region. All of the convoys are headed to the central city of Poltava, and are expected to arrive between 13:00 to 14:00. As Ukraine enters its 17th day under Russian invasion, Nato has said that it will be sending troops to Norway on Monday 14 March. Some 30,000 troops, 200 aircraft and 50 vessels from 27 nations are expected to take part in the Cold Response 2022 exercise, the largest exercise involving Nato troops this year. Starting on 14 March, the manoeuvres will enable western nations to hone their combat skills in Norway's cold climate, including in the Arctic, on the ground, at sea and in the skies. The exercise will be held a few hundred kilometres from the Russian border. While it was planned long before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, it now has added significance because of the war. Norway's Defence Minister Odd Roger Enoksen said: ""This exercise is extremely important for the security of Norway and its allies. We will practice an allied reinforcement of Norway"". The exercise is expected to come to an end on 1 April. With fierce fighting in cities along Ukraineâs south coast, the key city of Odesa is preparing its defences. Russian landing craft have been seen off the coast, and several aircraft have been reportedly shot down. Odesa is seen as an important target, both strategic and symbolic. The BBC has obtained footage of the volunteers preparing to defend the city, just 50km (30 miles) from the border with Moldova. This video can not be played Ukraine: Preparing to defend Odesa The Chernobyl power plant, photographed three days after the 1986 meltdown Ukraine has told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that technicians have begun efforts to restore the external power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. On Wednesday, Ukrainian officials said the site currently occupied by Russian troops was taken off the power grid. They later claimed that the Russians were preparing a ""terrorist attack"" that had been thwarted. Ukraine told the IAEA, the UN's nuclear energy watchdog, that work on Thursday evening successfully prepared one section, but that failures persist due to damage in other places. The agency said the work was continuing ""despite the difficult situation outside"" the former Soviet power plant, the site of a nuclear disaster in 1986. Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, is now firmly in the sights of the Russian army. Moscow's troops invaded from the nearby Crimea peninsula and have had more success in taking territory in this region than Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine. And now reports from the city indicate that Russian forces have started to shell the city again. As the Russians work their way west towards the city people are starting to flee and the hospitals are filling with the injured. But Anastasia has decided to stay, sending her one-year-old daughter and her mother away to safety. ""I'm a mum of my baby. But I have to help because I know how to do it,"" the former army captain told the BBC. Ukrainian forces have, for more than a week now, defended the city. But Governor Vitaliy Kim warns this is not a time to celebrate prematurely. ""We are winning this fight, but not this war,"" he says. Read more about the defence of Mykolaiv here.  Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has said his country could host negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Bulgarian media quoted President Radev saying that ""Bulgaria can legitmately claim to be a place for such talks, but this should be done in coordination with the European Union."" Radev added: ""We are members of the EU and we should strive for a unified European solution, a unified European approach."" On Friday, UK Minister of State for Europe and North America James Cleverly was in Bulgaria to discuss with his counterparts the crisis in Ukraine. Cleverly said the UK and Bulgaria - as Nato allies - oppose Russia's ""unprovoked attack"" on Ukraine. He added that Bulgaria was ""one of the first countries to close its skies to Russian aeroplanes"". Photos taken by Reuters apparently show a drone that has been rigged to drop petrol-filled bottles onto invading Russian troops. The four-blade device was apparently developed by the Ukrainian Territorial Defence Forces. Its use comes about two weeks after the government called for private owners to donate their drones to be outfitted for military purposes. It's unclear how the petrol in the Molotov cocktail bottle of Chernihivske beer - seen in the photo - is meant to be ignited. But the pictures show that as it falls, the bottle stays upright, in an apparent effort to keep the liquid from pouring out as it drops onto its target. Read more about Molotov cocktails in Ukrainehere The bottle stays upright after being released by the drone Social media channels and private messaging groups are being used in Russia to recruit a new brigade of mercenaries to fight in Ukraine alongside the army, the BBC has learned. The BBC has spoken to a serving mercenary and a former fighter with close links to one of Russia's leading mercenary organisations, who have shared details of the recruitment campaign. Read more of our investigation here. Earlier on we reported on a video address given by Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. The deputy prime minister said that shelling had prevented evacuations from Mariupol, where a maternity hospital was bombed this week, and the capital Kyiv. But she said some planned evacuations had been successful, including 1,000 people who were escorted from the village of Vorzel in the Kyiv region. Vereshchuk said that there will be a further attempt to evacuate people from Mariupol on Saturday. ""Tomorrow we will do it again in front of the whole world"", she said. She added a humanitarian cargo should be delivered to Mariupol, and on the way back people will have the opportunity of being evacuated. Several attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol failed earlier this week after agreements for temporary pauses in fighting were broken. Ukrainian families are grieving the deaths of the country's fallen soldiers. The bodies of the first victims of the Ukraine-Russia war are being laid to rest. The BBC's Fergal Keane reports. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ukrainians grieve for their fallen soldiers In the last half hour, air raid sirens have gone off in the capital city and in Zhytomyr, to its west, warning residents to seek shelter underground. Reporters on the ground in Kyiv report heavy shelling currently being heard. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine as the Russian invasion enters its 17th day.  Civilians living near the Zaporizhzhia plant have fled to other parts of Ukraine The head of Ukraine's state nuclear company, Energoatom, said Russian officials have tried to enter and take full control of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Energoatom's chief, Petro Kotin, said Russian forces had told Ukrainian staff at the plant that it now belonged to Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear company. In a televised interview, Kotin said 10 officials from Rosatom - including two senior engineers - unsuccessfully attempted to enter the plant and take control of operations. He added: ""On the territory [of the plant] there are around 500 Russian soldiers with automatic weapons â¦ our staff are in an extremely bad psychological state."" Kotin said on Friday that the radioactive material at the Chernobyl nuclear plant is still safely housed in storage, but warned that the plant remains disconnected from IAEA monitoring systems. The head of Instagram says that Russia's decision to block the social media platform means that tens of millions of Russians will on Monday lose access to the site and app. ""On Monday, Instagram will be blocked in Russia,"" tweeted Adam Mosseri. ""This decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world as ~80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong."" Russia made the move on Friday after Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said that it would temporarily suspend its own rules to allow for violent threats against Russian troops. Meta's head of global affairs said earlier today that the company's changes on speech in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will only apply in Ukraine itself and were temporary.

She gave birth the following day, her niece in Turkey told local media. Ukraine's ambassador to the UN said the baby had been named Veronika. Mariana became the subject of a Russian disinformation campaign after the bombing. The Russian embassy in the UK tweeted a conspiracy theory that Mariana was an actress and the aftermath of the attack had been staged. Read more about Mariana's story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

On the front line of the battle for KharkivQuentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway are with Ukrainian forces fighting to stop the Russian advance on the country's second city.,"Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky In the early days of the invasion, Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine fought back a Russian armoured column. Since then, it has suffered nightly Russian airstrikes and shelling, with dozens of civilians killed and hundreds injured. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Darren Conway have spent the week with the Ukrainian forces as they fight to stop a further Russian advance. This report contains material some viewers will find disturbing The first casualty of war is time. Ask the young soldier at the front when the attack happened, or the old lady in the hospital bed when her home was shelled, and they look at you confused. Was it 24 hours ago, or 48? The days have become one, they tell you. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, time is elastic. It's close to the border with Russia and the nightly shelling from Russian artillery and warplanes gives no rest. The past two weeks have seemed like an eternity, yet peace can be remembered as if it were yesterday. In a frozen landscape on the city's north-eastern edge, 21-year-old Lieutenant Yevgen Gromadsky stands with hands outstretched. There are trenches dug in nearby.  ""Outgoing,"" he says, lifting his right hand to accompany the thump of fire from his positions. ""Incoming,"" he says, and his left hand ticks up. With a crump, Russian shells are fired from their positions 900m away across snow-covered fields. The shelling continues like clockwork at the edge of this bombed-out village - ""Incoming, outgoing, incoming, outgoing,"" Lt Gromadsky flicks his hands with each report. We met only this afternoon, but already I know that just last week, his father Oleg was killed defending the city, and Lt Gromadsky is the seventh generation of military in his family. He plans for an eighth, in a free Ukraine. He describes the fight so far, ""Sabotage groups are probing our lines out, we have direct tank battles. They shoot with mortar shells at first, and then tanks fire at our positions."" We move along the front lines from position to position. Inside his armoured vehicle, a Russian army hat - a trophy from their first capture - hanging from the ceiling, he continues, ""We are shooting back with anti-tank guided missiles and also the usual small arms. They dismount, they scatter, there's always a lot of people."" Inside the truck there are Mexican Day of the Dead air fresheners. Grinning skulls hanging from every corner as we bounce along rutted dirt road. On the floor, rocket-propelled grenade launchers roll around. From the front passenger seat Lt Gromadsky says, ""Sometimes they use this tactic - first, they raise a white flag above their equipment, then come closer to our positions. When we come up and kind of take them as prisoners of war, they start to open fire on our troops."" The position was attacked on Monday (or was it the day before, he wonders), two Russian tanks and an armoured vehicle. ""Don't worry, we are well defended,"" he says as he gestures to a pile of American-made Javelin guided anti-tank missiles. ""Lockheed Martin, Texas,"" is written on their casing. Nearby, is a pile of British next-generation light anti-tank weapon (NLAW) missiles. ""Eliminates even the most advanced tanks,"" its manufacturer Saab promises on its website. It is bitterly cold and two puppies are playing around Lt Gromadsky's feet. His shoes are a pair of white Puma trainers - ""You need to be fast out here,"" he says. The Ukrainians are improvising in this war. Their government has been criticised for being ill-prepared, and now there is a rush to bring men forward to the front. The regular army is being merged with civilian defence forces. At a marshalling point on the city's eastern edge, I watch as buses arrive with hundreds of freshly equipped soldiers. ""Where's my body armour?"" asks one. ""You'll get it at the front,"" yells an officer, and moments later they are gone. This video can not be played Watch: Our correspondent on the front line, with Ukraineâs troops - this report contains graphic images of casualties Some will be joining Lt Gromadsky's unit and working alongside a medic who goes by the name of Reaper. ""You've heard of the grim reaper, right?"" he asks. He's also in command of this defence line at the edge of a village. Many of the homes there have been destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. How are the Russians fighting, I ask. ""They fight like stupid animals,"" says Reaper. ""They fight like it's 1941 - they have no manoeuvrability, they just come to the front and that's all. They have a lot of people, a lot of tanks, a lot of vehicles, but we are fighting for our land, and we are protecting our families. it doesn't matter how they fight because we fight like lions and they won't win."" Back in the rear, the field kitchen is in a coffee shop. The army cook is reassuringly large with a knitted hat atop his head. He offers bowls of steaming hot borscht - ""Have sour cream with it,"" he insists. There are piles of cakes and biscuits, made by local factories for the troops. I sit beside a 30-year-old battalion commander, Sergey. ""We see the enemy, we kill the enemy, there's no conversation, that's it,"" he says. He wants to know where I'm from. I tell him and he asks if it's true that British volunteers have come to fight for Ukraine. ""What aircraft have you given us,"" he says as he finishes his borscht. Battalion commander Sergey But across the east and south of Ukraine, Russia has been advancing. The Russian army has met more determined resistance than it expected, but cities continue to fall. And for all their front-line courage, there is a recognition that their abilities on the ground will not be enough. Soldier after soldier says they need air defence, a no-fly zone. I get inside another armoured vehicle, which two weeks ago was doing cash pickups at the city's banks. It, too, has now been put into the war effort. As we drive through the city, with its wide boulevards, and fine buildings, we reach a Soviet-Era apartment complex. And there I meet Eugene, a great Viking of a man, heavily tattooed with an orange beard. Eugene is part of a reconnaissance team ""If Kharkiv falls, then all of Ukraine falls,"" Eugene, 36,  tells me. He's a part of a reconnaissance team working near apartment blocks. Some of the flats have taken direct hits and in the car park, a car lies ripped apart from another grad missile strike. What there isn't here in Kharkiv, is any surprise at the Russian attack. ""Since 2014 we knew they would come, maybe in a year, 10 years, or 1,000 years, but we knew they would come"". At 04:55 on 24 February, Eugene received a call from a friend saying the attack was about to begin. ""Then I heard the rockets attack our city,"" he says. Like everyone else he hasn't been home since. Viewers in the UK can watch an extended report from Kharkiv on BBC iPlayer Leaving the front to return to the centre of the city is almost like entering another world. The relentless Russian shelling has meant that most of the 1.5m population has fled. Few neighbourhoods have escaped some kind of damage. Early in the mornings, queues can still be seen at pharmacies, banks, supermarkets and petrol stations, as those who stayed behind stock up on supplies. A huge logistical and humanitarian effort is going on behind the scenes to keep Kharkiv running. Before curfew I make my way to the city's Hospital Number 4 to meet Dr Alexander Dukhovskyi, head of paediatrics. Underneath his hospital whites, he's wearing a Miami Beach 2015 T-shirt, with the American flag. He hasn't gone home in weeks. This video can not be played Watch: How Russia is using tactics refined over a decade in Syria He laughs when I say that Russia says it isn't targeting civilians. Then, silently, he takes me down corridor after corridor of victims of Russian attacks. They are in the hallways because Russian shells have landed nearby, so the patients aren't safe in the wards with large windows. Most here were injured while at home. The children's intensive care unit is on the ground floor. Its narrow windows catch the brilliant light from the snow outside and glint over the golden icons of saints above the nurses' station. Dmitry in intensive care In a bed nearby is eight-year-old Dmitry. His toes poke out from under the blanket and a hand, bruised and bloodied peeks out too. His face is scraped and scarred with hundreds of marks, his right eye is not quite closed. A few days ago, the doctors removed a bullet from under his skull and vertebrae. It is hoped he'll make a full recovery, but for the moment he's in a sorry state, with tubes taking out fluids from his small body in plastic bottles hanging beneath his bed. The thin blanket with tiny roses on it, rises and falls with his mechanical breathing. This video can not be played Watch: Doctors removed a bullet from between Dmitriy's skull and vertebrae Vladimir Putin said he wanted to demilitarise Ukraine, instead he's creating a no-man's land. At night the city is in near total blackout. A steady beat of Russian strikes fall through the night. Kharkiv was once Ukraine's capital - it has the parks, cathedrals, museums and theatres you would expect, as well as the Antonov aircraft factory and tank and turbine manufacturers. All of the city is now a front line. And this, too, should come as no surprise. The Russian war-playbook has been perfected in Syria over the past 10 years. Surround, besiege, and terrorise the population. In Ukraine, as in Syria, the population is being bussed out of their home cities as Russian forces continue their advance. But still Ukraine resists. I meet an intelligence team, who drive with anti-tank missiles ready to use in the back of their vehicles. Again, I head to the city's edge, and pass through the front lines into a wasteland. Two petrol stations just outside the city that have been destroyed by shelling and gunfire. Lying in the snow, are a dozen or so frozen Russian corpses. The men lie like wax figures, some with hands reaching out, their matted beards frozen stiff in the cold. The guts of one are spilled across the forecourt. There are blood-red footprints around his corpse. Their weapons have been taken, and I ask Uta, one of the officers, what will happen to the bodies. ""What do you think will happen, we will leave them for the dogs,"" he says with a shrug. And at this miserable spot on Kharkiv's edge, unremarkable for its ordinariness two weeks ago, surrounded by frozen corpses, it's as if time is standing still. Are you or your family in Ukraine?
