UK's most polluted towns and cities revealed,"Manchester was among the places with the highest recordings Update 4 May 2018: This story, first published on 2 May, has been revised after the WHO issued corrected figures, including those that had originally put Port Talbot at the top of  its list. More than 40 towns and cities in the UK are at or have exceeded air pollution limits set by the World Health Organization, its new report has found. The WHO estimates that 30 areas have fine-particle air pollution levels above 10 micrograms per cubic metre, with another 17 at that limit. Areas that exceeded the level included London, Manchester and Swansea. Dirty air can cause debilitating diseases and hasten death. The figures on air pollution arecontained in the WHO's report,external, which estimates that globally nine out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants. Most of the UK figures were collected between 2013 and 2015 and in some places estimates of fine-particle air pollution were made based on measurements of larger particles of pollution. In the UK, Scunthorpe had the highest estimated level of fine-particle air pollution at 15 micrograms per cubic metre, though this was from 2013. Fine-particle air pollution is particularly bad for us, penetrating deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system, causing diseases including stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory infections, the WHO says. It estimates that, globally, seven million people die each year from exposure to such pollution, with most of these deaths being in low and middle-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa. The world's most polluted city in 2015, according to the WHO, was Muzaffarpur in India, with a figure of 197 micrograms per cubic metre - although that figure is under revision. Pasakha in Bhutan, Delhi in India and greater Cairo, Egypt, also had very high levels. This video can not be played Sarah MacFayden from the British Lung Foundation says people sometimes can't leave their homes as a result of air pollution However, while many UK towns had air pollution recorded at or above the WHO's recommended limit, in a number of places the levels are falling. In London, for example, levels fell from 17 to 11 micrograms from 2013 to 2015, while in the same period there was a fall from 17 micrograms to 12 in Sheffield. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said the UK still had ""a long way to go in the fight against air pollution"". ""The UK government needs to show leadership by adopting WHO air quality guidelines into national legislation and in doing so, help to protect the nation's heart and circulatory health."" A spokesman for the government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said: ""While air quality in the UK has improved significantly since 2010, this report from the WHO clearly shows the impact air pollution is having on the health of men, women and children in the UK and across the world. ""Tackling this important issue is a priority for this government which is why we have a Â£3.5bn plan to improve air quality and reduce harmful emissions and will set out further actions through a comprehensive Clean Air Strategy later this year.""

Body behind wall of Canada women's toilet,"Canadian police say the remains of an adult male have been found lodged behind the wall of a public toilet. A maintenance worker made the discovery on Monday morning in the women's restroom in a shopping centre in central Calgary, Alberta. He removed a wall panel in order to repair a toilet that would not flush and found the body. Police say they have not yet determined cause of death. A post-mortem examination was performed on Tuesday. ""Despite the circumstances of where the body was located, investigators do not suspect foul play and the death remains classified as undetermined,"" police said in a statement. Calgary fire services were called in to remove the body. Calgary police spokeswomanEmma Poole told CBC News,externalthey believe it is possible someone was crawling through a vent or duct, fell from above and became stuck behind the wall. YouTube stars paid to sell cheating Disguised women sneak into Iranian football match Restaurant fined for racial profiling ""So that is obviously something they would be looking at is someone crawling through the ventilation system,"" she said. Ms Poole told the BBC police currently believe the man ""probably went in there on his own"" and was unable to call for help. The investigation into when the victim died and how he ended up inside the wall at the Core shopping centre is continuing.

Facebook to launch dating service,"This video can not be played WATCH: How Facebook plans to disrupt internet dating Facebook's chief has said that 2018 has been an ""intense year"" for his firm. But Mark Zuckerberg also took the opportunity to unveil a dating service among other new products at his firm's annual F8 developers conference in San Jose, California. He told his audience that the match-making feature would take privacy issues in mind and would launch ""soon"". The company can ill afford another data scandal as it continues to be embroiled in the Cambridge Analytica affair. ""There are 200 million people on Facebook who list themselves as single,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. ""And if we are committed to building meaningful relationships, then this is perhaps the most meaningful of all."" Shares in the dating business Match Group fell after the announcement and closed more than 22% below their opening price. The firm owns Tinder, a dating app that sources its profile information from Facebook. Facebook has faced fierce criticism ever since it emerged that it had failed to check whether political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had deleted data harvested about millions of its users. Mr Zuckerberg said that this was a ""major breach of trust"" that must never happen again. How Facebook plans to disrupt dating 'Hate speech button' fazes Facebook users Zuckerberg faces angry developers WhatsApp boss and co-founder Jan Koum to quit As part of efforts to restore confidence, he said the firm was building a new Clear History tool to provide members with more control over how their information is used. The feature will: let members see which third-party sites and apps Facebook collects data from provide the ability to delete the information prevent Facebook from being able to add such details to their profile in the future However,in a related blog,external, Facebook has acknowledged that the tool will take several months to develop, and that it would still need to retain related information in ""rare cases"" for security reasons. Mr Zuckerberg also addressed his company's efforts to tackle fake news and detect operations designed to disrupt elections. But while he opted not to unveil a smart speaker - which the BBC understands had once been destined to launch at F8 - he did introduce other novelties. Users will be able to send each other text-only messages via a new chat tool The headline feature is a new service to help singletons on the platform meet potential dates. He said the opt-in feature would focus on ""real long-term relationships, not just hook-ups"", and would exclude existing friends from potential matches. ""We have designed this with privacy and safety in mind from the beginning,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Zuckerberg also announced that video chat and new augmented reality filters were coming to its photo-sharing Instagram app. In addition, he said that group video calling would soon launch on its WhatsApp messaging service. Big businesses will also benefit from new WhatsApp tools to help them communicate with their customers, he declared. The chief executive also paid tribute to WhatsApp's co-founder Jan Koum, who announced he was quitting the company yesterday. ""One of the things I'm most proud of is we've built the largest, fully encrypted network in the world,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. According to an earlierreport by the Washington Post, Mr Koum had decided to leave because he was unhappy that the forthcoming business tools would involve a weakening of WhatsApp's encryption. Mr Zuckerberg rounded off his list of unveils by revealing that his company's Oculus virtual reality division had begun shipping its first standalone headset, meaning the device does not need to be plugged into a PC or smartphone to work. Oculus Go provides its own computing power rather than requiring a PC or smartphone He said the $199 kit - which costs Â£199 in the UK - was the ""easiest way to get into VR"" and had the ""highest quality lenses and optics that we have ever built"". The firm's larger Oculus Rift headsets have proved less popular than many industry insiders had predicted, and appear to have been outsold by Sony's less powerful PlayStation VR gear. Experts are split about the new device's prospects. ""The new device makes VR much more accessible to everyone,"" commented Adrian Willings from the gadget review site Pocket-lint. ""It's a brilliant middle ground, but it's a mobile experience so not as good as a PC one."" But the head of games at the IHS consultancy was less positive. ""I see the Oculus Go headset as quite awkwardly positioned versus existing technology in the market,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls. ""The major thing it has going for it is its price point, but the fact it has a similar user-experience to a premium smartphone adapter headset limits its appeal."" Mr Zuckerberg had a defiant message for F8's attendees For Mark Zuckerberg there were two audiences for his speech - the 5,000 developers in the hall, many of them anxious about their businesses, and the two billion Facebook users who don't know whether they should trust the social network. For developers, who have seen much of their access to data frozen as the privacy crisis deepens, he announced the reopening of app reviews. That means an end to a logjam for new apps. There was a mild cheer for this quite limited move and a huge one when he told attendees they would all walk away with a free Oculus Go VR headset - some people are easily pleased. Facebook developers had complained that some of their apps had stopped working as a consequence of its emergency measures For the wider audience, Zuckerberg kept hammering away at what has become his new mantra - that Facebook needs to take a broader view of its responsibilities. He admitted mistakes - the Cambridge Analytica breach of trust, failing to spot Russian interference in elections - and outlined the various steps being taken to combat fakery, to investigate dodgy apps and to give users more control. Apart from a new feature allowing users to clear their history - with the warning that it might make the Facebook experience worse - there was little that was new. But there was a clear defiant message - yes, Facebook was acting to make users safer, but it would continue to launch new services like dating that expanded its reach. Mark Zuckerberg thinks Facebook's huge global audience still believes in his vision - no real signs here that he has been chastened by recent events. In a separate development, some US-based users have reported that a new prompt has appeared beneath posts on their News Feed asking them if the messages contain hate speech. The service apparently extends to updates written by Mr Zuckerberg himself. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I see the Oculus Go headset as quite awkwardly positioned versus existing technology in the market,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls. ""The major thing it has going for it is its price point, but the fact it has a similar user-experience to a premium smartphone adapter headset limits its appeal."" Mr Zuckerberg had a defiant message for F8's attendees For Mark Zuckerberg there were two audiences for his speech - the 5,000 developers in the hall, many of them anxious about their businesses, and the two billion Facebook users who don't know whether they should trust the social network. For developers, who have seen much of their access to data frozen as the privacy crisis deepens, he announced the reopening of app reviews. That means an end to a logjam for new apps. There was a mild cheer for this quite limited move and a huge one when he told attendees they would all walk away with a free Oculus Go VR headset - some people are easily pleased. Facebook developers had complained that some of their apps had stopped working as a consequence of its emergency measures For the wider audience, Zuckerberg kept hammering away at what has become his new mantra - that Facebook needs to take a broader view of its responsibilities. He admitted mistakes - the Cambridge Analytica breach of trust, failing to spot Russian interference in elections - and outlined the various steps being taken to combat fakery, to investigate dodgy apps and to give users more control. Apart from a new feature allowing users to clear their history - with the warning that it might make the Facebook experience worse - there was little that was new. But there was a clear defiant message - yes, Facebook was acting to make users safer, but it would continue to launch new services like dating that expanded its reach. Mark Zuckerberg thinks Facebook's huge global audience still believes in his vision - no real signs here that he has been chastened by recent events. In a separate development, some US-based users have reported that a new prompt has appeared beneath posts on their News Feed asking them if the messages contain hate speech. The service apparently extends to updates written by Mr Zuckerberg himself. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gladiators star smashes stones record,"James toured Scotland lifting well-known stones A former TV star has smashed the record for lifting the famous Dinnie Stones. James Crossley, who was Hunter in the 90s television series Gladiators, made it his life's focus for four months to beat the previous record of holding the stones for 33.9 seconds. After two failed attempts, the weightlifter and strongman summoned all his strength to lift the two giant rocks at the Old Potarch Hotel in Aberdeenshire. His 34.58 seconds set a new record. James Crossley during his challenge ""Since I was 12,  I was obsessed with different challenges,"" said James. ""When I hit 40 four years ago I wanted to set myself a goal of having a world record. ""I discovered historic stone tours of Scotland and then I came across these Dinnie Stones. ""The history there was incredible."" James found a gym an hour away from his home in London which had replica stones. The first time he lifted them, he managed five seconds. James trained using replicas with chains added on He told theBBC Scotland news website: ""I asked the trainer, did he think I could get there to the world record of 33.9? ""He joked that I might, if I made it my total life commitment. ""So basically my whole life for four months has revolved around these Dinnie Stones. ""I wake up thinking about Dinnie Stones, I go to bed thinking about Dinnie Stones."" Donald Dinnie was world famous for his strength The Dinnie Stones are two giant boulders which sit outside the Old Potarch Hotel between Aboyne and Banchory in Aberdeenshire. The smaller stone weighs 144.47kg (318.5lbs) and the larger  188.02kg (414.5lbs). Legendary Scottish strongman Donald Dinnie achieved international fame from his exploits around the world. In 1860 Donald Dinnie famously carried them both with his bare hands across the width of nearby Potarch Bridge  - a distance of more than 17ft (5m). James said lifting the stones is not about how strong the grip is, but is about pain management when holding that kind of weight for so long. During training, his weights got heavier, he held them for longer, working on his grip and practising yoga for pain management and breathing techniques. On Saturday 28 April, James travelled to Aberdeenshire, but he did not make it easy on himself. The first of three permitted attempts just fell short at 31 seconds. After a rest, a second try ended in 30.3 seconds. James said: ""My hands were torn and I thought I had peaked. I had one more go. I thought maybe I should leave it. I started to get the feeling back in my hands, I listened to the Rocky soundtrack in my ears and I just went for it. ""I got 34.58 seconds on the third lift. "" I looked at the timekeepers and I burst into tears as soon as I knew I'd done it."" One of the organisers of the challenge, Steve Shanks said: ""The lift and hold for time aspect was introduced at the Aboyne Highland games in August 2016. ""It is not strictly speaking in keeping with the original historical challenge laid down by Donald Dinnie in 1860, however it is definitely becoming more popular amongst strength athletes and James' incredible lift is the longest recorded to date.""

Abbas remarks on Holocaust condemnedPalestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas's speech suggested Jews brought the Holocaust on themselves.1h37 minutes agoMiddle East,"Child survivors found in Auschwitz death camp by advancing Soviet troops in 1945 Remarks by Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas about the Holocaust have been condemned as anti-Semitic by Israeli politicians and rights activists. Mr Abbas told a meeting in the West Bank the Nazi mass murder of European Jews was the result of their financial activities, not anti-Semitism. He described their ""social function"" as ""usury and banking and such"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said  the remarks were ""anti-Semitic and pathetic"". Michael Oren, Israel's deputy minister for diplomacy, remarked in a tweet: ""Mahmoud Abbas says money-lending Jews provoked Holocaust... Now there's a peace partner."" Allow Twitter content?

Jews in eastern and western Europe, he said, had been periodically subjected to massacres over the centuries, culminating in the Holocaust. ""But why did this used to happen?"" he asked. ""They say, 'It is because we are Jews.' I will bring you three Jews, with three books who say that enmity towards Jews was not because of their religious identity but because of their social function. ""This is a different issue.

Tiger cub abandoned at US-Mexico borderThe cub was unconscious and stuffed inside a duffel bag when officers discovered it.,"The tiger cub, no older than 4 months, was discovered in the Rio Grande Valley by US border agents US border patrol agents found a tiger cub in a bag abandoned by individuals trying to illegally enter the country at the Texas border, officials say. The male tiger cub was unconscious inside a black duffel bag, according to a statement from the US Customs and Border Protection. When the individuals realised agents were nearby, they fled back to Mexico, leaving the cub behind in their escape. The cub, only several months old, is now in the care of a local zoo. Brownsville, Texas border officials had been ready to intercept the group, but discovered the young tiger instead.

The cub is one of many exotic animals smugglers attempt to sneak across the US-Mexico border. It has become quite a lucrative industry in Mexico, and drug traffickers often keep imported animals on their ranches. Earlier this year,a US teenager was sentenced to six months in prison for trying to smuggle a six-week-old Bengal tiger cub from Mexico. The US has one of the world's highest demands for trafficked wildlife,according to a 2015 report,externalby US-based conservation group Defenders of Wildlife. Around the world, the illegal animal industry generates between $7bn (Â£5bn ) and $23bn (Â£17bn ) the report states. Defenders of Wildlife senior international counsel Alejandra Goyenechatold the Washington Post,externalthat a quarter of the 50,000 animals seized in the US between 2005 and 2014 came from Latin America. The cub was found stuffed inside a duffel bag, a common method of smuggling animals across borders Smugglers typically use the same US-Mexico routes as drug, weapon and human traffickers, Ms Goyenecha said. Many animals are transported in containers or luggage, like the tiger cub discovered on Tuesday. And many, according to Ms Goyenecha, do not survive the journey across the border, dying from suffocation or hunger. In 2014, theWorld Wildlife Fund reported,externalthat there were more tigers in captivity in the US than in the wild. During the Obama administration, the USannounced a national strategy for combating wildlife trafficking,externalin an effort to reduce demand for illegal wildlife in the US and abroad.

A grenade lobbed into the customs union debate,"As if it wasn't tense enough,30 pages of arguments against part of the government's policy have emerged, an ultimatum from senior Brexiteers who see this week's deliberations over customs arrangements as a ""breaking point"". It will hardly have been welcome in No 10's inboxes on Sunday afternoon, days before the Cabinet Brexit Committee was due to meet and also, worth noting, just days before the local elections, where the Tories are already expecting to do badly. The document, which I understand has been seen by Brexiteer Cabinet ministers, lobs a grenade into a meeting where it was already expected that some would urge Theresa May to drop one part of her plan. As I wrote last weekthere is deep scepticism even among some Remainers in Westminster about how viable the customs partnership is. Another source memorably remarked that the prime minister is more or less the ""last person left in Whitehall"" who believes it might work. UK will leave customs union, insists No 10 Reality Check: Why is the customs union so important? While No 10 knows very well that proposal has never been popular with Tory Brexiteers, on whose support the majority-less prime minister depends. Their calculations have always had to take in the likelihood of if and when the dozens of backbench Eurosceptics would rebel. But the leak of this document suggests the seriousness with which the powerful, if minority group, takes this issue. A senior Tory said ""the customs partnership is the breaking point"", suggesting that if No 10 doesn't do their bidding, they could withhold their support. Of course the stakes are high on all sides, tempers are hot, and it is not certain that they would deliver on those kinds of threats. ButTheresa May warned in her Mansion House Speechthat the UK won't get everything it wants in the EU negotiations. The time when she has to say that forcefully in negotiations with her own party may be coming fast. The question is whether that's feasible, one former minister said that Theresa May ""already isn't leading the party"". Another told me it's like ""the politicians have all gone missing"".

YouTube stars paid to sell essay cheating,"This video can not be played The YouTubers selling cheating: 'Get an A on your paper - and you don't even need to do it' YouTube stars are being paid to sell academic cheating, a BBC investigation has found. More than 250 channels are promoting EduBirdie, based in Ukraine, which allows students to buy essays, rather than doing the work themselves. YouTube said it would help creators understand they cannot promote dishonest behaviour. Sam Gyimah, Universities Minister for England, says YouTube has a moral responsibility to act. He said he was shocked by the nature and scale of the videos uncovered by the BBC: ""It's clearly wrong because it is enabling and normalising cheating potentially on an industrial scale."" The BBC Trending investigation uncovered more than 1,400 videos with a total of more than 700 million views containing EduBirdie adverts selling cheating to students and school pupils. EduBirdie is based in Ukraine, but aims its services at pupils and students across the globe. Essay writing services are not illegal, but if students submit work they have paid for someone else to do the penalties can be severe. The company is not just aiming to capture the attention of university students with its advertising. Popular YouTubers, some as young as 12, are being paid to personally endorse the service. In some of the videos YouTubers say if you cannot be bothered to do the work, EduBirdie has a ""super smart nerd"" who will do it for you. The adverts appear in videos on YouTube channels covering a range of subjects, including pranks, dating, gaming, music and fashion. They include several by stars such as Adam Saleh whose channel has four million subscribers, and British gamer JMX who has two and a half million subscribers. Following the BBC's investigation, both have now removed videos with EduBirdie adverts from YouTube. The BBC also approached the mother of one 12-year-old, who had promoted the company to his 200,000 followers. She also took her advert down. Adam Saleh is one popular YouTuber who has advertised EduBirdie in his videos Channels with tens of thousands of subscribers can be offered hundreds of dollars for each advert. They are not clearly labelled video ads, which are common on YouTube channels. Instead the YouTuber usually breaks off from what they are doing to personally endorse EduBirdie, promising that the company will deliver an A+ essay for money. Some YouTubers suggest that using the service will free up time to play video games or take drugs. So prevalent is the promotion of EduBirdie that very young children are posting videos on YouTube of themselves mimicking the ads. Universities minister, Sam Gyimah, said he was shocked by the scale of the videos. Sam Gyimah said that EduBirdie's marketing was shocking and pernicious as it presented cheating as ""a lifestyle choice"". He said the YouTubers involved should be ""called out"" for abusing their power as social influencers. ""I think YouTube has a huge responsibility here,"" he said. ""They do incredibly well from the advertising revenue that they get from the influencers and everyone else. But this is something that is corrosive to education and I think YouTube has got to step up to the plate and exercise some responsibility here."" About 30 of the channels promoting EduBirdie are from Britain and Ireland. They include a student vlogger at a top UK university. Another is a popular 15-year-old YouTuber, whose mother was unaware he was promoting the company until she was approached by the BBC. Shakira Martin, the President of the National Union of Students, said: ""I think it's totally disgusting the fact that these type of organisations are exploiting vulnerable young people through getting them to promote something that isn't good, isn't ethical."" She added that students who were working to support themselves while studying might be most tempted to use EduBirdie. Google's own research found YouTubers were more influential than celebrities when it came to promoting products. Toni Hopponen, from the tech company Flockler, advises businesses and some universities on how to tap into the power of social influencers. He said this was creating new challenges as it is outside the regulations that apply to traditional advertising. ""There's always been unethical advertising out there - but now the channels like YouTube provide a way for all of us to be publishers and the scale is huge. "" One British YouTuber, Alpay B urges viewers in one of his videos: ""Don't waste your time doing your essays, let these people do it for you."" In a statement, he told the BBC: ""Whether a student wants to cheat or not it's totally their choice. You can't really blame EduBirdie or creators who promote them because everyone's got their own hustle."" The BBC ordered two essays through EduBirdie, opting for them to be written from scratch. One was an English Literature GCSE coursework essay, the other a first-year degree course assignment. Both were delivered with only the students' names left blank to be filled in. The GCSE essay was given a C or 5/6 and the university assignment 60% - not quite the guaranteed A+ grade promised by EduBirdie.

Brexiteers send customs 'ultimatum' to PM,"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? Theresa May is facing a demand from Conservative Brexiteers to drop one of the government's preferred post-Brexit customs options. A 30-page document passed to the BBC says a ""customs partnership"" would make meaningful trade deals ""impossible"" to forge and render the UK's International Trade Department ""obsolete"". It came ahead of a key meeting of senior ministers about Brexit. The committee discussed rival options to replace customs union membership. Afterwards, a source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that a narrow majority of those at the meeting had said the customs partnership was not viable, and it was suggested it would not be taken back to full cabinet for further discussion. But Downing Street sources said the meeting agreed that this option and the proposal for a ""highly streamlined"" arrangement were still ""serious propositions"", although they acknowledged there were ""challenges that need to be addressed"". Theresa May is understood to have asked for ""revised proposals"", our correspondent added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

All EU members are part of the customs union, within which there are no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between them. There is also a common tariff agreed on goods entering from outside. The UK government has said it is leaving the EU customs union so will have to agree a new arrangement for what happens at the UK/EU border post-Brexit and whether businesses will be hit with tariffs or not. The complicating factor is that the UK wants to strike its own post-Brexit trade deals with other countries rather than have to stick with deals struck for the EU customs union. A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. Government sources say the situation is constantly evolving. It is possible another option could emerge combining elements of the first two. But any solution would aim to avoid the need for physical border checks on the island of Ireland. Wednesday's cabinet sub-committee meeting may not reach a final decision on the proposals - and don't forget, this is all about the UK agreeing its stance before more Brexit talks. The EU does not appear to be keen on either option. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said there were ""a number of ways"" to deliver Britain's objectives on customs arrangements after Brexit. Reality Check: The government's customs options Please upgrade your browser The BBC's economic editor Kamal Ahmed says he understandsChancellor Philip Hammond (pictured above) favours a customs partnership. Mr Hammond and other Remain-voting cabinet ministers, such as business secretary Greg Clark, are hoping to persuade the prime minister to keep it on the table when the 11-strong Brexit sub-committee meets later. Remain-voting Tory backbenches also want it to remain an option. One of them, Vicky Ford, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it did not mean remaining in the EU ""by the back door"" as critics claim and could protect British business. Brexiteer cabinet ministers such as Boris Johnson, Liam Fox (pictured above) and David Davis - and a group of Conservative backbenchers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, whose Tory Research Group produced the dossier sent to Mrs May. The Cabinet all signed up to the two customs optionswhen they were announced last year,externalbut some are now thought to be worried that the customs partnership idea would mean a slide towards remaining in the customs union. Backbench Tory Brexiteers fear the scheme would be expensive and complex to operate, and could mean the UK is indefinitely trapped within the EU's customs arrangements - and unable to strike its own post-Brexit trade deals with other nations around the world. Mr Rees-Mogg said it would not only be ""unworkable"", it would the same as staying in the EU and was the ""single market by another name"". Housing minister Dominic Raab told BBC Radio 5 Live's Anna Foster the ""streamlined"" customs option was ""winning the argument"" in government as it was ""the one that's been tried and tested the most"". According to the Press Association, Downing Street has been privately warned that a customs partnership could collapse the government, as committed Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches regard it as unacceptable. A senior Conservative told the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg ""the customs partnership is the breaking point"", suggesting that if No 10 doesn't do the Brexiteers' bidding, they could withhold their support. On Tuesday, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox refused to deny he would resign if a customs partnership was agreed in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Read Laura Kuenssberg's blog The MPs' dossier cautions against continued deliberations in government, saying that ""further delay is itself a decision"". It is the strongest warning yet from Tory Brexiteers to the PM, who have largely been supportive, in public, of her efforts to negotiate Britain's exit from the EU. Mr Rees-Mogg (pictured above) told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""we are not in the business of making threats"". If it came to a confidence vote in the prime minister over the issue, the Tory MP said it was ""inconceivable"" that he would vote against her. Downing Street sources denied the document was an ultimatum, calling it part of the policy-making process. David Davis is preparing for the next round of talks with EU Brexit chief Michel Barnier Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Tuesday that Brussels was ""pushing back"" against both proposals. The EU thinks the customs partnership proposal is very ambitious - to put it mildly - and has given the UK a list of questions about it, writes the BBC's Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming. What new burdens will be placed on customs officials in the EU27? How will the UK apply EU customs law if it's no longer in the club? How will the ""track and trace"" system work? The warning from Brussels about the UK government's other option, a ""highly streamlined"" customs deal, is that it doesn't fully solve the problem of avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which they say is about more than just tariffs. Hanging over it all is the issue of trust because the EU and UK are still arguing over 2bn euros (Â£1.76bn) of allegedly unpaid duties on Chinese shoes and textiles imported into Britain, and legal action looms. The EU's negotiators wonder whether the other side is about to change tack on a major issue, and they suggest that the upcoming political deal about the shape of the future relationship may have to be very vague if it's to find approval from a divided British government, parliament and public. Labour wants the UK to form a customs union with the EU after Brexit and says the prime minister is ""being held hostage by the extreme Brexiteers in her own party"". The party's shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said: ""Labour has been clear that the best way to protect jobs, the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland is by negotiating a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union after Brexit. ""However, the Tories appear more interested in issuing ultimatums and squabbling amongst themselves than acting in the national interest."" The Lib Dems, who back staying in the customs union and want a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said Mrs May was ""kicking the can down the road in a desperate attempt to hold the widening fissures of the Tory party together - it cannot and will not work"". SNP MP Tommy Sheppard accused the Scottish Conservative MPs who were among the group of Brexiteers warning Mrs May about a customs partnership of being ""British nationalists, who long for the return of days of Empire and for the time when the map of the world was mostly pink"".

RAF 'may have killed civilians' in Iraq,"Mosul was retaken in December, three years after being seized by IS A source inside the coalition fighting the Islamic State group has told the BBC he believes civilians have been killed as a result of RAF air strikes. The claim casts into doubt the Ministry of Defence's statement it has seen ""no evidence"" that its strikes in Iraq have caused civilian casualties. Other coalition members have alerted the UK to times when civilians may have been harmed, a BBC investigation found. The MoD says ""everything possible"" is done to minimise the risk to civilians. But it has also been discovered that some RAF bombs have malfunctioned and strayed off target. Estimates for the number of civilians killed in the nine-month battle for Mosul - the last stronghold of the Islamic State group in Iraq - range from more than 1,000 to 10 times that number. The war against 'Islamic State' in maps and charts How many bombs has the UK dropped in 2017? Can civilian deaths be avoided in RAF strikes on IS? Many were trapped, held hostage by IS who used civilians as human shields. Some were also the unintended victims of the US-led coalition's bombing campaign, which saw 29,000 munitions dropped or fired in and around the city. The UK was second to the US in the number of airstrikes it conducted for thecoalition,external, a grouping of 75 countries formed in 2014 to defeat IS. Only about a dozen members of the coalition conducted airstrikes in and around Mosul, with British warplanes hitting more than 750 targets. An RAF Tornado was involved in the January 2017 strike The source, who has not been named to protect his identity, says it was ""impossible"" to conduct a bombing campaign in highly-populated areas, like Mosul, without killing civilians. He said he had seen evidence that British airstrikes had caused civilian casualties ""on several occasions"". ""To suggest they have not - as has been done - is nonsense,"" he added. The source described a strike on 9 January last year when an RAF Tornado fired a Brimstone missile on what was described as a ""lorry bomb"" in eastern Mosul. It caused a large secondary explosion and the source said he believes two civilians were ""almost certainly"" killed. The MoD insisted their ""very careful analysis"" had concluded that those killed were ""highly probably"" IS fighters. It refused a request to view the strike footage it filmed from the air and will not release the co-ordinates of other RAF airstrikes. But it did eventually confirm the location of this one strike. Many potential eyewitness to the strike were in hiding at the time but some say IS fighters were in the area. And there were reports of civilians being injured too. One man said the ""women and men were screaming in the aftermath. Some of them were wounded."" The incident highlights the limitations of making assessments only from the air. Both the MoD and the source describe the target as a ""lorry bomb"" but those on the ground insist it was smaller  - the size of an SUV. Another source in the coalition said it is possible for two different people looking at the same aerial imagery to reach different conclusions. Aerial surveillance cannot see through walls and rubble. During the BBC's investigation other factors emerged that might cast some doubt on whether British airstrikes have caused civilian deaths including: Reports of a number of RAF weapons malfunctions Instances of some bombs failing to detonate Occasions when bombs have strayed and exploded hundreds of metres off target - hitting buildings that were not even even under surveillance The MoD insists a ""very low percentage"" of weapons have malfunctioned but it has refused to give numbers. But other coalition members have highlighted, or ""flagged"", several incidents when UK airstrikes may have caused civilian harm. On each occasion the MoD says it saw no evidence it caused civilian casualties. Over the past three and a half years the RAF has dropped more than 3,700 bombs and missiles in the campaign against IS in Iraq and Syria. Cockpit footage of an RAF air strike on an IS artillery position in Mosul in 2017 It has still not claimed responsibility for a single civilian death. The MoD says it has done ""everything possible"" to minimise the risk to civilians. It highlights the professionalism of the RAF crews involved, their ""rigorous targeting"" procedures and  use of ""precision weapons"".  But it has never had anyone on the ground to investigate allegations of civilian harm. The MoD has been careful in its choice of words. It has also admitted it cannot completely eliminate the risk to civilians. In saying it has seen ""no evidence"" of causing civilian casualties it is not ruling out the possibility that it might have happened. Yet there is also the danger the public might have also been left with the impression that hundreds of British airstrikes in a heavily-populated city, like Mosul, caused zero civilian deaths. Back in the tightly packed streets of Mosul's old city, which suffered the heaviest bombardment, there seems to be no doubt that airstrikes by the US-led coalition did kill civilians. Abdel Rahman Ali lost five of his children in a coalition strike Abdel Rahman Ali lost five of his children, when a bomb hit his home, and says 47 civilians were killed as a result of the air strikes in his street alone. ""Nobody destroyed us except the coalition,"" he said. Airwars,external, a group which has been monitoring civilian casualties,  says it is likely that between 1,066 and 1,579 civilians died in the fighting in Mosul. Of the half a dozen coalition members who carried out airstrikes in the city, so far only the US and Australia have accepted responsibility for causing civilian casualties. At present the coalition has admitted to causing just over 350 civilian deaths in Mosul. US Central Command is still working its way through a list of other allegations. This video can not be played Why a group of volunteers is digging out bodies in Mosul's Old City Chris Woods of Airwars says: ""It's simply fanciful to claim no civilians have been harmed by the RAF. ""We don't live in a world of magic bombs and missiles that only kill bad people."" The reality is that while the UK and coalition airstrikes helped rid the city of the scourge of IS the MoD has carried out no investigations on the ground counting the cost to civilian life.

Bercow accused of bullying private secretary,"This video can not be played John Bercow's former private secretary tells Newsnight the Speaker bullied him John Bercow's former private secretary has toldNewsnightthat he was bullied by the Speaker. Angus Sinclair said he faced angry outbursts, undermining, obscene language, and mimicry from Mr Bercow, who also smashed a phone on his desk. Mr Sinclair said he was paid Â£86,250 in 2010 as part of a deal that required him to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Mr Bercow denies bullying - with a spokesman saying ""there was no substance to any of the allegations"". Mr Sinclair, who has breached the terms of the non-disclosure agreement by speaking to Newsnight, said: ""I thought to myself, it's in the public interest to know why I left. John Bercow in 2010. Angus Sinclair is on the right, with blue, white and purple ribbons on his chest ""Yes, it breaks that non-disclosure agreement, but it's the truth. There was bullying."" Mr Sinclair, who spent 30 years in the Royal Navy, joined the House of Commons in 2005 as the private secretary to Michael Martin, who was then Speaker. In 2009, after the expenses scandal, Mr Martin was replaced by Mr Bercow, who Mr Sinclair says bullied him - shouting at him, undermining him in front of other staff, swearing, and attempting to physically intimidate him. After around a year of working for Mr Bercow, Mr Sinclair was given a ""compulsory early retirement"" by Commons authorities. The Â£86,250 lump sum - more than a year's pay - was part of a deal that required him not to make a complaint about his treatment at the House, or speak publicly about the manner of his treatment. This is not conventional for people retiring from the House. The role of Speaker's secretary is wide-ranging: in addition to running the Speaker's office, the secretary also assists the Speaker in his duties in the House of Commons chamber, Others involved in the process have confirmed to Newsnight that the intention of the non-disclosure agreement was to prevent the issue of bullying being raised. Mr Sinclair said: ""I can only think it was because of the detail of what had happened, you know, the bullying and the manner of my leaving... ""What I'd done was sign a cover-up and in a cynical way. I'd been paid to do it, and that's not a good feeling."" A spokesman for the Speaker's Office said: ""Mr Speaker strenuously denies that there is any substance to any of these allegations. ""Mr Speaker has a superb team of dedicated, effective and long-serving staff - five of whom have worked for him very happily for a combined total of over 40 years."" John Bercow on the day he was elected Speaker Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, who is a long-standing critic of Mr Bercow, said the Speaker should ""consider his position"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think, at a time when we are looking for culture change in the House of Commons with regard to bullying and harassment, I think that's very difficult if the titular head of that organisation is mired in these allegations."" But Labour peer Lord Hain said the ""attack"" on the Speaker was motivated by those ""resisting his essential parliamentary reforms"". Labour MP Barry Sheerman also defended Mr Bercow, saying he had been the ""best reforming Speaker for 100 years"", and it was only a ""small group"" of parliamentary officials ""hated"" his modernising efforts. Cabinet Office minister David Liddington said: ""I have heard the allegations that have been made. Obviously any allegation of this nature is serious. It is a matter for the House of Commons to decide what to do."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Newsnight has previously reportedthat House of Commons managers were informed in 2011 that Kate Emms, Mr Sinclair's successor in that role, had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after less than a year working for Mr Bercow. The Speaker has categorically denied bullying Ms Emms. Reflecting on what happened, Mr Sinclair said: ""I think if I'd actually said to myself I'm not signing this non-disclosure agreement, or I'd put in a complaint, or I'd done what anyone should do if they've suffered a bullying incident - to speak out and get it resolved, then [Ms Emms] might not have been put in that position."" As a consequence of Newsnight's reporting on theculture of Westminster, the House of Commons Commission has commissioned an inquiry into the treatment of the apolitical staff who run the House. However, the investigation - led by Dame Laura Cox - will not investigate individual cases or reopen past complaints. Mr Sinclair said he had a good relationship with Mr Martin, but struggled to build a working relationship with his successor, Mr Bercow. Mr Sinclair told Newsnight: ""The Speaker responded in a way that I can only say is a form of bullying. And that is to show anger, to thump the table to say that someone has failed in front of others... it seemed to get more frequent."" Newsnight has spoken to other members of House staff, who have corroborated this account. Other officials have described Mr Sinclair being undermined in meetings and held responsible for things that were beyond his power. Mr Sinclair has also shown Newsnight entries from his contemporaneous diary, which records examples of these behaviours. Mr Sinclair told Newsnight that the Speaker was prone to ""over-the-top anger. I'm not sure he was completely in control of it. The arms would wave around"". Mr Sinclair detailed one particular outburst, which is corroborated by his diaries: ""There was one afternoon I was working at my desk and he came in and was absolutely furious about something... he asked for some information from another part of the House. It had been very slow coming and I'd prodded for an early resolution and he knew that but he held me responsible... ""There was a tirade of how I'd let him down and it was the worst thing... there was a lot of bad language and suddenly his mobile phone which he'd been holding was flung on the desk in front of me and broke into a lot of bits."" Mr Bercow in the chamber. His current private secretary is at the Speaker's left hand side. Mr Sinclair described the effect on his personal wellbeing: ""Perhaps one of the worst aspects of it - from time to time you would hear yourself mimicked, and your thought then is 'Is that really how he sees me?' ""I think we all know that every job in the land has to have some dignity. Well, I felt at the time that the dignity had been removed. ""You would walk to work with a heavy heart. The horizon suddenly was low, and it was not a good feeling, it was a feeling of failure."" The role of Speaker's secretary is unusual, in that it is appointed solely at the discretion of the Speaker. It is set out in Erskine May, the parliamentary practice guide, that the Speaker of the House has the sole power to appoint his own staff. While Mr Sinclair raised his treatment with House of Commons managers, any complaint would - in the end - have to be dealt with by the Speaker. In 2010, shortly after the general election, Mr Bercow was re-elected as Speaker. Mr Sinclair said he was called in to see the Speaker, who told him he was going to ""redesign the office"", and that Mr Sinclair would not be needed. His severance package included a payment of Â£86,250. But a letter from the Director General of Resources made clear the payment was explicitly dependent on signing a non-disclosure agreement that would bar him from speaking to the media - or raising a tribunal complaint. The House of Commons agreed at that time that there was no concern about Mr Sinclair's capacity. The House gave him a reference stating that he ""acted with a very high degree of professionalism. He showed discretion, loyalty, assiduity and efficiency... there were no disciplinary issues affecting him"".

"Belfast trust recalls 2,500 patientsPeople with brain conditions might have been misdiagnosed or not given the right treatment, it is feared.1han hour agoNorthern Ireland","The trust says it is a ""serious"" situation and has apologised More than 2,500 neurology patients in Northern Ireland, including children, are being recalled for a case review. The recall comes amid concerns some patients may have been misdiagnosed. The BBC can reveal that this follows a review of the work of neurology consultant Dr Michael Watt at the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Neurology is the treatment of brain conditions including MS, Parkinson's Disease, Stroke and Motor Neurone Disease. Following the case review, the patients involved could receive devastating news. While some of these conditions can be treated, nearly all are life-changing. Patients being recalled should have received a letter by post on Tuesday. It will include details about how to make an appointment. An advice line is now operating for those who have been affected - it is 0800 980 1100. The Ulster Independent Clinic, which confirmed that Dr Watt operated a private practice at the clinic until June 2017, said it would be operating a helpline for concerned patients from 09:00 BST on Wednesday morning - the number is 028 9068 6511. Both the trust and the Royal College of Physicians have carried out separate reviews of patients' notes. Concerns were initially raised by a GP about a patient's diagnosis and treatment in December 2016. The Belfast Health Trust said it was a ""serious"" situation and apologised to patients and their families. Nichola Mallon, SDLP, told the BBC that she raised the issue on behalf of several constituents last year. ""It is as if we have been beating our heads off a brick wall, trying to get information about what is going on and trying to get answers including diagnosis,"" she said. ""Some of my constituents have been in Dr Watt's care for years. But they can't get a proper diagnosis. So they are living in pain their quality of life is deteriorating, they don't know whether they are on the right medication, some cannot work."" Among the 2,500 under review are children, some of whom may have been struggling with a wrong diagnosis. A consultant who once worked alongside Dr Michael Watt said all of his colleagues were shocked. He said it was a ""daunting"" time for everyone, but patient safety must come first. Read more analysis from Marie-Louise here. This video can not be played 'We have never been involved with a recall of this scale' Dr Mark Mitchelson is responsible for neurosciences at the Belfast Health Trust. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, he said: ""While we hope this will affect a very small number of patients - the change in diagnosis could potentially be very significant. ""We understand that this must be incredibly anxious for them and, for that, we are deeply sorry for any distress that has been caused. ""Equally, we feel it's absolutely vital that we are prudent and cautious when dealing with any patient safety issues and hence, that is why we are recalling these patients to be seen."" Neurology is the field of medicine concerned with the operation of the brain While there is particular concern over a small number of his patients, the trust has decided to recall everyone who is currently in Dr Watt's care. The trust did not rule out the possibility, at a later stage,  it could stretch to patients who died while in Dr Watt's care. Dr Mitchelson said nine neurology consultants in the trust would be running 200 additional clinics starting from Saturday 5 May. They will see the 2,500 patients including teenagers as young as 14 years of age as quickly as possible. Beverley Davidson was one of thousands of neurology patients who discovered on Tuesday morning that they would face fresh appointments as part of the review. She told BBC News NI about how she found out about the news. ""I was out with my husband in the car, we turned the radio on and heard mention of Dr Watt and a bit of controversy over it - I decided to look at the news on the phone to see that patients were being recalled. ""I've come home and the letter is in the post to say I've been asked to come for an appointment in May. Beverley Davidson with the letter sent to her by the Belfast Health Trust ""I was shocked. It leaves you very uneasy. You're unsure of what's going on, what's going to happen. I'll have to go through lots of tests again, which was quite traumatic at the time. It leaves you in limbo, really - not good. ""I just don't know what to think - I found Dr Watt to be understanding and helpful. He took me through the paces of what I was going through. He made it quite easy to work with. The panic of who will take over or what will happen - I just don't know. ""The trust could have dealt with this a lot better than they have. To just send out a letter and hear a news report with no preparation - heartless. ""I wasn't expecting this today or any day. Within an hour, your whole world's upside down and will be until I have another consultation with whoever I get. ""I just hope they're just as efficient and professional as Dr Watt was with me."" Some of the recalled patients will be seen by doctors working in the independent sector. ""Certainly this is a significant number and, within the neurosciences division, we have never been involved with a recall of this scale,"" Dr Mitchelson said. ""These are patients with a wide range of neurological conditions, some of which are debilitating, complex and significantly serious. ""But standards did dip around one consultant and patient safety should always be paramount - hence the recall."" According to the Belfast Health Trust, Dr Watt has not seen any patient either in the public or private sector since June 2017. He remains an employee. The Ulster Independent Clinic said that Dr Watt operated a private practice at the clinic but he voluntarily suspended it in June 2017. ""Late last evening we were made aware of the completion of the review, commissioned by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, undertaken by the Royal College of Physicians into Dr Watt's clinical practice. ""When this is made available to us we will immediately consider the report to fully understand the type and extent of the concerns raised."" It added: ""We would like to reassure all Dr Watt's patients, potentially impacted by this issue, that we are moving as quickly as possible to address any concerns they may have."" Some of those who received letters on Tuesday have shared their experiences with BBC News NI. Kathy Ellis said that strong medication she did not need ""stole"" her life. ""I was like a zombie,"" she said. However, she improved after a new consultant changed her treatment. ""I feel so much better until today, until I got the letter,"" she said. Maeve Falconer said she was absolutely furious at Tuesday's patient recall ""I'm angry. I've been very tearful and crying all day. That's my life, how dare they."" Maeve Falconer said she was diagnosed with MS but later found out that was not the case. ""I believed that I had MS. I'd told my family, I'd told my employers, my husband told his employers. ""I thought if I told people I took control of it - and then to find out in February I didn't have MS, that was a bit of a shock."" She added: ""I am absolutely furious. I'm not recalled because I actually fell through the cracks before getting to that stage. ""But I'm so, so cross to think that I was not the only person in this position, that there are so many others who potentially are looking at the same thing as me or worse."" One caller to BBC's Talkback programme said his daughter, who has brain stem epilepsy, was a patient of Dr Watt's. ""We received a letter this morning (Tuesday) to go to the Royal Victoria Hospital on Sunday"", he said. ""She hasn't had an appointment with neurology for at least five years and now this has come like a bombshell - it's frightening. ""We feel we are left in limbo,"" the caller added. Nichola Mallon said getting answers was like ""beating our heads off a brick wall"" The trust said that it also wanted to reassure patients on already long waiting lists that they would not be affected by the recall. Dr Mitchelson said the consultants were very much aware of Northern Ireland's ""unacceptable"" waiting times and running 200 additional clinics would ensure these patients would not have to wait any longer. When asked by the BBC if the General Medical Council had been made aware of the review and Dr Watt, a spokesperson said that the trust had taken all ""appropriate action including liaising with the GMC"". ""It remains unclear if Dr Watt has referred himself to the governing body or if the Belfast Health Trust has done so on his behalf,"" the spokesperson said.

"Belfast trust recalls 2,500 patients","The trust says it is a ""serious"" situation and has apologised More than 2,500 neurology patients in Northern Ireland, including children, are being recalled for a case review. The recall comes amid concerns some patients may have been misdiagnosed. The BBC can reveal that this follows a review of the work of neurology consultant Dr Michael Watt at the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Neurology is the treatment of brain conditions including MS, Parkinson's Disease, Stroke and Motor Neurone Disease. Following the case review, the patients involved could receive devastating news. While some of these conditions can be treated, nearly all are life-changing. Patients being recalled should have received a letter by post on Tuesday. It will include details about how to make an appointment. An advice line is now operating for those who have been affected - it is 0800 980 1100. The Ulster Independent Clinic, which confirmed that Dr Watt operated a private practice at the clinic until June 2017, said it would be operating a helpline for concerned patients from 09:00 BST on Wednesday morning - the number is 028 9068 6511. Both the trust and the Royal College of Physicians have carried out separate reviews of patients' notes. Concerns were initially raised by a GP about a patient's diagnosis and treatment in December 2016. The Belfast Health Trust said it was a ""serious"" situation and apologised to patients and their families. Nichola Mallon, SDLP, told the BBC that she raised the issue on behalf of several constituents last year. ""It is as if we have been beating our heads off a brick wall, trying to get information about what is going on and trying to get answers including diagnosis,"" she said. ""Some of my constituents have been in Dr Watt's care for years. But they can't get a proper diagnosis. So they are living in pain their quality of life is deteriorating, they don't know whether they are on the right medication, some cannot work."" Among the 2,500 under review are children, some of whom may have been struggling with a wrong diagnosis. A consultant who once worked alongside Dr Michael Watt said all of his colleagues were shocked. He said it was a ""daunting"" time for everyone, but patient safety must come first. Read more analysis from Marie-Louise here. This video can not be played 'We have never been involved with a recall of this scale' Dr Mark Mitchelson is responsible for neurosciences at the Belfast Health Trust. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, he said: ""While we hope this will affect a very small number of patients - the change in diagnosis could potentially be very significant. ""We understand that this must be incredibly anxious for them and, for that, we are deeply sorry for any distress that has been caused. ""Equally, we feel it's absolutely vital that we are prudent and cautious when dealing with any patient safety issues and hence, that is why we are recalling these patients to be seen."" Neurology is the field of medicine concerned with the operation of the brain While there is particular concern over a small number of his patients, the trust has decided to recall everyone who is currently in Dr Watt's care. The trust did not rule out the possibility, at a later stage,  it could stretch to patients who died while in Dr Watt's care.

He described their ""social function"" as ""usury and banking and such"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said  the remarks were ""anti-Semitic and pathetic"".

Children âmurdered in feud arson attack',"Lia, Demi, Brandon and Lacie died in the fire and their mother Michelle Pearson was left in a coma Four sleeping children were murdered after being trapped in their bedrooms when their house was torched with petrol bombs, a court has been told. Zak Bolland, 23, launched the attack after being involved in a feud with the victims' 16-year-old brother Kyle Pearson, Manchester Crown Court heard. The four siblings, aged between three and 15, were killed in the blaze in Walkden, Salford on 11 December 2017. Mr Bolland, Courtney Brierley and David Worrall all deny four counts of murder. Mr Bolland, along with Mr Worrall, 26, removed a fence panel from the garden of the Pearsons' home, smashed a kitchen window and threw in two lit petrol bombs, the jury was told. One landed near the stairs, blocking the only exit to the ground floor and trapping the victims upstairs as flames engulfed the three-bedroom mid-terrace house. Demi Pearson, 15, her brother, Brandon, aged eight and sister, Lacie, aged seven, sleeping in a front bedroom, all died in the blaze, which started at about 05:00 GMT. ""Their apparently lifeless bodies were recovered by the firefighters who attended and battled their way through the heat, smoke and flames,"" Paul Reid QC, prosecuting, told the court. Demi, Brandon and Lacie all died in the blaze while Lia died in hospital two days later Their mother, Michelle Pearson, 35, was rescued along with her youngest daughter, Lia, aged three, who died in hospital two days later. Kyle Pearson, who had been feuding with Mr Bolland, escaped with a friend, Bobby Harris, who was also staying at the house. He saw the light from his sister Demi's mobile phone at the window before she coughed in the thick smoke then appeared to fall away from the window, the court heard. Prosecution witness Abigail Toone, who drove Mr Bolland and Mr Worrall to the scene of the arson attack, described how they had been drinking and getting ""loud and aggressive"" in the hours before the incident. At his home, Mr Bolland said: ""Shall we do it?"" and Mr Worrall replied, ""Yeah, I'll do it"", the jury heard. At about 04:30, the pair armed with an axe and machete, got a frightened Ms Toone to drive them to a petrol station where Mr Worrall put petrol from a pump into a green petrol can, the jury heard. Ms Toone drove them back to Mr Bolland's house before Ms Brierley gave her directions to an alley near the Pearsons' home. After the attack Mr Bolland and Mr Worrall ran back to Ms Toone's car and they drove away, the court heard. The firebombing was the culmination of a series of tit-for-tat attacks between Mr Bolland and Kyle Pearson, Mr Reid told the jury. Mr Bolland claimed Kyle owed him Â£500 for an arson attack on his car and sent harassing text messages. Both sides broke windows in each other's homes and Mr Bolland threatened to fire bomb Kyle's house, the court heard. The threat led Mrs Pearson to call police on 26 November and as a result the fire service fitted a letter box cover, Mr Reid said. Mrs Pearson's bin was later set on fire and the word ""grass"" was spray-painted on her house. Jurors were told Mr Bolland and Mr Worrall visited the house four hours before the fatal fire and attacked the door before Mr Bolland shouted: ""Watch, all your family's getting it, they're all gonna die."" Kyle Pearson was ""really worried"" they would return so he got a door and wedged it behind the front door, Mr Reid said. Mr Bolland has admitted reckless arson, a charge his girlfriend Ms Brierley, 20, and Mr Worrall both deny. All three also deny three counts of attempted murder relating to Michelle Pearson, Kyle Pearson and Bobby Harris.

Paris police arrest 200 in May Day riots,"This video can not be played Cars were set ablaze and shops wrecked by masked and hooded rioters French police are holding 109 people - a day after masked demonstrators smashed shop windows and torched cars during May Day protests. Far-left anarchist groups, known as Black Blocs, hijacked a peaceful rally against President Emmanuel Macron's public sector labour reforms. Police said about 1,200 masked and hooded protesters attended the annual 1 May demonstration by labour unions. Four people, including a police officer, were lightly wounded. Police on Wednesday corrected an earlier figure of more than 200 arrested given out by the Interior Minister Gerard Collomb. The protesters were swamped with teargas and sprayed with a water cannon in an effort to disperse them. Protesters wore protective masks against tear gas They pulled down signs and clashed with officers The black-clad protesters attempted to hold up the demonstration march, before smashing shop windows along the route and torching a McDonald's near Austerlitz station. Various vehicles and a car dealership were also set ablaze, and graffiti was scrawled on walls. France's protesters revive ghosts of 1968 revolt Macron's reforms spark nationwide strikes In pictures: Workers unite for May Day Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux criticised the protesters for covering their faces. ""When you have sincere convictions, you demonstrate with your face unmasked,"" he said. ""Those who wear hoods are the enemies of democracy."" A protester holds the French Tricolour with an anti-Macron slogan outside a destroyed McDonald's Other demonstrators rallied against public sector labour reforms There is widespread discontent in labour unions over Mr Macron's reforms.Rail staff have begun three months of nationwide strikesover a planned overhaul of state-run railway SNCF. Tens of thousands of teachers, nurses and other workers joined the rail staff on strike in March. The president has said he will not back down on his agenda. Unions said the number of peaceful protesters at the main demonstration on Tuesday was about 55,000. Police put the number lower, at about 20,000.

Brexiteers send customs 'ultimatum' to PMThe government is under pressure to drop one of its preferred options to manage customs after Brexit.2m2 minutes agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? Theresa May is facing a demand from Conservative Brexiteers to drop one of the government's preferred post-Brexit customs options. A 30-page document passed to the BBC says a ""customs partnership"" would make meaningful trade deals ""impossible"" to forge and render the UK's International Trade Department ""obsolete"". It came ahead of a key meeting of senior ministers about Brexit. The committee discussed rival options to replace customs union membership. Afterwards, a source told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that a narrow majority of those at the meeting had said the customs partnership was not viable, and it was suggested it would not be taken back to full cabinet for further discussion. But Downing Street sources said the meeting agreed that this option and the proposal for a ""highly streamlined"" arrangement were still ""serious propositions"", although they acknowledged there were ""challenges that need to be addressed"". Theresa May is understood to have asked for ""revised proposals"", our correspondent added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

All EU members are part of the customs union, within which there are no internal tariffs (taxes) on goods transported between them. There is also a common tariff agreed on goods entering from outside. The UK government has said it is leaving the EU customs union so will have to agree a new arrangement for what happens at the UK/EU border post-Brexit and whether businesses will be hit with tariffs or not. The complicating factor is that the UK wants to strike its own post-Brexit trade deals with other countries rather than have to stick with deals struck for the EU customs union. A 'highly streamlined' customs arrangement - This would minimise customs checks rather than getting rid of them altogether, by using new technologies and things like trusted trader schemes, which could allow companies to pay duties in bulk every few months rather than every time their goods cross a border A customs partnership - This would remove the need for new customs checks at the border. The UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. If those goods didn't leave the UK and UK tariffs on them were lower, companies could then claim back the difference. Government sources say the situation is constantly evolving. It is possible another option could emerge combining elements of the first two. But any solution would aim to avoid the need for physical border checks on the island of Ireland. Wednesday's cabinet sub-committee meeting may not reach a final decision on the proposals - and don't forget, this is all about the UK agreeing its stance before more Brexit talks. The EU does not appear to be keen on either option. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said there were ""a number of ways"" to deliver Britain's objectives on customs arrangements after Brexit. Reality Check: The government's customs options Please upgrade your browser The BBC's economic editor Kamal Ahmed says he understandsChancellor Philip Hammond (pictured above) favours a customs partnership. Mr Hammond and other Remain-voting cabinet ministers, such as business secretary Greg Clark, are hoping to persuade the prime minister to keep it on the table when the 11-strong Brexit sub-committee meets later. Remain-voting Tory backbenches also want it to remain an option. One of them, Vicky Ford, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it did not mean remaining in the EU ""by the back door"" as critics claim and could protect British business. Brexiteer cabinet ministers such as Boris Johnson, Liam Fox (pictured above) and David Davis - and a group of Conservative backbenchers led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, whose Tory Research Group produced the dossier sent to Mrs May. The Cabinet all signed up to the two customs optionswhen they were announced last year,externalbut some are now thought to be worried that the customs partnership idea would mean a slide towards remaining in the customs union. Backbench Tory Brexiteers fear the scheme would be expensive and complex to operate, and could mean the UK is indefinitely trapped within the EU's customs arrangements - and unable to strike its own post-Brexit trade deals with other nations around the world. Mr Rees-Mogg said it would not only be ""unworkable"", it would the same as staying in the EU and was the ""single market by another name"". Housing minister Dominic Raab told BBC Radio 5 Live's Anna Foster the ""streamlined"" customs option was ""winning the argument"" in government as it was ""the one that's been tried and tested the most"". According to the Press Association, Downing Street has been privately warned that a customs partnership could collapse the government, as committed Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches regard it as unacceptable. A senior Conservative told the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg ""the customs partnership is the breaking point"", suggesting that if No 10 doesn't do the Brexiteers' bidding, they could withhold their support. On Tuesday, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox refused to deny he would resign if a customs partnership was agreed in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Read Laura Kuenssberg's blog The MPs' dossier cautions against continued deliberations in government, saying that ""further delay is itself a decision"". It is the strongest warning yet from Tory Brexiteers to the PM, who have largely been supportive, in public, of her efforts to negotiate Britain's exit from the EU. Mr Rees-Mogg (pictured above) told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""we are not in the business of making threats"". If it came to a confidence vote in the prime minister over the issue, the Tory MP said it was ""inconceivable"" that he would vote against her. Downing Street sources denied the document was an ultimatum, calling it part of the policy-making process. David Davis is preparing for the next round of talks with EU Brexit chief Michel Barnier Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Tuesday that Brussels was ""pushing back"" against both proposals. The EU thinks the customs partnership proposal is very ambitious - to put it mildly - and has given the UK a list of questions about it, writes the BBC's Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming. What new burdens will be placed on customs officials in the EU27? How will the UK apply EU customs law if it's no longer in the club? How will the ""track and trace"" system work? The warning from Brussels about the UK government's other option, a ""highly streamlined"" customs deal, is that it doesn't fully solve the problem of avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which they say is about more than just tariffs. Hanging over it all is the issue of trust because the EU and UK are still arguing over 2bn euros (Â£1.76bn) of allegedly unpaid duties on Chinese shoes and textiles imported into Britain, and legal action looms. The EU's negotiators wonder whether the other side is about to change tack on a major issue, and they suggest that the upcoming political deal about the shape of the future relationship may have to be very vague if it's to find approval from a divided British government, parliament and public. Labour wants the UK to form a customs union with the EU after Brexit and says the prime minister is ""being held hostage by the extreme Brexiteers in her own party"". The party's shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said: ""Labour has been clear that the best way to protect jobs, the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland is by negotiating a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union after Brexit. ""However, the Tories appear more interested in issuing ultimatums and squabbling amongst themselves than acting in the national interest."" The Lib Dems, who back staying in the customs union and want a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said Mrs May was ""kicking the can down the road in a desperate attempt to hold the widening fissures of the Tory party together - it cannot and will not work"". SNP MP Tommy Sheppard accused the Scottish Conservative MPs who were among the group of Brexiteers warning Mrs May about a customs partnership of being ""British nationalists, who long for the return of days of Empire and for the time when the map of the world was mostly pink"".

Hammond backs EU 'customs partnership'The BBC understands the Chancellor prefers a plan for the UK to collect customs levies for the EU.4h4 hours agoBusinessComments,"Philip Hammond visits the Openreach training centre in Bradford Wednesday sees the next stage in the difficult process of the government agreeing its approach to trade with the European Union. Theresa May will host a meeting of her Brexit cabinet - the inner sanctum that attempts to thrash out the knottiest issues left on the table. One is the future customs relationship between the UK and EU. That will be a vital part of any future trade deal as the UK exports 50% of its goods to the EU. The government has said it wants to leave the EU single market and the customs union and at the same time retain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The big and highly complicated question is how? I am told that the chancellor will use the meeting tomorrow to argue in favour of a close ""customs partnership"" with the EU, or at least not rule it out at this early stage. Senior sources have told me that Philip Hammond sees advantages in the proposal that would mean the UK could set its own tariffs but would also be obliged to mirror European Union customs rules. He is likely to receive support from the business secretary, Greg Clark. The arrangement would mean the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for any other union member state. Businesses would claim back any tariff rebates from the government if the goods stayed in the UK. Although technically difficult - some say impossible - officials believe such a partnership could ""solve"" the Irish border question as there would be no hard customs border between the UK and the EU. It still leaves open the problem of what happens if there are substantive regulatory differences between the UK and the EU beyond tariff arrangements. Whitehall sources I have spoken to say a customs partnership would help the many British businesses that only export to the EU. It would also leave the UK free to sign trade deals with other countries, a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy. Sources said a fourth advantage is that it would be for the UK to sort out the very difficult technical and infrastructure issues alone as they would all fall on the British side of the border. Mr Hammond's position is likely to cause controversy within the Conservative Party. Brexit-backing MPs believe the partnership model may be used as a back door route to rejoining the customs union. ""Some of the people proposing it know such an immensely complicated - and untried - arrangement is guaranteed to end in chaotic failure,"" said David Jones, the former Brexit minister, last month. ""At which point they will conclude we have no choice but to rejoin the fully fledged customs union."" The second option put forward by the government - and to be discussed at Wednesday's Cabinet meeting - is called ""maximum facilitation"" or a ""highly streamlined customs arrangement"". Under the ""maxfac"" model - supported by many pro-Brexit MPs - any customs checks needed at borders between the EU and the UK once Britain has left the EU would be as friction free as possible. Technology and trusted trader status licences would be used to smooth the flow of goods and services, its proponents argue. Its backers also say it would be a more definitive break with the EU and is more technically feasible as it would in part be operationally based on arrangements Britain already has with non-EU nations. Critics say it would not solve the Irish border question as there would still need to be tariff checks. Read more from Kamal Ahmed here The whole debate on Wednesday will ultimately be a rather surreal affair. Senior figures I have spoken to admit that both models are untried, possibly unworkable and it could take years to build either system. The EU is yet to be convinced that they are viable alternatives to its own ""backstop"" solution to the Irish border question - placing a customs border in the Irish Sea and approaching the whole island of Ireland as a single trading entity. Theresa May has said that the government would never agree to such a plan. What is clear is that there is still a very significant amount of work to be done if any customs policy is to be agreed by both the government and the EU, which wants there to be ""substantial progress"" by June. Without agreement, the conclusion of Britain's overall withdrawal deal - due to be signed in October or December - would be in jeopardy.

RAF 'may have killed civilians' in IraqA BBC investigation casts doubt on the MoD claim it has not seen evidence that strikes against IS caused civilian casualties.3m3 minutes agoUK,"Mosul was retaken in December, three years after being seized by IS A source inside the coalition fighting the Islamic State group has told the BBC he believes civilians have been killed as a result of RAF air strikes. The claim casts into doubt the Ministry of Defence's statement it has seen ""no evidence"" that its strikes in Iraq have caused civilian casualties. Other coalition members have alerted the UK to times when civilians may have been harmed, a BBC investigation found. The MoD says ""everything possible"" is done to minimise the risk to civilians. But it has also been discovered that some RAF bombs have malfunctioned and strayed off target. Estimates for the number of civilians killed in the nine-month battle for Mosul - the last stronghold of the Islamic State group in Iraq - range from more than 1,000 to 10 times that number. The war against 'Islamic State' in maps and charts How many bombs has the UK dropped in 2017? Can civilian deaths be avoided in RAF strikes on IS? Many were trapped, held hostage by IS who used civilians as human shields. Some were also the unintended victims of the US-led coalition's bombing campaign, which saw 29,000 munitions dropped or fired in and around the city. The UK was second to the US in the number of airstrikes it conducted for thecoalition,external, a grouping of 75 countries formed in 2014 to defeat IS. Only about a dozen members of the coalition conducted airstrikes in and around Mosul, with British warplanes hitting more than 750 targets. An RAF Tornado was involved in the January 2017 strike The source, who has not been named to protect his identity, says it was ""impossible"" to conduct a bombing campaign in highly-populated areas, like Mosul, without killing civilians. He said he had seen evidence that British airstrikes had caused civilian casualties ""on several occasions"". ""To suggest they have not - as has been done - is nonsense,"" he added. The source described a strike on 9 January last year when an RAF Tornado fired a Brimstone missile on what was described as a ""lorry bomb"" in eastern Mosul. It caused a large secondary explosion and the source said he believes two civilians were ""almost certainly"" killed. The MoD insisted their ""very careful analysis"" had concluded that those killed were ""highly probably"" IS fighters. It refused a request to view the strike footage it filmed from the air and will not release the co-ordinates of other RAF airstrikes. But it did eventually confirm the location of this one strike. Many potential eyewitness to the strike were in hiding at the time but some say IS fighters were in the area. And there were reports of civilians being injured too. One man said the ""women and men were screaming in the aftermath. Some of them were wounded."" The incident highlights the limitations of making assessments only from the air. Both the MoD and the source describe the target as a ""lorry bomb"" but those on the ground insist it was smaller  - the size of an SUV. Another source in the coalition said it is possible for two different people looking at the same aerial imagery to reach different conclusions. Aerial surveillance cannot see through walls and rubble. During the BBC's investigation other factors emerged that might cast some doubt on whether British airstrikes have caused civilian deaths including: Reports of a number of RAF weapons malfunctions Instances of some bombs failing to detonate Occasions when bombs have strayed and exploded hundreds of metres off target - hitting buildings that were not even even under surveillance The MoD insists a ""very low percentage"" of weapons have malfunctioned but it has refused to give numbers. But other coalition members have highlighted, or ""flagged"", several incidents when UK airstrikes may have caused civilian harm. On each occasion the MoD says it saw no evidence it caused civilian casualties. Over the past three and a half years the RAF has dropped more than 3,700 bombs and missiles in the campaign against IS in Iraq and Syria. Cockpit footage of an RAF air strike on an IS artillery position in Mosul in 2017 It has still not claimed responsibility for a single civilian death. The MoD says it has done ""everything possible"" to minimise the risk to civilians. It highlights the professionalism of the RAF crews involved, their ""rigorous targeting"" procedures and  use of ""precision weapons"".  But it has never had anyone on the ground to investigate allegations of civilian harm. The MoD has been careful in its choice of words. It has also admitted it cannot completely eliminate the risk to civilians. In saying it has seen ""no evidence"" of causing civilian casualties it is not ruling out the possibility that it might have happened. Yet there is also the danger the public might have also been left with the impression that hundreds of British airstrikes in a heavily-populated city, like Mosul, caused zero civilian deaths. Back in the tightly packed streets of Mosul's old city, which suffered the heaviest bombardment, there seems to be no doubt that airstrikes by the US-led coalition did kill civilians. Abdel Rahman Ali lost five of his children in a coalition strike Abdel Rahman Ali lost five of his children, when a bomb hit his home, and says 47 civilians were killed as a result of the air strikes in his street alone. ""Nobody destroyed us except the coalition,"" he said. Airwars,external, a group which has been monitoring civilian casualties,  says it is likely that between 1,066 and 1,579 civilians died in the fighting in Mosul. Of the half a dozen coalition members who carried out airstrikes in the city, so far only the US and Australia have accepted responsibility for causing civilian casualties. At present the coalition has admitted to causing just over 350 civilian deaths in Mosul. US Central Command is still working its way through a list of other allegations. This video can not be played Why a group of volunteers is digging out bodies in Mosul's Old City Chris Woods of Airwars says: ""It's simply fanciful to claim no civilians have been harmed by the RAF. ""We don't live in a world of magic bombs and missiles that only kill bad people."" The reality is that while the UK and coalition airstrikes helped rid the city of the scourge of IS the MoD has carried out no investigations on the ground counting the cost to civilian life.

Soldier 'thought he would get Â£120k payout',"Victoria Cilliers almost died in the 2015 parachute jump A soldier accused of trying to kill his spouse by tampering with her parachute thought he would get a Â£120,000 life insurance payout, his wife told a jury. Emile Cilliers, 38, of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps, denies two charges of attempted murder. Winchester Crown Court heard that Mr Cilliers owed Â£19,000 to his wife Victoria Cilliers. Mrs Cilliers also told the court she ""elaborated"" when she gave her original statement to police. When questioned by the police in May 2015, Mrs Cilliers said Emile Cilliers had taken her parachute rig into the toilet with him at the airfield, and he was there ""for about five minutes"". But on Tuesday, she told the court that he had been quicker than she had first alleged and that she ""elaborated"". ""I'm not saying I'm lying completely. I was angry when I made that statement and lied throughout it in order to paint Emile in a bad picture,"" she told the prosecution. An accident investigation team found that the lines to the main canopy were tangled and two links connecting the reserve parachute's canopy to the harness had been removed. The court was played a 90-minute video recording of Mrs Cilliers' original interview with Wiltshire Police. On the tape Mrs Cilliers was wearing a body brace and using crutches due to her injuries, which included a smashed pelvis, collapsed lung and broken ribs. She told the interviewing police officer that as soon as she pulled the parachute cord she knew ""something wasn't right"" and was ""fighting against"" the chute as it span out of control. She lost consciousness while falling and only briefly came round when she hit the ground and again when she was in A&E at hospital in Southampton. Michael Bowes QC, for the prosecution, also took Mrs Cilliers through the couple's financial arrangements. Mrs Cilliers told Winchester Crown Court both she and her husband thought the insurance money would go directly to him rather than to her estate. Documents read to the court showed that she had some savings and owned the family home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, while Mr Cilliers had no assets. She was also questioned about her will, in which she left everything to her two children, unbeknownst to her husband. The prosecution alleges Mr Cilliers sabotaged his wife's main and reserve parachutes, causing them to fail during a jump at the Army Parachute Association at Netheravon, Wiltshire, on Easter Sunday 2015. Mrs Cilliers, described as ""a highly experienced parachutist and parachute instructor"", survived the 4,000ft (1,220m) fall, which has been described by experts as ""a miracle"". Now largely recovered from her injuries, Mrs Cilliers remained standing throughout her testimony. Mr Cilliers, a sergeant in the Royal Army Physical Training Corps, denies two charges of attempted murder and another of criminal damage with reckless endangerment to life. The trial continues.

Ministers back down on tax haven registers,"The amendment would require overseas territories like the Cayman Islands to publish company ownership registers The government has agreed to calls for new measures aimed at increasing transparency in offshore tax havens. Facing a possible Commons defeat, ministers said they would not oppose an amendment to force British overseas territories to publish details of the true owners of companies based there. Campaigners say public registers make it easier to uncover corruption, money laundering and tax dodging. The move was backed by both Labour and Tory MPs. The government has also agreed to a new laws to sanction people suspected of gross human rights abuses. What are Britain's overseas territories and crown dependencies? With no Conservative majority in the House of Commons, the government is vulnerable to any rebellion, and 19 Tory MPs had backed the amendment on company ownership registers. As MPs debated the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill in the Commons, Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan said the government had not wanted to damage the overseas territories' autonomy by legislating directly. But he added: ""We've listened to the strength of feeling in the House on this issue and accept that it is without a doubt the majority view of this House that the overseas territories should have public registers."" He added that the government would ""respect the will of the House"" and not vote against the amendment put forward by Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell and Labour's Dame Margaret Hodge. This video can not be played Dame Margaret Hodge said the government had failed to take on simple measures The amendment would require the UK government to take steps to provide that British Overseas Territories establish publicly accessible registers of the beneficial ownership of companies. It does not include Britain's crown dependencies, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Oxfam welcomed the government's concession, which it said would help developing countries ""recoup billions of lost revenue"", and Transparency International said it was ""a hugely significant moment"". Dame Margaret said the move was ""a remarkable, important and really world-changing measure in relation to the fight against corruption"". Mr Mitchell added: ""The overseas territories share our freedom. They travel under our flag, and they should also share our values."" But speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Lorna Smith, interim executive director of British Virgin Island Finance, accused supporters of the legislation of ""colonialism"". Ms Smith said the British Virgin Islands had ""done nothing wrong"" and were deemed ""largely compliant"" on transparency by international bodies, saying her concern was one of ""constitutional infringement"". ""If this bill goes through, it's like Scotland feeling that Westminster is legislating for Scotland,"" she said. ""It's simply not right."" As well as the beneficial ownership register, Sir Alan confirmed the bill would impose sanctions for human rights abuses. It is known as the ""Magnitsky"" amendment after a Russian lawyer who died in prison after alleging fraud by state officials. Sir Alan said that anyone sanctioned under the bill would have their names published on a publicly-availably list. Welcoming the amendment, Lib Dem Tom Brake said: ""These people and their money are not welcome in the UK and must not be given sanctuary in our cities.""

India worried as Taj Mahal changes colour,"Students help clean up the Yamuna River, a source of pollution said to be damaging the Taj Mahal India's Supreme Court has instructed the government to seek foreign help to fix what it described as a worrying change in colour at the Taj Mahal. ""Even if you have the expertise, you are not utilising it. Or perhaps you don't care,"" court justices said. The court said the famous tomb, built in the 17th Century from white marble and other materials, had turned yellow and was now turning brown and green. Pollution, construction and insect dung are said to be among the causes. Justices Madan Lokur and Deepak Gupta examined photographs of the mausoleum submitted by environmentalists and ordered the government to seek expertise from inside India and abroad. The government has previously shuttered thousands of factories near the Taj Mahal, but activists say its marble is still losing its lustre. Why is India's Taj Mahal turning green? This video can not be played Pollution and insects are among the factors to blame Sewage in the Yamuna River, alongside the palace, attracts insects which excrete waste onto the palace's walls, staining them. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the city of Agra and is now one of the world's leading tourist attractions, drawing as many as 70,000 people every day. Insect faeces are leaving green patches on the marble The dirt problem is not a new one - several times over the past two decades or so the palace's white marble has been coated in a mud pack in an attempt to clean it - but there are fears the problem is worsening. Its most recent mud bath began in January. Scaling the walls on scaffolds, workers plaster the surfaces with Fuller's earth, a mud paste that absorbs dirt, grease, and animal excrement. Think of a giant face mask, but for a palace. The mud is then washed off, taking the dirt with it. The current cleanup operation is expected to last until late this year. Another Supreme Court hearing has been set for 9 May. Why is India's Taj Mahal turning green? Politician says traitors built Taj Mahal Reality Check: Whose Taj Mahal is it anyway?

Iran hits back at Israel over nuclear claimIsrael's prime minister produced what he said was proof Iran had lied about its nuclear plans.3h3 hours agoMiddle East,"This video can not be played Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled on Monday what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive Iran has called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a ""liar"" after he accused the country of deceiving the world about its nuclear intentions. Mr Netanyahu produced what he said were copies of Iranian files detailing a project to build nuclear weapons, which was reportedly mothballed 15 years ago. Iran said it had never sought to build a bomb when it signed an international deal to curb nuclear activity in 2015. US President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of the deal. American allies like the UK and France have called for the agreement to be maintained, arguing that  Iran has abided by it, steadily reducing its capacity to produce weapons-grade uranium. Hostility between Israel and Iran, already bitter enemies, has grown as Iran builds up its military in Syria, on Israel's doorstep. How important are Israel's revelations? Could the nuclear deal collapse? Why the bomb is back Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi described Mr Netanyahu as an ""infamous liar who has had nothing to offer except lies and deceits"". His accusations, he continued, were ""worn-out, useless and shameful"". Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the documents produced by Israel were a rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog. Israel says that Iran is not a reliable partner and the 2015 agreement was reached in bad faith. Speaking afterMr Netanyahu's presentation of the alleged secret Iranian files, Mark Regev, the Israeli ambassador to London, said the Iranian government had deliberately concealed its military nuclear programme. ""It appears we've caught them red-handed lying about what is ultimately a crucial element in the deal, one which is a prerequisite for future implementation of that very deal,"" he said. Not only did Mr Netanyahu give alleged details of Project Amad, the alleged Iranian nuclear weapons programme reportedly mothballed in 2003, but he said the project had continued at the Iranian defence ministry. He quoted the head of the alleged programme as saying ""special activities"" would continue ""under the title of scientific know-how developments"". Such work continued this year, Mr Netanyahu said, without giving evidence. Late 1980sIran allegedly begins secret nuclear weapons research(IAEA report, December 2015),external Flashback to 2015: John Kerry (left) negotiating for the US with Iran's Javad Zarif and the EU's Federica Mogherini 1999The Amad Project is launched, according to Israeli intelligence. In the years that follow, Iranian presidents consistently deny seeking to acquire nuclear weapons 2002Satellite photos reveal Iranian nuclear sites and Washington accuses Iran of ""across-the-board pursuit of weapons of mass destruction"" 2003The IAEA challenges Iran to prove it is not pursuing a nuclear weapons programme. Inspections follow and Amad is wound down, according to the IAEA's 2015 report 2006UN agrees first round of sanctions on Iran after it fails to demonstrate its burgeoning civilian nuclear programme is not weapons-related 2011The IAEA says Iran has been carrying out research that can only be used to develop a nuclear bomb trigger 2013Election in Iran of reformist president, Hassan Rouhani, gives boost to talks with world powers on nuclear programme 2015World powers reach deal with Iran on limiting Iranian nuclear activity in return for lifting of international economic sanctions 2018Israel produces what it says is documentary proof of Project Amad's existence 15 years earlier and accuses Iran of continuing ""special activities"" It pointed out that one of its own reports from 2015 had identified some Iranian activities in 2003 ""relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device"". There had been ""no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009"", according to that report. The White House initially responded to Mr Netanyahu's allegations by saying they were consistent with its understanding that Iran ""has"" a ""robust, clandestine nuclear weapons"" programme. However, it later corrected the statement by changing the tense of the verb to ""had"", blaming a ""clerical error"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the documents proved ""beyond any doubt"" that Iran had not told the truth. Donald Trump has asked for permanent restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment. He has warned the US will abandon the deal on 12 May - the next deadline for waiving sanctions - unless European signatories to the deal and Congress address his concerns. France said the Israeli findings could ""confirm the need for longer-term assurances on the Iranian programme"". The evidence appeared to confirm what European powers had known for more than a decade and a half, it added. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Mr Netanyahu's presentation on Iran's past nuclear weapons research underlined the ""importance of keeping the Iran nuclear deal's constraints on Tehran's nuclear ambitions"". ""The Iran nuclear deal is not based on trust about Iran's intentions; rather it is based on tough verification,"" he said. EU Foreign Policy ChiefFederica Mogherini said the documents had not put into question Iran's compliance with the deal,externalbut they should be analysed by the IAEA. The agreement signed between Iran, the US, China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain lifted crippling economic sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear programme. Fordo, here seen in 2009, formerly enriched uranium Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran is committed to slashing the number of its centrifuges, which are machines used to enrich uranium. It is also meant to cut its stockpile of enriched uranium drastically and not enrich remaining uranium to the level needed to produce nuclear weapons.

Soldier 'thought he would get Â£120k payout'Emile Cilliers is accused of trying to kill his wife by tampering with her parachute before a jump.4h4 hours agoWiltshire,"Victoria Cilliers almost died in the 2015 parachute jump A soldier accused of trying to kill his spouse by tampering with her parachute thought he would get a Â£120,000 life insurance payout, his wife told a jury.

RBS to cut branches and jobs,"Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is closing 162 branches across England and Wales. The bank said that 792 jobs would go as a result and staff would be offered voluntary redundancy. RBS branches in England and Wales, and the NatWest business in Scotland, had been earmarked for a new ""challenger bank"" under the name Williams & Glyn. However, that project is now not going ahead and the bank has reviewed its branch network. Some 109 branches will close in late July and August 2018, while a further 53 branches will close in November 2018. You can see a full list of the branches that will be closing here. An RBS spokesman said: ""We are no longer launching Williams & Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England and Wales. ""As a result, we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we've made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. ""Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England & Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs."" The latest branch closuresfollow existing plansto close 52 bank branches in Scotland that serve rural communities, and 197 NatWest branches. The Unite union has calculated that in the case of 71 of the 162 branches closing, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles to reach another one. Rob MacGregor, Unite's national officer, said: ""The Williams & Glyn saga rolls on as Royal Bank of Scotland continues with its shambolically poor management of this business. ""How does a taxpayer-funded institution spend Â£1.8bn on a failed IT project and in the next breath demolish the much-needed local bank branches? ""Today nearly 1,000 employees have finally been told of their dark futures because the bank has been calamitously managed for too long."" In February, following a campaign by local communities,RBS decided to keep 10 branches threatened with closure opentill the end of the year. Nicky Morgan, who chairs Parliament's Treasury Committee, said there was ""a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion"" as a result of the branch closures, since bank branches were still vital for many people. ""It's important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene,"" she said. Staff were braced for something like this, though the scale of the closures and job losses is a shock. Last year the European Commission said RBS could forget about trying to hive off part of its business and, instead, set up a fund to support new rivals. Ever since then the writing was on the wall for most of the people and branches which RBS had shoved into Williams & Glyn, a Frankenstein bank which no one seemed to want. That was the trigger, but it's also a fact that big banks have been looking for excuses to close as many branches as they can. And they would have you believe it is partly your fault, if you've joined the legions who bank on computers and mobile phones. For customers wondering where it will all end, it seems inevitable that we will end up with even fewer branches. Those that survive may be dedicated to selling complicated products like investments and pensions, and sorting out tricky complaints. Unite is calling on RBS ""not to abandon their responsibilities"" to the communities that depend on the affected bank branches. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan recently defended the bank's closure of its Scottish branches,saying that mobile banks are serving 440 communities. However, the bank has faced criticism from customers that the mobile banks do not stop in each location for long enough. RBS has promoted online banking and its mobile banking app as an alternative to going into branches RBS has also tried to persuade customers to start using online banking and its companion smartphone mobile banking app. But the bank has had to recognise that not everyone wants to handle their banking digitally. To this end, today it announced that it had created a special taskforce to help customers learn digital skills so they could use online banking in future. Which RBS branches are closing?

Hammond backs EU 'customs partnership',"Philip Hammond visits the Openreach training centre in Bradford Wednesday sees the next stage in the difficult process of the government agreeing its approach to trade with the European Union. Theresa May will host a meeting of her Brexit cabinet - the inner sanctum that attempts to thrash out the knottiest issues left on the table. One is the future customs relationship between the UK and EU. That will be a vital part of any future trade deal as the UK exports 50% of its goods to the EU. The government has said it wants to leave the EU single market and the customs union and at the same time retain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The big and highly complicated question is how? I am told that the chancellor will use the meeting tomorrow to argue in favour of a close ""customs partnership"" with the EU, or at least not rule it out at this early stage. Senior sources have told me that Philip Hammond sees advantages in the proposal that would mean the UK could set its own tariffs but would also be obliged to mirror European Union customs rules. He is likely to receive support from the business secretary, Greg Clark. The arrangement would mean the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for any other union member state. Businesses would claim back any tariff rebates from the government if the goods stayed in the UK. Although technically difficult - some say impossible - officials believe such a partnership could ""solve"" the Irish border question as there would be no hard customs border between the UK and the EU. It still leaves open the problem of what happens if there are substantive regulatory differences between the UK and the EU beyond tariff arrangements. Whitehall sources I have spoken to say a customs partnership would help the many British businesses that only export to the EU. It would also leave the UK free to sign trade deals with other countries, a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy. Sources said a fourth advantage is that it would be for the UK to sort out the very difficult technical and infrastructure issues alone as they would all fall on the British side of the border. Mr Hammond's position is likely to cause controversy within the Conservative Party. Brexit-backing MPs believe the partnership model may be used as a back door route to rejoining the customs union. ""Some of the people proposing it know such an immensely complicated - and untried - arrangement is guaranteed to end in chaotic failure,"" said David Jones, the former Brexit minister, last month. ""At which point they will conclude we have no choice but to rejoin the fully fledged customs union."" The second option put forward by the government - and to be discussed at Wednesday's Cabinet meeting - is called ""maximum facilitation"" or a ""highly streamlined customs arrangement"". Under the ""maxfac"" model - supported by many pro-Brexit MPs - any customs checks needed at borders between the EU and the UK once Britain has left the EU would be as friction free as possible. Technology and trusted trader status licences would be used to smooth the flow of goods and services, its proponents argue. Its backers also say it would be a more definitive break with the EU and is more technically feasible as it would in part be operationally based on arrangements Britain already has with non-EU nations. Critics say it would not solve the Irish border question as there would still need to be tariff checks. Read more from Kamal Ahmed here The whole debate on Wednesday will ultimately be a rather surreal affair. Senior figures I have spoken to admit that both models are untried, possibly unworkable and it could take years to build either system. The EU is yet to be convinced that they are viable alternatives to its own ""backstop"" solution to the Irish border question - placing a customs border in the Irish Sea and approaching the whole island of Ireland as a single trading entity. Theresa May has said that the government would never agree to such a plan. What is clear is that there is still a very significant amount of work to be done if any customs policy is to be agreed by both the government and the EU, which wants there to be ""substantial progress"" by June. Without agreement, the conclusion of Britain's overall withdrawal deal - due to be signed in October or December - would be in jeopardy.

RBS to cut 162 branches and 792 jobs,"Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is closing 162 branches across England and Wales. The bank said that 792 jobs would go as a result and staff would be offered voluntary redundancy. RBS branches in England and Wales, and the NatWest business in Scotland, had been earmarked for a new ""challenger bank"" under the name Williams & Glyn. However, that project is now not going ahead and the bank has reviewed its branch network. Some 109 branches will close in late July and August 2018, while a further 53 branches will close in November 2018. You can see a full list of the branches that will be closing here. An RBS spokesman said: ""We are no longer launching Williams & Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England and Wales. ""As a result, we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we've made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. ""Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England & Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs."" The latest branch closuresfollow existing plansto close 52 bank branches in Scotland that serve rural communities, and 197 NatWest branches. The Unite union has calculated that in the case of 71 of the 162 branches closing, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles to reach another one. Rob MacGregor, Unite's national officer, said: ""The Williams & Glyn saga rolls on as Royal Bank of Scotland continues with its shambolically poor management of this business. ""How does a taxpayer-funded institution spend Â£1.8bn on a failed IT project and in the next breath demolish the much-needed local bank branches? ""Today nearly 1,000 employees have finally been told of their dark futures because the bank has been calamitously managed for too long."" In February, following a campaign by local communities,RBS decided to keep 10 branches threatened with closure opentill the end of the year. Nicky Morgan, who chairs Parliament's Treasury Committee, said there was ""a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion"" as a result of the branch closures, since bank branches were still vital for many people. ""It's important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene,"" she said. Staff were braced for something like this, though the scale of the closures and job losses is a shock. Last year the European Commission said RBS could forget about trying to hive off part of its business and, instead, set up a fund to support new rivals. Ever since then the writing was on the wall for most of the people and branches which RBS had shoved into Williams & Glyn, a Frankenstein bank which no one seemed to want. That was the trigger, but it's also a fact that big banks have been looking for excuses to close as many branches as they can. And they would have you believe it is partly your fault, if you've joined the legions who bank on computers and mobile phones. For customers wondering where it will all end, it seems inevitable that we will end up with even fewer branches. Those that survive may be dedicated to selling complicated products like investments and pensions, and sorting out tricky complaints. Unite is calling on RBS ""not to abandon their responsibilities"" to the communities that depend on the affected bank branches. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan recently defended the bank's closure of its Scottish branches,saying that mobile banks are serving 440 communities. However, the bank has faced criticism from customers that the mobile banks do not stop in each location for long enough. RBS has promoted online banking and its mobile banking app as an alternative to going into branches RBS has also tried to persuade customers to start using online banking and its companion smartphone mobile banking app. But the bank has had to recognise that not everyone wants to handle their banking digitally. To this end, today it announced that it had created a special taskforce to help customers learn digital skills so they could use online banking in future. Which RBS branches are closing?

Zuckerberg: This has been an intense year,"This video can not be played WATCH: How Facebook plans to disrupt internet dating Facebook's chief has said that 2018 has been an ""intense year"" for his firm. But Mark Zuckerberg also took the opportunity to unveil a dating service among other new products at his firm's annual F8 developers conference in San Jose, California. He told his audience that the match-making feature would take privacy issues in mind and would launch ""soon"". The company can ill afford another data scandal as it continues to be embroiled in the Cambridge Analytica affair. ""There are 200 million people on Facebook who list themselves as single,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. ""And if we are committed to building meaningful relationships, then this is perhaps the most meaningful of all."" Shares in the dating business Match Group fell after the announcement and closed more than 22% below their opening price. The firm owns Tinder, a dating app that sources its profile information from Facebook. Facebook has faced fierce criticism ever since it emerged that it had failed to check whether political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had deleted data harvested about millions of its users. Mr Zuckerberg said that this was a ""major breach of trust"" that must never happen again. How Facebook plans to disrupt dating 'Hate speech button' fazes Facebook users Zuckerberg faces angry developers WhatsApp boss and co-founder Jan Koum to quit As part of efforts to restore confidence, he said the firm was building a new Clear History tool to provide members with more control over how their information is used. The feature will: let members see which third-party sites and apps Facebook collects data from provide the ability to delete the information prevent Facebook from being able to add such details to their profile in the future However,in a related blog,external, Facebook has acknowledged that the tool will take several months to develop, and that it would still need to retain related information in ""rare cases"" for security reasons. Mr Zuckerberg also addressed his company's efforts to tackle fake news and detect operations designed to disrupt elections. But while he opted not to unveil a smart speaker - which the BBC understands had once been destined to launch at F8 - he did introduce other novelties. Users will be able to send each other text-only messages via a new chat tool The headline feature is a new service to help singletons on the platform meet potential dates. He said the opt-in feature would focus on ""real long-term relationships, not just hook-ups"", and would exclude existing friends from potential matches. ""We have designed this with privacy and safety in mind from the beginning,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Zuckerberg also announced that video chat and new augmented reality filters were coming to its photo-sharing Instagram app. In addition, he said that group video calling would soon launch on its WhatsApp messaging service. Big businesses will also benefit from new WhatsApp tools to help them communicate with their customers, he declared. The chief executive also paid tribute to WhatsApp's co-founder Jan Koum, who announced he was quitting the company yesterday. ""One of the things I'm most proud of is we've built the largest, fully encrypted network in the world,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. According to an earlierreport by the Washington Post, Mr Koum had decided to leave because he was unhappy that the forthcoming business tools would involve a weakening of WhatsApp's encryption. Mr Zuckerberg rounded off his list of unveils by revealing that his company's Oculus virtual reality division had begun shipping its first standalone headset, meaning the device does not need to be plugged into a PC or smartphone to work. Oculus Go provides its own computing power rather than requiring a PC or smartphone He said the $199 kit - which costs Â£199 in the UK - was the ""easiest way to get into VR"" and had the ""highest quality lenses and optics that we have ever built"". The firm's larger Oculus Rift headsets have proved less popular than many industry insiders had predicted, and appear to have been outsold by Sony's less powerful PlayStation VR gear. Experts are split about the new device's prospects. ""The new device makes VR much more accessible to everyone,"" commented Adrian Willings from the gadget review site Pocket-lint. ""It's a brilliant middle ground, but it's a mobile experience so not as good as a PC one."" But the head of games at the IHS consultancy was less positive. ""I see the Oculus Go headset as quite awkwardly positioned versus existing technology in the market,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls. ""The major thing it has going for it is its price point, but the fact it has a similar user-experience to a premium smartphone adapter headset limits its appeal."" Mr Zuckerberg had a defiant message for F8's attendees For Mark Zuckerberg there were two audiences for his speech - the 5,000 developers in the hall, many of them anxious about their businesses, and the two billion Facebook users who don't know whether they should trust the social network. For developers, who have seen much of their access to data frozen as the privacy crisis deepens, he announced the reopening of app reviews. That means an end to a logjam for new apps. There was a mild cheer for this quite limited move and a huge one when he told attendees they would all walk away with a free Oculus Go VR headset - some people are easily pleased. Facebook developers had complained that some of their apps had stopped working as a consequence of its emergency measures For the wider audience, Zuckerberg kept hammering away at what has become his new mantra - that Facebook needs to take a broader view of its responsibilities. He admitted mistakes - the Cambridge Analytica breach of trust, failing to spot Russian interference in elections - and outlined the various steps being taken to combat fakery, to investigate dodgy apps and to give users more control. Apart from a new feature allowing users to clear their history - with the warning that it might make the Facebook experience worse - there was little that was new. But there was a clear defiant message - yes, Facebook was acting to make users safer, but it would continue to launch new services like dating that expanded its reach. Mark Zuckerberg thinks Facebook's huge global audience still believes in his vision - no real signs here that he has been chastened by recent events. In a separate development, some US-based users have reported that a new prompt has appeared beneath posts on their News Feed asking them if the messages contain hate speech. The service apparently extends to updates written by Mr Zuckerberg himself. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Hospital nurses scoop Â£1m in lottery,"The nurses all work at Cleland Hospital in Lanarkshire A syndicate of 15 hospital nurses from Lanarkshire are celebrating after scooping Â£1m in the National Lottery. The group, from Cleland Hospital in Motherwell, each pocketed more than Â£66,666 after matching a Euromillions UK Millionaire Maker code. They have been playing together for three years - with their previous biggest win being Â£12. Between them, they plan to splash the cash on trips to Canada, Sri Lanka, cruises, new cars and a motorbike. Thirteen members of the syndicate opted to share news of their win. Their previous biggest win was Â£12 June Fraser, 58, who was in charge of checking tickets each week, said she had used the National Lottery app to check them on Saturday morning. ""I scanned the first one and it wasn't a winner - I actually thought that was the ticket for Friday night's draw and very nearly didn't scan the second one as I thought it was for a future draw,"" she said. ""When I did and it told me that we'd won Â£1m I thought the app must be broken - I couldn't believe it. ""My first phone call was to my ward where I managed to get hold of two of the other members who were working. ""I phoned a few other members but I was just too hyper to call everyone at that point. I still went into work later that afternoon though."" When Ms Fraser went to work she pinned the winning ticket inside her nurse's uniform. Carol Hamlyn, 59, said the win meant she could have a dream retirement. ""I am due to retire in November and this win will be life-changing for me,"" she said. ""I was going to have to keep doing a few shifts but now I have financial security and I can also look after my four children and my three grandchildren."" The first thing the nurses planned to spend their money on was a bumper batch of cakes and goodies to treat the staff, patients and families at Cleland Hospital.

"Jaw scaffolding 'helps our baby breathe'Noah Connell, who turns one this weekend, is the youngest person in the UK to have had the surgery.6h6 hours agoGlasgow & West Scotland","Noah Connell's had six operations including one so rare, it does not even have a name Noah Connell from Glasgow has a rare condition which could have stopped him from breathing. Doctors have carried out an operation on him that has never been carried out on a person so young in the UK. It involved inserting metal plates and pins into his jaw because he could not eat or breath properly. His parents have told BBC Scotland the way Noah has coped with his condition has been an ""inspiration"". He turns one on Saturday, but his family say they will be celebrating so much more than his first milestone birthday. The baby, from Robroyston in Glasgow, was born with a rare medical condition called Hemifacial Microsomia, which means the lower half of his face did not form properly. He also has Pierre Robin syndrome - a congenital condition of facial abnormalities which causes problems with feeding and breathing. Noah's parents say he has a ""brilliant personality"" and ""laughs all the time"" Surgeons were considering carrying out a tracheostomy, where a hole would be cut into his throat, but the maxillofacial team at the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow had other ideas. They wanted to try a different operation, one which would insert metal plates into his mouth to reform his jaw. The procedure is so rare that the ""scaffolding"" had to be sourced from the USA and Germany. Noah's parents Jade Gordon, 19, and Kieran Connell, 17, have been speaking about what their son has been through on theBBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme. Jade was launched into the whirlwind of parenthood unexpectedly, because she did not know she was pregnant until she went into labour. Kieran said: ""It wasn't a bad thing. It was just a shocker when he was born."" The birth of a child with special needs changed the young couple's lives completely; Kieran had to leave school and Jade had to leave college. Jade added: ""The first couple of days he was in an incubator, then after that the consultants said they'd have to do genetic testing. ""They thought it was a condition called Pierre Robin, where the jaw is tiny and pushed right back, and it was restricting his breathing."" ""He had a floppy airway, and the maxillofacial team decided they could operate at four weeks old, which is very young. You're meant to be six months old. ""The operation was five hours long. They broke his jaw in three places, put plates in, and pins behind his ear, and me and Kieran had to turn his face with a screwdriver for three weeks."" ""That worked well, but he still couldn't swallow safely."" Jade Gordon and Kieran Connell says they want to raise awareness about their son's condition Then in January, Noah caught the Australian Flu. That is when his medical team discovered he was not getting enough oxygen at night. Several more operations followed to try and keep his airways open, including one only last week to fix a metal plate which had moved. That is also when doctors discovered he is missing the C1 to C5 vertebrae of his spine. He cannot sit up unaided, but his parents say it is not affecting other parts of his development. Kieran said: ""He's really happy all the time. He's got a brilliant personality. He laughs all the time. He's not developing 'normally', but it's our normal."" Jade added: ""He loves the films Trolls and Moana and he loves Celtic. He's a big fan, and is glued to the telly when they're playing."" ""He's thriving. The future's still...we've been told to take one day at a time...don't plan too far ahead. ""But Noah's healthy to us, he's normal to us. That's our baby, so we'll just keep going on. He's an inspiration. He doesn't moan about anything."" The couple say people do stare at Noah when they're out and about, but say that is because he is different. ""We'd rather people came to us and asked us what's wrong with him. We're all about raising awareness. It's a very rare condition he's got,"" Kieran added. They also say they really appreciate it when people react positively to their son.

Biggest recall ever of NI patients,"A consultant said it was a ""daunting"" time for everyone This is the biggest recall ever of patients in Northern Ireland and it is also the most serious. Among the 2,500 under review are children, some of whom may have been struggling with a wrong diagnosis. One patient said she felt she was not being taken seriously by the Belfast Health Trust. Another woman said that she is frightened that she is actually suffering from a serious condition, such as Multiple Sclerosis. Neurologists treat people with conditions like Parkinson's Disease Neurology is the treatment of brain conditions including MS, Parkinson's Disease, Stroke and Motor Neurone Disease. While some of these conditions can be treated, nearly all are life changing. A consultant who once worked alongside Dr Michael Watt said all of his colleagues were shocked. He said it was a ""daunting"" time for everyone, but patient safety must come first. The Belfast Health Trust has been aware of a potential problem since December 2016. I understand that, within weeks of a GP raising concerns about his patient, some consultants also raised the alarm and urged the trust to carry out its own review. Within six months, Dr Watt was no longer working with patients. The Belfast Health Trust said he had not seen any patients since June 2017. However, it has taken a year to get to this stage. The results of an independent review by the Royal College of Physicians were delivered last week and a decision was made to recall Dr Watt's patients. The Belfast Trust said the college was positive about the work of its neurology department. However, a more extensive review will be carried out later in the year. Neurology is the treatment of brain conditions Questions still remain. Did the trust act quickly enough? Should a consultant be responsible for a case load of 2,500 patients? In time, the trust's chief executive will be expected to answer questions about the review of patients and, consequently, Dr Watt's future. The BBC also tried to get answers but, for weeks, requests for information were ignored. Reviews are necessary to establish facts. But in the meantime, according to patients, they can feel their plight is forgotten. For many, it has been an anxious time as patients were not told what was going on. It was also a frustrating time as many could not get appointments or were receiving conflicting messages over a diagnosis.

Iran hits back at Israel over nuclear claim,"This video can not be played Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled on Monday what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive Iran has called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a ""liar"" after he accused the country of deceiving the world about its nuclear intentions. Mr Netanyahu produced what he said were copies of Iranian files detailing a project to build nuclear weapons, which was reportedly mothballed 15 years ago. Iran said it had never sought to build a bomb when it signed an international deal to curb nuclear activity in 2015. US President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of the deal. American allies like the UK and France have called for the agreement to be maintained, arguing that  Iran has abided by it, steadily reducing its capacity to produce weapons-grade uranium. Hostility between Israel and Iran, already bitter enemies, has grown as Iran builds up its military in Syria, on Israel's doorstep. How important are Israel's revelations? Could the nuclear deal collapse? Why the bomb is back Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi described Mr Netanyahu as an ""infamous liar who has had nothing to offer except lies and deceits"". His accusations, he continued, were ""worn-out, useless and shameful"". Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the documents produced by Israel were a rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog. Israel says that Iran is not a reliable partner and the 2015 agreement was reached in bad faith. Speaking afterMr Netanyahu's presentation of the alleged secret Iranian files, Mark Regev, the Israeli ambassador to London, said the Iranian government had deliberately concealed its military nuclear programme. ""It appears we've caught them red-handed lying about what is ultimately a crucial element in the deal, one which is a prerequisite for future implementation of that very deal,"" he said. Not only did Mr Netanyahu give alleged details of Project Amad, the alleged Iranian nuclear weapons programme reportedly mothballed in 2003, but he said the project had continued at the Iranian defence ministry. He quoted the head of the alleged programme as saying ""special activities"" would continue ""under the title of scientific know-how developments"". Such work continued this year, Mr Netanyahu said, without giving evidence. Late 1980sIran allegedly begins secret nuclear weapons research(IAEA report, December 2015),external Flashback to 2015: John Kerry (left) negotiating for the US with Iran's Javad Zarif and the EU's Federica Mogherini 1999The Amad Project is launched, according to Israeli intelligence. In the years that follow, Iranian presidents consistently deny seeking to acquire nuclear weapons 2002Satellite photos reveal Iranian nuclear sites and Washington accuses Iran of ""across-the-board pursuit of weapons of mass destruction"" 2003The IAEA challenges Iran to prove it is not pursuing a nuclear weapons programme. Inspections follow and Amad is wound down, according to the IAEA's 2015 report 2006UN agrees first round of sanctions on Iran after it fails to demonstrate its burgeoning civilian nuclear programme is not weapons-related 2011The IAEA says Iran has been carrying out research that can only be used to develop a nuclear bomb trigger 2013Election in Iran of reformist president, Hassan Rouhani, gives boost to talks with world powers on nuclear programme 2015World powers reach deal with Iran on limiting Iranian nuclear activity in return for lifting of international economic sanctions 2018Israel produces what it says is documentary proof of Project Amad's existence 15 years earlier and accuses Iran of continuing ""special activities"" It pointed out that one of its own reports from 2015 had identified some Iranian activities in 2003 ""relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device"". There had been ""no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009"", according to that report. The White House initially responded to Mr Netanyahu's allegations by saying they were consistent with its understanding that Iran ""has"" a ""robust, clandestine nuclear weapons"" programme. However, it later corrected the statement by changing the tense of the verb to ""had"", blaming a ""clerical error"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the documents proved ""beyond any doubt"" that Iran had not told the truth. Donald Trump has asked for permanent restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment. He has warned the US will abandon the deal on 12 May - the next deadline for waiving sanctions - unless European signatories to the deal and Congress address his concerns. France said the Israeli findings could ""confirm the need for longer-term assurances on the Iranian programme"". The evidence appeared to confirm what European powers had known for more than a decade and a half, it added. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Mr Netanyahu's presentation on Iran's past nuclear weapons research underlined the ""importance of keeping the Iran nuclear deal's constraints on Tehran's nuclear ambitions"". ""The Iran nuclear deal is not based on trust about Iran's intentions; rather it is based on tough verification,"" he said. EU Foreign Policy ChiefFederica Mogherini said the documents had not put into question Iran's compliance with the deal,externalbut they should be analysed by the IAEA. The agreement signed between Iran, the US, China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain lifted crippling economic sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear programme. Fordo, here seen in 2009, formerly enriched uranium Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran is committed to slashing the number of its centrifuges, which are machines used to enrich uranium. It is also meant to cut its stockpile of enriched uranium drastically and not enrich remaining uranium to the level needed to produce nuclear weapons.

Sainsbury's boss sorry for money song gaffe,"This video can not be played Mike Coupe caught singing on camera The boss of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, has apologised after being caught on camera singing ""We're in the money"". He was filmed singing the words to the show tune as he was waiting to be interviewed for ITV News. It was one of a round of dozens of interviews to explain details of the planned tie up with Asda, the company's biggest deal to date. Mr Coupe has pledged it will bring no job losses or store closures, but some fear these will come at some point. Suppliers are also concerned they will sufferfrom the tie-up. Mr Coupe say customers will benefit by seeing prices fall by an average of 10%, something suppliers say are likely to come at the cost of their own profit margins. The song, We're in the Money, is one of the key tunes used in the musical 42nd Street, which Mr Coupe said he had seen last year. He busked some lines from it: ""We're in the money, the sky is sunny, let's lend it, spend it, send it rolling along,"" while sitting waiting to be interviewed. Suppliers fear Sainsbury's price squeeze Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts Sainsbury's vows Asda deal will cut prices Mr Coupe, a keen guitarist who has played in front of thousands of Sainsbury's employees on occasion, issued a statement after the incident became public. ""This was an unguarded moment trying to compose myself before a TV interview,"" he said. ""It was an unfortunate choice of song, from the musical 42nd Street which I saw last year and I apologise if I have offended anyone."" Mr Coupe could indeed be in the money if the positive effects of Monday's announcement are sustained. He is a shareholder in Sainsbury's, and shares in the supermarket jumped by nearly 15% on Monday after the Asda deal was announced. Ian Cass, managing director of the Forum of Private Business, reacted scornfully to Mr Coupe's choice of song. He said: ""If that's the song he's singing and highlights his position on this, I very much doubt small suppliers would choose the same song to sing, and one option would be Highway to Hell. ""It's almost like, what's in it for him? I'm sure his bonus and dividend will go up massively because of this merger. ""I don't think there's any degree of sensitivity to our concerns.

New problems with TSB standing orders,"TSB said problems with standing orders affecting some customers had been resolved. The bank, which has been grapping with problems following an IT switchover, said any scheduled payments had now been processed. Some customers complained on Tuesday that payments had failed to complete, with some raising concerns over standing orders. TSB bosses face questions from MPs on Wednesday about the IT problems. Problems began after TSB shut down services for two days from the evening of Friday, 20 April to move customer data from former owner Lloyds to a new IT system managed by its Spanish owner Sabadell. As soon as the new system was switched on, customers reported problems which have persisted for some banking online and in branches. On Wednesday, senior executives from TSB and Sabadell are appearing before the Commons' Treasury Committee. They will face questions about the cause of the IT crisis, the information - at times contradictory - given to customers, and the plans to compensate those affected. TSB chief executive Paul Pester will be giving evidence, alongside TSB chairman Richard Meddings, and Miquel Montes, the group chief operating officer at Sabadell. The bank urged customers to log in through the official website, rather than via old bookmarks or links. Those having difficulties using the mobile app have been told to reinstall it.

"Woman, 96, stands in council elections","Florence Kirkby was 18 when World War Two started A 96-year-old woman is standing in Thursday's council elections. Florence Kirkby, from Newcastle, who is standing in the city, is believed to be one of the country's oldest candidates. She was involved in politics from a young age because her father was an early member of the Labour Party and a close friend of suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst. She said she ""thought it was time there was somebody who could take a stand"" and would be ""looking to the future"". Having worked as a teacher and headmistress of several schools, Miss Kirkby was awarded an MBE for services to education in 2013. She taught evacuees in Blackpool during World War Two and said the war made her realise how important democracy was. Miss Kirkby advised first-time voters to ""make up their own minds and not be too guided by people they know"". Dolls heads used to lobby for pothole repairs Asperger's woman 'was dragged' out of BFI screening Quiz: How much do you know about May Day?

Jaw 'scaffolding' helps our baby breathe,"Noah Connell's had six operations including one so rare, it does not even have a name Noah Connell from Glasgow has a rare condition which could have stopped him from breathing. Doctors have carried out an operation on him that has never been carried out on a person so young in the UK. It involved inserting metal plates and pins into his jaw because he could not eat or breath properly. His parents have told BBC Scotland the way Noah has coped with his condition has been an ""inspiration"". He turns one on Saturday, but his family say they will be celebrating so much more than his first milestone birthday. The baby, from Robroyston in Glasgow, was born with a rare medical condition called Hemifacial Microsomia, which means the lower half of his face did not form properly. He also has Pierre Robin syndrome - a congenital condition of facial abnormalities which causes problems with feeding and breathing. Noah's parents say he has a ""brilliant personality"" and ""laughs all the time"" Surgeons were considering carrying out a tracheostomy, where a hole would be cut into his throat, but the maxillofacial team at the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow had other ideas. They wanted to try a different operation, one which would insert metal plates into his mouth to reform his jaw. The procedure is so rare that the ""scaffolding"" had to be sourced from the USA and Germany. Noah's parents Jade Gordon, 19, and Kieran Connell, 17, have been speaking about what their son has been through on theBBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme. Jade was launched into the whirlwind of parenthood unexpectedly, because she did not know she was pregnant until she went into labour. Kieran said: ""It wasn't a bad thing. It was just a shocker when he was born."" The birth of a child with special needs changed the young couple's lives completely; Kieran had to leave school and Jade had to leave college. Jade added: ""The first couple of days he was in an incubator, then after that the consultants said they'd have to do genetic testing. ""They thought it was a condition called Pierre Robin, where the jaw is tiny and pushed right back, and it was restricting his breathing."" ""He had a floppy airway, and the maxillofacial team decided they could operate at four weeks old, which is very young. You're meant to be six months old. ""The operation was five hours long. They broke his jaw in three places, put plates in, and pins behind his ear, and me and Kieran had to turn his face with a screwdriver for three weeks."" ""That worked well, but he still couldn't swallow safely."" Jade Gordon and Kieran Connell says they want to raise awareness about their son's condition Then in January, Noah caught the Australian Flu. That is when his medical team discovered he was not getting enough oxygen at night. Several more operations followed to try and keep his airways open, including one only last week to fix a metal plate which had moved. That is also when doctors discovered he is missing the C1 to C5 vertebrae of his spine. He cannot sit up unaided, but his parents say it is not affecting other parts of his development. Kieran said: ""He's really happy all the time. He's got a brilliant personality. He laughs all the time. He's not developing 'normally', but it's our normal."" Jade added: ""He loves the films Trolls and Moana and he loves Celtic. He's a big fan, and is glued to the telly when they're playing."" ""He's thriving. The future's still...we've been told to take one day at a time...don't plan too far ahead. ""But Noah's healthy to us, he's normal to us. That's our baby, so we'll just keep going on. He's an inspiration. He doesn't moan about anything."" The couple say people do stare at Noah when they're out and about, but say that is because he is different. ""We'd rather people came to us and asked us what's wrong with him. We're all about raising awareness. It's a very rare condition he's got,"" Kieran added. They also say they really appreciate it when people react positively to their son.

YouTube stars paid to sell essay cheatingA BBC investigation has found that YouTube stars are being paid to sell academic cheating.14m15 minutes agoFamily & Education,"This video can not be played The YouTubers selling cheating: 'Get an A on your paper - and you don't even need to do it' YouTube stars are being paid to sell academic cheating, a BBC investigation has found. More than 250 channels are promoting EduBirdie, based in Ukraine, which allows students to buy essays, rather than doing the work themselves. YouTube said it would help creators understand they cannot promote dishonest behaviour. Sam Gyimah, Universities Minister for England, says YouTube has a moral responsibility to act. He said he was shocked by the nature and scale of the videos uncovered by the BBC: ""It's clearly wrong because it is enabling and normalising cheating potentially on an industrial scale."" The BBC Trending investigation uncovered more than 1,400 videos with a total of more than 700 million views containing EduBirdie adverts selling cheating to students and school pupils. EduBirdie is based in Ukraine, but aims its services at pupils and students across the globe. Essay writing services are not illegal, but if students submit work they have paid for someone else to do the penalties can be severe. The company is not just aiming to capture the attention of university students with its advertising. Popular YouTubers, some as young as 12, are being paid to personally endorse the service. In some of the videos YouTubers say if you cannot be bothered to do the work, EduBirdie has a ""super smart nerd"" who will do it for you. The adverts appear in videos on YouTube channels covering a range of subjects, including pranks, dating, gaming, music and fashion. They include several by stars such as Adam Saleh whose channel has four million subscribers, and British gamer JMX who has two and a half million subscribers. Following the BBC's investigation, both have now removed videos with EduBirdie adverts from YouTube. The BBC also approached the mother of one 12-year-old, who had promoted the company to his 200,000 followers. She also took her advert down. Adam Saleh is one popular YouTuber who has advertised EduBirdie in his videos Channels with tens of thousands of subscribers can be offered hundreds of dollars for each advert. They are not clearly labelled video ads, which are common on YouTube channels. Instead the YouTuber usually breaks off from what they are doing to personally endorse EduBirdie, promising that the company will deliver an A+ essay for money. Some YouTubers suggest that using the service will free up time to play video games or take drugs. So prevalent is the promotion of EduBirdie that very young children are posting videos on YouTube of themselves mimicking the ads. Universities minister, Sam Gyimah, said he was shocked by the scale of the videos. Sam Gyimah said that EduBirdie's marketing was shocking and pernicious as it presented cheating as ""a lifestyle choice"". He said the YouTubers involved should be ""called out"" for abusing their power as social influencers. ""I think YouTube has a huge responsibility here,"" he said. ""They do incredibly well from the advertising revenue that they get from the influencers and everyone else. But this is something that is corrosive to education and I think YouTube has got to step up to the plate and exercise some responsibility here."" About 30 of the channels promoting EduBirdie are from Britain and Ireland. They include a student vlogger at a top UK university. Another is a popular 15-year-old YouTuber, whose mother was unaware he was promoting the company until she was approached by the BBC. Shakira Martin, the President of the National Union of Students, said: ""I think it's totally disgusting the fact that these type of organisations are exploiting vulnerable young people through getting them to promote something that isn't good, isn't ethical."" She added that students who were working to support themselves while studying might be most tempted to use EduBirdie. Google's own research found YouTubers were more influential than celebrities when it came to promoting products. Toni Hopponen, from the tech company Flockler, advises businesses and some universities on how to tap into the power of social influencers. He said this was creating new challenges as it is outside the regulations that apply to traditional advertising. ""There's always been unethical advertising out there - but now the channels like YouTube provide a way for all of us to be publishers and the scale is huge. "" One British YouTuber, Alpay B urges viewers in one of his videos: ""Don't waste your time doing your essays, let these people do it for you."" In a statement, he told the BBC: ""Whether a student wants to cheat or not it's totally their choice. You can't really blame EduBirdie or creators who promote them because everyone's got their own hustle."" The BBC ordered two essays through EduBirdie, opting for them to be written from scratch. One was an English Literature GCSE coursework essay, the other a first-year degree course assignment. Both were delivered with only the students' names left blank to be filled in. The GCSE essay was given a C or 5/6 and the university assignment 60% - not quite the guaranteed A+ grade promised by EduBirdie. On its website EduBirdie says the essays provided by its writers are  ""100% plagiarism free"". In practice, this means the essays are written to order, rather than copied and pasted from elsewhere on the internet. So if a student submits an EduBirdie essay as their own work, it might not be detected by anti-cheating software. Any university student found to have submitted work done by someone else would face disciplinary action. ""If you've worked hard to get to university, you potentially throw it all away by cheating and getting found out. It is wrong, full stop,"" Mr Gyimah said. EduBirdie is run by a company called Boosta, which operates a number of essay-writing websites. In a statement it said: ""We cannot be held responsible for what social influencers say on their channels. ""We give influencers total freedom on how they prefer to present the EduBirdie platform to their audience in a way they feel would be most relevant to their viewers. ""We do admit that many tend to copy and paste each others' shout-outs with a focus on 'get someone to do your homework for you', but this is their creative choice."" It added that there was a disclaimer on the EduBirdie site which suggested that the work it provided should only be used as a sample or a reference. A YouTube spokesman told the BBC: ""YouTube creators may include paid endorsements as part of their content only if the product or service they are endorsing complies with our advertising policies. We do not allow ads for essay writing and so paid promotions of these services will be removed when we discover them."" They added: ""We will be working with creators going forward so they better understand that in video promotions must not promote dishonest activity."" The YouTubers making studying cool.

YouTube stars paid to sell essay cheatingA BBC investigation has found that YouTube stars are being paid to sell academic cheating.9m10 minutes agoFamily & Education,"This video can not be played The YouTubers selling cheating: 'Get an A on your paper - and you don't even need to do it' YouTube stars are being paid to sell academic cheating, a BBC investigation has found. More than 250 channels are promoting EduBirdie, based in Ukraine, which allows students to buy essays, rather than doing the work themselves. YouTube said it would help creators understand they cannot promote dishonest behaviour. Sam Gyimah, Universities Minister for England, says YouTube has a moral responsibility to act. He said he was shocked by the nature and scale of the videos uncovered by the BBC: ""It's clearly wrong because it is enabling and normalising cheating potentially on an industrial scale."" The BBC Trending investigation uncovered more than 1,400 videos with a total of more than 700 million views containing EduBirdie adverts selling cheating to students and school pupils. EduBirdie is based in Ukraine, but aims its services at pupils and students across the globe. Essay writing services are not illegal, but if students submit work they have paid for someone else to do the penalties can be severe. The company is not just aiming to capture the attention of university students with its advertising. Popular YouTubers, some as young as 12, are being paid to personally endorse the service. In some of the videos YouTubers say if you cannot be bothered to do the work, EduBirdie has a ""super smart nerd"" who will do it for you. The adverts appear in videos on YouTube channels covering a range of subjects, including pranks, dating, gaming, music and fashion. They include several by stars such as Adam Saleh whose channel has four million subscribers, and British gamer JMX who has two and a half million subscribers. Following the BBC's investigation, both have now removed videos with EduBirdie adverts from YouTube. The BBC also approached the mother of one 12-year-old, who had promoted the company to his 200,000 followers. She also took her advert down. Adam Saleh is one popular YouTuber who has advertised EduBirdie in his videos Channels with tens of thousands of subscribers can be offered hundreds of dollars for each advert. They are not clearly labelled video ads, which are common on YouTube channels. Instead the YouTuber usually breaks off from what they are doing to personally endorse EduBirdie, promising that the company will deliver an A+ essay for money. Some YouTubers suggest that using the service will free up time to play video games or take drugs. So prevalent is the promotion of EduBirdie that very young children are posting videos on YouTube of themselves mimicking the ads. Universities minister, Sam Gyimah, said he was shocked by the scale of the videos. Sam Gyimah said that EduBirdie's marketing was shocking and pernicious as it presented cheating as ""a lifestyle choice"". He said the YouTubers involved should be ""called out"" for abusing their power as social influencers. ""I think YouTube has a huge responsibility here,"" he said. ""They do incredibly well from the advertising revenue that they get from the influencers and everyone else. But this is something that is corrosive to education and I think YouTube has got to step up to the plate and exercise some responsibility here."" About 30 of the channels promoting EduBirdie are from Britain and Ireland. They include a student vlogger at a top UK university. Another is a popular 15-year-old YouTuber, whose mother was unaware he was promoting the company until she was approached by the BBC. Shakira Martin, the President of the National Union of Students, said: ""I think it's totally disgusting the fact that these type of organisations are exploiting vulnerable young people through getting them to promote something that isn't good, isn't ethical."" She added that students who were working to support themselves while studying might be most tempted to use EduBirdie. Google's own research found YouTubers were more influential than celebrities when it came to promoting products. Toni Hopponen, from the tech company Flockler, advises businesses and some universities on how to tap into the power of social influencers. He said this was creating new challenges as it is outside the regulations that apply to traditional advertising. ""There's always been unethical advertising out there - but now the channels like YouTube provide a way for all of us to be publishers and the scale is huge. "" One British YouTuber, Alpay B urges viewers in one of his videos: ""Don't waste your time doing your essays, let these people do it for you."" In a statement, he told the BBC: ""Whether a student wants to cheat or not it's totally their choice. You can't really blame EduBirdie or creators who promote them because everyone's got their own hustle."" The BBC ordered two essays through EduBirdie, opting for them to be written from scratch. One was an English Literature GCSE coursework essay, the other a first-year degree course assignment. Both were delivered with only the students' names left blank to be filled in. The GCSE essay was given a C or 5/6 and the university assignment 60% - not quite the guaranteed A+ grade promised by EduBirdie. On its website EduBirdie says the essays provided by its writers are  ""100% plagiarism free"". In practice, this means the essays are written to order, rather than copied and pasted from elsewhere on the internet. So if a student submits an EduBirdie essay as their own work, it might not be detected by anti-cheating software. Any university student found to have submitted work done by someone else would face disciplinary action. ""If you've worked hard to get to university, you potentially throw it all away by cheating and getting found out. It is wrong, full stop,"" Mr Gyimah said. EduBirdie is run by a company called Boosta, which operates a number of essay-writing websites. In a statement it said: ""We cannot be held responsible for what social influencers say on their channels. ""We give influencers total freedom on how they prefer to present the EduBirdie platform to their audience in a way they feel would be most relevant to their viewers. ""We do admit that many tend to copy and paste each others' shout-outs with a focus on 'get someone to do your homework for you', but this is their creative choice."" It added that there was a disclaimer on the EduBirdie site which suggested that the work it provided should only be used as a sample or a reference. A YouTube spokesman told the BBC: ""YouTube creators may include paid endorsements as part of their content only if the product or service they are endorsing complies with our advertising policies. We do not allow ads for essay writing and so paid promotions of these services will be removed when we discover them."" They added: ""We will be working with creators going forward so they better understand that in video promotions must not promote dishonest activity."" The YouTubers making studying cool.

PM plans 'robust' response to Brexit vote,"Theresa May says the government will be ""robust"" in its response to a House of Lords defeat which potentially gives Parliament a decisive say on Brexit. No 10 said the cabinet had ""strong disappointment"" with the vote, adding: ""We wish for the bill to go through in the same way it left the Commons."" Some ministers accuse peers of trying to ""thwart the will of the people"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Parliament must be sovereign on this matter and make the final decision."" He said the vote marked a ""hugely significant moment"" in the fight to ensure Parliament has a ""proper role"" in the Brexit negotiations and a no-deal situation was avoided. On Wednesday the key Brexit sub-committee of senior ministers will meet, with the issue of the UK and EU's future customs relationship expected to be on the agenda. Speaking to a House of Lords committee on Tuesday, Brexit Secretary David Davis said the EU had ""pushed back"" against the UK's two proposals aimed at avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. He said Brussels was concerned by the prospect of ""porosity"" on the EU's external border and by the risk of creating a precedent which might be copied elsewhere. Government defeated on Brexit deal vote Brexit: All you need to know A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill UK will leave customs union, insists No 10 The amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill - which would give MPs the power to stop the UK from leaving the EU without a deal, or make Theresa May return to the negotiating table - was approved by 335 votes to 244 on Monday night in the House of Lords. After the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the PM's official spokesman said the Lords amendment risked tying the government's hands in negotiations with the EU. The government will try to persuade MPs to overturn the change when the bill returns to the Commons later this month. It was one of three government defeats on the Brexit bill in one day - bringing the total number of government defeats on the EU bill to nine. It is not yet known whether any of the amendments from the Lords will be accepted by the government. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a leading voice in the 2016 campaign to get Britain out of the EU, told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""It is not acceptable for an unelected house to try to block the democratic will of the British people."" He said allowing Parliament to send the prime minister back to Brussels if MPs and peers did not like the deal the government had secured with the EU opened up the possibility of ""delaying exit from the EU indefinitely"". And the option of ""leaving the EU without an agreement"" had to be kept on the table. He said there was a ""big debate"" to be had about whether an ""unelected House"" could ""thwart the view of the British electorate"". And he categorically ruled out the UK being in some form of customs union with the EU after Brexit, amid speculation the government could be lining up a ""customs partnership"" or an EU association deal. ""No, I don't think we can stay in the customs union for a number of reasons, the main reason being that we would be in a worse position than we are today,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""If we were in a customs union with the European Union we would have to accept what the EU negotiated in terms of market access to the UK without the UK having a voice."" He added: ""I don't think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable."" Please upgrade your browser The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, with plans for a transition phase until the new permanent relationship kicks in after 31 December 2020. Both sides hope to negotiate the UK's withdrawal agreement by this October in order to give the UK and European Parliaments enough time to debate and vote on it before the moment of departure. The amendment proposed by Conservative Viscount Hailsham would allow Parliament to determine the government's course of action if MPs rejected the deal or if the UK and EU were not able to reach an agreement of any kind. It would also give Parliament control of the process if the legislation enshrining the withdrawal treaty promised by ministers was not approved by 29 March 2019. The peer, who as Douglas Hogg was an MP for many years, told the House of Lords the principle of parliamentary sovereignty was ""fundamental to our liberties and must not be betrayed"" when it came to Brexit. ""Whatever our party affiliation, our duty as parliamentarians is to our country and our conscience,"" he said. But former Conservative leader Lord Howard said the idea of effectively giving Parliament a veto over Brexit ""reveals the appalling lengths to which the die-hard Remainers are prepared to go to achieve their aims"". He told the BBC's Daily Politics that peers were ""playing with fire"".

"Hospital nurses scoop Â£1m in lotteryThe 15 members of the syndicate at a hospital in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, will pocket about Â£66,666 each.23m24 minutes agoGlasgow & West Scotland","The nurses all work at Cleland Hospital in Lanarkshire A syndicate of 15 hospital nurses from Lanarkshire are celebrating after scooping Â£1m in the National Lottery. The group, from Cleland Hospital in Motherwell, each pocketed more than Â£66,666 after matching a Euromillions UK Millionaire Maker code. They have been playing together for three years - with their previous biggest win being Â£12. Between them, they plan to splash the cash on trips to Canada, Sri Lanka, cruises, new cars and a motorbike. Thirteen members of the syndicate opted to share news of their win. Their previous biggest win was Â£12 June Fraser, 58, who was in charge of checking tickets each week, said she had used the National Lottery app to check them on Saturday morning. ""I scanned the first one and it wasn't a winner - I actually thought that was the ticket for Friday night's draw and very nearly didn't scan the second one as I thought it was for a future draw,"" she said. ""When I did and it told me that we'd won Â£1m I thought the app must be broken - I couldn't believe it. ""My first phone call was to my ward where I managed to get hold of two of the other members who were working. ""I phoned a few other members but I was just too hyper to call everyone at that point. I still went into work later that afternoon though."" When Ms Fraser went to work she pinned the winning ticket inside her nurse's uniform. Carol Hamlyn, 59, said the win meant she could have a dream retirement. ""I am due to retire in November and this win will be life-changing for me,"" she said. ""I was going to have to keep doing a few shifts but now I have financial security and I can also look after my four children and my three grandchildren."" The first thing the nurses planned to spend their money on was a bumper batch of cakes and goodies to treat the staff, patients and families at Cleland Hospital.

Matthew Wright to leave The Wright Stuff,"Wright has been at the helm of the show for 18 years TV presenter Matthew Wright is leaving his role as the host of Channel 5's The Wright Stuff. Wright has presented the topical current affairs chat show since it began in 2000. He said in statement: ""After almost 18 glorious years on Channel 5 and with the show flying high in the ratings, I feel it's time to depart."" Channel 5 said the show will continue with a new host but we don't know yet who or what the show will be called. Ben Frow, director of programmes at Channel 5, said Wright would be ""sorely missed"". He added: ""We would like to thank Matthew for his passion, hard work and enthusiasm over the last 18 years and for making the show what it is today.""

Guests over the years have included Tony Blair, George Galloway, Ben Elton and Brian May. His website says: ""Aside from Mrs Wright, the big love of Matthew's life has been presenting The Wright Stuff."" Wright started his career in newspapers, first at the Sun and later at The Daily Mirror, where he had a daily column for five years, before making his move into TV. He is also known for presenting BBC weekly factual show Inside Out London and was a contestant on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! in 2013. Matthew Wright always said to me that he would stop presenting The Wright Stuff when it stopped being fun. (I was the on-screen audience researcher from 2005-7.) Recently, it stopped being fun. Until last year, the show was made by Princess Productions, an independent production company. The company was set up in 1996, and bought by the production giant Endemol Shine in 2007. Last May, Endemol Shine shut Princess Productions. Under Ben Frow, Director of Programmes, Channel 5 invited various bids for the right to produce the show. In the end, ITN won the right to broadcast the show. But the move was an uncomfortable one. Many of the staff who had long worked on the show were not brought over, and there were technical issues in the studio. Over the past several months, the show has maintained its audience share, but away from the cameras there has been tension aplenty. Read Amol's full blog.

Scotland calls time on cheap boozeThe new law sets a minimum price at which alcohol can be sold in a bid to tackle problem drinking.6h6 hours agoScotlandComments,"Vodka is one of the drinks affected by the minimum pricing The price of cheap, high-strength alcohol has gone up in Scotland as long-awaited legislation on minimum pricing comes into force. The law, which sets a floor price for drinks depending on how many units of alcohol they contain, was passed in 2012 but has faced legal challenges. The Scottish government said the move would cut consumption and save lives. High-strength white cider and cheap own-brand vodka and whisky will see the biggest rise in prices. Ministers said the idea was to target booze that attracted problem drinkers. They were concerned that a two-litre bottle of strong cider (7.5 abv), which contained more than the weekly recommended limit for alcohol (14 units), could be bought for as little as Â£2.50. It will now cost at least Â£7.50. Own brand vodka, gin and whisky will also rise in price by as much as Â£3 a bottle, as will some cheap wines and multi-pack beers. Why has alcohol just got more expensive? How will minimum pricing affect me? Minimum alcohol pricing in Scotland to start in May Scotland to set 50p minimum unit price for alcohol Last week, a BBC survey of Scotland's supermarkets found that well-known brand names such as Smirnoff vodka, Famous Grouse whisky and Tennent's lager would also be affected by the minimum price, especially when they are on special offer. Research by alcohol-concern charities showed that almost three-quarters of Scotland's alcohol is bought from supermarkets and shops. This video can not be played David Richardson from Glasgow says he had a good job and a good life before drink took hold This video can not be played These three women are a little taken aback when they find out the new price of a bottle of cider Pubs, clubs and restaurants are unlikely to be affected by the law as they would have to be selling a pint of lager for about Â£1.14 or a large glass of wine for Â£1.50. The new law is not a tax and any extra revenue from higher prices will go to the supermarkets. A three-litre bottle of Frosty Jack cider will go up from Â£4.70 to Â£11.25 You can work out how many units there are in any drink by multiplying the total volume of a drink (in ml) by its ABV (Alcohol by volume - measured as a percentage) and dividing the result by 1,000. A bottle of 70cl (700ml) whisky at 40 abv is 28 units. At 50p per unit of alcohol that means a minimum price of Â£14. Vodka, which is not quite as strong (37.5 abv) would be 26.25 units and Â£13.13. A 440 ml can of lager (4% abv) would be a minimum of 88p. Ministers have called the new law a significant step in tackling Scotland's ""unhealthy relationship"" with alcohol. The Scottish government claims minimum pricing will save 58 lives in its first year and reduce hospital admissions by 1,300. Speaking on the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland radio programme, Health Secretary Shona Robison said the policy ""targets hazardous and harmful drinkers"". She added: ""This policy is geared towards making sure that by increasing the price - particularly of those products that do the most harm - that we will reduce consumption."" Asked about how it would be enforced, Ms Robison insisted policing of the policy would be robust. ""We believe that the licensing standards officers, and the work they do anyway around licensed premises, will be able to make sure that minimum unit pricing is adhered to,"" she said. ""I don't think anyone is going to want to put their licence at risk because obviously breaching licensing conditions can be a criminal offence and could lead to serious consequences with substantial fines and potentially imprisonment of up to six months."" The medical profession has welcomed the move which finally comes into force after five years of court battles brought by the Scotch Whisky Association. Dr Christine Goodall, of Medics Against Violence, told BBC Scotland more than 80% of assault victims in hospital emergency departments had been drinking, as had the people who had assaulted them. She said: ""Young people will start drinking at an early age and inevitably they don't have a lot of money to do that. ""So they are probably drinking the cheap alcohol. It will make that much more expensive. ""The hope is that will be a real disincentive to them."" Dr Goodall agrees the policy will not cure all of Scotland's alcohol-related ills. But she said it was an important plank in a wider attempt to cut the harm it causes, following on from ending buy-one-get-one-free multi-buys and tighter drink-drive laws. She said: ""We are not aiming to get the whole population to stop drinking but it will have an impact on the people who are currently experiencing the most harm."" Once the new law comes in, research will begin to gauge its effectiveness. It was passed with a ""sunset clause"" meaning that minimum unit pricing will end in six years if MSPs at Holyrood decide it has not worked.

Ministers back down on tax haven registersThe amendment would force overseas territories to publish company ownership details.7m7 minutes agoUK Politics,"The amendment would require overseas territories like the Cayman Islands to publish company ownership registers The government has agreed to calls for new measures aimed at increasing transparency in offshore tax havens. Facing a possible Commons defeat, ministers said they would not oppose an amendment to force British overseas territories to publish details of the true owners of companies based there. Campaigners say public registers make it easier to uncover corruption, money laundering and tax dodging. The move was backed by both Labour and Tory MPs. The government has also agreed to a new laws to sanction people suspected of gross human rights abuses. What are Britain's overseas territories and crown dependencies? With no Conservative majority in the House of Commons, the government is vulnerable to any rebellion, and 19 Tory MPs had backed the amendment on company ownership registers. As MPs debated the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill in the Commons, Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan said the government had not wanted to damage the overseas territories' autonomy by legislating directly. But he added: ""We've listened to the strength of feeling in the House on this issue and accept that it is without a doubt the majority view of this House that the overseas territories should have public registers."" He added that the government would ""respect the will of the House"" and not vote against the amendment put forward by Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell and Labour's Dame Margaret Hodge. This video can not be played Dame Margaret Hodge said the government had failed to take on simple measures The amendment would require the UK government to take steps to provide that British Overseas Territories establish publicly accessible registers of the beneficial ownership of companies. It does not include Britain's crown dependencies, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Oxfam welcomed the government's concession, which it said would help developing countries ""recoup billions of lost revenue"", and Transparency International said it was ""a hugely significant moment"". Dame Margaret said the move was ""a remarkable, important and really world-changing measure in relation to the fight against corruption"". Mr Mitchell added: ""The overseas territories share our freedom. They travel under our flag, and they should also share our values."" But speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Lorna Smith, interim executive director of British Virgin Island Finance, accused supporters of the legislation of ""colonialism"". Ms Smith said the British Virgin Islands had ""done nothing wrong"" and were deemed ""largely compliant"" on transparency by international bodies, saying her concern was one of ""constitutional infringement"". ""If this bill goes through, it's like Scotland feeling that Westminster is legislating for Scotland,"" she said. ""It's simply not right."" As well as the beneficial ownership register, Sir Alan confirmed the bill would impose sanctions for human rights abuses. It is known as the ""Magnitsky"" amendment after a Russian lawyer who died in prison after alleging fraud by state officials. Sir Alan said that anyone sanctioned under the bill would have their names published on a publicly-availably list. Welcoming the amendment, Lib Dem Tom Brake said: ""These people and their money are not welcome in the UK and must not be given sanctuary in our cities.""

Brazil tower block collapses after infernoAt least one person has died and firefighters fear more people may have been trapped inside.1han hour agoLatin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Footage shows SÃ£o Paulo tower block collapse A 26-storey building has collapsed after being engulfed in flames in Brazil's largest city, SÃ£o Paulo, killing at least one person. More than 150 firefighters are battling the blaze which is thought to have been caused by a gas explosion. The high-rise had been occupied by squatters. Fire authorities said they feared more people were trapped inside. Witnesses said flames spread quickly from one of the lower floors and set an adjacent building on fire. Some 50 families had moved into the building in the Largo do Paissandu area of the city after the federal police force, which had been using it, vacated it some years ago. The SÃ£o Paulo newspaper EstadÃ£o reported that makeshift living compartments in the building had been constructed from wood, aiding the spread of the blaze through the floors. Firefighters evacuated the high-rise but as they were taking out the last of the residents the building collapsed, killing one man. One firefighter was injured, EstadÃ£o reported. ""It was a matter of seconds but we couldn't save him,"" firefighter Max Mena said. ""It felt like a tsunami when the building came down,"" a 58-year-old woman who lived on the fourth floor told Folha newspaper. ""I could not take anything with me."" The building collapsed after 90 minutes Deise Silva, 31, told Folha that she was asleep inside one of the rooms with her five children when she was woken by screaming. ""When people told me there was a fire, I woke up the children and ran,"" she said. A nearby hotel has been evacuated. The hotel receptionist told Folha that he was alerted to the blaze by shouting. ""At first I thought it was a fight but then I heard people shouting 'get out, get out!'"" he said. The fire started at 01:20 local time (04:20 GMT) and the high-rise collapsed just 90 minutes later. SÃ£o Paulo Governor MÃ¡rcio FranÃ§a said the building was an accident waiting to happen but that its residents had resisted leaving. ""That type of home is uninhabitable, staying there is looking for trouble,"" he said speaking at the site of the blaze. Capt Marcos Palumbo of the SÃ£o Paulo fire brigade said that modifications made by the residents had allowed the fire to spread more quickly. ""The lifts had been taken out and those empty air shafts formed a chimney. There was also a lot of combustible material, such as wood and paper which helped fuel the fire,"" he said. Officials say the second building is currently not at risk of collapse. Firefighters have cordoned off a large area around the blaze.

'Critical window' for learning a language,"There is a critical cut-off age for learning a language fluently, according to research. If you want to have native-like knowledge of English grammar, for example, you should ideally start before age 10, say the researchers. People remain highly skilled learners until 17 or 18, when ability tails off. The findings, in the journalCognition,external, come from an online grammar test taken by nearly 670,000 people of different ages and nationalities. Thegrammar quiz,externalwas posted on Facebook to get enough people to take part. Questions tested if participants could determine whether a sentence written in English, such as: ""Yesterday John wanted to won the race,"" was grammatically correct. Users were asked their age and how long they had been learning English, and in what setting - had they moved to an English-speaking country, for example? About 246,000 of the people who took the test had grown up speaking only English, while the rest were bi- or multilingual. The most common native languages (excluding English) were Finnish, Turkish, German, Russian and Hungarian. Most of the people who completed the quiz were in their 20s and 30s. The youngest age was about 10 and the oldest late 70s. When the researchersanalysed the data,externalusing a computer model, the best explanation for the findings was that grammar-learning was strongest in childhood, persists into teenage years and then drops at adulthood. This video can not be played How did this man learn 11 languages? Learning a language is often said to be easy for children and to get more difficult as we age. But late learners can still become proficient, if not seamlessly fluent, say the researchers. It is unclear what causes the drop in the optimal learning rate seen at about age 18. The researchers suggest it could be because the brain becomes less changeable or adaptable in adulthood. Study co-author Josh Tenenbaum, a professor of brain and cognitive sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, said: ""It's possible that there's a biological change. It's also possible that it's something social or cultural. ""There's roughly a period of being a minor that goes up to about age 17 or 18 in many societies. After that, you leave your home, maybe you work full time, or you become a specialised university student. All of those might impact your learning rate for any language."" That doesn't mean learning another language in adulthood is futile. This video can not be played Which languages Americans study and why Learning another tongue is said to be good for your brain and might evendelay the onset of dementia, according to some studies. Prof Marilyn Vihman, from the University of York's department of language and linguistic science, said: ""The suggestion that you can't reach native-like ability if you don't start early is questionable. ""Such cases are rare, but they do occur and are documented. ""There are cases of people in their 20s who learn a new language and can pass as spies. ""There are two, three or four documented cases like that. ""I don't think there is a critical age as such, just a plateau that sets in after the teen years for most but not all speakers."" Dr Danijela Trenkic, also from the University of York, pointed out that the study dealt with only one aspect of language - grammar. ""You can be an excellent communicator, even if you don't sound like a native speaker or don't get all your sentences grammatically correct.""

"New problems with TSB standing ordersThe bank - reeling from an IT fiasco - faces a tough two days, as MPs prepare to question executives.","TSB said problems with standing orders affecting some customers had been resolved. The bank, which has been grapping with problems following an IT switchover, said any scheduled payments had now been processed. Some customers complained on Tuesday that payments had failed to complete, with some raising concerns over standing orders. TSB bosses face questions from MPs on Wednesday about the IT problems. Problems began after TSB shut down services for two days from the evening of Friday, 20 April to move customer data from former owner Lloyds to a new IT system managed by its Spanish owner Sabadell. As soon as the new system was switched on, customers reported problems which have persisted for some banking online and in branches. On Wednesday, senior executives from TSB and Sabadell are appearing before the Commons' Treasury Committee. They will face questions about the cause of the IT crisis, the information - at times contradictory - given to customers, and the plans to compensate those affected. TSB chief executive Paul Pester will be giving evidence, alongside TSB chairman Richard Meddings, and Miquel Montes, the group chief operating officer at Sabadell. The bank urged customers to log in through the official website, rather than via old bookmarks or links. Those having difficulties using the mobile app have been told to reinstall it.

"Children âmurdered in feud arson attack'Four siblings were trapped upstairs in their bedroom as flames engulfed the house, a court hears.1han hour agoManchester","Lia, Demi, Brandon and Lacie died in the fire and their mother Michelle Pearson was left in a coma Four sleeping children were murdered after being trapped in their bedrooms when their house was torched with petrol bombs, a court has been told. Zak Bolland, 23, launched the attack after being involved in a feud with the victims' 16-year-old brother Kyle Pearson, Manchester Crown Court heard. The four siblings, aged between three and 15, were killed in the blaze in Walkden, Salford on 11 December 2017. Mr Bolland, Courtney Brierley and David Worrall all deny four counts of murder. Mr Bolland, along with Mr Worrall, 26, removed a fence panel from the garden of the Pearsons' home, smashed a kitchen window and threw in two lit petrol bombs, the jury was told. One landed near the stairs, blocking the only exit to the ground floor and trapping the victims upstairs as flames engulfed the three-bedroom mid-terrace house. Demi Pearson, 15, her brother, Brandon, aged eight and sister, Lacie, aged seven, sleeping in a front bedroom, all died in the blaze, which started at about 05:00 GMT. ""Their apparently lifeless bodies were recovered by the firefighters who attended and battled their way through the heat, smoke and flames,"" Paul Reid QC, prosecuting, told the court. Demi, Brandon and Lacie all died in the blaze while Lia died in hospital two days later Their mother, Michelle Pearson, 35, was rescued along with her youngest daughter, Lia, aged three, who died in hospital two days later. Kyle Pearson, who had been feuding with Mr Bolland, escaped with a friend, Bobby Harris, who was also staying at the house. He saw the light from his sister Demi's mobile phone at the window before she coughed in the thick smoke then appeared to fall away from the window, the court heard. Prosecution witness Abigail Toone, who drove Mr Bolland and Mr Worrall to the scene of the arson attack, described how they had been drinking and getting ""loud and aggressive"" in the hours before the incident. At his home, Mr Bolland said: ""Shall we do it?"" and Mr Worrall replied, ""Yeah, I'll do it"", the jury heard. At about 04:30, the pair armed with an axe and machete, got a frightened Ms Toone to drive them to a petrol station where Mr Worrall put petrol from a pump into a green petrol can, the jury heard. Ms Toone drove them back to Mr Bolland's house before Ms Brierley gave her directions to an alley near the Pearsons' home. After the attack Mr Bolland and Mr Worrall ran back to Ms Toone's car and they drove away, the court heard. The firebombing was the culmination of a series of tit-for-tat attacks between Mr Bolland and Kyle Pearson, Mr Reid told the jury. Mr Bolland claimed Kyle owed him Â£500 for an arson attack on his car and sent harassing text messages. Both sides broke windows in each other's homes and Mr Bolland threatened to fire bomb Kyle's house, the court heard. The threat led Mrs Pearson to call police on 26 November and as a result the fire service fitted a letter box cover, Mr Reid said. Mrs Pearson's bin was later set on fire and the word ""grass"" was spray-painted on her house. Jurors were told Mr Bolland and Mr Worrall visited the house four hours before the fatal fire and attacked the door before Mr Bolland shouted: ""Watch, all your family's getting it, they're all gonna die."" Kyle Pearson was ""really worried"" they would return so he got a door and wedged it behind the front door, Mr Reid said. Mr Bolland has admitted reckless arson, a charge his girlfriend Ms Brierley, 20, and Mr Worrall both deny. All three also deny three counts of attempted murder relating to Michelle Pearson, Kyle Pearson and Bobby Harris.

Scotland calls time on cheap booze,"Vodka is one of the drinks affected by the minimum pricing The price of cheap, high-strength alcohol has gone up in Scotland as long-awaited legislation on minimum pricing comes into force. The law, which sets a floor price for drinks depending on how many units of alcohol they contain, was passed in 2012 but has faced legal challenges. The Scottish government said the move would cut consumption and save lives. High-strength white cider and cheap own-brand vodka and whisky will see the biggest rise in prices. Ministers said the idea was to target booze that attracted problem drinkers. They were concerned that a two-litre bottle of strong cider (7.5 abv), which contained more than the weekly recommended limit for alcohol (14 units), could be bought for as little as Â£2.50. It will now cost at least Â£7.50. Own brand vodka, gin and whisky will also rise in price by as much as Â£3 a bottle, as will some cheap wines and multi-pack beers. Why has alcohol just got more expensive? How will minimum pricing affect me? Minimum alcohol pricing in Scotland to start in May Scotland to set 50p minimum unit price for alcohol Last week, a BBC survey of Scotland's supermarkets found that well-known brand names such as Smirnoff vodka, Famous Grouse whisky and Tennent's lager would also be affected by the minimum price, especially when they are on special offer. Research by alcohol-concern charities showed that almost three-quarters of Scotland's alcohol is bought from supermarkets and shops. This video can not be played David Richardson from Glasgow says he had a good job and a good life before drink took hold This video can not be played These three women are a little taken aback when they find out the new price of a bottle of cider Pubs, clubs and restaurants are unlikely to be affected by the law as they would have to be selling a pint of lager for about Â£1.14 or a large glass of wine for Â£1.50. The new law is not a tax and any extra revenue from higher prices will go to the supermarkets. A three-litre bottle of Frosty Jack cider will go up from Â£4.70 to Â£11.25 You can work out how many units there are in any drink by multiplying the total volume of a drink (in ml) by its ABV (Alcohol by volume - measured as a percentage) and dividing the result by 1,000. A bottle of 70cl (700ml) whisky at 40 abv is 28 units. At 50p per unit of alcohol that means a minimum price of Â£14. Vodka, which is not quite as strong (37.5 abv) would be 26.25 units and Â£13.13. A 440 ml can of lager (4% abv) would be a minimum of 88p. Ministers have called the new law a significant step in tackling Scotland's ""unhealthy relationship"" with alcohol. The Scottish government claims minimum pricing will save 58 lives in its first year and reduce hospital admissions by 1,300. Speaking on the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland radio programme, Health Secretary Shona Robison said the policy ""targets hazardous and harmful drinkers"". She added: ""This policy is geared towards making sure that by increasing the price - particularly of those products that do the most harm - that we will reduce consumption."" Asked about how it would be enforced, Ms Robison insisted policing of the policy would be robust. ""We believe that the licensing standards officers, and the work they do anyway around licensed premises, will be able to make sure that minimum unit pricing is adhered to,"" she said. ""I don't think anyone is going to want to put their licence at risk because obviously breaching licensing conditions can be a criminal offence and could lead to serious consequences with substantial fines and potentially imprisonment of up to six months."" The medical profession has welcomed the move which finally comes into force after five years of court battles brought by the Scotch Whisky Association. Dr Christine Goodall, of Medics Against Violence, told BBC Scotland more than 80% of assault victims in hospital emergency departments had been drinking, as had the people who had assaulted them. She said: ""Young people will start drinking at an early age and inevitably they don't have a lot of money to do that. ""So they are probably drinking the cheap alcohol. It will make that much more expensive. ""The hope is that will be a real disincentive to them."" Dr Goodall agrees the policy will not cure all of Scotland's alcohol-related ills. But she said it was an important plank in a wider attempt to cut the harm it causes, following on from ending buy-one-get-one-free multi-buys and tighter drink-drive laws. She said: ""We are not aiming to get the whole population to stop drinking but it will have an impact on the people who are currently experiencing the most harm."" Once the new law comes in, research will begin to gauge its effectiveness. It was passed with a ""sunset clause"" meaning that minimum unit pricing will end in six years if MSPs at Holyrood decide it has not worked.

"Spotify can reveal nation's mood, says Bank","Could the Bank of England soon pop up among your Spotify playlist followers? Its chief economist has hinted that analysis of people's music choices could be a useful tool and give a ""window on their soul"". In a speech about new possibilities in data analytics,external, Andy Haldane said data on downloads from Spotify had been used to gain an insight into people's mood. Book lists, TV choices and even computer games could also be used to gauge consumer confidence. He said: ""To give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people's sentiment."" He said the results did at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the well-regarded Michigan survey of consumer confidence in the US. Mr Haldane said games such as EVE Online and World of Warcraft were particularly useful as they had primitive economies which allowed goods and money to change hands between players. He said some economists had in fact begun to use gaming technologies to understand behaviour and could be used to explore behaviour in a virtual economy by studying player reactions to certain changes in policy. Mr Haldane is known for his attempts to broaden the Bank's knowledge base.

Corrie to air male suicide storyline,"Coronation Street is to tackle male suicide in a storyline which will see factory boss Aidan Connor kill himself. Producers say the plot ""is designed to give people who hide their feelings of desperation a chance to start a conversation"". The makers of the soap have worked with mental health charities on the storyline. More than three-quarters of suicides in the UK are by men, and it's the biggest killer of males under 45. Viewers will last see Aidan on screen with his ex-fiancÃ©e Eva, who has just given birth to a baby In an hour-long episode to be shown on 9 May, Aidan Connor kills himself - although the soap's makers say ""no element of the suicide will be shown on screen"". Shayne Ward, who plays the character, said he hopes ""that anyone who recognises something of themselves in Aidan will realise they can, and really should, talk about how they're feeling"". The former X Factor winner added: ""We have all heard stories like Aidan's when it was too late, when people looked back and wished they had spotted the signs, but it isn't always possible.

Judd sues Weinstein for career 'damage'The actress is accusing the Oscar-winning producer of defamation and sexual harassment.,"Ms Judd's lawsuit alleges that Mr Weinstein sought to sabotage her acting career Actress Ashley Judd is suing Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein claiming he damaged her career in retaliation for her rejecting his sexual advances. Monday's lawsuit accuses the Oscar-winning producer of defamation, sexual harassment and violation of the California Unfair Competition Law. Ms Judd was in the first group of women who came forward last year to accuse the filmmaker of sexual misconduct. Mr Weinstein is facing multiple claims of rape, intimidation and harassment. ""Weinstein used his power in the entertainment industry to damage Ms Judd's reputation and limit her ability to find work,"" the lawsuit filed at a court in Los Angeles alleges. Who has accused Weinstein of what? How the scandal unfolded Is #MeToo changing Hollywood? It comes after Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson said last year that he had been considering Ms Judd for a role in the 2002 film but that she was ""blacklisted"" following conversations with the Weinstein Company. He said that Mr Weinstein had warned him that the actress was a ""nightmare"" to work with. Mr Weinstein, however, has said that he had no role in Mr Jackson's casting and has denied trying to derail Ms Judd's career. A spokesperson for Mr Weinstein said in a statement that the producer had ""neither defamed Ms Judd nor ever interfered with Ms Judd's career"". Speaking to BBC Hardtalk's Stephen Sackur in January, Ms Judd said she believed that Mr Weinstein had ""blackballed"" her because she was ""not frightened"" of him. ""I think that is why he blacklisted me and did unfortunately as we know now such a successful job sabotaging my career,"" she added. This video can not be played Judd: I was not frightened of Weinstein If the lawsuit is successful, the actress has said she would donate any monetary damages to the Time's Up legal defence fund. The Time's Up campaign is a movement against sexual harassment that was founded at the start of January in response to recent allegations in the media, film and broadcasting. Its legal fund will offer support to people who have experienced sexual harassment, abuse or assault in the workplace. What is the Time's Up campaign? Exploring the casting couch culture of LA The widespread allegations of sexual abuse in Hollywood also sparked the #MeToo campaign, another women-led movement against harassment and assault.

"Iran nuclear deal built on lies, says US","This video can not be played Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled on Monday what he claims to be Iran's secret atomic archive US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says a landmark nuclear deal with Iran was ""built on lies"", after Israel claimed to have proof of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme. Mr Pompeo said documents revealed by Israel's prime minister were authentic. Analysts say they show nothing new, highlighting that concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions led to the 2015 deal. US President Donald Trump, who opposes the accord, has until 12 May to decide whether to abandon it or not. Other Western powers, including signatories Britain and France, say Iran has been abiding by the deal and it should be kept. How important was Netanyahu's revelation? Could the nuclear deal collapse? Why the bomb is back Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday accused Iran of conducting a secret nuclear weapons programme, dubbed Project Amad, and said it had continued to pursue nuclear weapons knowledge after the project was shuttered in 2003. That followed the revelation in 2002 by an exiled Iranian opposition group that Iran was constructing secret nuclear sites in breach of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which Iran was a signatory. Mr Netanyahu presented what he said was evidence of thousands of ""secret nuclear files"" that showed Iran had lied about its nuclear ambitions before the deal was signed in 2015. Tension between the long-standing enemies has grown steadily since Iran built up its military presence in Syria, which lies to the north-east of Israel. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons, and agreed three years ago to curb its nuclear energy programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. The Israeli prime minister did not provide evidence that Iran had violated the accord since it went into effect in early 2016. But he insisted that Project Amad had continued at the Iranian defence ministry - citing the head of the programme as saying: ""Special activities will be carried out under the title of scientific know-how developments."" Mr Netanyahu said he had shared the files with the US, and they would be submitted to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has been tasked with investigating Iran's nuclear past. The new secretary of state said the documents were proof ""beyond any doubt"" that ""the Iranian regime was not telling the truth"". ""Iran hid a vast atomic archive from the world and from the IAEA - until today,"" Mr Pompeo added. Mr Trump, who has been vocal about his opposition to the Obama-era deal, said he had viewed part of Mr Netanyahu's presentation and said the situation was ""not acceptable"". He said he would make a decision on whether to retain the deal in the next 12 days. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the move by Mr Netanyahu was a stunt to influence Mr Trump's decision on whether the US should stick with the nuclear deal. He said the documents were a rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the IAEA. A former chief inspector at the agency told the Guardian newspaper his department had seen some of the documentation presented by the Israeli prime minister as early as 2005. Olli Heinonen told the newspaper his department had come to the conclusion that evidence of Project Amad was credible, but that substantial work on it had ceased in 2003. A spokesman for the UK government, a signatory of the deal, said it would continue to back the deal, adding: ""We have never been naive about Iran and its nuclear intentions."" Rob Malley, who was on the Iran negotiating team under the Obama administration, played down the allegations, saying they were ""nothing new"". Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, the European Union's foreign policy chief,Federica Mogherini, said the documents have not put into question Iran's compliance with the 2015 deal,externaland said they should be analysed by the IAEA. Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Monday that Israel's intelligence agency Mossad had obtained 55,000 pages of evidence and a further 55,000 files on 183 CDs relating to Project Amad. A senior Israeli official told the New York Times that the agency first discovered the warehouse in southern Tehran in February 2016, and put the building under surveillance. In January, intelligence agents managed to break into the property in the middle of the night, remove the original documents and smuggle them back into Israel the same night, the official told the paper. The agreement signed between Iran, the US, China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain lifted crippling economic sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear programme. Under the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran is committed to slashing the number of its centrifuges, which are machines used to enrich uranium. It is also meant to cut its stockpile of enriched uranium drastically and not enrich remaining uranium to the level needed to produce nuclear weapons. The number of centrifuges installed at Iran's Natanz and Fordo sites was cut drastically soon after the deal while tonnes of low-enriched uranium were shipped to Russia. Furthermore, monitors from the IAEA have been able to carry out snap inspections at Iranian nuclear sites. Iran nuclear deal: Key details The US president has not held back in voicing his opposition to the deal, which he has described as the ""worst ever"". He has twice already refused to certify to Congress that Iran is complying with the agreement, and warned that the US would withdraw completely on 12 May - the next deadline for waiving sanctions - unless European signatories to the deal and Congress addressed his concerns. He is unhappy that it only limited Iran's nuclear activities for a fixed period and had failed to stop the development of ballistic missiles. He also said it had handed Iran a $100bn (Â£72bn) windfall that it used ""as a slush fund for weapons, terror, and oppression"" across the Middle East.

Brazil tower block collapses after inferno,"This video can not be played Footage shows SÃ£o Paulo tower block collapse A 26-storey building has collapsed after being engulfed in flames in Brazil's largest city, SÃ£o Paulo, killing at least one person. More than 150 firefighters are battling the blaze which is thought to have been caused by a gas explosion. The high-rise had been occupied by squatters. Fire authorities said they feared more people were trapped inside. Witnesses said flames spread quickly from one of the lower floors and set an adjacent building on fire. Some 50 families had moved into the building in the Largo do Paissandu area of the city after the federal police force, which had been using it, vacated it some years ago. The SÃ£o Paulo newspaper EstadÃ£o reported that makeshift living compartments in the building had been constructed from wood, aiding the spread of the blaze through the floors. Firefighters evacuated the high-rise but as they were taking out the last of the residents the building collapsed, killing one man. One firefighter was injured, EstadÃ£o reported. ""It was a matter of seconds but we couldn't save him,"" firefighter Max Mena said. ""It felt like a tsunami when the building came down,"" a 58-year-old woman who lived on the fourth floor told Folha newspaper. ""I could not take anything with me."" The building collapsed after 90 minutes Deise Silva, 31, told Folha that she was asleep inside one of the rooms with her five children when she was woken by screaming. ""When people told me there was a fire, I woke up the children and ran,"" she said. A nearby hotel has been evacuated. The hotel receptionist told Folha that he was alerted to the blaze by shouting. ""At first I thought it was a fight but then I heard people shouting 'get out, get out!'"" he said. The fire started at 01:20 local time (04:20 GMT) and the high-rise collapsed just 90 minutes later. SÃ£o Paulo Governor MÃ¡rcio FranÃ§a said the building was an accident waiting to happen but that its residents had resisted leaving. ""That type of home is uninhabitable, staying there is looking for trouble,"" he said speaking at the site of the blaze. Capt Marcos Palumbo of the SÃ£o Paulo fire brigade said that modifications made by the residents had allowed the fire to spread more quickly. ""The lifts had been taken out and those empty air shafts formed a chimney. There was also a lot of combustible material, such as wood and paper which helped fuel the fire,"" he said. Officials say the second building is currently not at risk of collapse. Firefighters have cordoned off a large area around the blaze. Last year,dozens of homes were destroyed by a fire in a favelain the city.

Undercover officer faces prosecution bid,"This video can not be played ""Monica"", environmental campaigner An environmental campaigner who says she was tricked into a sexual relationship with an undercover police officer is mounting a legal challenge to have him prosecuted. The woman, known as Monica, will ask judges to overturn prosecutors' decision not to charge the Metropolitan Police's Jim Boyling. A string of officers from a disbanded unit had affairs while undercover. DC Boyling is suspended and his lawyers have declined to comment on his behalf. This week Scotland Yard began a closed disciplinary hearing which could see him sacked. DC Boyling went on to have two more relationships and his behaviour - and what his managers knew about it - is a key element of a long-delayedpublic inquiry into alleged abuses in undercover policing,external. The CPS has said there were no grounds to prosecute the officer Twenty years ago, ""Monica"" was an environmental campaigner with Reclaim the Streets, a protest group that occupied roads and called for better planning of sustainable transport such as bicycles rather than cars. Jim Boyling was an officer with the Metropolitan Police's Special Demonstration Squad, a secret unit that sent detectives undercover into protest groups police considered might trigger trouble. DC Boyling met Monica while infiltrating Reclaim the Streets. They became a couple for six months in 1997. ""I loved him in a way, I really felt strongly for him,"" Monica told the BBC.  ""At the time I thought he had genuine feelings for me.  But now I look at that and I think actually this man was trained. He was a successful police officer. He was duping us all. ""And I was encouraged to be intimate and sexual with somebody who I would never ever have got involved with if I had known who he was: if I had known his true motives and his true identity."" DC Boyling, whom Monica knew as Jim Sutton, later disappeared in unclear circumstances - a tactic used by all of the officers at the end of their deployment. Monica only discovered who he really was after he was unmasked along with other officers accused of abuses. Scotland Yard has settled cases with a dozen women who sued the police force for being tricked into relationships. In an unprecedented apology, the force said the women had been ""deceived"" ""These [relationships] should never have happened,"" said the force's Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt. ""They were a gross violation of personal dignity and integrity."" Met Apologise to women over relationships Who are the deceived women? But the Crown Prosecution Service has refused to prosecute any of the officers for either sexual offences, or misconduct in public office. Monica appealed that decision under a system called theVictims Right to Review,external- but the CPS still refused to change its mind. Now she is seeking a full judicial review before High Court judges of the Director of Public Prosecution's handling of the file. Infiltration: Boyling would help campaigners by driving them around She says that the DPP was wrong not to consider charges, including the unusual historic offence of procuring someone for sex, because she had been the victim of deceit - and therefore never consented to the relationship. Harriet Wistrich, Monica's lawyer, also argues the CPS should consider whether DC Boyling should be prosecuted on the same legal terms as two women who were convicted of sexual assaultby impersonating men,external. The Crown Prosecution Service said it would not comment on the legal challenge. DC Boyling has said he will co-operate with the Undercover Policing Inquiry when it calls to give him evidence, although that could be more than a year off.

Cardinal Pell to stand trial on sex charges,"Cardinal George Pell has pleaded not guilty to charges of sexual assault Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell will stand trial on historical sexual assault charges, a court has ruled. Cardinal Pell formally pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing. An Australian magistrate ruled on Tuesday that there was enough evidence for the case to proceed to a trial on some charges, but not on others. Cardinal Pell, 76, is Australia's most senior Catholic and one of the most powerful officials in the Vatican. He was given a large police guard as he entered the Melbourne Magistrates' Court in front of dozens of media representatives and members of the public. Cardinal Pell, who is considered the Church's third-ranked official, took a leave of absence from the Vatican last year to fight the charges in his home country. Most of the evidence given remains confidential. But following the hearing on Tuesday, his lawyer, Robert Richter QC, argued that the most ""vile"" allegations against his client had been dismissed. Last June, police in the state of Victoria charged the senior cleric with what they described as historical charges involving ""multiple complainants"". More than 30 witnesses testified during a preliminary court hearing, known as a committal, that ran for four weeks from March. Many sessions were closed to the public, which is standard practice in Victoria in sexual offence cases. Cardinal George Pell and his lawyer were given a police guard entering court In open hearings, the court heard that an alleged incident took place at a Melbourne cathedral in the 1990s when the cleric was archbishop of Melbourne. Another allegation related to a swimming pool in the city of Ballarat in the 1970s, when Cardinal Pell was a local priest, the court heard. The cleric has consistently denied all accusations, saying last year: ""I am innocent of these charges, they are false. The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me."" Cardinal Pell's lawyer, Robert Richter QC, told a previous hearing that the allegations were ""impossible"", describing the complainants as ""unreliable"". He argued that Cardinal Pell had been targeted by accusers because of his role as Australia's most senior Catholic figure, and that his client had fully co-operated with police. Magistrate Belinda Wallington said about half of the charges had sufficient evidence to be put to a trial. An allegation that Cardinal Pell committed a sexual assault in a Ballarat cinema during a screening of Close Encounters of The Third Kind was among the charges that were dismissed. In explaining that decision, Magistrate Wallington cited inconsistencies between the evidence of the accused and other witnesses, as well as timelines of when the film was screening. ""The evidence as a whole is not a sufficient weight for a jury to convict,"" she said. Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent For over an hour, Cardinal Pell listened studiously, arms folded, as all of allegations against him were described in detail. Surrounded by supporters in the front row, he didn't react when the magistrate announced that half of the charges were to be dismissed. When he entered his plea, Cardinal Pell remained seated but spoke in a loud, defiant voice with two words: ""Not guilty."" And with that, it was clear that the cardinal will now face a trial before a jury. His appearances so far have seen dozens of cameras trail his every move in and out of court. When a trial does finally take place, the scrutiny is likely to be even more intense. Cardinal Pell's trial will be held before a judge and a 12-person jury in the County Court of Victoria. The court will hold an administrative hearing on Wednesday, but the trial is not expected to begin for several months. On Tuesday, the Archbishop of Melbourne, Denis Hart, said he had ""confidence in the judicial system in Australia and said that justice must now take its course"".

"High carb diet may hasten menopauseA study finds a diet rich in oily fish may help to delay natural menopause, while carbs hasten it.11h11 hours agoHealthComments","A diet high in carbs could bring on an earlier menopause, a study suggests. Eating lots of pasta and rice was associated with reaching menopause one-and-a-half years earlier than the average age of women in the UK of 51. However, the University of Leeds study of 914 UK women, also found that a diet rich in oily fish and peas and beans may delay natural menopause. But experts say many other factors, including genes, influence timing of the menopause. It's not clear how big a contribution dietary choices might make and women should not worry about changing what they eat based on the findings, they add. The research was published inthe Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health,externaland the women were asked what their typical diet contained. A diet high in legumes, which includes peas, beans, lentils and chickpeas, delayed menopause by one-and-a-half years, on average. Eating lots of refined carbs, particularly rice and pasta, was linked to menopause coming earlier by one-and-a-half years. The researchers took into account other potentially influencing factors, such as a woman's weight, reproductive history and use of HRT, but they weren't able to consider genetic factors, which can influence age of menopause. The study is observational and cannot prove any cause, but the researchers offer some possible explanations behind their findings. For example, legumes contain antioxidants, which may preserve menstruation for longer. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are in oily fish, also stimulate antioxidant capacity in the body. Refined carbs boost the risk of insulin resistance, which can interfere with sex hormone activity and boost oestrogen levels. This might increase the number of menstrual cycles leading to the egg supply running out faster. Study co-author Janet Cade, professor of nutritional epidemiology, said the age at which menopause begins can have ""serious health implications"" for some women. ""A clear understanding of how diet affects the start of natural menopause will be very beneficial to those who may already be at risk or have a family history of certain complications related to menopause."" Women who go through the menopause early are at increased risk of osteoporosis and heart disease, while women who go through it late are at increased risk of breast, womb, and ovarian cancers. Kathy Abernethy, menopause specialist nurse and chairwoman of the British Menopause Society, said: ""This study doesn't prove a link with the foods mentioned, but certainly contributes to the limited knowledge we currently have on why some women go through menopause earlier than others."" Prof Saffron Whitehead, emeritus professor of endocrinology at St George's University of London and Society for Endocrinology member, said: ""It is an interesting approach to investigate the timing of the menopause but I am not yet convinced that diet alone can account for the age of the onset of the menopause. There are too many other factors involved."" Dr Channa Jayasena, clinical senior lecturer and consultant in reproductive endocrinology and andrology at Imperial College, points out ""the body's metabolism plays an important role regulating ovulation and having periods"". ""It is tempting to speculate that this provides a recipe for delaying menopause. Unfortunately, a big limitation of these observational studies, is their inability to prove that dietary behaviour actually causes early menopause. Until we have that type of proof, I see no reason for people to change their diet."" Employers urged to 'normalise' menopause Doctors 'should discuss HRT more' NICE issues menopause guidelines.

"Bank tunes in to Spotify mood musicMusic downloads could help the Bank of England understand consumers' moods, its chief economist says.","Could the Bank of England soon pop up among your Spotify playlist followers? Its chief economist has hinted that analysis of people's music choices could be a useful tool and give a ""window on their soul"". In a speech about new possibilities in data analytics,external, Andy Haldane said data on downloads from Spotify had been used to gain an insight into people's mood. Book lists, TV choices and even computer games could also be used to gauge consumer confidence. He said: ""To give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people's sentiment."" He said the results did at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the well-regarded Michigan survey of consumer confidence in the US. Mr Haldane said games such as EVE Online and World of Warcraft were particularly useful as they had primitive economies which allowed goods and money to change hands between players. He said some economists had in fact begun to use gaming technologies to understand behaviour and could be used to explore behaviour in a virtual economy by studying player reactions to certain changes in policy. Mr Haldane is known for his attempts to broaden the Bank's knowledge base.

Children's social services 'near crisis',"Children's services in Wales are nearly ""at crisis point"", according to the body that represents councils. The latest figures show that there has been a 149% increase in the number of court applications to remove children into care over the last nine years. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said councils faced a rising caseload with restricted budgets. The Welsh Government said it recognised the pressure on councils and had taken action to support families. A ""section 31"" court application is made by a council if they want to take children into care because they have evidence of harm or likelihood of harm to the child. 'I was split from my sister' Crisis for adoptive families Children in care doing better in GCSEs Figures from the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service show the annual number of applications rose from 422 in 2008-09 to 1,050 in 2017-18. Councillor Geraint Hopkins, deputy spokesperson for children at the WLGA, said the last 10 years had been a difficult period for councils The WLGA said although councils were coping as well as possible, the situation was not sustainable. ""The system is very near at crisis point,"" said Geraint Hopkins, deputy spokesman for children at the WLGA. Mr Hopkins added: ""Unless we significantly look at the resources available to children's services in Wales and the important early intervention methods that we take to try and prevent children coming into care then we're going to be in serious trouble. ""It's been a difficult period over these last 10 years, austerity has hit many local authorities and whilst we have continued to meet the rising costs of looked after children, it's getting to the point now where we're really at crisis level."" This video can not be played Mother's child services crisis 'nightmare' Sarah (not her real name) complained to the Public Services Ombudsman about her son being taken into care by Monmouthshire council three years ago. The ombudsman's investigation found it was appropriate to remove him, but the way it was done was ""inadequately planned and poorly executed"". He said there were significant failings on the part of the council and upheld Sarah's complaint. Social workers asked Sarah to sign a handwritten note to show she agreed to her son staying with a family friend for one night. The ombudsman's report said the note was ""inadequate"" and ""of dubious validity"". As a result he said he was not convinced Sarah ""was in a position, or was given the opportunity to, provide fully informed consent"" to the indefinite removal of her child. Sarah said: ""He took a few things, his teddy bears, his pyjamas, his toothbrush and his school uniform, his bag and his lunch for the next day and off they went. ""I was made to sign a handwritten piece of paper just stating that it was for one night only and he never returned. That was three years ago. It feels like a nightmare."" The ombudsman found it was reasonable to take the boy into care, but ""there is some uncertainty, given the council's poor record keeping, whether other precautionary action could have been taken sooner"". Monmouthshire council fully accepted the recommendations of the ombudsman and said children's services were an ""absolute priority"". A spokesman said: ""We will always ensure that children are safe and protected and that staff have the support required to carry out this very difficult work. ""We work with many hundreds of children and their families every year. ""Since this case, no others relating to children's services have been upheld by the [ombudsman] and this provides assurance on system-wide service quality to the public."" Prof Judith Masson, from the University of Bristol, said there were many complex reasons why there had been a rise in section 31 applications. She said that there had been a population increase and that there were more care proceedings brought for children over the age of 13 compared with previous years because of more awareness of child sexual exploitation. She added that drinking, drug use and domestic abuse have increased too - all factors leading to section 31 applications. ""These are just a couple of the reasons. There's a whole variation of policies and practices that can lead to these increases over time,"" she said. Overall there were around 5,955 children in care in Wales in March 2017 compared with 4,695 in March 2009 - a rise of 27%. Six councils had a drop in the number of looked-after children - Denbighshire, Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Newport. The average cost of a foster placement provided by local authorities is about Â£23,327 a year, while those provided by an independent agency cost Â£43,378 on average. Residential care - for example a children's home - is generally more expensive and costs can range between Â£2,500 and Â£16,000 a week. A Welsh Government spokesman said it recognised the pressures being placed on local authorities. ""That's why we have taken action to strengthen early intervention and preventative action to support families to continue to safely care for their children and reduce the need for them to become looked after.""

"Health trust recalls 2,500 patients","The trust says it is a ""serious"" situation and has apologised More than 2,500 neurology patients in Northern Ireland, including children, are being recalled for a case review. The recall comes amid concerns some patients may have been misdiagnosed. The BBC can reveal that this follows a review of the work of neurology consultant Dr Michael Watt at the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Neurology is the treatment of brain conditions including MS, Parkinson's Disease, Stroke and Motor Neurone Disease. Following the case review, the patients involved could receive devastating news. While some of these conditions can be treated, nearly all are life-changing. Patients being recalled should have received a letter by post on Tuesday. It will include details about how to make an appointment. An advice line is now operating for those who have been affected - it is 0800 980 1100. The Ulster Independent Clinic, which confirmed that Dr Watt operated a private practice at the clinic until June 2017, said it would be operating a helpline for concerned patients from 09:00 BST on Wednesday morning - the number is 028 9068 6511. Both the trust and the Royal College of Physicians have carried out separate reviews of patients' notes. Concerns were initially raised by a GP about a patient's diagnosis and treatment in December 2016. The Belfast Health Trust said it was a ""serious"" situation and apologised to patients and their families. Nichola Mallon, SDLP, told the BBC that she raised the issue on behalf of several constituents last year. ""It is as if we have been beating our heads off a brick wall, trying to get information about what is going on and trying to get answers including diagnosis,"" she said. ""Some of my constituents have been in Dr Watt's care for years. But they can't get a proper diagnosis. So they are living in pain their quality of life is deteriorating, they don't know whether they are on the right medication, some cannot work."" Among the 2,500 under review are children, some of whom may have been struggling with a wrong diagnosis. A consultant who once worked alongside Dr Michael Watt said all of his colleagues were shocked. He said it was a ""daunting"" time for everyone, but patient safety must come first. Read more analysis from Marie-Louise here. This video can not be played 'We have never been involved with a recall of this scale' Dr Mark Mitchelson is responsible for neurosciences at the Belfast Health Trust. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, he said: ""While we hope this will affect a very small number of patients - the change in diagnosis could potentially be very significant. ""We understand that this must be incredibly anxious for them and, for that, we are deeply sorry for any distress that has been caused. ""Equally, we feel it's absolutely vital that we are prudent and cautious when dealing with any patient safety issues and hence, that is why we are recalling these patients to be seen."" Neurology is the field of medicine concerned with the operation of the brain While there is particular concern over a small number of his patients, the trust has decided to recall everyone who is currently in Dr Watt's care. The trust did not rule out the possibility, at a later stage,  it could stretch to patients who died while in Dr Watt's care. Dr Mitchelson said nine neurology consultants in the trust would be running 200 additional clinics starting from Saturday 5 May. They will see the 2,500 patients including teenagers as young as 14 years of age as quickly as possible. Beverley Davidson was one of thousands of neurology patients who discovered on Tuesday morning that they would face fresh appointments as part of the review. She told BBC News NI about how she found out about the news. ""I was out with my husband in the car, we turned the radio on and heard mention of Dr Watt and a bit of controversy over it - I decided to look at the news on the phone to see that patients were being recalled. ""I've come home and the letter is in the post to say I've been asked to come for an appointment in May. Beverley Davidson with the letter sent to her by the Belfast Health Trust ""I was shocked. It leaves you very uneasy. You're unsure of what's going on, what's going to happen. I'll have to go through lots of tests again, which was quite traumatic at the time. It leaves you in limbo, really - not good. ""I just don't know what to think - I found Dr Watt to be understanding and helpful. He took me through the paces of what I was going through. He made it quite easy to work with. The panic of who will take over or what will happen - I just don't know. ""The trust could have dealt with this a lot better than they have. To just send out a letter and hear a news report with no preparation - heartless. ""I wasn't expecting this today or any day. Within an hour, your whole world's upside down and will be until I have another consultation with whoever I get. ""I just hope they're just as efficient and professional as Dr Watt was with me."" Some of the recalled patients will be seen by doctors working in the independent sector. ""Certainly this is a significant number and, within the neurosciences division, we have never been involved with a recall of this scale,"" Dr Mitchelson said. ""These are patients with a wide range of neurological conditions, some of which are debilitating, complex and significantly serious. ""But standards did dip around one consultant and patient safety should always be paramount - hence the recall."" According to the Belfast Health Trust, Dr Watt has not seen any patient either in the public or private sector since June 2017. He remains an employee. The Ulster Independent Clinic said that Dr Watt operated a private practice at the clinic but he voluntarily suspended it in June 2017. ""Late last evening we were made aware of the completion of the review, commissioned by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, undertaken by the Royal College of Physicians into Dr Watt's clinical practice. ""When this is made available to us we will immediately consider the report to fully understand the type and extent of the concerns raised."" It added: ""We would like to reassure all Dr Watt's patients, potentially impacted by this issue, that we are moving as quickly as possible to address any concerns they may have."" Some of those who received letters on Tuesday have shared their experiences with BBC News NI. Kathy Ellis said that strong medication she did not need ""stole"" her life. ""I was like a zombie,"" she said. However, she improved after a new consultant changed her treatment. ""I feel so much better until today, until I got the letter,"" she said. Maeve Falconer said she was absolutely furious at Tuesday's patient recall ""I'm angry. I've been very tearful and crying all day. That's my life, how dare they."" Maeve Falconer said she was diagnosed with MS but later found out that was not the case. ""I believed that I had MS. I'd told my family, I'd told my employers, my husband told his employers. ""I thought if I told people I took control of it - and then to find out in February I didn't have MS, that was a bit of a shock."" She added: ""I am absolutely furious. I'm not recalled because I actually fell through the cracks before getting to that stage. ""But I'm so, so cross to think that I was not the only person in this position, that there are so many others who potentially are looking at the same thing as me or worse."" One caller to BBC's Talkback programme said his daughter, who has brain stem epilepsy, was a patient of Dr Watt's. ""We received a letter this morning (Tuesday) to go to the Royal Victoria Hospital on Sunday"", he said. ""She hasn't had an appointment with neurology for at least five years and now this has come like a bombshell - it's frightening. ""We feel we are left in limbo,"" the caller added. Nichola Mallon said getting answers was like ""beating our heads off a brick wall"" The trust said that it also wanted to reassure patients on already long waiting lists that they would not be affected by the recall. Dr Mitchelson said the consultants were very much aware of Northern Ireland's ""unacceptable"" waiting times and running 200 additional clinics would ensure these patients would not have to wait any longer. When asked by the BBC if the General Medical Council had been made aware of the review and Dr Watt, a spokesperson said that the trust had taken all ""appropriate action including liaising with the GMC"". ""It remains unclear if Dr Watt has referred himself to the governing body or if the Belfast Health Trust has done so on his behalf,"" the spokesperson said.

"Genetic secrets of the rose revealedTake time to smell the roses, the saying goes, as a study shows they may smell even sweeter in future.","There are about 200 types of rose Take time to smell the roses, the saying goes, and, according to scientists, the fragrant flowers could smell even sweeter in the future. For the first time researchers have deciphered the full genetic ""book"" of this most prized of plants. The secret history of the rose reveals surprises - it is more closely related to the strawberry than we thought. And in the long term the work could lead to roses with new scents and colours, says an international team. The new genome map, which took eight years to complete, reveals genes involved in scent production, colour and the longevity of flowers, said Mohammed Bendahmane of ENS de Lyon, in Lyon, France, who led the research. ""You have here a book of the history of the rose,"" he told BBC News. ""A book that helps us understand the rose, its history and its journey through evolution and domestication."" The Chinese rose, Rosa chinensis âOld Blushâ, was mapped in the study The study, by a team of more than 40 scientists from France, Germany, China and the UK, gives a better understanding of why roses have such a wide range of colours and scents. The genetic information will help breeders develop new varieties that last longer in the vase or are more resistant to plant pests. It also sheds light on the Rosaceae family, which contains fruits such as apples, pears and strawberries, as well as ornamentals such as the rose. ""The rose and the strawberry are very close species,"" said Dr Bendahmane. The cultivation of roses in gardens began thousands of years ago, probably in China. During the Roman period, roses were grown widely in the Middle East, where they were used as confetti or for perfume. In the fifteenth century, the rose was a symbol of the fight for the English throne during the ""War of the Roses"". The white rose represented the House of York, and the red rose symbolised the House of Lancaster. The research is published in the journal,Nature Genetics,external. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Fox: Peers blocking people's will on Brexit,"Theresa May says the government will be ""robust"" in its response to a House of Lords defeat which potentially gives Parliament a decisive say on Brexit. No 10 said the cabinet had ""strong disappointment"" with the vote, adding: ""We wish for the bill to go through in the same way it left the Commons."" Some ministers accuse peers of trying to ""thwart the will of the people"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Parliament must be sovereign on this matter and make the final decision."" He said the vote marked a ""hugely significant moment"" in the fight to ensure Parliament has a ""proper role"" in the Brexit negotiations and a no-deal situation was avoided. On Wednesday the key Brexit sub-committee of senior ministers will meet, with the issue of the UK and EU's future customs relationship expected to be on the agenda. Speaking to a House of Lords committee on Tuesday, Brexit Secretary David Davis said the EU had ""pushed back"" against the UK's two proposals aimed at avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. He said Brussels was concerned by the prospect of ""porosity"" on the EU's external border and by the risk of creating a precedent which might be copied elsewhere. Government defeated on Brexit deal vote Brexit: All you need to know A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill UK will leave customs union, insists No 10 The amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill - which would give MPs the power to stop the UK from leaving the EU without a deal, or make Theresa May return to the negotiating table - was approved by 335 votes to 244 on Monday night in the House of Lords. After the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the PM's official spokesman said the Lords amendment risked tying the government's hands in negotiations with the EU. The government will try to persuade MPs to overturn the change when the bill returns to the Commons later this month. It was one of three government defeats on the Brexit bill in one day - bringing the total number of government defeats on the EU bill to nine. It is not yet known whether any of the amendments from the Lords will be accepted by the government. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a leading voice in the 2016 campaign to get Britain out of the EU, told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""It is not acceptable for an unelected house to try to block the democratic will of the British people."" He said allowing Parliament to send the prime minister back to Brussels if MPs and peers did not like the deal the government had secured with the EU opened up the possibility of ""delaying exit from the EU indefinitely"". And the option of ""leaving the EU without an agreement"" had to be kept on the table. He said there was a ""big debate"" to be had about whether an ""unelected House"" could ""thwart the view of the British electorate"". And he categorically ruled out the UK being in some form of customs union with the EU after Brexit, amid speculation the government could be lining up a ""customs partnership"" or an EU association deal. ""No, I don't think we can stay in the customs union for a number of reasons, the main reason being that we would be in a worse position than we are today,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""If we were in a customs union with the European Union we would have to accept what the EU negotiated in terms of market access to the UK without the UK having a voice."" He added: ""I don't think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable."" Please upgrade your browser The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, with plans for a transition phase until the new permanent relationship kicks in after 31 December 2020. Both sides hope to negotiate the UK's withdrawal agreement by this October in order to give the UK and European Parliaments enough time to debate and vote on it before the moment of departure. The amendment proposed by Conservative Viscount Hailsham would allow Parliament to determine the government's course of action if MPs rejected the deal or if the UK and EU were not able to reach an agreement of any kind. It would also give Parliament control of the process if the legislation enshrining the withdrawal treaty promised by ministers was not approved by 29 March 2019. The peer, who as Douglas Hogg was an MP for many years, told the House of Lords the principle of parliamentary sovereignty was ""fundamental to our liberties and must not be betrayed"" when it came to Brexit. ""Whatever our party affiliation, our duty as parliamentarians is to our country and our conscience,"" he said. But former Conservative leader Lord Howard said the idea of effectively giving Parliament a veto over Brexit ""reveals the appalling lengths to which the die-hard Remainers are prepared to go to achieve their aims"". He told the BBC's Daily Politics that peers were ""playing with fire"".

Trump delays decision on steel tariffs,"The US is reliant on steel imports from more than 100 nations US President Donald Trump's administration has extended negotiations on steel and aluminium tariffs for 30 days with Canada, the EU and Mexico. It has also reached a deal in principle with Argentina, Brazil and Australia. In March, Mr Trump imposed worldwide tariffs of 25% on US imports of steel and 10% on aluminium. Some countries were then exempted temporarily from those tariffs, including Canada, the EU and Mexico. The EU said delaying the decision ""prolongs market uncertainty"", which was already having an effect on businesses. It was open to discussions, it said, but warned: ""As a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat."" Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? Trump imposes controversial tariffs US exempts EU from steel tariffs China was not included in the exemptions and later retaliated with its own duties on some US imports. Mr Trump responded by calling for further US tariffs against China, escalating trade tensions between the two giants. South Korea was given an indefinite exemption in return for a 30% cut in its steel exports to the US. ""In all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment, and protect the national security,"" a statement from the White House said. The statement said the details of the agreements with Argentina, Brazil and Australia would be ""finalised shortly"". Canada and Mexico had previously been given exemptions until 1 May while talks took place over Nafta (the North America Free Trade Agreement),  as had Argentina, Australia, Brazil and the EU. Those talks are due to resume next week. Analysis: BBC New York business correspondent, Kim Gittleson It was the deadline that wasn't. After a week-long charm offensive from both French President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the Trump administration has decided to kick the can down the road. This delay gives the administration more time to convince trading partners to perhaps consider quotas in lieu of tariffs - a concession to which South Korea has already agreed. But even with this extension, it's anyone's guess as to just what will constitute a win for a president who has promised to put America first. The EU reacted firmly to the US decision, insisting that it ""should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security"". It has already threatened a series of countermeasures if that does not happen. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday his government had been in regular contact with the White House on Canada's temporary exemption to metals tariffs. Canada is the biggest exporter of steel to the US. In response to Tuesday's announcement, the UK said it would continue to work closely with its EU partners and the US government to achieve a permanent exemption. ""We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets,"" a UK government spokesperson said.

Supreme Court to hear 'gay cake' caseIt's the latest legal challenge by a bakery found to have discriminated for refusing to make a 'gay cake'.7h7 hours agoNorthern Ireland,"The cake was ordered four years ago by gay rights activist Gareth Lee The owners of a Northern Ireland bakery found to have discriminated for refusing to make a ""gay cake"" were forced to act against their religious beliefs, the Supreme Court has heard. Ashers Bakery is challenging the ruling over its decision not to make a cake iced with the slogan ""Support Gay Marriage"" for activist Gareth Lee. Appeal court judges upheld the original decision,external. However, Mr Lee's barrister said he had 'no abusive intent' placing the order. Ashers general manager Daniel McArthur and his wife Amy attended the hearing in Belfast, where the bakery was represented by barrister David Scoffield QC. Timeline: Bakery discrimination case 'Gay cake' row Q&A ""This is a case of forced or compelled speech, unlike other cases which have come before the court,""  Mr Scoffield told the Supreme Court. ""Mr and Mrs McArthur have been penalised by the state, in the form of the judgment at the county court, for failing through their family company to create and provide a product bearing an explicit slogan 'Support Gay Marriage' to which they have a genuine objection in conscience. Ashers owner Daniel McArthur has argued that the cake's message was against their religious views ""They would equally have refused to provide that cake with the slogan to a heterosexual customer. ""Their difficulty was the content of the cake, not the characteristic of the customer."" Mr Scoffield added that the McArthur family were being forced to use their skills, trade and experience for a purpose inconsistent with their beliefs and claimed they must ""choose between operating their businesses or living and acting in accordance with their religious beliefs, and we say that cannot be the law"". It is only the second time the Supreme Court, established in 2009, has sat away from its permanent home in London. Last June the court held four days of hearings in Edinburgh. The court's judgementon whether the owners of Ashers Bakery were guilty of unlawful discrimination is expected to be handed down later in the year, or possibly in early 2019. By BBC News NI's Mark Simpson, inside the Supreme Court What started as a dispute in a Belfast bakery has ended up in the highest court in the land. The protagonists were separated by only three seats in court. It is almost four years to the day since gay activist Gareth Lee walked into Ashers bakery in Belfast city centre and tried to order his cake. On Tuesday, Mr Lee sat only a short distance away from Daniel McArthur, the general manager of Ashers. While they may have been close in court, there is a legal gulf between them. The five Supreme Court justices who have to decide which side they are on will not rush to judgement. It could be February 2019 before they make up their minds. Tuesday marks the latest legal chapter in the long-running case that began in May 2014 when the order was placed at an Ashers shop in Belfast by Gareth Lee, a gay rights activist. Ashers refused to bake the cake but was later found to have discriminated against Mr Lee. His barrister, Robin Allen QC, said he ""knew nothing at all"" about Mr and Mrs McArthur's religious beliefs when he placed the order. Mr Allen listed a range of images which Ashers had advertised on a flier that it would ice on cakes, including a witch for Halloween, a photograph of a person or ""a picture of Larne Ladies Football Club"". ""They say on the reverse of the flier 'We scan images - bring a favourite photo and we will scan it using edible ink, for all cakes we need three days notice,"" Mr Allen told the court. ""That was what Mr Lee understood was the offer they were making to the world at large when he went in with his logo of Bert and Ernie and 'Support Gay Marriage'. ""There was an attempt to argue that his request was outside the normal offer that they made to the public at large and that was rejected at first instance and on appeal by the Court of Appeal."" The case was taken by gay rights activist Gareth Lee When Mr Lee first took action against Ashers he said the bakery's actions left him feeling like a lesser person. Arriving outside the court on Tuesday, Ashers general manager Daniel McArthur said the case had ""always been about the message"". ""We didn't say no because of the customer; we'd served him before, we'd serve him again. It was because of the message. ""But some people want the law to make us support something with which we disagree."" The case against has so far cost the Equality Commission of Northern Ireland Â£150,000. The move to take the case to the Supreme Court came after Appeal court judges said that, under law,the bakers were not allowed to provide a service only to people who agreed with their religious beliefs,external.

Genetic secrets of the rose revealed,"There are about 200 types of rose Take time to smell the roses, the saying goes, and, according to scientists, the fragrant flowers could smell even sweeter in the future. For the first time researchers have deciphered the full genetic ""book"" of this most prized of plants. The secret history of the rose reveals surprises - it is more closely related to the strawberry than we thought. And in the long term the work could lead to roses with new scents and colours, says an international team. The new genome map, which took eight years to complete, reveals genes involved in scent production, colour and the longevity of flowers, said Mohammed Bendahmane of ENS de Lyon, in Lyon, France, who led the research. ""You have here a book of the history of the rose,"" he told BBC News. ""A book that helps us understand the rose, its history and its journey through evolution and domestication."" The Chinese rose, Rosa chinensis âOld Blushâ, was mapped in the study The study, by a team of more than 40 scientists from France, Germany, China and the UK, gives a better understanding of why roses have such a wide range of colours and scents. The genetic information will help breeders develop new varieties that last longer in the vase or are more resistant to plant pests. It also sheds light on the Rosaceae family, which contains fruits such as apples, pears and strawberries, as well as ornamentals such as the rose. ""The rose and the strawberry are very close species,"" said Dr Bendahmane. The cultivation of roses in gardens began thousands of years ago, probably in China. During the Roman period, roses were grown widely in the Middle East, where they were used as confetti or for perfume. In the fifteenth century, the rose was a symbol of the fight for the English throne during the ""War of the Roses"". The white rose represented the House of York, and the red rose symbolised the House of Lancaster. The research is published in the journal,Nature Genetics,external. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Suppliers fear Sainsbury's price squeeze,"Sainsbury's says its merger with Asda will give consumers better savings, but what about suppliers? Companies that supply products to Sainsbury's and Asda fear they could suffer when the two grocery chains merge. Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe haspledged to cut prices on everyday products by around 10%after the deal. But suppliers fear they will have to shoulder the cost of those savings. ""There will be plenty of losers from this,"" said Austin Sugarman, boss of Fine Foods International, a supplier of instant coffee based in Bedfordshire. ""If suppliers are going to have to come up with the savings, then we'll see consolidation in the supply base,"" he told the BBC. Austin Sugarman, head of Fine Foods International, believes many suppliers will lose out from the deal ""That means closing factories, that means losing people and it means effectively less choice for consumers."" Mr Coupe said the combined group's buying power would enable it to strike better deals with suppliers, and these savings would then be passed on to consumers. But industry bodies fear this will make life very difficult for smaller suppliers, who are already having to adapt to higher costs from auto-enrolment pensions and the Living Wage, as well as the weaker pound since the Brexit vote. Sainsbury's boss sorry for money song gaffe Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts ""We already operate in a very competitive retail environment,"" said Gordon Polson, director of the Federation of Bakers. ""We just don't see possibly how our products could be reduced any further."" Ian Cass, managing director of the Forum of Private Business agreed: ""If suppliers are asked to reduce prices by 10% to stay on the Sainsbury's-Asda supply chain, then some small companies could go out of business."" Mr Cass was concerned that the combined company - which will be Britain's biggest grocer - could seek to pressure suppliers into unfavourable terms by holding the threat of losing contracts over their heads. Suppliers fear a 10% reduction in shop prices would harm their businesses He cited Arcadia Group, which owns brands such as Topshop and Dorothy Perkins as an example.In January, the firm imposed a 2% discount on all current and existing orders from suppliers,externaldue to poor Christmas sales. On top of all these pressures, suppliers also have to contend with the fact that many retailers in the grocery industry make suppliers wait up to three months for payment. ""Surely there are other efficiencies you could make in partnership with suppliers, other than turning around and demanding a 10% discount,"" Mr Cass said. Sentinel Management Consultants acts as an adviser to suppliers on their negotiations with supermarkets. It said that while some suppliers will undoubtedly be ""quaking with fear"" after the Sainsbury's-Asda merger announcement, others will have more power to negotiate with the new firm than they realise. ""Suppliers need to get better at saying no,"" said Sentinel boss David Sables. An expert says Sainsbury's and Asda will be unable to convince major suppliers to offer more discounts ""Supermarkets don't want to have complaints from shoppers because their favourite crisps, biscuits, coffee or soap powder have come off the shelves."" Mr Sables said small businesses should make sure they understand their rights under the Groceries Supply Code of Practice, and also understand that supermarket chains tend to hold the threat of getting rid of suppliers as a bluff. ""There is a game being played about the demand for cheaper prices, and very often when suppliers have said no and they're walking away, nine times out of 10 that's the price they get the contract to supply at."" A Sainsbury's spokeswoman told the BBC that suppliers would benefit from the deal. ""At this stage, we are still in the early phases of our plans but we believe this is a great opportunity for suppliers as they will be able to make their supply chains more streamlined, to develop differentiated product ranges and to grow their businesses as we grow ours. ""We are also actively investing in small suppliers - we are recruiting a team which is dedicated to working with smaller and distinctive suppliers to help them bring new products to market and to handhold them through this process.""

Trump delays decision on tariffs,"The US is reliant on steel imports from more than 100 nations US President Donald Trump's administration has extended negotiations on steel and aluminium tariffs for 30 days with Canada, the EU and Mexico. It has also reached a deal in principle with Argentina, Brazil and Australia. In March, Mr Trump imposed worldwide tariffs of 25% on US imports of steel and 10% on aluminium. Some countries were then exempted temporarily from those tariffs, including Canada, the EU and Mexico. The EU said delaying the decision ""prolongs market uncertainty"", which was already having an effect on businesses. It was open to discussions, it said, but warned: ""As a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat."" Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? Trump imposes controversial tariffs US exempts EU from steel tariffs China was not included in the exemptions and later retaliated with its own duties on some US imports. Mr Trump responded by calling for further US tariffs against China, escalating trade tensions between the two giants. South Korea was given an indefinite exemption in return for a 30% cut in its steel exports to the US. ""In all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment, and protect the national security,"" a statement from the White House said. The statement said the details of the agreements with Argentina, Brazil and Australia would be ""finalised shortly"". Canada and Mexico had previously been given exemptions until 1 May while talks took place over Nafta (the North America Free Trade Agreement),  as had Argentina, Australia, Brazil and the EU. Those talks are due to resume next week. Analysis: BBC New York business correspondent, Kim Gittleson It was the deadline that wasn't. After a week-long charm offensive from both French President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the Trump administration has decided to kick the can down the road. This delay gives the administration more time to convince trading partners to perhaps consider quotas in lieu of tariffs - a concession to which South Korea has already agreed. But even with this extension, it's anyone's guess as to just what will constitute a win for a president who has promised to put America first. The EU reacted firmly to the US decision, insisting that it ""should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security"". It has already threatened a series of countermeasures if that does not happen. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday his government had been in regular contact with the White House on Canada's temporary exemption to metals tariffs. Canada is the biggest exporter of steel to the US. In response to Tuesday's announcement, the UK said it would continue to work closely with its EU partners and the US government to achieve a permanent exemption. ""We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets,"" a UK government spokesperson said.

Supreme Court to hear 'gay cake' case,"The cake was ordered four years ago by gay rights activist Gareth Lee The owners of a Northern Ireland bakery found to have discriminated for refusing to make a ""gay cake"" were forced to act against their religious beliefs, the Supreme Court has heard. Ashers Bakery is challenging the ruling over its decision not to make a cake iced with the slogan ""Support Gay Marriage"" for activist Gareth Lee. Appeal court judges upheld the original decision,external. However, Mr Lee's barrister said he had 'no abusive intent' placing the order. Ashers general manager Daniel McArthur and his wife Amy attended the hearing in Belfast, where the bakery was represented by barrister David Scoffield QC. Timeline: Bakery discrimination case 'Gay cake' row Q&A ""This is a case of forced or compelled speech, unlike other cases which have come before the court,""  Mr Scoffield told the Supreme Court. ""Mr and Mrs McArthur have been penalised by the state, in the form of the judgment at the county court, for failing through their family company to create and provide a product bearing an explicit slogan 'Support Gay Marriage' to which they have a genuine objection in conscience. Ashers owner Daniel McArthur has argued that the cake's message was against their religious views ""They would equally have refused to provide that cake with the slogan to a heterosexual customer. ""Their difficulty was the content of the cake, not the characteristic of the customer."" Mr Scoffield added that the McArthur family were being forced to use their skills, trade and experience for a purpose inconsistent with their beliefs and claimed they must ""choose between operating their businesses or living and acting in accordance with their religious beliefs, and we say that cannot be the law"". It is only the second time the Supreme Court, established in 2009, has sat away from its permanent home in London. Last June the court held four days of hearings in Edinburgh. The court's judgementon whether the owners of Ashers Bakery were guilty of unlawful discrimination is expected to be handed down later in the year, or possibly in early 2019. By BBC News NI's Mark Simpson, inside the Supreme Court What started as a dispute in a Belfast bakery has ended up in the highest court in the land. The protagonists were separated by only three seats in court. It is almost four years to the day since gay activist Gareth Lee walked into Ashers bakery in Belfast city centre and tried to order his cake. On Tuesday, Mr Lee sat only a short distance away from Daniel McArthur, the general manager of Ashers. While they may have been close in court, there is a legal gulf between them. The five Supreme Court justices who have to decide which side they are on will not rush to judgement. It could be February 2019 before they make up their minds. Tuesday marks the latest legal chapter in the long-running case that began in May 2014 when the order was placed at an Ashers shop in Belfast by Gareth Lee, a gay rights activist. Ashers refused to bake the cake but was later found to have discriminated against Mr Lee. His barrister, Robin Allen QC, said he ""knew nothing at all"" about Mr and Mrs McArthur's religious beliefs when he placed the order. Mr Allen listed a range of images which Ashers had advertised on a flier that it would ice on cakes, including a witch for Halloween, a photograph of a person or ""a picture of Larne Ladies Football Club"". ""They say on the reverse of the flier 'We scan images - bring a favourite photo and we will scan it using edible ink, for all cakes we need three days notice,"" Mr Allen told the court. ""That was what Mr Lee understood was the offer they were making to the world at large when he went in with his logo of Bert and Ernie and 'Support Gay Marriage'. ""There was an attempt to argue that his request was outside the normal offer that they made to the public at large and that was rejected at first instance and on appeal by the Court of Appeal."" The case was taken by gay rights activist Gareth Lee When Mr Lee first took action against Ashers he said the bakery's actions left him feeling like a lesser person. Arriving outside the court on Tuesday, Ashers general manager Daniel McArthur said the case had ""always been about the message"".

New home secretary Javid's Windrush vow,"This video can not be played New Home Secretary Sajid Javid: ""We will do right by the Windrush generation."" Sajid Javid is vowing to ""do right"" by the people affected by the Windrush scandal as he starts his new job as home secretary. He has rejected the controversial ""hostile environment"" tag attached to the government's immigration policy. Theresa May will meet her ministers at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday for the first time since Amber Rudd quit. Labour says the prime minister has ""questions to answer"" about her own time at the Home Office. As it happened: Javid replaces Rudd Who is Sajid Javid, the new home secretary? Who's who guide to the new cabinet Facing questions by MPs, Mr Javid vowed to ""do whatever it takes"" to put right the problems faced by the Windrush generation which led to Ms Rudd's departure. As a second generation migrant, he said he was ""angry"" at the treatment of those caught up in the saga. The difficulties faced by ""longstanding pillars of the community"" should never have happened, he said, adding: ""I thought that it could be my mum, my brother, my uncle or even me."" He told MPs: ""I want to start by making a pledge, a pledge to those from the Windrush generation who have been in this country for decades and yet have struggled to navigate through the immigration system. This never should have been the case and I will do whatever it takes to put it right."" And he said he would not be using the phrase ""hostile environment"" to describe immigration laws introduced by Mrs May when she was home secretary. He told MPs: ""I think the terminology is incorrect, I think it's a phrase that is unhelpful and does not represent the values as a country."" Politically neat, generally welcomed by colleagues - In the recent canon of Tory events the relatively smooth landing of this appointment is an achievement in itself. But moving Sajid Javid in, after Amber Rudd took herself out, does not end the prime minister's problems. She and Mr Javid need to move fast to cauterise the political wounds from Windrush. He can, and did, make a more compelling and personal case in the House of Commons, showing what seems real anger about what has happened to those caught up in Windrush, and unafraid to use his own family story to display it too. Colleagues have called him a ""good operator"", and ""compassionate and empathetic"". Many in Westminster are pointing to his own family history as the ultimate Tory dream - the boy whose dad arrived in Britain with Â£1 in his pocket, who through hard work ended up in the cabinet, with a portrait of Margaret Thatcher on his wall. His appointment is also a landmark: he is the first politician from an ethnic minority to take on one of the great offices of state - the biggest jobs in cabinet. But whatever the presentation and the political messaging, the realities of the Windrush fiasco affect real lives. It's not going to be fixed with a new face or a more sympathetic soundbite. Read the full blog here The Windrush generation settled legally in post-war Britain and automatically won the right to remain in the UK. However the UK government did not keep a record of many of the migrants. Some people who do not have the paperwork to prove they are in the UK legally have been detained. Others have lost their jobs and have been denied access to free medical care. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The row has prompted calls for the government to abandon its ""hostile environment"" policy on illegal immigration, which Ms Rudd and Mrs May continued to defend. Mr Javid told MPs he preferred the phrase ""compliant environment"". Labour MP Barry Gardiner said it would be a ""mistake"" if Mr Javid did not abandon the government's targets on removing illegal immigrants. This video can not be played Labour MP Barry Gardiner: 'International students should be excluded from migration target' No easy fixes for new home secretary Windrush: Who exactly was on board? What went wrong for Amber Rudd? Rudd's resignation letter in full And Labour MP and Windrush campaigner David Lammy, said promises made by the government should be urgently written into law. He criticised ministers for referring to illegal immigration in its response to the row. Speaking in a Westminster Hall debate he said: ""This not about illegal immigration. This is about British citizens, and frankly it is deeply offensive to conflate the Windrush generation with illegal immigrants to try and distract from the Windrush crisis.""

UK backs Iran deal amid weapon claims,"Theresa May has continued to back the deal, signed in 2015 The UK has backed a ""vitally important"" nuclear deal with Iran, despite accusations from the US and Israel that Iranians are pursuing atomic weapons. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu claims thousands of ""secret nuclear files"" proved Iran covertly sought nuclear weapons - an accusation Iran rejects. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo backed him, saying Tehran had lied. But Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt told the BBC the deal ""contributes to peace in the region"". Iran 'lied' on nuclear deal, says Pompeo What is the Iranian nuclear deal? Could the deal collapse? Six nations signed an accord in 2015 lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for it abandoning a nuclear weapons programme. The three European signatories - the UK, France and Germany - reaffirmed their backing for the deal, asUS President Donald Trump continues to threaten to walk away from the agreement. The deal is also signed by Russia and China. A UK government spokesman said inspectors appointed as part of the accord are providing a ""vitally important way of independently verifying that Iran is adhering to the deal"". The spokesman added: ""We have never been naive about Iran and its nuclear intentions."" This video can not be played Trump says Israel's allegations prove 'I'm right on Iran' Mr Burt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he understood the ""anxiety"" of Israel and the US, but the UK government has been very clear about its belief in the deal - known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). He said: ""There is a great deal of confrontation, worries and heightened rhetoric [in the region] and I think one of the roles the United Kingdom can play is to seek to de-escalate this. ""It is extremely tense and we should be doing all we can to back those things that are likely to deescalate tension - that is one of the reasons we support JCPOA."" On Monday, Mr Netanyahu said thousands of pages of material obtained by Israel showed Iran had deceived the world by denying it had ever sought nuclear weapons. Stood in front of a screen reading ""Iran Lied"", he accused Iran of conducting a secret weapons programme until 2003 codenamed ""Project Amad"". He then claimed the country had continued to pursue nuclear weapons knowledge after Project Amad was shuttered. Iran responded that Israel's revelations were a ""childish"" stunt to influence President Trump's decision on whether to remain in the nuclear deal, which he is due to make by 12 May. Mr Trump has asked the European signatories to the agreement to ""fix the terrible flaws"" with it or he will refuse to extend sanctions relief on Iran. This video can not be played Netanyahu unveils what he claims to be Iran's secret atomic archive In a statement, the White House said Israel's information provided ""new and compelling details"" about Iran's alleged efforts to develop ""missile-deliverable nuclear weapons"". The US statement said: ""These facts are consistent with what the US has long known - Iran had a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons programme that it has tried and failed to hide from the world and from its own people."" US Secretary of State Mr Pompeo said the top secret documents Israel claims to have obtained show Tehran ""was not telling the truth"" about its nuclear programme. Foreign Office minister Mr Burt said the UK was working ""very hard"" with partners to persuade President Trump to stick with the deal and all sides needed to carry on talking to each other. ""We support the JCPOA [and] we will stick to its provisions because we believe it contributes to peace in the region, notwithstanding all the other things that also need to be dealt with,"" he added.

"Iran 'lied' on nuclear deal, says Pompeo","This video can not be played Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled on Monday what he claims to be Iran's secret atomic archive US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says a landmark nuclear deal with Iran was ""built on lies"", after Israel claimed to have proof of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme. Mr Pompeo said documents revealed by Israel's prime minister were authentic. Analysts say they show nothing new, highlighting that concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions led to the 2015 deal. US President Donald Trump, who opposes the accord, has until 12 May to decide whether to abandon it or not. Other Western powers, including signatories Britain and France, say Iran has been abiding by the deal and it should be kept. How important was Netanyahu's revelation? Could the nuclear deal collapse? Why the bomb is back Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday accused Iran of conducting a secret nuclear weapons programme, dubbed Project Amad, and said it had continued to pursue nuclear weapons knowledge after the project was shuttered in 2003. That followed the revelation in 2002 by an exiled Iranian opposition group that Iran was constructing secret nuclear sites in breach of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which Iran was a signatory. Mr Netanyahu presented what he said was evidence of thousands of ""secret nuclear files"" that showed Iran had lied about its nuclear ambitions before the deal was signed in 2015. Tension between the long-standing enemies has grown steadily since Iran built up its military presence in Syria, which lies to the north-east of Israel. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons, and agreed three years ago to curb its nuclear energy programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. The Israeli prime minister did not provide evidence that Iran had violated the accord since it went into effect in early 2016. But he insisted that Project Amad had continued at the Iranian defence ministry - citing the head of the programme as saying: ""Special activities will be carried out under the title of scientific know-how developments."" Mr Netanyahu said he had shared the files with the US, and they would be submitted to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has been tasked with investigating Iran's nuclear past. The new secretary of state said the documents were proof ""beyond any doubt"" that ""the Iranian regime was not telling the truth"". ""Iran hid a vast atomic archive from the world and from the IAEA - until today,"" Mr Pompeo added. Mr Trump, who has been vocal about his opposition to the Obama-era deal, said he had viewed part of Mr Netanyahu's presentation and said the situation was ""not acceptable"". He said he would make a decision on whether to retain the deal in the next 12 days. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the move by Mr Netanyahu was a stunt to influence Mr Trump's decision on whether the US should stick with the nuclear deal. He said the documents were a rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the IAEA. A former chief inspector at the agency told the Guardian newspaper his department had seen some of the documentation presented by the Israeli prime minister as early as 2005. Olli Heinonen told the newspaper his department had come to the conclusion that evidence of Project Amad was credible, but that substantial work on it had ceased in 2003. A spokesman for the UK government, a signatory of the deal, said it would continue to back the deal, adding: ""We have never been naive about Iran and its nuclear intentions."" Rob Malley, who was on the Iran negotiating team under the Obama administration, played down the allegations, saying they were ""nothing new"". Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, the European Union's foreign policy chief,Federica Mogherini, said the documents have not put into question Iran's compliance with the 2015 deal,externaland said they should be analysed by the IAEA. Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Monday that Israel's intelligence agency Mossad had obtained 55,000 pages of evidence and a further 55,000 files on 183 CDs relating to Project Amad. A senior Israeli official told the New York Times that the agency first discovered the warehouse in southern Tehran in February 2016, and put the building under surveillance. In January, intelligence agents managed to break into the property in the middle of the night, remove the original documents and smuggle them back into Israel the same night, the official told the paper. The agreement signed between Iran, the US, China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain lifted crippling economic sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear programme. Under the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran is committed to slashing the number of its centrifuges, which are machines used to enrich uranium. It is also meant to cut its stockpile of enriched uranium drastically and not enrich remaining uranium to the level needed to produce nuclear weapons. The number of centrifuges installed at Iran's Natanz and Fordo sites was cut drastically soon after the deal while tonnes of low-enriched uranium were shipped to Russia. Furthermore, monitors from the IAEA have been able to carry out snap inspections at Iranian nuclear sites. Iran nuclear deal: Key details The US president has not held back in voicing his opposition to the deal, which he has described as the ""worst ever"". He has twice already refused to certify to Congress that Iran is complying with the agreement, and warned that the US would withdraw completely on 12 May - the next deadline for waiving sanctions - unless European signatories to the deal and Congress addressed his concerns. He is unhappy that it only limited Iran's nuclear activities for a fixed period and had failed to stop the development of ballistic missiles. He also said it had handed Iran a $100bn (Â£72bn) windfall that it used ""as a slush fund for weapons, terror, and oppression"" across the Middle East.

High carb diet may hasten menopause,"A diet high in carbs could bring on an earlier menopause, a study suggests. Eating lots of pasta and rice was associated with reaching menopause one-and-a-half years earlier than the average age of women in the UK of 51. However, the University of Leeds study of 914 UK women, also found that a diet rich in oily fish and peas and beans may delay natural menopause. But experts say many other factors, including genes, influence timing of the menopause. It's not clear how big a contribution dietary choices might make and women should not worry about changing what they eat based on the findings, they add. The research was published inthe Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health,externaland the women were asked what their typical diet contained. A diet high in legumes, which includes peas, beans, lentils and chickpeas, delayed menopause by one-and-a-half years, on average. Eating lots of refined carbs, particularly rice and pasta, was linked to menopause coming earlier by one-and-a-half years. The researchers took into account other potentially influencing factors, such as a woman's weight, reproductive history and use of HRT, but they weren't able to consider genetic factors, which can influence age of menopause. The study is observational and cannot prove any cause, but the researchers offer some possible explanations behind their findings. For example, legumes contain antioxidants, which may preserve menstruation for longer. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are in oily fish, also stimulate antioxidant capacity in the body. Refined carbs boost the risk of insulin resistance, which can interfere with sex hormone activity and boost oestrogen levels. This might increase the number of menstrual cycles leading to the egg supply running out faster. Study co-author Janet Cade, professor of nutritional epidemiology, said the age at which menopause begins can have ""serious health implications"" for some women. ""A clear understanding of how diet affects the start of natural menopause will be very beneficial to those who may already be at risk or have a family history of certain complications related to menopause."" Women who go through the menopause early are at increased risk of osteoporosis and heart disease, while women who go through it late are at increased risk of breast, womb, and ovarian cancers. Kathy Abernethy, menopause specialist nurse and chairwoman of the British Menopause Society, said: ""This study doesn't prove a link with the foods mentioned, but certainly contributes to the limited knowledge we currently have on why some women go through menopause earlier than others."" Prof Saffron Whitehead, emeritus professor of endocrinology at St George's University of London and Society for Endocrinology member, said: ""It is an interesting approach to investigate the timing of the menopause but I am not yet convinced that diet alone can account for the age of the onset of the menopause. There are too many other factors involved."" Dr Channa Jayasena, clinical senior lecturer and consultant in reproductive endocrinology and andrology at Imperial College, points out ""the body's metabolism plays an important role regulating ovulation and having periods"". ""It is tempting to speculate that this provides a recipe for delaying menopause. Unfortunately, a big limitation of these observational studies, is their inability to prove that dietary behaviour actually causes early menopause.

Judd sues Weinstein for career 'damage'Actress Ashley Judd's lawsuit accuses the Oscar-winning producer of defamation and sexual harassment.1han hour agoUS & Canada,"Ms Judd's lawsuit alleges that Mr Weinstein sought to sabotage her acting career Actress Ashley Judd is suing Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein claiming he damaged her career in retaliation for her rejecting his sexual advances. Monday's lawsuit accuses the Oscar-winning producer of defamation, sexual harassment and violation of the California Unfair Competition Law. Ms Judd was in the first group of women who came forward last year to accuse the filmmaker of sexual misconduct. Mr Weinstein is facing multiple claims of rape, intimidation and harassment. ""Weinstein used his power in the entertainment industry to damage Ms Judd's reputation and limit her ability to find work,"" the lawsuit filed at a court in Los Angeles alleges. Who has accused Weinstein of what? How the scandal unfolded Is #MeToo changing Hollywood? It comes after Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson said last year that he had been considering Ms Judd for a role in the 2002 film but that she was ""blacklisted"" following conversations with the Weinstein Company. He said that Mr Weinstein had warned him that the actress was a ""nightmare"" to work with. Mr Weinstein, however, has said that he had no role in Mr Jackson's casting and has denied trying to derail Ms Judd's career. A spokesperson for Mr Weinstein said in a statement that the producer had ""neither defamed Ms Judd nor ever interfered with Ms Judd's career"". Speaking to BBC Hardtalk's Stephen Sackur in January, Ms Judd said she believed that Mr Weinstein had ""blackballed"" her because she was ""not frightened"" of him. ""I think that is why he blacklisted me and did unfortunately as we know now such a successful job sabotaging my career,"" she added. This video can not be played Judd: I was not frightened of Weinstein If the lawsuit is successful, the actress has said she would donate any monetary damages to the Time's Up legal defence fund. The Time's Up campaign is a movement against sexual harassment that was founded at the start of January in response to recent allegations in the media, film and broadcasting. Its legal fund will offer support to people who have experienced sexual harassment, abuse or assault in the workplace. What is the Time's Up campaign? Exploring the casting couch culture of LA The widespread allegations of sexual abuse in Hollywood also sparked the #MeToo campaign, another women-led movement against harassment and assault. The movements have continued to grow in the face of widespread abuses of power that have rocked industries across the US and around the world. Judd: I was not frightened of Weinstein.

"Peppa Pig blocked on popular Chinese appState media say the cartoon is being used ""subversively"" - and a rival, domestic pig has been launched.","Peppa Pig is the latest subject of China's censors A popular British cartoon has been removed from one of China's most popular social media platforms, with state media saying that the character is being used subversively. Social media users in the country noticed video clips of the cartoon were being removed on Saturday, and on Monday, state newspaper Global Times said that the #PeppaPig hashtag had been removed from the Douyin video website, while searches for ""Peppa Pig"" on the site produced no results. Many papers also note that the platform appears to have added ""Peppa Pig"" to its list of blacklisted content. The Peppa Pig cartoon is hugely popular in China, but despite being targeted at a pre-school audience, it has found mass appeal with Chinese adults in recent months. Its characters have become a common feature in memes, including sexually suggestive content. ""After Peppa Pig started to take on this subversive hue and subsequently go viral, some experts said the popularity of the cartoon demonstrates the social psychology of hunting for novelty and spoofing, which could potentially hamper positive societal morale,""Global Times said,external. Beijing appears keen to quell subversive enthusiasm for the cartoon by trying to promote friendly domestic pig cartoons instead. Peppa Pig has been long popular with children in China, and has attracted some 34 billion views on domestic online video platforms. It was exported to China in the early 2000s, and over 100 translated episodes have aired in the mainland. Peppa Pig first aired on TV in 2004 It is shown on the children's channel of state broadcaster CCTV, and also hosted on a number of digital platforms, such as the Netflix-like website iQiyi. In recent weeks, however, mainstream media have noticed a mass appeal of the Peppa Pig cartoon among adults. Verified Chinese media outlets are sharing screengrabs showing ""Peppa Pig"" is blacklisted on Douyin Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post notes that there has been a recent frenzy for Peppa Pig products online, with users paying hundreds of yuan for goods such as ""antique-style"" Peppa Pig porcelain bowls. The Sina Entertainment website has also noted the popularity of the cartoon's plush toys and fairytale cakes among actresses Yang Mi, Nana Ou-yang and Zhao Liying, among others. It is not only women with a squeaky clean image that have caught what Sina calls ""the Peppa Pig virus""; the website shares a number of edgy male actors and singers showing off Peppa Pig, plus toys and transfer tattoos. The wave sparked a trend of adult Chinese Sina Weibo users sharing pictures of their own Peppa Pig merchandise. Thousands of female users have shared pictures of pink fans and hair accessories adorned with the lead character, while male users have shared pictures of their stickers and watches. In recent months, state media have signalled their increasing discomfort about the growing influence of the cartoon. They have noted that its characters have become the subject of what they call deviance and manipulation among Chinese youths. Nationalist newspaper Global Times noted in January that social media users had been circulating ""explicit fake versions"" of the cartoon online, making references to paedophiles and sexual organs. And a recent article on the popular news portal Sohu notes that there's been a particular surge of social media users making personalised emojis and memes out of stills of the cartoon. It says that this has been particularly the case on the Snapchat-like mobile application Douyin - potentially leading to the ban. Thousands of Weibo users are posting pictures of themselves with ""Little Dodo"" the pig Douyin's removal of the popular cartoon from its platform is possibly just the start of a wider clampdown. It comes as part of a wider crackdown on online content the Beijing government deems vulgar or pornographic. In recent months, Chinese microblogs such as Sina Weibo have been extensively removing such content from their platforms, stressing that such material is not in keeping with a healthy online culture. Given China's millions of online users, it is extremely difficult to simply censor all content when a TV show or personality has proven so popular. Beijing normally takes steps to launch a domestically-approved version, and this is what has happened with Peppa Pig. One Chinese mobile app, Suishoupai, has launched the character ""Little Pig Dodo"", which the Sina Weibo microblog has widely publicised. It encourages users of Douyin to switch to Suishoupai, and to switch their Peppa Pig fascination for a Dodo the pig. Thousands of users have subsequently registered, and posted pictures of themselves next to emojis of the state-approved pig.

"Suppliers fear Sainsbury's price squeezeA promise to slash consumer prices after Asda merger could hit suppliers hard, say industry groups.2h2 hours agoBusiness","Sainsbury's says its merger with Asda will give consumers better savings, but what about suppliers? Companies that supply products to Sainsbury's and Asda fear they could suffer when the two grocery chains merge. Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe haspledged to cut prices on everyday products by around 10%after the deal. But suppliers fear they will have to shoulder the cost of those savings. ""There will be plenty of losers from this,"" said Austin Sugarman, boss of Fine Foods International, a supplier of instant coffee based in Bedfordshire. ""If suppliers are going to have to come up with the savings, then we'll see consolidation in the supply base,"" he told the BBC. Austin Sugarman, head of Fine Foods International, believes many suppliers will lose out from the deal ""That means closing factories, that means losing people and it means effectively less choice for consumers."" Mr Coupe said the combined group's buying power would enable it to strike better deals with suppliers, and these savings would then be passed on to consumers. But industry bodies fear this will make life very difficult for smaller suppliers, who are already having to adapt to higher costs from auto-enrolment pensions and the Living Wage, as well as the weaker pound since the Brexit vote. Sainsbury's boss sorry for money song gaffe Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts ""We already operate in a very competitive retail environment,"" said Gordon Polson, director of the Federation of Bakers. ""We just don't see possibly how our products could be reduced any further."" Ian Cass, managing director of the Forum of Private Business agreed: ""If suppliers are asked to reduce prices by 10% to stay on the Sainsbury's-Asda supply chain, then some small companies could go out of business."" Mr Cass was concerned that the combined company - which will be Britain's biggest grocer - could seek to pressure suppliers into unfavourable terms by holding the threat of losing contracts over their heads. Suppliers fear a 10% reduction in shop prices would harm their businesses He cited Arcadia Group, which owns brands such as Topshop and Dorothy Perkins as an example.In January, the firm imposed a 2% discount on all current and existing orders from suppliers,externaldue to poor Christmas sales. On top of all these pressures, suppliers also have to contend with the fact that many retailers in the grocery industry make suppliers wait up to three months for payment. ""Surely there are other efficiencies you could make in partnership with suppliers, other than turning around and demanding a 10% discount,"" Mr Cass said. Sentinel Management Consultants acts as an adviser to suppliers on their negotiations with supermarkets. It said that while some suppliers will undoubtedly be ""quaking with fear"" after the Sainsbury's-Asda merger announcement, others will have more power to negotiate with the new firm than they realise. ""Suppliers need to get better at saying no,"" said Sentinel boss David Sables. An expert says Sainsbury's and Asda will be unable to convince major suppliers to offer more discounts ""Supermarkets don't want to have complaints from shoppers because their favourite crisps, biscuits, coffee or soap powder have come off the shelves."" Mr Sables said small businesses should make sure they understand their rights under the Groceries Supply Code of Practice, and also understand that supermarket chains tend to hold the threat of getting rid of suppliers as a bluff. ""There is a game being played about the demand for cheaper prices, and very often when suppliers have said no and they're walking away, nine times out of 10 that's the price they get the contract to supply at."" A Sainsbury's spokeswoman told the BBC that suppliers would benefit from the deal. ""At this stage, we are still in the early phases of our plans but we believe this is a great opportunity for suppliers as they will be able to make their supply chains more streamlined, to develop differentiated product ranges and to grow their businesses as we grow ours. ""We are also actively investing in small suppliers - we are recruiting a team which is dedicated to working with smaller and distinctive suppliers to help them bring new products to market and to handhold them through this process.""

Ahmad Shah, 29, had worked for the BBC Afghan service for more than a year. In a statement, BBC World Service Director Jamie Angus said Shah had been a ""respected and popular"" journalist. ""This is a devastating loss and I send my sincere condolences to Ahmad Shah's friends and family and the whole BBC News Afghan team,"" he said. ""We are doing all we can to support his family at this very difficult time."" Khost police chief Abdul Hanan told BBC Afghan that Shah had been shot by unidentified armed men. He said police were investigating the motive. Locals told the BBC that Shah had been on his bicycle when the attack happened. He was then taken to hospital, where he died of his injuries.
