"University pension boss's Â£82,000 pay rise","The pension scheme at the centre of a Â£6bn deficit row paid more than 100 of its own staff more than Â£100,000 The chief executive of the lecturers' pension scheme atthe centre of a university strikereceived a 17% pay rise worth an extra Â£82,000 this year. Bill Galvin's pay package had risen from Â£484,000 to Â£566,000, said a spokeswoman for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). Running costs for the university pension scheme were Â£125m per year - including two staff earning over Â£1m. Mr Galvin has described the pension scheme as ""excellent value"". Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, said: ""Whatever happens with this dispute, it is time for a proper look at what is happening with USS. ""Staff forced out on strike today will no doubt look at the salaries enjoyed by some of those in charge of the scheme and wonder what exactly they are doing to justify the salary and safeguard the pensions."" University employers have claimed there is a Â£6bn deficit in the pension scheme - and although unions have challenged the size of the shortfall, they say proposals to address the deficit will mean cutting their retirement income by Â£10,000 per year. The pension scheme is run by professional managers and a board including university leaders and representatives of the UCU union. Lecturers strike in pension dispute Emotions run high on the picket lines University strike: What's it all about? Students' compensation bid for university strike Strikes at Northern Ireland universities Among board members is Dame Glynis Breakwell, who announcedshe was stepping down as vice-chancellor of the University of Bathafter a dispute over excessive pay for senior university staff. University staff at Cambridge were part of the protest over pension cuts There had been complaints about ""fat cat"" salaries for senior staff while lecturers' pay had been capped, but the head of the lecturers' pension scheme this year received a 17% increase. The running costs of the pension scheme for the last year of accounts, ending March 2017, were Â£124.9m, an increase of more than Â£6m on the previous year. Staff costs were Â£61m, including two staff earning between Â£1m and Â£1.25m, with 113 staff earning more than Â£100,000 - 18 more than in the previous year. The numbers earning between Â£100,000 and Â£150,000 had almost doubled in a year, from 22 to 40, a further 21 staff were earning between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000 and five were earning between Â£400,000 and Â£450,000. Chief executive Bill Galvin, with salary and benefits worth Â£566,000, was not the highest paid, with the top earners thought to be investment staff. Mr Galvin, writing in the annual accounts, said that ""no doubt that overall, USS provides excellent value for money for the products and services we provide"". A spokeswoman for the Â£60bn university pension scheme said it offered ""above-average investment performance at below-average cost"". ""Our investment performance has been consistently good - reducing the contributions that would otherwise be required of members and employers. ""USS is focused on delivering value for its members and its investment costs, relative to assets under management,"" said the spokeswoman, who said the running costs of the scheme were Â£61m lower than its peers, according to independent benchmarking. Universities UK and the Department for Education said such costs were a matter for the pension scheme.

Neanderthals were capable of making art,"In Maltravieso Cave, western Spain, Neanderthals stencilled their hands by blowing red paint over them Contrary to the traditional view of them as brutes, it turns out that Neanderthals were artists. A study in Science journal,externalsuggests they made cave drawings in Spain that pre-date the arrival of modern humans in Europe by 20,000 years. They also appear to have used painted sea shells as jewellery. Art was previously thought to be a behaviour unique to our species (Homo sapiens) and far beyond our evolutionary cousins. The cave paintings include stencilled impressions of Neanderthal hands, geometric patterns and red circles. They occupy three sites at La Pasiega, Maltravieso and Ardales - situated up to 700km apart in different parts of Spain. The researchers used a technique called uranium-thorium dating to obtain accurate ages. It relies on measuring the radioactive decay of uranium that gets incorporated into mineral crusts forming over the paintings. The results gave a minimum age of 65,000 years ago for the cave art. Modern humans only arrived in Europe roughly 45,000 years ago. This suggests that the Palaeolithic artwork must have been made by Neanderthals, a ""sister"" species toHomo sapiens, and Europe's sole human inhabitants at the time. But, so far, the researchers have found only abstract expressions of art by Neanderthals. This ladder-shaped drawing from La Pasiega cave consists of red horizontal and vertical lines and is older than 64,000 years Prof Alistair Pike, from the University of Southampton, who is a co-author of the study, said: ""Soon after the discovery of the first of their fossils in the 19th Century, Neanderthals were portrayed as brutish and uncultured, incapable of art and symbolic behaviour, and some of these views persist today. ""The issue of just how human-like Neanderthals behaved is a hotly debated issue. Our findings will make a significant contribution to that debate."" Prof Chris Stringer, from London's Natural History Museum, who was not involved in the study, commented: ""Some previous claims for Neanderthal symbolic behaviour had dating uncertainties or lay within inferred overlaps between Neanderthals andHomo sapiens40-60,000 years ago, meaning that they could still be attributed to modern humans, or to the influence of modern humans on Neanderthal behaviour."" He said the new work ""seems to remove any doubts"" that Neanderthals were capable of symbolic or artistic expression. Prof Stringer explained: ""They further narrow any perceived behavioural gap between the Neanderthals and us."" But he said it could be argued there were still no clear examples of Neanderthal figurative art - artwork drawn from real sources, such as animals or people. Prof Pike told BBC News: ""The next big question is: 'did Neanderthals make figurative art? We've got hand stencils, we've got lots of red dots and we've got these lines. We want to know whether there are paintings of the kind of animals they were hunting."" In La Pasiega cave, in northern Spain, the researchers dated a ladder-shaped (scalariform) drawing to a minimum age of 64,800 years ago. However, the artwork from this cave has yielded dates of up to 80,000 years ago. There are animals painted within the rungs of the ladder, but the scientists haven't yet dated these - and they could be younger. ""Even different groups of modern humans were approaching art in different ways. So it's really about the meaning of your symbols,"" said Prof Pike. ""Just because they didn't paint animals, it doesn't mean they couldn't paint animals."" The early ages for the cave art are supported by the dating of sea shells that were perforated to be used on necklaces and are stained with pigments. Two of the four samples dated to about 115,000 years ago - again, much further back in time than the known presence of modern humans in the region. Commenting on the work, Prof Clive Finlayson, from the Gibraltar Museum, told BBC News:  ""The work is very good; there's nothing to fault the dates. He added:  ""It suggests they're much older than anything we know of from Europe or beyond the boundaries of Europe."" Ancient ""hashtag""? This engraving, in Gorham's Cave, Gibraltar, was reported in 2014. It may have been made by a Neanderthal In 2014, Prof Finlayson and colleagues reported the discovery of an engraving in Gorham's Cave, Gibraltar, that may have been carved by a Neanderthal. But the recent finds add to mounting evidence we have underestimated the intellectual capabilities of our evolutionary cousins. But he said: ""If we are going to be strict in our interpretations, that Neanderthals made these paintings is really inferred from the dates."" While there is no direct evidence of other human species in Iberia at this time, Prof Finlayson added: ""To pin it on Neanderthals is highly likely... but from my knowledge I don't think any of those three caves have Neanderthal remains."" Early symbolic artefacts, dating back 70,000 years, have been found in Africa but are associated with modern humans. Prof Pike said of the Spanish finds: ""Some of these things are placed in the very darkest bits of caves, where you couldn't do it by accident. You need a light source, you've got to wander through passages and you've got to prepare your pigments."" On the other hand, he said, ""the panel in La Pasiega is on a really nice, smooth bit of wall framed by stalagmitic formations on either side. It looks like something you would stand in front of and look at"". He added: ""As to the meaning, I don't think we'll ever know. But I think we're pretty happy to say it's meaningful.""

Gun control groups 'exploit' US tragedy,"This video can not be played Seven things the NRA blames after Florida The head of the most powerful gun lobby in the US has accused Democrats and media of ""exploiting"" a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead. Wayne LaPierre said ""opportunists"" were using the 14 February tragedy to expand gun control and abolish US gun rights. Mr LaPierre's comments came during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump suggested teachers could receive bonuses for carrying guns. NRA under fire for Parks and Rec gif Lawmaker: Many mass shooters are Democrats 'Arm me with anything but a gun' ""As usual, the opportunists waited not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain,"" said Mr LaPierre, who is head of the National Rifle Association (NRA). ""They hate the NRA. They hate the second amendment. They hate individual freedom,"" he said, referring to the second amendment in the US constitution, which governs the ""right to keep and bear arms"". Separately, it has emerged that an armed guard who was at the school during the shooting stood outside the building where the attack was taking place and did not go in to confront the gunman. Scot Peterson, the school resource officer, has now resigned after being suspended, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. ""I am devastated. Sick to my stomach. He never went in,"" Sheriff Israel said.He was quoted by the Miami Herald,external. This video can not be played Florida shooting: Why the NRA wields so much power Mr LaPierre's comments were the gun lobby's first more than a week after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Mr LaPierre lambasted the FBI for failing to follow up on a tip about the former student suspected of carrying out the attack. He also criticised America's ""European-style socialists"" for urging gun control. In Florida aftermath, US students say 'Never Again' After Florida, some owners give up guns Six radical ways to stop US school shootings ""They don't care if their laws work or not,"" said Mr LaPierre. ""They just want to get more laws to get more control over people. But the NRA, the NRA does care."" Survivors of last week's deadly shooting have called for stricter gun laws, prompting the nationwide activist movement #NeverAgain. Mr LaPierre accused Democrats of trying to smear the NRA.

Mr LaPierre reiterated the NRA's backing for the proposal of arming teachers. He said the NRA would help any US school with their safety and security, free of charge. This video can not be played Teacher at Florida school where 17 people died says arming some teachers would be wrong ""Evil walks among us and God help us if we don't harden our schools and protect our kids,"" he said. But Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers union, disagreed. ""Anyone who wants guns in schools has no understanding of what goes on inside them - or worse, doesn't care,"" she said. The US president has stepped up his calls for teachers to be armed, a day after he floated the proposal at a White House event to hear from survivors of the Florida school shooting. Discussing school safety with state and local officials on Thursday, he said: ""Shooters won't walk into a school if 20% of people have guns."" America's gun culture in 10 charts Mr Trump added: ""What I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus. We give them a little bit of a bonus."" The president also said he supports raising the age at which a person can buy a gun from 18 to 21, insisting the NRA would back such a proposal. Allow Twitter content?

""I don't think I'll be going up against them,"" Mr Trump said of the gun lobby. ""They're good people."" Mr Trump also took to Twitter to push for national background checks for the mentally ill, a policy which the NRA chief later echoed at the conference. ""Anyone adjudicated as mentally incompetent or dangerous to society should be prevented from getting a gun,"" said Mr Trump. This video can not be played Victim's father tells Trump of rage Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On the first day of CPAC, the NRA had an uninterrupted hour to offer its response to Parkland - and respond it did. In a one-two punch, Dana Loesch and Wayne LaPierre launched a blistering attack against the mainstream media, the FBI and pro-gun-control Democratic politicians. The media ""love mass shootings"" because of the ratings, Ms Loesch said. The FBI rank-and-file should rise up against a ""corrupt"" senior staff that has failed to stop mass shooters, Mr LaPierre railed. Democrats, he said, ""hate individual freedom"". This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? The rhetoric may be an effort to reshape a firearm debate that, over the past week, has shifted towards calls for bans on so-called assault weapons and the emergence of students seeking action on gun control. The NRA would prefer this to be a conversation about media bias, ""European socialist"" Democrats and an FBI that has lately become a conservative bogeyman. When it comes to policy proposals, turning schools into ""hard targets"" with armed teachers and airtight security is the preferred option. The NRA has a vast political war chest and a president who views it as a loyal ally.  It has been down this road before - after Columbine, Newtown and other school shootings.

Ministers conclude crunch Brexit talks,"Theresa May and 11 senior ministers have been thrashing out the UK's approach to Brexit in an eight-hour discussion at the PM's country retreat. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said everyone is said to have left Chequers happy implying ""baby steps forwards not a huge breakthrough"". The PM will set out the position in a speech next week, after a discussion by the full cabinet. There have been clear differences between ministers over the way forward. But Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told the prime minister had ""played a blinder"" and persuaded Brexiteers to shift their position. However, a cabinet Brexiteer source had said ""divergence has won the day"" with mutual recognition between the UK and EU on goods in future, rather than the UK being forced to stick to EU rules.

Brexit: All you need to know ""What I can say to you is the outcome of those discussions will come to cabinet in the next few days, and late next week the prime minister will make a statement, a speech and outline what that position is."" Pressed on whether everyone in the cabinet would agree with it, he replied: ""Absolutely, yes."" Official cars make they way towards Chequers near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire The Brexit sub-committee includes key figures such as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond, who were on opposite sides of the EU referendum argument in 2016. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister and cabinet ministers met at Chequers for eight hours. ""They held discussions including about the automotive sector led by Greg Clark, agrifood led by Michael Gove, digital trade by Liam Fox and a discussion on the overall future economic partnership that was led by the prime minister.""

Documents suggest European Commission negotiators will not approve of a UK proposal that seeks to select which EU rules to stick to post-Brexit and which to diverge from. Slidespublished online,externalby the commission say such an approach would be ""not compatible with the principles"" set out in the EU's own guidelines and posed a risk to the ""proper functioning"" of its single market. But an EU diplomat told the BBC ""we are hoping for a relationship that is as close as possible to the existing relationship"", adding that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier should be given a mandate ""to explore all possibilities"". Before the final arrangements with the EU kick in, a temporary transition period is planned - although the details have yet to be negotiated. On Wednesday, the UK set out its plans for how this ""status quo"" transition phase should work. The document suggests the UK will abide by new EU laws and be involved in talks on future fishing quotas, but will not be able to sign trade deals without the EU's permission. It also says the period should last as long as it takes to ""prepare and implement the new processes and new systems"". No 10 denied this meant it would be longer than the planned two years. But Sir Bill Cash, chairman of the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, warned that the UK could face an extra Â£4bn-Â£5bn Brexit ""divorce bill"" if the post-withdraw transition period extends beyond the EU's preferred end date of 31 December 2020. He said that the current Â£35-39bn agreement was intended to cover to the end of the current EU budget period at the end of 2020. For Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would like to see ""a customs union"" option on the table, which would ""solve some of the issues around Northern Ireland"" and enable the UK to influence future trade negotiations. Taking questions after a speech in London, he also said Labour would rather have a general election than a second referendum on Britain's EU membership because ""there needs to be a wider debate"" about the UK's future relationship with Europe. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry also told LBC that while Brexit meant the UK could not be in the customs union, a new agreement was needed: ""That we think is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union."" It could mean the PM faces the prospect of a Commons rebellion as Conservative MP Anna Soubry said she had cross-party support for an amendment to the trade bill, calling for the government to form ""a"" customs union with the EU after Brexit.

Fourth Briton dies after helicopter crash,"A fourth British tourist has died following a helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon 12 days ago while on his honeymoon. Jonathan Udall, who was in his 30s and from Brighton, had been in hospital in Las Vegas since the accident on 10 February. His family has been told of his death. A spokesperson for his employer Yorkshire Building Society said they were ""deeply shocked"" by the death of a ""well-known and well-loved colleague"". Mr Udall's wife, Ellie Milward, 29, was injured when the aircraft crashed in the remote Quartermaster Canyon and remains in a critical condition. Stuart Hill, 30, and his girlfriend Becky Dobson, 27, and brother Jason, 32, from Worthing, West Sussex, died. Another Briton, Jennifer Barham, 39, and the pilot Scott Booth, 42, were also injured. A message posted on Thursday on a crowdfunding page set up to help Mr Udall and Ms Milward, reads: ""It is with a very heavy heart that I must type this. ""Our good friend Jon Udall has succumb to his injuries. He was strong, brave and I will never forget him. Ellie is critical and is continuing to fight."" Both Mr Udall and Ms Milward were friends with the other Britons in the helicopter. Ms Milward also worked at Yorkshire Building Society and the company's chief executive Mike Regnier said support was being offered to employees. ""We're all deeply shocked and saddened by [Mr Udall's] death,"" said Mr Regnier. ""We are in touch with his and Ellie's families and send them our deepest condolences. We hope to hear positive news about Ellie soon. ""We are offering colleagues, who are obviously shaken by this news, support at this upsetting time."" Stuart (left) and Jason Hill also died in the crash The Eurocopter (now Airbus) EC130 helicopter had spun out of control as it came in to land before crashing and catching fire. The crash is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board but an initial report indicates possible causes could include a mechanical problem and gusty winds. The chief of the Hualapai Police, Francis Bradley, had described the terrain as ""extremely rugged"". He said the rescue efforts had been hampered by severe weather conditions and gusts of up to 50mph (80 km/h). Jason and Stuart Hill and Ms Dobson, who had been in the US for Stuart's 30th birthday, died at the scene. Becky Dobson was on holiday to celebrate her boyfriend's 30th birthday Jason Hill worked as a corporate lawyer for Shoosmiths in its Milton Keynes office. Stuart Hill was a salesman at a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Brighton, East Sussex, while his girlfriend Ms Dobson, worked as a veterinary receptionist for Vets 4 Pets in Worthing. The helicopter company involved - Papillon Airways - calls itself ""the world's largest aerial sightseeing company"" and says it flies more than 600,000 people a year.

Gun control groups 'exploit' US tragedyThe head of America's powerful gun lobby says Democrats are putting politics ahead of school safety.,"This video can not be played Seven things the NRA blames after Florida The head of the most powerful gun lobby in the US has accused Democrats and media of ""exploiting"" a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead. Wayne LaPierre said ""opportunists"" were using the 14 February tragedy to expand gun control and abolish US gun rights. Mr LaPierre's comments came during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump suggested teachers could receive bonuses for carrying guns. NRA under fire for Parks and Rec gif Lawmaker: Many mass shooters are Democrats 'Arm me with anything but a gun' ""As usual, the opportunists waited not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain,"" said Mr LaPierre, who is head of the National Rifle Association (NRA). ""They hate the NRA. They hate the second amendment. They hate individual freedom,"" he said, referring to the second amendment in the US constitution, which governs the ""right to keep and bear arms"". Separately, it has emerged that an armed guard who was at the school during the shooting stood outside the building where the attack was taking place and did not go in to confront the gunman. Scot Peterson, the school resource officer, has now resigned after being suspended, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. ""I am devastated. Sick to my stomach. He never went in,"" Sheriff Israel said.He was quoted by the Miami Herald,external. This video can not be played Florida shooting: Why the NRA wields so much power Mr LaPierre's comments were the gun lobby's first more than a week after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Mr LaPierre lambasted the FBI for failing to follow up on a tip about the former student suspected of carrying out the attack. He also criticised America's ""European-style socialists"" for urging gun control. In Florida aftermath, US students say 'Never Again' After Florida, some owners give up guns Six radical ways to stop US school shootings ""They don't care if their laws work or not,"" said Mr LaPierre. ""They just want to get more laws to get more control over people. But the NRA, the NRA does care."" Survivors of last week's deadly shooting have called for stricter gun laws, prompting the nationwide activist movement #NeverAgain. Mr LaPierre accused Democrats of trying to smear the NRA.

Mr LaPierre reiterated the NRA's backing for the proposal of arming teachers. He said the NRA would help any US school with their safety and security, free of charge. This video can not be played Teacher at Florida school where 17 people died says arming some teachers would be wrong ""Evil walks among us and God help us if we don't harden our schools and protect our kids,"" he said. But Randi Weingarten, president of the 1.7 million-member American Federation of Teachers union, disagreed. ""Anyone who wants guns in schools has no understanding of what goes on inside them - or worse, doesn't care,"" she said. The US president has stepped up his calls for teachers to be armed, a day after he floated the proposal at a White House event to hear from survivors of the Florida school shooting. Discussing school safety with state and local officials on Thursday, he said: ""Shooters won't walk into a school if 20% of people have guns."" America's gun culture in 10 charts Mr Trump added: ""What I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus. We give them a little bit of a bonus."" The president also said he supports raising the age at which a person can buy a gun from 18 to 21, insisting the NRA would back such a proposal. Allow Twitter content?

""I don't think I'll be going up against them,"" Mr Trump said of the gun lobby. ""They're good people."" Mr Trump also took to Twitter to push for national background checks for the mentally ill, a policy which the NRA chief later echoed at the conference. ""Anyone adjudicated as mentally incompetent or dangerous to society should be prevented from getting a gun,"" said Mr Trump. This video can not be played Victim's father tells Trump of rage Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On the first day of CPAC, the NRA had an uninterrupted hour to offer its response to Parkland - and respond it did. In a one-two punch, Dana Loesch and Wayne LaPierre launched a blistering attack against the mainstream media, the FBI and pro-gun-control Democratic politicians. The media ""love mass shootings"" because of the ratings, Ms Loesch said. The FBI rank-and-file should rise up against a ""corrupt"" senior staff that has failed to stop mass shooters, Mr LaPierre railed. Democrats, he said, ""hate individual freedom"". This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? The rhetoric may be an effort to reshape a firearm debate that, over the past week, has shifted towards calls for bans on so-called assault weapons and the emergence of students seeking action on gun control. The NRA would prefer this to be a conversation about media bias, ""European socialist"" Democrats and an FBI that has lately become a conservative bogeyman. When it comes to policy proposals, turning schools into ""hard targets"" with armed teachers and airtight security is the preferred option. The NRA has a vast political war chest and a president who views it as a loyal ally.  It has been down this road before - after Columbine, Newtown and other school shootings.

"M1 crash driver 'twice drink-drive limit'The crash which killed eight people who were in a minibus was ""entirely avoidable"", a court hears.6h6 hours agoBeds, Herts & Bucks","Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash during the August Bank Holiday weekend A lorry driver was twice the drink-drive limit and another was on a hands-free call in cruise control when they were involved in a motorway crash which killed eight people, a court has heard. The two lorries collided with a minibus on the M1 near Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on 26 August. Ryszard Masierak, 32, and David Wagstaff, 54, face eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The lorry drivers are on trial at Reading Crown Court. The two men are also charged with four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, and Mr Masierak faces an additional charge of drink-driving. David Wagstaff (left) and Ryszard Masierak are charged with death by dangerous driving Prosecutor Oliver Saxby told the court the crash was ""entirely avoidable"". The jury heard Polish national Mr Masierak had stopped in lane one at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. Minibus driver Cyriac Joseph was waiting with his hazard lights on to go around the lorry when Mr Wagstaff ploughed into the back of the van forcing it into and under Mr Masierak's vehicle. Mr Joseph and seven of his passengers were killed in the crash on the Bank Holiday weekend. They were on their way to London to catch a coach to Disneyland Paris. CCTV footage of the minutes leading up to the collision and of the crash were shown to the jury. Mr Saxby said the sound had been removed to spare them the ""acute horror of what occurred"". He added it was important for the jury to see the footage so they could evaluate the standard of driving of both defendants. The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph Mr Saxby said the ""catastrophic and tragic"" collision was ""caused by the driving of these two defendants"". ""In Mr Masierak's case, under the influence of alcohol, parking up in the slowlane of the M1, an act as flagrant as it was dangerous. ""And in Mr Wagstaff's case, on a hands-free call completely failing to notice what was ahead of him, inattention on a gross scale."" The court heard Mr Wagstaff did not brake or decelerate before ploughing into Mr Joseph's minibus. Mr Masierak, of Barnards Close in Evesham, Worcestershire, and Mr Wagstaff, of Derwent Street in Stoke-on-Trent, both deny all charges against them. The trial continues.

Rising number of EU nationals leaving UK,"The number of EU citizens leaving the UK is at its highest level for a decade with 130,000 emigrating in the year to September,figures show.,external But far more EU nationals (220,000) moved to the UK in the same period, the Office for National Statistics found. It means net EU migration - the difference between arrivals and departures - was 90,000, the lowest for five years. The ONS said Brexit could be a factor in people's decisions to move. Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said migration was complicated and could be influenced by lots of different reasons. The figures also show that more British people are emigrating than are returning to live in the UK. Of those EU nationals arriving in the UK, fewer were coming for ""work-related reasons"", in particular to ""look for work"". By contrast, immigration from countries outside the European Union is going up which means the UK population is continuing to grow at a similar level to early 2014. Some 285,000 non-EU citizens arrived in the UK in the 12-month period to September, and 80,000 departed. This gives a net increase of 205,000, the highest for six years. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said this was largely driven by more people coming to study in the UK and an uncharacteristic dip in the previous year's figures that may have been corrected. He also speculated whether firms were starting to struggle to recruit or retain people from the EU, forcing them to look outside the EU. Overall, net migration is estimated to have fallen by 29,000 to 244,000 in the same period. This includes 73,000 British people coming back to the UK and 125,000 Britons leaving. The overall net migration figure is still well short of the government's target to reduce net migration to below 100,000, a pledge made in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 Tory manifestos. By home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw What explanation could there be for the decline in EU migration other than Brexit?  In the two years before the June 2016 referendum, the number of EU nationals arriving in Britain was stable at about 240,000 to 280,000. But every quarter since then has recorded falls, from 284,000 to 220,000. At the same time, the number of EU leavers, which hadn't risen higher than 100,000 since 2010, began to rise, from 95,000 to 130,000. Whether it's a feeling that EU citizens aren't wanted in the UK, uncertainty about their future or the growing relative strength of other EU economies, there has been a notable shift away from Britain's shores. Nevertheless, overall net migration remains at historically high levels, well above the government's controversial target, with a rise in migration from outside Europe. Caroline Nokes, immigration minister, said the latest figures demonstrated that the UK was still attracting the ""brightest and best people"" to come to work and study and described the increase in the number of overseas students as a ""huge positive"". ""We are a country that is open for business,"" she added. ""We want to have great relations with our European neighbours going forward but at the same time we need to have a sustainable migration system,"" she said. Asked whether falling numbers would adversely affect some sectors, in particular the NHS, Ms Nokes said the independent migration advisory committee was due to report its findings on EU patterns to the government in September so decisions could be made based on evidence.

""This deficit hurts us all and highlights the immigration mess the government has created,"" she said. The ONS figures also show that in 2017, the UK granted asylum, alternative forms of protection or resettlement to almost 15,000 people, 40% of whom were under 18. Separate figures from the Home Office showedmore than 10,500 people have been granted refuge in the UK after fleeing the conflict in Syria, under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement scheme. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who is in Lebanon near the Syrian border, said the government was considering extending its commitment to rehome 20,000 people by 2020. This video can not be played ""The UK has given us everything... but we miss our country"" Other figures from the Home Office,externalshow there were 141,302 applications made for British citizenship in 2017, an increase of 8% on the previous year. This was 39% lower than the peak of 232,262 in 2013. There is evidence that more EU citizens, who have settled in the UK, are applying for citizenship, with applications more than doubling from 15,460 in 2016 to 38,528 in 2017.

Kylie Jenner tweet costs Snap $1.5bn,"Reality TV star Kylie Jenner wiped $1.3bn (Â£1bn) off Snap's stock market value after tweeting that she no longer used its Snapchat messaging app. Celebrity Kim Kardashian's half-sister posted: ""sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad."" Snap's shares sank after Ms Jenner's tweet about Snapchat's re-design to her 24.5 million Twitter followers. One million people signed a petitiondemanding Snap roll back the change. After dropping almost 8%, shares in Snap closed 6% down on Wall Street, and are now back near the $17 price at which the shares were listed when the company floated on the stock market in March of last year. Snapchat is facing intense competition from Facebook's Instagram - especially for celebrity users - and Ms Jenner's attack comes at a time when investors are already worried. Even before Ms Jenner's Tweet, shares had been sliding. This week, analysts at Citi also downgraded the stock, pointing to the negative reaction to the redesign. Ms Jenner later tweeted a follow-up: ""still love you tho snap... my first love"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Snap has rejected complaints about November's re-design to its messaging app, with its boss Evan Spiegel saying earlier this month that users just needed time to get used to it. Mr Spiegel had something to soften the blow, though, with news on Thursday that his total pay last year was a staggering $637.8m. It is thought to be the third-highest annual package ever received by a company's chief executive. The market just doesn't know what to think of Snap or its Snapchat service. It is either the future of communication - or a social media fad that will last not much longer than one of the messages its army of young users sends. And that makes a share price which has mostly been built on a very optimistic view of future growth extremely volatile. Earlier this month it soared by nearly 50% on results that were marginally better than expected - now they've taken a minor tumble because a reality star says the new design is ""so sad"". Investors will continue to need strong stomachs - especially when they see how much founder Evan Spiegel is taking home. Kylie Jenner is not the first celebrity to move markets. In October 2015, TV host Oprah Winfrey bought a 10% stake in Weight Watchers, endorsing the firm publically at the same time. Investors saw their shares rise by 92% over successive weeks. Michelle Obama was responsible for the ""Michelle mark-up"" When the former First Lady, Michelle Obama, turned up to an event wearing Versace or another designer brand, Wall Street noted the immediate effect on share prices. They dubbed it the ""Michelle mark-up"". Snapchat's shares have been particularly volatile since the company went public last year, with investor profits sometimes evaporating as fast as pictures and messages disappear from the site. The shares plunged by 17% in August, after disappointing results. But in the first weeks of this month shares bounced back by almost 50% after Snapchat reported a 72% rise in sales in the last quarter of 2017, with no fewer than 187 million people using the site every day. ""Part of the problem is Snap isn't profitable at the moment, so there's a fair amount of hope for the future already baked into the share price, making it particularly vulnerable to swings in sentiment,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Snap's future rests on building user numbers, so anything which could undermine that journey is naturally going to unsettle investors.""

Russia casts doubt on UN Syria truce deal,"This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes The UN Security Council is struggling to agree a resolution seeking a ceasefire in Syria and has put back a vote until Saturday. The vote has already been delayed several times since Thursday. Russia wanted changes to a draft that calls for a 30-day calm to allow for aid deliveries and medical evacuations. Western diplomats have accused Russia, Syria's key ally, of stalling for time. France said failure to act may spell the end of the UN itself. Minds have been focused amid outrage at the plight of civilians in the Eastern Ghouta rebel enclave. Activists say 462 people have now been killed there this week. Warplanes maintained the bombardment on Friday, witnesses said. Douma and Hamouriyeh were among areas hit. Western powers suspect that Moscow wants to give Syria time to deal a final blow to forces defending the rebel-held enclave on the edge of Damascus. The United States, the UK and France had called for the resolution to be approved without delay. UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura said a truce had to be followed by immediate, unhindered access to the Eastern Ghouta. Commenting on Friday evening, US President Donald Trump pointed the finger of blame firmly at Syria and its allies, Russia and Iran, for the humanitarian crisis. ""What those three countries have done to people over the last, short period of time is a disgrace,"" he said, speaking alongside the visiting Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Washington. The draft, put forward by Kuwait and Sweden, calls for a nationwide truce to go into effect 72 hours after the resolution is passed. Medical evacuations and aid deliveries would start 48 hours after that. The draft says 5.6 million people in 1,244 communities across the country are in acute need. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Sweden's UN ambassador Olof Skoog told the BBC that getting aid to the Eastern Ghouta, where conditions were described by the UN secretary general as ""hell on earth"", was the main objective. ""I think that without the pressure coming from a united Security Council things are not happening the way they should on the ground,"" he said. ""So I think for the council it's a little bit less about the details and more about giving a political pressure to ensure that this happens."" Already overwhelmed hospitals are struggling to cope with the influx of casualties France's UN ambassador FranÃ§ois Delattre said the UN's inability to help Syrian civilians would result in a devastating loss of credibility. ""The Syrian tragedy must not also become a graveyard for the United Nations,"" he added. The draft resolution also calls for all parties to avoid establishing military positions in civilian areas, including schools and hospitals. Sieges of populated areas should be lifted. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote a joint letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to back the resolution. Under the terms of the draft resolution, any ceasefire would not apply to the Islamic State group, or the Nusra Front - formerly al-Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says it must go further and exclude other groups ""co-operating with them"" and which have shelled Damascus. This could include the two biggest rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta - Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman. Faylaq al-Rahman has in the past fought alongside the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of factions led by the Nusra Front. Mr Lavrov told reporters his country would be prepared to vote for the ceasefire under certain conditions. ""There are no guarantees that [the rebels] will not continue shooting at Damascus residential areas,"" he told a briefing. He said Russia had proposed ""a formula which would make the ceasefire real"". The Su-57, Russia's most advanced fighter plane, has been sent to Syria Meanwhile, two of Russia's most advanced fighter planes, Su-57s, have been sent to its coastal Hmeimim airbase, Russian military sources told BBC Russian. The sources said the stealth fighter planes were still undergoing flight tests and there was no confirmation they had yet been used in combat. For the sixth day running, Syrian government forces have pounded the Eastern Ghouta. A witness in Douma speaking to Reuters news agency early on Friday said the bombing there was the most intense so far. Syrian state TV says rebels have shelled Damascus, killing one and injuring dozens more. The US has also accused Russia of attacking Ghouta,external, allegations that Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed as ""groundless"". The number killed since Sunday in the Eastern Ghouta has risen to 462, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group says, at least 99 of them children.

M1 crash driver 'twice drink-drive limit',"Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash during the August Bank Holiday weekend A lorry driver was twice the drink-drive limit and another was on a hands-free call in cruise control when they were involved in a motorway crash which killed eight people, a court has heard. The two lorries collided with a minibus on the M1 near Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on 26 August. Ryszard Masierak, 32, and David Wagstaff, 54, face eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The lorry drivers are on trial at Reading Crown Court. The two men are also charged with four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, and Mr Masierak faces an additional charge of drink-driving. David Wagstaff (left) and Ryszard Masierak are charged with death by dangerous driving Prosecutor Oliver Saxby told the court the crash was ""entirely avoidable"". The jury heard Polish national Mr Masierak had stopped in lane one at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. Minibus driver Cyriac Joseph was waiting with his hazard lights on to go around the lorry when Mr Wagstaff ploughed into the back of the van forcing it into and under Mr Masierak's vehicle. Mr Joseph and seven of his passengers were killed in the crash on the Bank Holiday weekend. They were on their way to London to catch a coach to Disneyland Paris. CCTV footage of the minutes leading up to the collision and of the crash were shown to the jury. Mr Saxby said the sound had been removed to spare them the ""acute horror of what occurred"". He added it was important for the jury to see the footage so they could evaluate the standard of driving of both defendants. The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph Mr Saxby said the ""catastrophic and tragic"" collision was ""caused by the driving of these two defendants"". ""In Mr Masierak's case, under the influence of alcohol, parking up in the slowlane of the M1, an act as flagrant as it was dangerous. ""And in Mr Wagstaff's case, on a hands-free call completely failing to notice what was ahead of him, inattention on a gross scale."" The court heard Mr Wagstaff did not brake or decelerate before ploughing into Mr Joseph's minibus. Mr Masierak, of Barnards Close in Evesham, Worcestershire, and Mr Wagstaff, of Derwent Street in Stoke-on-Trent, both deny all charges against them. The trial continues.

May holds crunch Brexit talks at Chequers,"Theresa May and 11 senior ministers have been thrashing out the UK's approach to Brexit in an eight-hour discussion at the PM's country retreat. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said everyone is said to have left Chequers happy implying ""baby steps forwards not a huge breakthrough"". The PM will set out the position in a speech next week, after a discussion by the full cabinet. There have been clear differences between ministers over the way forward. But Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told the prime minister had ""played a blinder"" and persuaded Brexiteers to shift their position. However, a cabinet Brexiteer source had said ""divergence has won the day"" with mutual recognition between the UK and EU on goods in future, rather than the UK being forced to stick to EU rules.

Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said on BBC Question Time the cabinet would agree on the Brexit position, following the Chequers talks. Laura Kuenssberg - a happy ending? UK publishes transition plans Labour's policy 'evolves' on customs union What will Brexit mean for Britain's overseas territories? Brexit: All you need to know ""What I can say to you is the outcome of those discussions will come to cabinet in the next few days, and late next week the prime minister will make a statement, a speech and outline what that position is."" Pressed on whether everyone in the cabinet would agree with it, he replied: ""Absolutely, yes."" Official cars make they way towards Chequers near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire The Brexit sub-committee includes key figures such as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond, who were on opposite sides of the EU referendum argument in 2016. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister and cabinet ministers met at Chequers for eight hours. ""They held discussions including about the automotive sector led by Greg Clark, agrifood led by Michael Gove, digital trade by Liam Fox and a discussion on the overall future economic partnership that was led by the prime minister."" Chief Whip Julian Smith and senior UK diplomats Tim Barrow and Ed Llewellyn were among those present, alongside the cabinet's Brexit sub-committee. Cream of sweetcorn soup with a ham hock croquette Guinness short rib of Dexter Beef with onions and parsnip mash Lemon tart with raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries Mrs May still has to get any agreement through the whole cabinet on Tuesday, through her party - and then through 27 other EU member states. Documents suggest European Commission negotiators will not approve of a UK proposal that seeks to select which EU rules to stick to post-Brexit and which to diverge from. Slidespublished online,externalby the commission say such an approach would be ""not compatible with the principles"" set out in the EU's own guidelines and posed a risk to the ""proper functioning"" of its single market. But an EU diplomat told the BBC ""we are hoping for a relationship that is as close as possible to the existing relationship"", adding that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier should be given a mandate ""to explore all possibilities"". Before the final arrangements with the EU kick in, a temporary transition period is planned - although the details have yet to be negotiated. On Wednesday, the UK set out its plans for how this ""status quo"" transition phase should work. The document suggests the UK will abide by new EU laws and be involved in talks on future fishing quotas, but will not be able to sign trade deals without the EU's permission. It also says the period should last as long as it takes to ""prepare and implement the new processes and new systems"". No 10 denied this meant it would be longer than the planned two years. But Sir Bill Cash, chairman of the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, warned that the UK could face an extra Â£4bn-Â£5bn Brexit ""divorce bill"" if the post-withdraw transition period extends beyond the EU's preferred end date of 31 December 2020. He said that the current Â£35-39bn agreement was intended to cover to the end of the current EU budget period at the end of 2020. For Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would like to see ""a customs union"" option on the table, which would ""solve some of the issues around Northern Ireland"" and enable the UK to influence future trade negotiations. Taking questions after a speech in London, he also said Labour would rather have a general election than a second referendum on Britain's EU membership because ""there needs to be a wider debate"" about the UK's future relationship with Europe. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry also told LBC that while Brexit meant the UK could not be in the customs union, a new agreement was needed: ""That we think is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union."" It could mean the PM faces the prospect of a Commons rebellion as Conservative MP Anna Soubry said she had cross-party support for an amendment to the trade bill, calling for the government to form ""a"" customs union with the EU after Brexit.

Couple filmed on TV being evicted win payout,"The programme has run for five series to date Channel 5 has been ordered to pay a couple Â£10,000 each for the distress of broadcasting them being evicted. Shakar Ali and his wife Shahida Aslam, from Barking, east London, were filmed by Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away after they fell into arrears on rent. Mr Ali did not give consent for the footage to be used on TV, but it was not only shown but repeated 35 times. The High Court ruled the couple's privacy outweighed Channel 5's right to freedom of expression. Mr Justice Arnold awarded the damages for distress caused in the filming and misuse of the couple's private information. Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away is a long-running series that follows the work of a team of High Court enforcement officers. In 2015, Mr Ali, 52, and Mrs Aslam, 49, were filmed by a TV crew and High Court officers who were wearing body cameras, whilst they were evicted from their home. Mr Ali had fallen behind on rental payments for the house, which he shared with his wife and two children, as he recovered from a heart condition and a badly injured foot. The owner of the property had obtained a court order for repossession, and used a team of enforcement officers to carry out the eviction. The court officers were joined by a TV crew who entered the house filming the couple's reaction, and filmed in their children's bedrooms. Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away was first broadcast on Channel 5 in 2014 During the eviction the landlord's son was seen to be ""taunting"" Mr Ali and complaining about how much money the rent arrears and eviction order had cost his family. Despite Mr Ali asking the enforcement officers and the film crew why they were filming, no-one explained who the film crew were or why they were there. Mr Ali did not give his consent to the filming but editors at Channel 5 went ahead with the broadcast as planned. The programme was ultimately broadcast 36 times on Channel 5 and its sister channels. It was also available to view online. The total cumulative audience was said to be 9.65 million people, but this would have included repeat viewers. Mr Ali also contacted the production company after the eviction and before the programme was first shown to ask for it not to be broadcast. Mr Justice Arnold ruled that, despite Channel 5's claims that Mr Ali had provided his consent by talking to the producers and enforcement officers during the eviction, ""he unequivocally withdrew that consent"" when he asked for the programme not to be shown. Mr Ali claimed that the programme ""showed them at their lowest ebb.... in a state of shock and very distressed... [and] caused them significant loss of dignity"". Channel 5 argued that under ""freedom of expression"" laws they were entitled to show what happened during the eviction. However, the judge said that the Ali family had a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" and that the ""focus of the programme was not upon the matters of public interest, but upon the drama of the conflict"" between the family and the landlord's son. The judge ruled the family's right to privacy outweighed the documentary maker's right to freedom of expression. Christopher Hutchings, who represented the family, said the ruling was ""one of the first legal actions"" arising from ""an observational documentary"". He added: ""[The] judgement will inevitably have wider ramifications for those broadcasting film of a similar kind."" Channel 5 said it welcomed the judge's assessment, which recognised the show was ""made in good faith and in the public interest"". A spokesman added the case only related to ""a segment involving the Ali family and not the series in general"".

Kylie Jenner tweet costs Snap $1.5bnShares in Snapchat's owner sink after the reality TV star tweets her criticism of the messaging app.8m8 minutes agoBusiness,"Reality TV star Kylie Jenner wiped $1.3bn (Â£1bn) off Snap's stock market value after tweeting that she no longer used its Snapchat messaging app. Celebrity Kim Kardashian's half-sister posted: ""sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad."" Snap's shares sank after Ms Jenner's tweet about Snapchat's re-design to her 24.5 million Twitter followers. One million people signed a petitiondemanding Snap roll back the change. After dropping almost 8%, shares in Snap closed 6% down on Wall Street, and are now back near the $17 price at which the shares were listed when the company floated on the stock market in March of last year. Snapchat is facing intense competition from Facebook's Instagram - especially for celebrity users - and Ms Jenner's attack comes at a time when investors are already worried. Even before Ms Jenner's Tweet, shares had been sliding. This week, analysts at Citi also downgraded the stock, pointing to the negative reaction to the redesign. Ms Jenner later tweeted a follow-up: ""still love you tho snap... my first love"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Snap has rejected complaints about November's re-design to its messaging app, with its boss Evan Spiegel saying earlier this month that users just needed time to get used to it. Mr Spiegel had something to soften the blow, though, with news on Thursday that his total pay last year was a staggering $637.8m. It is thought to be the third-highest annual package ever received by a company's chief executive. The market just doesn't know what to think of Snap or its Snapchat service. It is either the future of communication - or a social media fad that will last not much longer than one of the messages its army of young users sends. And that makes a share price which has mostly been built on a very optimistic view of future growth extremely volatile. Earlier this month it soared by nearly 50% on results that were marginally better than expected - now they've taken a minor tumble because a reality star says the new design is ""so sad"". Investors will continue to need strong stomachs - especially when they see how much founder Evan Spiegel is taking home. Kylie Jenner is not the first celebrity to move markets. In October 2015, TV host Oprah Winfrey bought a 10% stake in Weight Watchers, endorsing the firm publically at the same time. Investors saw their shares rise by 92% over successive weeks. Michelle Obama was responsible for the ""Michelle mark-up"" When the former First Lady, Michelle Obama, turned up to an event wearing Versace or another designer brand, Wall Street noted the immediate effect on share prices. They dubbed it the ""Michelle mark-up"". Snapchat's shares have been particularly volatile since the company went public last year, with investor profits sometimes evaporating as fast as pictures and messages disappear from the site. The shares plunged by 17% in August, after disappointing results. But in the first weeks of this month shares bounced back by almost 50% after Snapchat reported a 72% rise in sales in the last quarter of 2017, with no fewer than 187 million people using the site every day. ""Part of the problem is Snap isn't profitable at the moment, so there's a fair amount of hope for the future already baked into the share price, making it particularly vulnerable to swings in sentiment,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Snap's future rests on building user numbers, so anything which could undermine that journey is naturally going to unsettle investors.""

Kendrick's drug lyrics muted at BritsITV censored parts of Kendrick Lamar's songs at the Brit Awards - but it wasn't because of swearing.5h5 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"Lamar's performance came after he was named best international male solo artist Brit Awards,externalviewers were left baffled after parts of rap star Kendrick Lamar's performance were muted by ITV. ""What's the point in having Kendrick Lamar perform on #BRITS if you're going to mute him every other word?""tweeted JP,external, voicing the discontent of many. Many assumed that Lamar's songs - Feel and New Freezer - were muted due to bad language. But it seems the main issues were references to drugs and oral sex. Some muted sections featured mentions of ""bad dope"" and ""cocaine white"". The US superstar himself actually changed the most overt bad language in his lyrics - but fell foul of the censor's button for the drug words and oblique slang references to oral sex. Stormzy steals the show at Brit Awards Brit Awards 2018: The best pictures Brits 2018: The real winners and losers Stormzy asks PM 'where's the money for Grenfell?' Lamar's performance at the Brit Awards in London was broadcast on ITV on Wednesday almost an hour past the 21:00 watershed. Yet the decision was made to mute the audio 10 times during his performance - recalling an appearanceby Kanye West in 2015that also fell foul of the broadcaster's censors. Asked about the decision to mute parts of the songs, ITV said the ceremony was broadcast ""to a wide audience"". ""We have always used a short time delay and audio muting to deal with language viewers may consider unsuitable,"" a spokeswoman said. A performer attacking a car during Lamar's performance Lamar's performance also included a man taking a baseball bat to the windshield of an expensive-looking sports car. On Thursday morning, media watchdog Ofcom said it had received 74 complaints from viewers about Lamar's segment - some of whom feared this might incite criminal behaviour and property damage, and some complaining about implied bad language. BBC music reporter Mark Savage described the car stunt as the evening's ""biggest metaphor failure"". ""His intention was to make a statement about the emptiness of status symbols and the trappings of fame,""he wrote. Rag 'N' Bone Man and Stormzy were among the night's other winners ""But, with most viewers unable to hear his lyrics, it came off as 'I'm so rich I can afford to smash up this very expensive car live on TV.'"" The BBC understands the car in question was a Â£20,000 replica of a Lamborghini Murcielago. The end of Rag 'N' Bone Man's speech after he won best British single was also muted after the singer - real name Rory Graham - used the f-word. Yet Stormzy's use of an offensive Jamaican slang word went out uncensored when he took to the stage to accept the award for best British male at 20:32 GMT. ITV said: ""The use of this word during Stormzy's acceptance speech was not recognised at the time. We will address this for repeats.""

Haiti suspends Oxfam operations,"Haiti has suspended Oxfam GB operations, as it investigates claims of sexual misconduct by charity staff after the 2010 earthquake. The country's minister of planning and external cooperation said Oxfam made a ""serious error"" by failing to inform Haitian authorities of the allegations. Aviol Fleurant said a decision on the charity's right to operate in Haiti would be made in about two months. Oxfam says it will improve its global safeguarding policies and practices. In a statement, the charity said its executives met government officials in Haiti on Thursday and were committed to cooperating with the investigation. It said it would establish an independent commission into the events and put more staff and resources into its safeguarding teams. Oxfam added that staff attached to its Italy, Spain and Quebec branches will continue working on projects in Haiti but it was anticipated the temporary suspension will have a ""significant impact"" on their work. How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Thousands cancel donations to charity How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? Oxfam also reiterated its earlier apology to the people of Haiti. Oxfam GB chief executive Mark Goldring told MPs earlier this week he was sorry for damage done to the people of Haiti and to the wider efforts of aid workers. This video can not be played Mark Goldring: 'We are sorry for the damage done to Haiti and the wider aid efforts' Seven Oxfam members of staff left the charity in 2011 following the organisation's owninvestigation into whether staff hired prostitutes while working overseas. Oxfam denied a cover-up but its handling of the scandal, first reported in The Times earlier this month, isbeing investigated by the Charity Commission. Mr Goldring said 26 claims of recent and historical sexual misconduct involving Oxfam staff have been made since the scandal broke - 16 of them outside the UK.

Tech giants face new UK tax clampdown,"This video can not be played Financial Secretary Mel Stride wants a fairer system Some of the world's largest technology firms are facing hefty new bills as the UK government moves to fundamentally change the way they are taxed. Google and Facebook are braced for significant changes in the tax system after the Treasury told the BBC that a new tax on revenues was the ""potentially preferred option"". It would open up the firms' huge UK sales numbers to the tax authorities. At the moment, tax is levied on profits, a much smaller figure. Google, for example, said it made sales - revenues - of Â£1bn in the UK in 2016 and a pre-tax profit of Â£149m. It paid taxes of Â£38m - significantly higher than previous years after it changed the way it accounted for its activity in the UK. If the government taxed a proportion of those sales its tax bill would be likely to increase significantly. It would have a similar impact on a company like Facebook, which is also highly profitable and also increased the amount of tax it pays in the UK. All the companies that have faced controversy have also made it clear that they abide by the present tax rules. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury told the BBC that large digital companies should pay a ""fair"" amount of tax. ""At the moment [they] are generating very significant value in the UK, typically through having a digital platform with lots of users interacting with that platform,"" Mel Stride told me. ""That is driving a lot of value, so you're looking at social media platforms, online marketplaces, internet search engines - where at the moment the tax regime is not taxing those activities fairly. ""We want to move to a situation where we are taxing those activities fairly."" Technology companies have long argued that the tax rules are not their responsibility and that they follow the law. Eileen Burbidge, of Tech City UK, said: ""I don't think the multi-national tech companies have been any different than any other commercially minded business, in that they're certainly willing to pay their fair share or their responsible share of tax."" Mr Stride said that a tax on revenues was the ""potentially preferred route to go"", although he did not want to do anything that would harm smaller start-ups or companies that were still battling to make a profit. In a consultation document on the issue, published alongside the Budget last year, the government did raise the prospect of a revenue tax. That option now appears to have come a significant step closer. ""One important point to make right up front is we're not talking about tax avoidance, evasion or non-compliance, we're talking about the way the system works,"" Mr Stride said. ""And we recognise that in the 21st century, the digital age, there's a type of model of business where it's actually difficult, using existing tax rules, to actually apply what most people would feel was a fair level of tax to those businesses."" Apple pays extra Â£136m in tax to HMRC Facebook to overhaul Irish tax scheme Ebay paid UK tax of Â£1.6m in 2016 Mr Stride said that digital companies would pay higher levels of tax in a ""number of cases"" under the Treasury proposals. He said the government wanted to work with partners in the European Union and at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - which advises on global tax rules - to come to an international solution. But if that proved too complicated, the government was prepared to ""unilaterally enter into various changes"", he said. Announcements about changes could come as early as the Spring Statement on March 13, the government's major annual financial and economic policy statement, second only to the Budget. Both France and Germany have said they want to see revenue taxes for digital firms after controversy over how much tax firms like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple pay. The European Commission is also expected to come up with its own proposals next month. But the OECD warned against ""tax wars"" breaking out if separate nations imposed different policies. That could also open up digital firms to being taxed multiple times across the globe on the same activity. And could make the UK less attractive for digital firms like Google and Facebook - which employ thousands of people in Britain - to invest in. The OECD also questioned whether revenue taxes were the best way forward. ""Solving the challenges of the digitalisation of the economy clearly is a long-term issue, it's going to take years,"" Pascal Saint-Amans, the director of tax policy at the OECD, told the BBC. ""So what do you do? Is the stop gap measure - a tax on revenue - a good measure, probably not. Is it the best you can do given the political pressure you face in a number of countries, probably yes. ""But this needs to be in a frame to ensure that it's not going to be the UK consumers who will have to pay for this tax."" He said that China and America - which has recently changed its laws to oblige global firms to make large tax payments in the US - did not agree with ""short term measures"" and that global agreement was important. ""Unilateral measures may trigger some form of tax wars, and tax wars are no good for anyone,"" Mr Saint-Amans said. ""Thus the importance to have all countries - starting with the US, the Europeans, the Chinese and the others - to get together and to be serious in exploring solutions for the long-term. ""Without these we face the risk that all countries will be willing to protect the tax base and I think that's a fair reaction that they may have."" He added: ""In the long-term, these companies - like all the others - should pay their taxes where they create value. And we need an agreement among countries of where is value created. ""Is the value of Google the algorithm, in which case it belongs to the US. Or is the value created by the consumption of the service, by the user contribution?""

Couple filmed on TV being evicted win payoutA judge rules a Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away showing of an eviction violated their right to privacy.3h3 hours agoUK,"The programme has run for five series to date Channel 5 has been ordered to pay a couple Â£10,000 each for the distress of broadcasting them being evicted. Shakar Ali and his wife Shahida Aslam, from Barking, east London, were filmed by Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away after they fell into arrears on rent. Mr Ali did not give consent for the footage to be used on TV, but it was not only shown but repeated 35 times. The High Court ruled the couple's privacy outweighed Channel 5's right to freedom of expression. Mr Justice Arnold awarded the damages for distress caused in the filming and misuse of the couple's private information. Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away is a long-running series that follows the work of a team of High Court enforcement officers. In 2015, Mr Ali, 52, and Mrs Aslam, 49, were filmed by a TV crew and High Court officers who were wearing body cameras, whilst they were evicted from their home. Mr Ali had fallen behind on rental payments for the house, which he shared with his wife and two children, as he recovered from a heart condition and a badly injured foot. The owner of the property had obtained a court order for repossession, and used a team of enforcement officers to carry out the eviction. The court officers were joined by a TV crew who entered the house filming the couple's reaction, and filmed in their children's bedrooms. Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away was first broadcast on Channel 5 in 2014 During the eviction the landlord's son was seen to be ""taunting"" Mr Ali and complaining about how much money the rent arrears and eviction order had cost his family. Despite Mr Ali asking the enforcement officers and the film crew why they were filming, no-one explained who the film crew were or why they were there. Mr Ali did not give his consent to the filming but editors at Channel 5 went ahead with the broadcast as planned. The programme was ultimately broadcast 36 times on Channel 5 and its sister channels. It was also available to view online. The total cumulative audience was said to be 9.65 million people, but this would have included repeat viewers. Mr Ali also contacted the production company after the eviction and before the programme was first shown to ask for it not to be broadcast. Mr Justice Arnold ruled that, despite Channel 5's claims that Mr Ali had provided his consent by talking to the producers and enforcement officers during the eviction, ""he unequivocally withdrew that consent"" when he asked for the programme not to be shown. Mr Ali claimed that the programme ""showed them at their lowest ebb.... in a state of shock and very distressed... [and] caused them significant loss of dignity"". Channel 5 argued that under ""freedom of expression"" laws they were entitled to show what happened during the eviction. However, the judge said that the Ali family had a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" and that the ""focus of the programme was not upon the matters of public interest, but upon the drama of the conflict"" between the family and the landlord's son. The judge ruled the family's right to privacy outweighed the documentary maker's right to freedom of expression. Christopher Hutchings, who represented the family, said the ruling was ""one of the first legal actions"" arising from ""an observational documentary"". He added: ""[The] judgement will inevitably have wider ramifications for those broadcasting film of a similar kind."" Channel 5 said it welcomed the judge's assessment, which recognised the show was ""made in good faith and in the public interest"". A spokesman added the case only related to ""a segment involving the Ali family and not the series in general"".

"University pension boss's Â£82,000 pay riseThe university pension scheme, with a Â£6bn deficit, has two staff earning over Â£1m.4h4 hours agoFamily & Education","The pension scheme at the centre of a Â£6bn deficit row paid more than 100 of its own staff more than Â£100,000 The chief executive of the lecturers' pension scheme atthe centre of a university strikereceived a 17% pay rise worth an extra Â£82,000 this year. Bill Galvin's pay package had risen from Â£484,000 to Â£566,000, said a spokeswoman for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). Running costs for the university pension scheme were Â£125m per year - including two staff earning over Â£1m. Mr Galvin has described the pension scheme as ""excellent value"". Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, said: ""Whatever happens with this dispute, it is time for a proper look at what is happening with USS. ""Staff forced out on strike today will no doubt look at the salaries enjoyed by some of those in charge of the scheme and wonder what exactly they are doing to justify the salary and safeguard the pensions."" University employers have claimed there is a Â£6bn deficit in the pension scheme - and although unions have challenged the size of the shortfall, they say proposals to address the deficit will mean cutting their retirement income by Â£10,000 per year. The pension scheme is run by professional managers and a board including university leaders and representatives of the UCU union. Lecturers strike in pension dispute Emotions run high on the picket lines University strike: What's it all about? Students' compensation bid for university strike Strikes at Northern Ireland universities Among board members is Dame Glynis Breakwell, who announcedshe was stepping down as vice-chancellor of the University of Bathafter a dispute over excessive pay for senior university staff. University staff at Cambridge were part of the protest over pension cuts There had been complaints about ""fat cat"" salaries for senior staff while lecturers' pay had been capped, but the head of the lecturers' pension scheme this year received a 17% increase. The running costs of the pension scheme for the last year of accounts, ending March 2017, were Â£124.9m, an increase of more than Â£6m on the previous year. Staff costs were Â£61m, including two staff earning between Â£1m and Â£1.25m, with 113 staff earning more than Â£100,000 - 18 more than in the previous year. The numbers earning between Â£100,000 and Â£150,000 had almost doubled in a year, from 22 to 40, a further 21 staff were earning between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000 and five were earning between Â£400,000 and Â£450,000. Chief executive Bill Galvin, with salary and benefits worth Â£566,000, was not the highest paid, with the top earners thought to be investment staff. Mr Galvin, writing in the annual accounts, said that ""no doubt that overall, USS provides excellent value for money for the products and services we provide"". A spokeswoman for the Â£60bn university pension scheme said it offered ""above-average investment performance at below-average cost"". ""Our investment performance has been consistently good - reducing the contributions that would otherwise be required of members and employers. ""USS is focused on delivering value for its members and its investment costs, relative to assets under management,"" said the spokeswoman, who said the running costs of the scheme were Â£61m lower than its peers, according to independent benchmarking. Universities UK and the Department for Education said such costs were a matter for the pension scheme.

New deadly raids rock Syria rebel enclaveWarplanes continue to pound the Eastern Ghouta as the UN Security Council meets.28m29 minutes agoMiddle East,"This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes The UN Security Council is struggling to agree a resolution seeking a ceasefire in Syria and has put back a vote until Saturday. The vote has already been delayed several times since Thursday. Russia wanted changes to a draft that calls for a 30-day calm to allow for aid deliveries and medical evacuations. Western diplomats have accused Russia, Syria's key ally, of stalling for time. France said failure to act may spell the end of the UN itself. Minds have been focused amid outrage at the plight of civilians in the Eastern Ghouta rebel enclave. Activists say 462 people have now been killed there this week. Warplanes maintained the bombardment on Friday, witnesses said. Douma and Hamouriyeh were among areas hit. Western powers suspect that Moscow wants to give Syria time to deal a final blow to forces defending the rebel-held enclave on the edge of Damascus. The United States, the UK and France had called for the resolution to be approved without delay. UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura said a truce had to be followed by immediate, unhindered access to the Eastern Ghouta. Commenting on Friday evening, US President Donald Trump pointed the finger of blame firmly at Syria and its allies, Russia and Iran, for the humanitarian crisis. ""What those three countries have done to people over the last, short period of time is a disgrace,"" he said, speaking alongside the visiting Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Washington. The draft, put forward by Kuwait and Sweden, calls for a nationwide truce to go into effect 72 hours after the resolution is passed. Medical evacuations and aid deliveries would start 48 hours after that. The draft says 5.6 million people in 1,244 communities across the country are in acute need. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Sweden's UN ambassador Olof Skoog told the BBC that getting aid to the Eastern Ghouta, where conditions were described by the UN secretary general as ""hell on earth"", was the main objective. ""I think that without the pressure coming from a united Security Council things are not happening the way they should on the ground,"" he said. ""So I think for the council it's a little bit less about the details and more about giving a political pressure to ensure that this happens."" Already overwhelmed hospitals are struggling to cope with the influx of casualties France's UN ambassador FranÃ§ois Delattre said the UN's inability to help Syrian civilians would result in a devastating loss of credibility. ""The Syrian tragedy must not also become a graveyard for the United Nations,"" he added. The draft resolution also calls for all parties to avoid establishing military positions in civilian areas, including schools and hospitals. Sieges of populated areas should be lifted. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote a joint letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to back the resolution. Under the terms of the draft resolution, any ceasefire would not apply to the Islamic State group, or the Nusra Front - formerly al-Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says it must go further and exclude other groups ""co-operating with them"" and which have shelled Damascus. This could include the two biggest rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta - Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman. Faylaq al-Rahman has in the past fought alongside the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of factions led by the Nusra Front. Mr Lavrov told reporters his country would be prepared to vote for the ceasefire under certain conditions. ""There are no guarantees that [the rebels] will not continue shooting at Damascus residential areas,"" he told a briefing. He said Russia had proposed ""a formula which would make the ceasefire real"". The Su-57, Russia's most advanced fighter plane, has been sent to Syria Meanwhile, two of Russia's most advanced fighter planes, Su-57s, have been sent to its coastal Hmeimim airbase, Russian military sources told BBC Russian. The sources said the stealth fighter planes were still undergoing flight tests and there was no confirmation they had yet been used in combat. For the sixth day running, Syrian government forces have pounded the Eastern Ghouta. A witness in Douma speaking to Reuters news agency early on Friday said the bombing there was the most intense so far. Syrian state TV says rebels have shelled Damascus, killing one and injuring dozens more. The US has also accused Russia of attacking Ghouta,external, allegations that Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed as ""groundless"". The number killed since Sunday in the Eastern Ghouta has risen to 462, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group says, at least 99 of them children. Barrel bombs and shell fire have rained down on the area, where some 393,000 people remain trapped. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" Rescue workers said the town of Douma came under sustained attack on Thursday The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and insisted it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both jihadist militants and the mainstream rebel groups that dominate the enclave.

Warning over fake piercing magnet craze,"The powerful attraction between the magnets ripped through Freddie Webster's stomach Two children needed life-saving surgery after accidentally swallowing powerful magnetic balls which are being used to mimic body piercings in a new craze. One of the youngsters, Freddie Webster, 12, had to have part of his bowel removed as the tiny balls were ripping a hole in the wall of his stomach. A third child, aged four, also swallowed the balls but managed to pass them out of the body naturally. The consultant who saw them has warned parents to be aware of the new craze. Read more stories from across East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire All three youngsters have been treated at Hull Royal Infirmary over the past three months. Doctors have warned of the life-threatening risks of the ball-bearings The ball-bearing magnets are understood to have become a craze among children who use them as pretend piercings on areas such as their mouth or tongue. However, doctors have warned if swallowed, they can cause serious damage by burrowing into the stomach and intestines. In Freddie's case, he had put one of the 3mm diameter balls inside his mouth and the other outside but accidentally swallowed it. The balls can burrow into the stomach and intestines Hours later, he swallowed another two and began experiencing stomach pains. He was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary where he underwent a four-and-a-half hour operation. Surgeons removed 10cms of his bowel to enable them to extract the balls. His mother Sarah Webster, from Driffield, said: ""The surgeon came out and said that Freddie was stable but very poorly and told us the next 24 hours would be critical."" Freddie has made a good recovery but doctors fear the next child may not be so lucky Consultant paediatric surgeon Sanja Besarovic has written to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in the hope a more public official warning can be made. ""We have been able to save these children but I'm growing increasingly concerned that this is happening often,"" she said.

"Boy, 2, killed in 'hit-and-run' crash","This video can not be played Two brothers died in the crash at about 14:00 GMT Two brothers aged six and two have died after a suspected hit-and-run crash in Coventry. They were struck by a car on MacDonald Road, Stoke, at about 14:00 GMT and taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries. A 53-year-old man and a 41-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and drink driving. A black Ford Focus was found abandoned a short time after the crash.

The two lorries collided with a minibus on the M1 near Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on 26 August. Ryszard Masierak, 32, and David Wagstaff, 54, face eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The lorry drivers are on trial at Reading Crown Court. The two men are also charged with four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, and Mr Masierak faces an additional charge of drink-driving. David Wagstaff (left) and Ryszard Masierak are charged with death by dangerous driving Prosecutor Oliver Saxby told the court the crash was ""entirely avoidable"". The jury heard Polish national Mr Masierak had stopped in lane one at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. Minibus driver Cyriac Joseph was waiting with his hazard lights on to go around the lorry when Mr Wagstaff ploughed into the back of the van forcing it into and under Mr Masierak's vehicle. Mr Joseph and seven of his passengers were killed in the crash on the Bank Holiday weekend. They were on their way to London to catch a coach to Disneyland Paris. CCTV footage of the minutes leading up to the collision and of the crash were shown to the jury. Mr Saxby said the sound had been removed to spare them the ""acute horror of what occurred"". He added it was important for the jury to see the footage so they could evaluate the standard of driving of both defendants. The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph Mr Saxby said the ""catastrophic and tragic"" collision was ""caused by the driving of these two defendants"". ""In Mr Masierak's case, under the influence of alcohol, parking up in the slowlane of the M1, an act as flagrant as it was dangerous. ""And in Mr Wagstaff's case, on a hands-free call completely failing to notice what was ahead of him, inattention on a gross scale."" The court heard Mr Wagstaff did not brake or decelerate before ploughing into Mr Joseph's minibus. Mr Masierak, of Barnards Close in Evesham, Worcestershire, and Mr Wagstaff, of Derwent Street in Stoke-on-Trent, both deny all charges against them. The trial continues.

Women earn up to 43% less at Barclays,"Female employees earn up to 43.5% less at Barclays than men, according togender pay gap figures,externalit has submitted to the government. Only 28 of the 1,154 companies that have reported the figures have a higher median hourly pay gap than Barclays. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said it had ""more work to do"" so women could progress in financial services. However, Barclays said that it paid men and women in the same roles equally. The 43.5% average gender pay gap reflects its investment bank division, Barclays International. For its UK retail bank, women earn 14.2% less than men on average, while the figure is 29.9% for the holding company, Barclays Services. The bank has not produced an overall figure for the three divisions. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Select Committee, described the pay disparity at Barclays International as shocking, adding: ""Financial firms should be prepared to explain any gender pay gap that they may have."" Mr Staley said: ""Although female representation is growing at Barclays, we still have high proportions of women in more junior, lower paid roles and high proportions of men in senior, highly paid roles. ""There has been improvement across financial services but progress has been slow within the industry, so we support the objectives and intent of the UK government in introducing gender pay gap reporting to drive equality in both the workplace and in society more widely."" What is the gender pay gap? Men still earn more than women at most firms Of all financial and insurance companies that have submitted their figures, the median pay gap is 14.8%. The imbalance at Barclays UK was further highlighted by its pay quartile figures, with women accounting for 73% of the lowest-paid employees. Women's bonus pay at Barclays UK was 46.9% lower than that for men on the median measure. Chief executive Jes Staley says Barclays has ""more work to do"" Barclays is the first big bank to report its gender pay figures and chose to do so on the same dayits annual results were released. Women earn 38.4% less at Virgin Money, while insurer Aviva has a median pay gap of 27.6%. Both firms, along with Barclays, have said they pay men and women in the same roles equally. UK companies with 250 or more employees - about 9,000 firms - must calculate their gender pay gap andpublish it on a government website,externalby 4 April, or 30 March for the public sector. Dominie Moss, founder of The Return Hub, which places women returning from career breaks in financial services jobs, said: ""There's no silver bullet - for banks and City firms it's about getting more women established in senior executive roles, so they can in turn embed a culture that's more attuned to the needs of both women and men. That's going to be about changing managerial and recruitment practice."" Most firms pay men more than women What is the gender pay gap?

Kendrick's drug lyrics muted at Brits,"Lamar's performance came after he was named best international male solo artist Brit Awards,externalviewers were left baffled after parts of rap star Kendrick Lamar's performance were muted by ITV. ""What's the point in having Kendrick Lamar perform on #BRITS if you're going to mute him every other word?""tweeted JP,external, voicing the discontent of many. Many assumed that Lamar's songs - Feel and New Freezer - were muted due to bad language. But it seems the main issues were references to drugs and oral sex. Some muted sections featured mentions of ""bad dope"" and ""cocaine white"". The US superstar himself actually changed the most overt bad language in his lyrics - but fell foul of the censor's button for the drug words and oblique slang references to oral sex. Stormzy steals the show at Brit Awards Brit Awards 2018: The best pictures Brits 2018: The real winners and losers Stormzy asks PM 'where's the money for Grenfell?' Lamar's performance at the Brit Awards in London was broadcast on ITV on Wednesday almost an hour past the 21:00 watershed. Yet the decision was made to mute the audio 10 times during his performance - recalling an appearanceby Kanye West in 2015that also fell foul of the broadcaster's censors. Asked about the decision to mute parts of the songs, ITV said the ceremony was broadcast ""to a wide audience"". ""We have always used a short time delay and audio muting to deal with language viewers may consider unsuitable,"" a spokeswoman said. A performer attacking a car during Lamar's performance Lamar's performance also included a man taking a baseball bat to the windshield of an expensive-looking sports car. On Thursday morning, media watchdog Ofcom said it had received 74 complaints from viewers about Lamar's segment - some of whom feared this might incite criminal behaviour and property damage, and some complaining about implied bad language. BBC music reporter Mark Savage described the car stunt as the evening's ""biggest metaphor failure"". ""His intention was to make a statement about the emptiness of status symbols and the trappings of fame,""he wrote. Rag 'N' Bone Man and Stormzy were among the night's other winners ""But, with most viewers unable to hear his lyrics, it came off as 'I'm so rich I can afford to smash up this very expensive car live on TV.'"" The BBC understands the car in question was a Â£20,000 replica of a Lamborghini Murcielago. The end of Rag 'N' Bone Man's speech after he won best British single was also muted after the singer - real name Rory Graham - used the f-word. Yet Stormzy's use of an offensive Jamaican slang word went out uncensored when he took to the stage to accept the award for best British male at 20:32 GMT. ITV said: ""The use of this word during Stormzy's acceptance speech was not recognised at the time. We will address this for repeats.""

Mum jailed for murdering baby son,"Hannah James suffocated her seven-week-old baby James and put anti-depressants in his milk bottle A mother who murdered her baby son after voices told her she was a bad mother has been jailed for life. Hannah Turtle, 22, from Shotton, Flintshire, suffocated seven-week-old James Hughes in June 2016. She stopped his breathing on two other occasions before she killed him - both times he was revived in hospital. Turtle, whochanged her plea to guiltyduring her murder trial at Mold Crown Court, must serve at least 14 years and nine months in prison. She also admitted five other child cruelty charges including administering poison to him, by putting her anti-depressants in James's milk bottle on two occasions. Baby murder accused 'could not stop' Baby murder accused 'had depression' Mother 'smiled after killing baby' Mr Justice Clive Lewis said Turtle suffered from a personality disorder which reduced her culpability and he was not sure she had meant to kill him. He said James was a baby deserving of his mother's protection but ""instead you suffocated him"". In a victim impact statement read out in court James's grandmother Kathleen Hughes described Turtle as ""pure evil"" and said she did not deserve forgiveness. The trial had heard how Turtle stopped James breathing on three occasions within a 10-day period, including when she was left alone with him in hospital. Then on 9 June 2016 she suffocated her son again, this time he did not recover, and died in hospital four days later from brain damage due to oxygen deprivation. During the trial Turtle told how James fought back when she put her hand over his face, but then went all floppy and white. A social worker told the trial Turtle had smiled as she told her how she had smothered her baby as he was sleeping in the cot. James Hughes died from brain damage caused by oxygen deprivation Turtle initially denied harming her son when questioned by police but was re-interviewed after she told social workers she had killed him. The defendant said she wished she had not done it and said she needed help. She also said she heard voices telling her she was a bad mother, and added that she had been abused as a child, suffered from depression and had mental health problems. While there had been no evidence of mental illness Turtle had been assessed as potentially having post-natal depression in the days before James's death. In a statement following her sentencing, James's family said they been through ""hell and back"" and the family was still ""suffering every day"". ""James will always be our little angel,"" the statement added. Mental health charity Mind Cymru said these sorts of cases were ""incredibly rare"". ""The overwhelming majority of people with mental health problems are not dangerous,"" said director Sara Moseley. ""Of the 500-600 homicides each year in England and Wales, the overwhelming majority are committed by people who do not have a mental health diagnosis or symptoms of a mental health problem."" Catrin Attwell, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said Turtle had twice administered her own anti-depressants to her son. ""Each time, she made sure there was no-one to witness her cruelty and stayed silent while doctors tried to find a medical cause for James' problems,"" she said. North Wales Police said a child protection review by a regional safeguarding board into James's death was ongoing.

Pair jailed for UK Christmas attack plan,"Munir Mohammed and Rowaida El-Hassan met on an online dating site A couple has been jailed for plotting a terror attack in the UK using a homemade bomb. Munir Mohammed, from Derby, was handed a life sentence, with a minimum of 14 years. Pharmacist Rowaida El-Hassan has been jailed for 12 years. The trial at the Old Bailey heard the pairmet on a dating websiteand Mohammed used El-Hassan's chemical knowledge to help plan an attack. The judge said he posed ""a significant risk of serious harm to the public"". At the time of his arrest in December 2016, Mohammed had two of the three components for TATP explosives as well as manuals on how to make bombs and ricin poison. A bottle of hydrogen peroxide, which Mohammed believed was needed to make a bomb, was found in a wardrobe at his home The 37-year-old, of Leopold Street, Derby, had volunteered for a ""lone wolf"" mission while messaging an IS commander on Facebook. ""You decided the means of your attack would involve you making an IED,"" Judge Michael Topolski QC said. ""You had not decided whether that would be made with an ordinary bomb or whether you could do more damage and more terror by exploding a device containing ricin."" He added that Mohammed had carefully and deliberately pulled El-Hassan in to the plot, to the point where her commitment was ""consistent and sustained"". It is not clear why Munir Mohammed was in the UK given he arrived illegally and, according to evidence in the trial, seemingly lied about having any kind of justifiable claim for asylum. But once he made that claim, he appeared to have entered legal limbo. He was placed in an immigration removal centre, but then sent to live in the Midlands. He then used false documents to work in a food factory - while flirting with the idea of making his own poisons. His application to stay in Britain was in a massive backlog of unresolved asylum cases known to officials as the ""not straightforward"" list. The Home Office, the ministry responsible for both immigration and national security, declined to say what happened to Munir Mohammed's case. But what's clear is he sat and waited. And as he waited, he began to plot. Derby terror plot: The online Casanova and his lover Mohammed, originally from Eritrea and who lived in Sudan for some time before coming to the UK, investigated making poison while working at a supermarket ready meals factory. The court heard he and El-Hassan, 33, of Willesden Lane, north-west London, had exchanged messages about ricin after meeting online. El-Hassan wrote on the dating website she was looking for a simple man whom she could ""vibe with on a spiritual and intellectual level"". By the spring of 2016 the pair were in regular contact on WhatsApp and had met more than once in a London park near El-Hassan's home. The mother-of-two advised fellow divorcee Mohammed on what chemicals he needed for the bomb. During sentencing, the judge highlighted Mohammed's ""vast store"" of IS propaganda depicting the ""abhorrent"" acts of murder, including nearly 26,000 images on his phone. El-Hassan never objected to being sent the material as her two children slept in her bedroom, and even asked for more, the judge said. Even though Mohammed introduced extremism in their relationship, El-Hassan ""embraced it and became more and more absorbed by it to the point she became an enthusiastic and encouraging partner"", he added. Couple guilty of plotting terror attack The Casanova and his lover behind terror plot Accused bomb plotter 'was married' Alleged bomb plotter 'sent gory videos' MP 'took up case of accused bomb plotter' Terror suspect 'pledged allegiance to IS' Online dating couple 'plotted bombing' Suspects deny plans for UK terror attack HM Courts Service List of Derbyshire roads closed as council issues key warning Bridge still closed as police 'astonished' after drivers move road closure signs Drug raids uncover large scale cannabis grows inside Chesterfield homes â with hundreds of plants seized by police Group of girls attacked in Derbyshire town centre takeaway â as police launch appeal to trace man in connection with incident Stonehouse Business Consultancy launches in High Peak The Royal Mint has launched a new Â£1,000 coin - and you won't believe how much it costs Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Rising numbers of EU nationals leaving UK,"The number of EU citizens leaving the UK is at its highest level for a decade with 130,000 emigrating in the year to September,figures show.,external But far more EU nationals (220,000) moved to the UK in the same period, the Office for National Statistics found. It means net EU migration - the difference between arrivals and departures - was 90,000, the lowest for five years. The ONS said Brexit could be a factor in people's decisions to move. Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said migration was complicated and could be influenced by lots of different reasons. The figures also show that more British people are emigrating than are returning to live in the UK. Of those EU nationals arriving in the UK, fewer were coming for ""work-related reasons"", in particular to ""look for work"". By contrast, immigration from countries outside the European Union is going up which means the UK population is continuing to grow at a similar level to early 2014. Some 285,000 non-EU citizens arrived in the UK in the 12-month period to September, and 80,000 departed. This gives a net increase of 205,000, the highest for six years. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said this was largely driven by more people coming to study in the UK and an uncharacteristic dip in the previous year's figures that may have been corrected. He also speculated whether firms were starting to struggle to recruit or retain people from the EU, forcing them to look outside the EU. Overall, net migration is estimated to have fallen by 29,000 to 244,000 in the same period. This includes 73,000 British people coming back to the UK and 125,000 Britons leaving. The overall net migration figure is still well short of the government's target to reduce net migration to below 100,000, a pledge made in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 Tory manifestos. By home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw What explanation could there be for the decline in EU migration other than Brexit?  In the two years before the June 2016 referendum, the number of EU nationals arriving in Britain was stable at about 240,000 to 280,000. But every quarter since then has recorded falls, from 284,000 to 220,000. At the same time, the number of EU leavers, which hadn't risen higher than 100,000 since 2010, began to rise, from 95,000 to 130,000. Whether it's a feeling that EU citizens aren't wanted in the UK, uncertainty about their future or the growing relative strength of other EU economies, there has been a notable shift away from Britain's shores. Nevertheless, overall net migration remains at historically high levels, well above the government's controversial target, with a rise in migration from outside Europe. Caroline Nokes, immigration minister, said the latest figures demonstrated that the UK was still attracting the ""brightest and best people"" to come to work and study and described the increase in the number of overseas students as a ""huge positive"". ""We are a country that is open for business,"" she added. ""We want to have great relations with our European neighbours going forward but at the same time we need to have a sustainable migration system,"" she said. Asked whether falling numbers would adversely affect some sectors, in particular the NHS, Ms Nokes said the independent migration advisory committee was due to report its findings on EU patterns to the government in September so decisions could be made based on evidence.

""This deficit hurts us all and highlights the immigration mess the government has created,"" she said. The ONS figures also show that in 2017, the UK granted asylum, alternative forms of protection or resettlement to almost 15,000 people, 40% of whom were under 18. Separate figures from the Home Office showedmore than 10,500 people have been granted refuge in the UK after fleeing the conflict in Syria, under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement scheme. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who is in Lebanon near the Syrian border, said the government was considering extending its commitment to rehome 20,000 people by 2020.

This was 39% lower than the peak of 232,262 in 2013. There is evidence that more EU citizens, who have settled in the UK, are applying for citizenship, with applications more than doubling from 15,460 in 2016 to 38,528 in 2017.

Syria refugee target may be extended,"This video can not be played Home secretary Amber Rudd said resettling Syrians was an important commitment The government is considering whether the UK should agree to resettle more refugees from the Syrian war, once it hits its target of bringing in 20,000 by 2020, the home secretary has said. Amber Rudd said that 10,538 people have already been granted refuge under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme. The 2020 target was set by David Cameron in 2015. Speaking in Lebanon, Ms Rudd said she was already holding talks about what would follow when it was met. During a trip to a refugee camp on Monday, which could not be reported at the time, Ms Rudd said: ""20,000 is definitely achievable by 2020, and I hope that we may get there earlier than that in fact. ""At the moment I am consulting with stakeholders and really engaging with other departments to decide what we should have to replace that when we go forward after 2020."" Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? UK to accept 20,000 refugees from Syria by 2020 Why is there war in Syria? She visited an informal tented settlement in Qab Elias, a Lebanese town about 15 miles from the Syrian border, where she met some of the 46 families staying there. Ms Rudd said Britain was one of the largest donors to help with Syria's refugee crisis, having committed Â£2.46bn in funding since 2012. She spoke as Syrian bombing has killed scores of civilians during the past few daysin the rebel-held area of Eastern Ghouta. Ms Rudd met 46 families - some 200 people - staying at the camp in Lebanon Ms Rudd added that the British public should be ""proud"" of what the VPRS had achieved, saying: ""It is the largest number of any European country of resettlement from the region. ""People have been very kind about saying how effective it is and how good the care is when people get to the local authority.""

Labour 'to end deportation heartbreak',"Ms Abbott said immigration policy would be based on ""Labour values"" Labour has vowed to change immigration rules it says are breaking up families. Diane Abbott said a Labour government would end the ""heartbreak"" of children of migrants being deported once they turn 18 even when their parents have gained the right to stay in the UK. The shadow home secretary also said the parents of child refugees who come to the UK should be allowed to join them. The Tories said this risked creating an increased incentive for children from war zones to try coming to the UK. In a speech to the Policy Institute in London, Ms Abbott said the ""right to a family life"" and the principle of family reunion would be at the heart of her party's ""humanistic"" approach to immigration policy after Brexit. ""We don't want to see the break-up of families from the EU in the way we currently do for non-EU families."" Child refugees who fled Nazis in plea to PM She suggested her party's refusal to ""scapegoat"" immigrants had contributed to its gains in last year's election, contrasting Labour's rhetoric on the issue with that of other left-of-centre parties across Europe. She said it was ""not fair nor reasonable"" to separate children from their parents on immigration grounds or bar the parents and carers of children granted asylum or leave to remain in the UK from joining them. ""This commitment underlines our commitment to human rights. This is the application of Labour values and it is the right thing to do,"" she said. As part of a proposed overhaul of deportation rules, she called for an end to situations where migrants and asylum seekers told they could not settle in the UK were forcibly returned to countries with which they had little connection. She also pledged to end the indefinite detention of asylum seekers and migrants and review the role of private companies in running holding and removal centres. She rejected suggestions Labour continued to support an open-door immigration policy, saying it backed ""sensible and humane"" controls that recognised that immigration was not always an ""unalloyed benefit"" and created pressures on public services in parts of the UK. Labour's approach, she argued, would not be based on numbers but a system of ""fair rules and reasonable management"", which prioritised the economy and jobs and ensured a level-playing field for migrants, wherever they originated from. She claimed the government's target of reducing annual net migration to below 100,000 was resulting in much-needed doctors and nurses from outside the EU being turned away and landlords and health professionals effectively being transformed into immigration enforcement officials. ""We won't have artificial targets or 'go home' vans,"" she said. ""In a global world, we need migration and migrants. They should not be subjected to a hostile environment."" A Conservative spokesman said the government was committed to giving a home to those ""most in need"" and that the UK had resettled 23,000 of the most vulnerable refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, including 9,000 children, over the past year. ""Labour's policy would risk breaking up families by creating a dangerous incentive for children to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean and on to the UK on their own,"" he said.

New deadly raids rock Syria rebel enclave,"This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes The UN Security Council is struggling to agree a resolution seeking a ceasefire in Syria and has put back a vote until Saturday. The vote has already been delayed several times since Thursday. Russia wanted changes to a draft that calls for a 30-day calm to allow for aid deliveries and medical evacuations. Western diplomats have accused Russia, Syria's key ally, of stalling for time. France said failure to act may spell the end of the UN itself. Minds have been focused amid outrage at the plight of civilians in the Eastern Ghouta rebel enclave. Activists say 462 people have now been killed there this week. Warplanes maintained the bombardment on Friday, witnesses said. Douma and Hamouriyeh were among areas hit. Western powers suspect that Moscow wants to give Syria time to deal a final blow to forces defending the rebel-held enclave on the edge of Damascus. The United States, the UK and France had called for the resolution to be approved without delay. UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura said a truce had to be followed by immediate, unhindered access to the Eastern Ghouta. Commenting on Friday evening, US President Donald Trump pointed the finger of blame firmly at Syria and its allies, Russia and Iran, for the humanitarian crisis. ""What those three countries have done to people over the last, short period of time is a disgrace,"" he said, speaking alongside the visiting Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Washington. The draft, put forward by Kuwait and Sweden, calls for a nationwide truce to go into effect 72 hours after the resolution is passed. Medical evacuations and aid deliveries would start 48 hours after that. The draft says 5.6 million people in 1,244 communities across the country are in acute need. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Sweden's UN ambassador Olof Skoog told the BBC that getting aid to the Eastern Ghouta, where conditions were described by the UN secretary general as ""hell on earth"", was the main objective. ""I think that without the pressure coming from a united Security Council things are not happening the way they should on the ground,"" he said. ""So I think for the council it's a little bit less about the details and more about giving a political pressure to ensure that this happens."" Already overwhelmed hospitals are struggling to cope with the influx of casualties France's UN ambassador FranÃ§ois Delattre said the UN's inability to help Syrian civilians would result in a devastating loss of credibility. ""The Syrian tragedy must not also become a graveyard for the United Nations,"" he added. The draft resolution also calls for all parties to avoid establishing military positions in civilian areas, including schools and hospitals. Sieges of populated areas should be lifted. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote a joint letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to back the resolution. Under the terms of the draft resolution, any ceasefire would not apply to the Islamic State group, or the Nusra Front - formerly al-Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says it must go further and exclude other groups ""co-operating with them"" and which have shelled Damascus. This could include the two biggest rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta - Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman. Faylaq al-Rahman has in the past fought alongside the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of factions led by the Nusra Front. Mr Lavrov told reporters his country would be prepared to vote for the ceasefire under certain conditions. ""There are no guarantees that [the rebels] will not continue shooting at Damascus residential areas,"" he told a briefing. He said Russia had proposed ""a formula which would make the ceasefire real"". The Su-57, Russia's most advanced fighter plane, has been sent to Syria Meanwhile, two of Russia's most advanced fighter planes, Su-57s, have been sent to its coastal Hmeimim airbase, Russian military sources told BBC Russian. The sources said the stealth fighter planes were still undergoing flight tests and there was no confirmation they had yet been used in combat. For the sixth day running, Syrian government forces have pounded the Eastern Ghouta. A witness in Douma speaking to Reuters news agency early on Friday said the bombing there was the most intense so far. Syrian state TV says rebels have shelled Damascus, killing one and injuring dozens more. The US has also accused Russia of attacking Ghouta,external, allegations that Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed as ""groundless"". The number killed since Sunday in the Eastern Ghouta has risen to 462, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group says, at least 99 of them children. Barrel bombs and shell fire have rained down on the area, where some 393,000 people remain trapped. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" Rescue workers said the town of Douma came under sustained attack on Thursday The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and insisted it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both jihadist militants and the mainstream rebel groups that dominate the enclave.

Brits 2018: The real winners and losers,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Stormzy and Dua Lipa both took home two trophies at theBrits,external, but there's always more to the show than the awards. On a night of joy and disappointment, X-rated confessions and spectacular performances, who were the real winners and losers at the O2 Arena? So much dress, in fact, that it took two or three people to move it around. Dua,external's baby pink tiered Giambattista Valli gown was an extravaganza of ruffles - but she wasn't being precious about it. ""There's a lot of it, so if it gets damaged I can pick up a piece from somewhere else."" Emma Bunton,external's kids were disappointed they couldn't come to the Brit Awards, so she threw them their own awards ceremony on Tuesday. ""We had orange juice, they did a little performance, and they won best male and best group."" He might have sold 12.8 million albums last year, butEd Sheeran,externalwas shut out of the Brits. His only prize was the global success award, which recognises commercial success, while best male, best album, best single and best video all went to other artists. There's certainly a sense that the industry isn't on his side right now - he was similarly overlooked at the Grammys - but it's hard to work out what he's done wrong. Perhaps voters felt his latest album, Ã·, was too safe, or cynically commercial, to deserve a prize. Or maybe they just really, really hated Galway Girl. Either way, it feels odd that the star couldn't catch a break in his home country. During the ceremony, pop coupleCheryl,externalandLiam Payne,externalwere confronted by presenter Jack Whitehall, who had a question about Liam's upcoming performance withRita Ora,external. ""You're performing later, you're doing a song from the Fifty Shades of Grey movie,"" he said. ""Sounds pretty saucy, is there a safe word?"" Liam gallantly threw the question to Cheryl, saying: ""She knows that."" Without batting an eyelid, she leaned into the microphone and said two words. ""Don't stop"". Stormzy steals the show at Brit Awards Brit Awards 2018: Relive the ceremony Brit Awards 2018: The best pictures Paloma Faith: More men should have worn white roses See the full list of winners and nominees Stormzy,external's performance was a show-stopper, and not just because it literally came at the end of the ceremony. Still beaming after winning best album, the star showed the full range of his talents in a performance that encompassed the heartfelt gospel of Blinded By Your Grace and the tongue-twisting wordplay of Big For Your Boots. But in the middle, he did something special - a ferocious freestyle verse that took aim at thegovernment's response to the Grenfell fire. This video can not be played Brit Awards 2018: Stormzy explains why he spoke up about Grenfell ""Yo, Theresa May, where's the money for Grenfell?"" he rapped. ""What, you thought we forgot about Grenfell? ""You're criminals, and you got the cheek to call us savages? You should do some jail time, you should pay some damages. We should burn your house down and see if you can manage this?"" In true Stormzy style, though, the rap wove the personal into the political, and he went on to talk about his pride in seeing other black British stars succeeding, including model Jourdan Dunn and actor Daniel Kaluuya. ""When Dan Kaluuya won the Bafta, I could have cried,"" he grinned. Speaking to the BBC afterwards, the rapper said he wanted to use his platform ""to say something bigger"" than ""yeah, it's the Stormzy show"". ""This isn't about me. It's about Grenfell, it's about all the things I said in that lyric."" Technically this happened three years ago but we only found out about it tonight, and it's our public duty to inform you thatTaylor Swift,externalnarrowly escaped a black eye at the Brit Awards. Mike Kerr fromRoyal Blood,externalrevealed the incident, while grassing up his musical partner Ben Thatcher as the culprit. ""We went into her dressing room to say hello, and Ben opened a bottle of champagne,"" he recalled. ""The cork nearly hit her in the face and knocked her out"". ""I get a little overexcited sometimes,"" said Ben, sheepishly. Out on the red carpet, we introduced disco legendNile Rodgers,externalto EsteHaim,external, who essentially exploded with glee. ""You are the funkiest man I've ever heard,"" she gushed as the Chic guitarist greeted her with a hug. ""I'm literallyâ¦ I wish I was wearing a diaper right now,"" she said.

The video for Dua Lipa's New Rules is unquestionably brilliant. Its message of women supporting women chimes perfectly with the times; and the iconic choreography inspired hundreds of tributes and covers. Last week, it clocked up its one billionth play on YouTube. At 22, Dua is now the youngest female artist ever to reach that milestone. So why wasn't it in the running for best British video? Because the Brits opens that category up to a fan vote, which meant Dua was dumped from the longlist in favour of multiple videos by former members of One Direction. In the end, the not-very-good video forHarry Styles's,externalnot-very-good Sign Of The Times won. A complete travesty. Hosting the Brits is a poisoned chalice. The audience aren't listening, the artists aren't interested and the script is perennially awful. But, amazingly,Jack Whitehall,externalpulled it out of the bag with a series of acid-tongued one-liners. Like these ones: On Rag 'N' Bone Man:""The man with the voice of an angel and the beard of a wizard"". On Sam Smith:""If you like Adele songs, but find them too upbeat, you're in for a treat as Sam Smith will be performing!"" On The Voice judges:""It's a knight of the realm, an Oscar-winner and... Olly Murs."" Jack Whitehall's best one-liners at the Brits Kendrick Lamar,externalperformed Feel, a song about how stardom left him feeling isolated, while a dancer smashed an orange Lamborghini with a baseball bat. His intention was to make a statement about the emptiness of status symbols and the trappings of fame. But, with most viewers unable to hear his lyrics, it came off as ""I'm so rich I can afford to smash up this very expensive car live on TV."" Allow Twitter content?

Ex-UKIP boss and lover: We're not racists,"UKIP says ousted leader Henry Bolton has now quit the party. The announcement came as Mr Bolton made a joint appearance with girlfriend Jo Marney on ITV's This Morning programme. The pair insisted they were not ""private racists"" after being confronted with messages posted by Ms Marney on social media, including her description of Grenfell Tower as ""a nest of illegal immigrants"". Asked if Ms Marney was worth losing his job over, Mr Bolton said: ""Yes."" But the 54-year-old blamed rivals in UKIP for using his relationship with the 25-year-old model, and the controversy around her social-media messages, to get rid him for political reasons. Ex-UKIP leader back with girlfriend He was also read a lengthy statement from his wife of 11 years, Tatiana Smurova-Bolton, whom he left shortly before Christmas. ""The past few months have been horrendous for me and my family,"" the statement said. ""Rather than trying to protect the privacy of the children he hurt so badly, my still-husband has given countless interviews proclaiming his feelings for his lover while still being legally married."" Mr Bolton claimed ""people within the party"" had ""aggravated the situation"" but added: ""I have brought about a situation which has caused a lot of hurt and distress and I am very, very sorry for that."" He defended Ms Marney over the message she had posted about Grenfell Tower, saying it had been taken out of context, and there was a debate to be had about illegal immigration. Ms Marney said ""the language that I used was not good"" but she had not meant to ""cause offence"". Asked about the private WhatsApp messages about Prince Harry's fiancee, Meghan Markle, who she said would ""taint"" the Royal Family, she said: ""My comments were disgusting - they were meant to be shocking."" But she had ""never intended"" the messages to be made public and they ""don't reflect my views"". ""Who can realistically say they have never said anything offensive in private?"" asked Ms Marney. Asked if the couple were ""private racists"", Mr Bolton said: ""No of course not."" Mr Bolton was voted out as party leader at a special meeting of UKIP members at the weekend, five months after his leadership victory. Interim UKIP leader Gerard Batten said Mr Bolton's resignation ""will draw a line under a sad period"" for the party. But he said it ""will allow us to concentrate on our core duty of representing the millions that have voted for us, and the 17.4 million whose decision in the referendum is being betrayed by a political class, especially the leadership of both the Conservatives and Labour"". He added: ""On a personal level, I have written to Henry expressing my and the party's best wishes in whatever it is that he chooses to do next'.""

Man jailed for plotting UK terror attack,"Munir Mohammed and Rowaida El-Hassan met on an online dating site A couple has been jailed for plotting a terror attack in the UK using a homemade bomb. Munir Mohammed, from Derby, was handed a life sentence, with a minimum of 14 years. Pharmacist Rowaida El-Hassan has been jailed for 12 years. The trial at the Old Bailey heard the pairmet on a dating websiteand Mohammed used El-Hassan's chemical knowledge to help plan an attack. The judge said he posed ""a significant risk of serious harm to the public"". At the time of his arrest in December 2016, Mohammed had two of the three components for TATP explosives as well as manuals on how to make bombs and ricin poison. A bottle of hydrogen peroxide, which Mohammed believed was needed to make a bomb, was found in a wardrobe at his home The 37-year-old, of Leopold Street, Derby, had volunteered for a ""lone wolf"" mission while messaging an IS commander on Facebook. ""You decided the means of your attack would involve you making an IED,"" Judge Michael Topolski QC said. ""You had not decided whether that would be made with an ordinary bomb or whether you could do more damage and more terror by exploding a device containing ricin."" He added that Mohammed had carefully and deliberately pulled El-Hassan in to the plot, to the point where her commitment was ""consistent and sustained"". It is not clear why Munir Mohammed was in the UK given he arrived illegally and, according to evidence in the trial, seemingly lied about having any kind of justifiable claim for asylum. But once he made that claim, he appeared to have entered legal limbo. He was placed in an immigration removal centre, but then sent to live in the Midlands. He then used false documents to work in a food factory - while flirting with the idea of making his own poisons. His application to stay in Britain was in a massive backlog of unresolved asylum cases known to officials as the ""not straightforward"" list. The Home Office, the ministry responsible for both immigration and national security, declined to say what happened to Munir Mohammed's case. But what's clear is he sat and waited. And as he waited, he began to plot. Derby terror plot: The online Casanova and his lover Mohammed, originally from Eritrea and who lived in Sudan for some time before coming to the UK, investigated making poison while working at a supermarket ready meals factory. The court heard he and El-Hassan, 33, of Willesden Lane, north-west London, had exchanged messages about ricin after meeting online. El-Hassan wrote on the dating website she was looking for a simple man whom she could ""vibe with on a spiritual and intellectual level"". By the spring of 2016 the pair were in regular contact on WhatsApp and had met more than once in a London park near El-Hassan's home. The mother-of-two advised fellow divorcee Mohammed on what chemicals he needed for the bomb. During sentencing, the judge highlighted Mohammed's ""vast store"" of IS propaganda depicting the ""abhorrent"" acts of murder, including nearly 26,000 images on his phone. El-Hassan never objected to being sent the material as her two children slept in her bedroom, and even asked for more, the judge said. Even though Mohammed introduced extremism in their relationship, El-Hassan ""embraced it and became more and more absorbed by it to the point she became an enthusiastic and encouraging partner"", he added. Couple guilty of plotting terror attack The Casanova and his lover behind terror plot Accused bomb plotter 'was married' Alleged bomb plotter 'sent gory videos' MP 'took up case of accused bomb plotter' Terror suspect 'pledged allegiance to IS' Online dating couple 'plotted bombing' Suspects deny plans for UK terror attack HM Courts Service List of Derbyshire roads closed as council issues key warning Bridge still closed as police 'astonished' after drivers move road closure signs Drug raids uncover large scale cannabis grows inside Chesterfield homes â with hundreds of plants seized by police Group of girls attacked in Derbyshire town centre takeaway â as police launch appeal to trace man in connection with incident Stonehouse Business Consultancy launches in High Peak The Royal Mint has launched a new Â£1,000 coin - and you won't believe how much it costs Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Women earn up to 43% less at BarclaysThe bank's boss, Jes Staley, says it has ""more work to do"" as the gender pay gap figures are released.1h42 minutes agoBusiness","Female employees earn up to 43.5% less at Barclays than men, according togender pay gap figures,externalit has submitted to the government. Only 28 of the 1,154 companies that have reported the figures have a higher median hourly pay gap than Barclays. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said it had ""more work to do"" so women could progress in financial services. However, Barclays said that it paid men and women in the same roles equally. The 43.5% average gender pay gap reflects its investment bank division, Barclays International. For its UK retail bank, women earn 14.2% less than men on average, while the figure is 29.9% for the holding company, Barclays Services. The bank has not produced an overall figure for the three divisions. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Select Committee, described the pay disparity at Barclays International as shocking, adding: ""Financial firms should be prepared to explain any gender pay gap that they may have."" Mr Staley said: ""Although female representation is growing at Barclays, we still have high proportions of women in more junior, lower paid roles and high proportions of men in senior, highly paid roles. ""There has been improvement across financial services but progress has been slow within the industry, so we support the objectives and intent of the UK government in introducing gender pay gap reporting to drive equality in both the workplace and in society more widely."" What is the gender pay gap? Men still earn more than women at most firms Of all financial and insurance companies that have submitted their figures, the median pay gap is 14.8%. The imbalance at Barclays UK was further highlighted by its pay quartile figures, with women accounting for 73% of the lowest-paid employees. Women's bonus pay at Barclays UK was 46.9% lower than that for men on the median measure. Chief executive Jes Staley says Barclays has ""more work to do"" Barclays is the first big bank to report its gender pay figures and chose to do so on the same dayits annual results were released. Women earn 38.4% less at Virgin Money, while insurer Aviva has a median pay gap of 27.6%. Both firms, along with Barclays, have said they pay men and women in the same roles equally. UK companies with 250 or more employees - about 9,000 firms - must calculate their gender pay gap andpublish it on a government website,externalby 4 April, or 30 March for the public sector. Dominie Moss, founder of The Return Hub, which places women returning from career breaks in financial services jobs, said: ""There's no silver bullet - for banks and City firms it's about getting more women established in senior executive roles, so they can in turn embed a culture that's more attuned to the needs of both women and men. That's going to be about changing managerial and recruitment practice."" Most firms pay men more than women What is the gender pay gap?

"Shape of Water accused of 'copying' plotThe Oscar-tipped film is accused of being ""in many ways identical"" to a Paul Zindel play.4h4 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","Sally Hawkins stars alongside Octavia Spencer in the film Oscar favouriteThe Shape of Water,externalhas been hit by a copyright legal case, with claims it ""brazenly"" copied the story of a 1969 play. Director Guillermo del Toro and the Fox Searchlight studio are being sued by the family of late Pulitzer-winning playwright Paul Zindel. They denied the allegations about thefilm,external, which is up for 13Oscars,external. The otherworldly film stars Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner who falls in love with an amphibious man. Review: The Shape of Water The Shape of Water leads Oscar nominations The director who wouldn't be silenced It has already won Golden Globes and its Oscar nominations include best director for del Toro and the prestigious best picture,leading the pack with 13 nominations. Hawkins is also up for best actress for her portrayal of Elisa Esposito. Votes are currently being cast for the awards, which take place in Los Angeles on 4 March. Guillermo del Toro, pictured on set, said he had not read or seen the play before making his film Del Toro has said he had never heard of the play before making The Shape of Water, and neither had any of his collaborators. Zindel's family sued the studio, director and others on Wednesday in a California court, saying the film is ""in many ways identical"" to his play,Let Me Hear You Whisper,external. The play tells the story of Helen, a ""little old cleaning lady"" newly hired to work in a laboratory where experiments are being carried out on dolphins. She develops a rapport with one of them and plays it music as it makes attempts to speak. Doug Jones stars as the amphibious creature Fox Searchlight said it would ""vigorously"" defend the ""ground-breaking and original film"". ""These claims from Mr Zindel's estate are baseless, wholly without merit and we will be filing a motion to dismiss,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Furthermore, the estate's complaint seems timed to coincide with the Academy Award voting cycle in order to pressure our studio to quickly settle."" Lawyer Marc Toberoff claimed in court there are at least 61 similarities between the two works, saying both are 1960s Cold War stories about an unmarried janitor and her relationship with an aquatic creature. In the case of the play, it is a dolphin, while in the film it's a humanoid creature with fins and gills. He said: ""The Shape Of Water, though presented to the public as a highly original work of fantasy/science fiction, in reality, brazenly copies the story, elements, characters, and themes from a work by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Paul Zindel."" Del Toro, who won the Golden Globe and Bafta awards for best director The case refers to an interview in which del Toro said author Daniel Kraus told him, in 2011, of an idea ""about a janitor that kidnaps an amphibian-man from a secret government facility"". Kraus, also a defendant in the case, is said to have come up with the idea as a teenager. Toberoff said that would have been in 1990 - the year a television adaptation of Zindel's play aired. His son David Zindel said: ""We are very grateful for the spontaneous outpouring on social media that first brought this injustice to our attention. ""This troubling matter was raised with Fox five weeks ago but was met with inertia. ""The glaring similarities between the film and our father's play are too extensive for us to ignore and so we had to act."" The family is seeking damages and costs. It's not the first time the film has been accused of plagiarism - earlier this year,the Netherlands Film Academy,externalruled The Shape of Water did not have any links to a short film called The Space Between Us, after some viewers claimed there were similarities.

Russian arrested over Euro 2016 attack,"Violence erupted in Marseilles ahead of the England Russia match in June 2016 A Russian football fan wanted for attacking an England fan during the Euro 2016 riots in Marseilles has been arrested in Munich. German police said they apprehended the 31-year-old suspect upon his arrival from Moscow. The suspect was not named. Police said his victim suffered fractured bones and injuries to the brain and lungs. He faces up to 15 years in jail in France for attempted homicide and grievous bodily harm. German police only identified the victim as a 51-year-old England fan. But Andrew Bache, from Portsmouth, was 51 when he was attacked during the tournament two years ago. He suffered severe brain injuries and had to be placed in an induced coma, from which he has since emerged. German federal police said the Russian suspect was identified following a joint investigation with British police over the course of almost a year and a half. Police said the suspect had been the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by French authorities late last year. He was arrested during a flight change at Munich airport, while on his way to Bilbao in Spain for a Europa League game. England and Russia fans clashed both inside and outside the stadium in June 2016 ""It seems he didn't count on the good co-operation of European law enforcement agencies,"" the police statement said. ""Now he's sitting in jail in Munich."" Euro 2016 'not a return to hardcore hooliganism' What Russian fans say about the Marseille violence What motivates Russian hooligans? German prosecutor Joachim Ettenhofer told Reuters news agency the suspect could be extradited to France in two weeks. ""These things usually go pretty quickly,"" he said. France jailed both Russia and England fans in the immediate aftermath of the Euro 2016 violence, and deported more than 20 others. The police officer credited with helping to save Mr Bache's life in 2016said people had described the scene as being similar to a zombie film. PC Stuart Dickerson saw ""about 150 Russian hooligans who were clearly trained in fighting"", wearing boxing gloves and gum-shields, and carrying metal bars and other weapons. ""It was like a load of locusts going through a cornfield,"" the English officer - on deployment in France - said. ""They were just randomly assaulting any England fan that was in their path.""

Shape of Water accused of 'copying' plot,"Sally Hawkins stars alongside Octavia Spencer in the film Oscar favouriteThe Shape of Water,externalhas been hit by a copyright legal case, with claims it ""brazenly"" copied the story of a 1969 play. Director Guillermo del Toro and the Fox Searchlight studio are being sued by the family of late Pulitzer-winning playwright Paul Zindel. They denied the allegations about thefilm,external, which is up for 13Oscars,external. The otherworldly film stars Sally Hawkins as a mute cleaner who falls in love with an amphibious man. Review: The Shape of Water The Shape of Water leads Oscar nominations The director who wouldn't be silenced It has already won Golden Globes and its Oscar nominations include best director for del Toro and the prestigious best picture,leading the pack with 13 nominations. Hawkins is also up for best actress for her portrayal of Elisa Esposito. Votes are currently being cast for the awards, which take place in Los Angeles on 4 March. Guillermo del Toro, pictured on set, said he had not read or seen the play before making his film Del Toro has said he had never heard of the play before making The Shape of Water, and neither had any of his collaborators. Zindel's family sued the studio, director and others on Wednesday in a California court, saying the film is ""in many ways identical"" to his play,Let Me Hear You Whisper,external. The play tells the story of Helen, a ""little old cleaning lady"" newly hired to work in a laboratory where experiments are being carried out on dolphins. She develops a rapport with one of them and plays it music as it makes attempts to speak. Doug Jones stars as the amphibious creature Fox Searchlight said it would ""vigorously"" defend the ""ground-breaking and original film"". ""These claims from Mr Zindel's estate are baseless, wholly without merit and we will be filing a motion to dismiss,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Furthermore, the estate's complaint seems timed to coincide with the Academy Award voting cycle in order to pressure our studio to quickly settle."" Lawyer Marc Toberoff claimed in court there are at least 61 similarities between the two works, saying both are 1960s Cold War stories about an unmarried janitor and her relationship with an aquatic creature. In the case of the play, it is a dolphin, while in the film it's a humanoid creature with fins and gills. He said: ""The Shape Of Water, though presented to the public as a highly original work of fantasy/science fiction, in reality, brazenly copies the story, elements, characters, and themes from a work by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Paul Zindel."" Del Toro, who won the Golden Globe and Bafta awards for best director The case refers to an interview in which del Toro said author Daniel Kraus told him, in 2011, of an idea ""about a janitor that kidnaps an amphibian-man from a secret government facility"". Kraus, also a defendant in the case, is said to have come up with the idea as a teenager. Toberoff said that would have been in 1990 - the year a television adaptation of Zindel's play aired. His son David Zindel said: ""We are very grateful for the spontaneous outpouring on social media that first brought this injustice to our attention. ""This troubling matter was raised with Fox five weeks ago but was met with inertia. ""The glaring similarities between the film and our father's play are too extensive for us to ignore and so we had to act."" The family is seeking damages and costs. It's not the first time the film has been accused of plagiarism - earlier this year,the Netherlands Film Academy,externalruled The Shape of Water did not have any links to a short film called The Space Between Us, after some viewers claimed there were similarities.

"University pension boss's Â£82,000 pay riseThe university pension scheme, with a Â£6bn deficit, has two staff earning over Â£1m.1han hour agoFamily & Education","The pension scheme at the centre of a Â£6bn deficit row paid more than 100 of its own staff more than Â£100,000 The chief executive of the lecturers' pension scheme atthe centre of a university strikereceived a 17% pay rise worth an extra Â£82,000 this year. Bill Galvin's pay package had risen from Â£484,000 to Â£566,000, said a spokeswoman for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). Running costs for the university pension scheme were Â£125m per year - including two staff earning over Â£1m. Mr Galvin has described the pension scheme as ""excellent value"". Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, said: ""Whatever happens with this dispute, it is time for a proper look at what is happening with USS. ""Staff forced out on strike today will no doubt look at the salaries enjoyed by some of those in charge of the scheme and wonder what exactly they are doing to justify the salary and safeguard the pensions."" University employers have claimed there is a Â£6bn deficit in the pension scheme - and although unions have challenged the size of the shortfall, they say proposals to address the deficit will mean cutting their retirement income by Â£10,000 per year. The pension scheme is run by professional managers and a board including university leaders and representatives of the UCU union. Lecturers strike in pension dispute Emotions run high on the picket lines University strike: What's it all about? Students' compensation bid for university strike Strikes at Northern Ireland universities Among board members is Dame Glynis Breakwell, who announcedshe was stepping down as vice-chancellor of the University of Bathafter a dispute over excessive pay for senior university staff. University staff at Cambridge were part of the protest over pension cuts There had been complaints about ""fat cat"" salaries for senior staff while lecturers' pay had been capped, but the head of the lecturers' pension scheme this year received a 17% increase. The running costs of the pension scheme for the last year of accounts, ending March 2017, were Â£124.9m, an increase of more than Â£6m on the previous year. Staff costs were Â£61m, including two staff earning between Â£1m and Â£1.25m, with 113 staff earning more than Â£100,000 - 18 more than in the previous year. The numbers earning between Â£100,000 and Â£150,000 had almost doubled in a year, from 22 to 40, a further 21 staff were earning between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000 and five were earning between Â£400,000 and Â£450,000. Chief executive Bill Galvin, with salary and benefits worth Â£566,000, was not the highest paid, with the top earners thought to be investment staff. Mr Galvin, writing in the annual accounts, said that ""no doubt that overall, USS provides excellent value for money for the products and services we provide"". A spokeswoman for the Â£60bn university pension scheme said it offered ""above-average investment performance at below-average cost"". ""Our investment performance has been consistently good - reducing the contributions that would otherwise be required of members and employers. ""USS is focused on delivering value for its members and its investment costs, relative to assets under management,"" said the spokeswoman, who said the running costs of the scheme were Â£61m lower than its peers, according to independent benchmarking. Universities UK and the Department for Education said such costs were a matter for the pension scheme.

"Brits 2018: The real winners and losersFrom best mum to worst metaphor, these are the only Brit awards that really count.12h12 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Stormzy and Dua Lipa both took home two trophies at theBrits,external, but there's always more to the show than the awards. On a night of joy and disappointment, X-rated confessions and spectacular performances, who were the real winners and losers at the O2 Arena? So much dress, in fact, that it took two or three people to move it around. Dua,external's baby pink tiered Giambattista Valli gown was an extravaganza of ruffles - but she wasn't being precious about it. ""There's a lot of it, so if it gets damaged I can pick up a piece from somewhere else."" Emma Bunton,external's kids were disappointed they couldn't come to the Brit Awards, so she threw them their own awards ceremony on Tuesday. ""We had orange juice, they did a little performance, and they won best male and best group."" He might have sold 12.8 million albums last year, butEd Sheeran,externalwas shut out of the Brits. His only prize was the global success award, which recognises commercial success, while best male, best album, best single and best video all went to other artists. There's certainly a sense that the industry isn't on his side right now - he was similarly overlooked at the Grammys - but it's hard to work out what he's done wrong. Perhaps voters felt his latest album, Ã·, was too safe, or cynically commercial, to deserve a prize. Or maybe they just really, really hated Galway Girl. Either way, it feels odd that the star couldn't catch a break in his home country. During the ceremony, pop coupleCheryl,externalandLiam Payne,externalwere confronted by presenter Jack Whitehall, who had a question about Liam's upcoming performance withRita Ora,external. ""You're performing later, you're doing a song from the Fifty Shades of Grey movie,"" he said. ""Sounds pretty saucy, is there a safe word?"" Liam gallantly threw the question to Cheryl, saying: ""She knows that."" Without batting an eyelid, she leaned into the microphone and said two words. ""Don't stop"". Stormzy steals the show at Brit Awards Brit Awards 2018: Relive the ceremony Brit Awards 2018: The best pictures Paloma Faith: More men should have worn white roses See the full list of winners and nominees Stormzy,external's performance was a show-stopper, and not just because it literally came at the end of the ceremony. Still beaming after winning best album, the star showed the full range of his talents in a performance that encompassed the heartfelt gospel of Blinded By Your Grace and the tongue-twisting wordplay of Big For Your Boots. But in the middle, he did something special - a ferocious freestyle verse that took aim at thegovernment's response to the Grenfell fire. This video can not be played Brit Awards 2018: Stormzy explains why he spoke up about Grenfell ""Yo, Theresa May, where's the money for Grenfell?"" he rapped. ""What, you thought we forgot about Grenfell? ""You're criminals, and you got the cheek to call us savages? You should do some jail time, you should pay some damages. We should burn your house down and see if you can manage this?"" In true Stormzy style, though, the rap wove the personal into the political, and he went on to talk about his pride in seeing other black British stars succeeding, including model Jourdan Dunn and actor Daniel Kaluuya. ""When Dan Kaluuya won the Bafta, I could have cried,"" he grinned. Speaking to the BBC afterwards, the rapper said he wanted to use his platform ""to say something bigger"" than ""yeah, it's the Stormzy show"". ""This isn't about me. It's about Grenfell, it's about all the things I said in that lyric."" Technically this happened three years ago but we only found out about it tonight, and it's our public duty to inform you thatTaylor Swift,externalnarrowly escaped a black eye at the Brit Awards. Mike Kerr fromRoyal Blood,externalrevealed the incident, while grassing up his musical partner Ben Thatcher as the culprit. ""We went into her dressing room to say hello, and Ben opened a bottle of champagne,"" he recalled. ""The cork nearly hit her in the face and knocked her out"". ""I get a little overexcited sometimes,"" said Ben, sheepishly. Out on the red carpet, we introduced disco legendNile Rodgers,externalto EsteHaim,external, who essentially exploded with glee. ""You are the funkiest man I've ever heard,"" she gushed as the Chic guitarist greeted her with a hug. ""I'm literallyâ¦ I wish I was wearing a diaper right now,"" she said.

The video for Dua Lipa's New Rules is unquestionably brilliant. Its message of women supporting women chimes perfectly with the times; and the iconic choreography inspired hundreds of tributes and covers. Last week, it clocked up its one billionth play on YouTube. At 22, Dua is now the youngest female artist ever to reach that milestone. So why wasn't it in the running for best British video? Because the Brits opens that category up to a fan vote, which meant Dua was dumped from the longlist in favour of multiple videos by former members of One Direction. In the end, the not-very-good video forHarry Styles's,externalnot-very-good Sign Of The Times won. A complete travesty. Hosting the Brits is a poisoned chalice. The audience aren't listening, the artists aren't interested and the script is perennially awful. But, amazingly,Jack Whitehall,externalpulled it out of the bag with a series of acid-tongued one-liners. Like these ones: On Rag 'N' Bone Man:""The man with the voice of an angel and the beard of a wizard"". On Sam Smith:""If you like Adele songs, but find them too upbeat, you're in for a treat as Sam Smith will be performing!"" On The Voice judges:""It's a knight of the realm, an Oscar-winner and... Olly Murs."" Jack Whitehall's best one-liners at the Brits Kendrick Lamar,externalperformed Feel, a song about how stardom left him feeling isolated, while a dancer smashed an orange Lamborghini with a baseball bat. His intention was to make a statement about the emptiness of status symbols and the trappings of fame.

"British Gas owner to cut 4,000 jobs","Centrica, which owns British Gas, is cutting 4,000 jobs, after what its chief executive called a ""weak"" end to 2017. Iain Conn said plans for a price cap in the UK was one reason for the job losses, just over half of which will be in the UK. The energy supplier, which also operates in North America and Ireland, said group profits fell 17% to Â£1.25bn. British Gas lost 750,000 domestic customers in 2017. That amounts to a fall of about 9%, with the company now left with 7.8 million UK domestic customers. Centrica said the job losses, which are part of an extended cost-cutting programme, would fall mainly in its UK energy supply business. Investment in technology and the simplification of core business processes would result in cost savings of Â£1.25bn per year by 2020, the firm said. It also expects to create around 1,000 additional roles. Mr Conn told the BBC the job losses were also due to ""intense"" competition and partly due to customers using more digital services. But he said government plans to limit what firms can charge customers also played a part. ""There is a link between our cost efficiency programme and preparing for any price cap in the UK. ""We've got to be competitive and this measure means we've got to drive more efficiency."" This video can not be played Centrica chief Iain Conn says the firm will not pursue customers if it means making a loss Unison, the largest union representing white collar workers at British Gas, said the firm needed to alter its strategy. The union's national energy officer, Matt Lay, said: ""Staff quite simply will be devastated. ""Although Centrica has already shed thousands of jobs, it's nowhere near out of the woods."" Energy bill price cap 'urgently needed' Energy switch trial to cut 50,000 bills Scottish Power loses 200,000 customers Mr Conn said that the prospect of the price cap had also hit the company's shares. Centrica's shares have lost more than half of their value over the past year as politicians focused on ways to limit the cost of energy to ordinary consumers. Around 12 million UK households are charged some form of default tariff for their energy, which can cost hundreds of pounds more per year than the cheapest deals on offer. The government is planning to cap the standard variable tariffs. Mr Conn said he fundamentally disagreed with plans to cap prices, arguing it would reduce choice. ""We will clearly be wanting to discuss all the details with the government. We don't agree with it. We hope it doesn't happen because we think that ultimately it will be bad for customers,"" he said. Despite the fall in profits for Centrica Group as a whole, British Gas, which supplies energy to UK homes and businesses, saw profits rise 3% to Â£572m. Centrica said that the total number of customer accounts at British Gas fell by 1,376,000, or 10%, during 2017, although it said 70% of those accounts were loss-making. As many of its customers have more than one account - for example, many households have both gas and electricity accounts - this decline amounted to the loss of 750,000 customers. Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital, said Centrica was making good progress on its cost-savings programme but the loss of customers remained at the heart of Centrica's problems. ""Management has to find a way to staunch the flow of losses, which seems to be getting worse, not better,"" he said. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: ""Plans to take another Â£500m off the cost base will help keep the wolf from the door, but cost-cutting clearly can't continue forever. ""With political pressure ramping up and competition intensifying, there's definitely more headwinds than tailwinds.""

Women earn 43% less at Barclays,"Female employees earn up to 43.5% less at Barclays than men, according togender pay gap figures,externalit has submitted to the government. Only 28 of the 1,154 companies that have reported the figures have a higher median hourly pay gap than Barclays. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said it had ""more work to do"" so women could progress in financial services. However, Barclays said that it paid men and women in the same roles equally. The 43.5% average gender pay gap reflects its investment bank division, Barclays International. For its UK retail bank, women earn 14.2% less than men on average, while the figure is 29.9% for the holding company, Barclays Services. The bank has not produced an overall figure for the three divisions. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Select Committee, described the pay disparity at Barclays International as shocking, adding: ""Financial firms should be prepared to explain any gender pay gap that they may have."" Mr Staley said: ""Although female representation is growing at Barclays, we still have high proportions of women in more junior, lower paid roles and high proportions of men in senior, highly paid roles. ""There has been improvement across financial services but progress has been slow within the industry, so we support the objectives and intent of the UK government in introducing gender pay gap reporting to drive equality in both the workplace and in society more widely."" What is the gender pay gap? Men still earn more than women at most firms Of all financial and insurance companies that have submitted their figures, the median pay gap is 14.8%. The imbalance at Barclays UK was further highlighted by its pay quartile figures, with women accounting for 73% of the lowest-paid employees. Women's bonus pay at Barclays UK was 46.9% lower than that for men on the median measure.

Barclays pays women 43% less than men,"Female employees earn up to 43.5% less at Barclays than men, according togender pay gap figures,externalit has submitted to the government. Only 28 of the 1,154 companies that have reported the figures have a higher median hourly pay gap than Barclays. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said it had ""more work to do"" so women could progress in financial services. However, Barclays said that it paid men and women in the same roles equally. The 43.5% average gender pay gap reflects its investment bank division, Barclays International. For its UK retail bank, women earn 14.2% less than men on average, while the figure is 29.9% for the holding company, Barclays Services. The bank has not produced an overall figure for the three divisions. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Select Committee, described the pay disparity at Barclays International as shocking, adding: ""Financial firms should be prepared to explain any gender pay gap that they may have."" Mr Staley said: ""Although female representation is growing at Barclays, we still have high proportions of women in more junior, lower paid roles and high proportions of men in senior, highly paid roles. ""There has been improvement across financial services but progress has been slow within the industry, so we support the objectives and intent of the UK government in introducing gender pay gap reporting to drive equality in both the workplace and in society more widely."" What is the gender pay gap? Men still earn more than women at most firms Of all financial and insurance companies that have submitted their figures, the median pay gap is 14.8%. The imbalance at Barclays UK was further highlighted by its pay quartile figures, with women accounting for 73% of the lowest-paid employees. Women's bonus pay at Barclays UK was 46.9% lower than that for men on the median measure.

Warning over fake piercing magnet crazeOne 12-year-old boy had to have part of his bowel removed after swallowing the magnetic balls.,"The powerful attraction between the magnets ripped through Freddie Webster's stomach Two children needed life-saving surgery after accidentally swallowing powerful magnetic balls which are being used to mimic body piercings in a new craze. One of the youngsters, Freddie Webster, 12, had to have part of his bowel removed as the tiny balls were ripping a hole in the wall of his stomach. A third child, aged four, also swallowed the balls but managed to pass them out of the body naturally. The consultant who saw them has warned parents to be aware of the new craze. Read more stories from across East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire All three youngsters have been treated at Hull Royal Infirmary over the past three months. Doctors have warned of the life-threatening risks of the ball-bearings The ball-bearing magnets are understood to have become a craze among children who use them as pretend piercings on areas such as their mouth or tongue. However, doctors have warned if swallowed, they can cause serious damage by burrowing into the stomach and intestines. In Freddie's case, he had put one of the 3mm diameter balls inside his mouth and the other outside but accidentally swallowed it. The balls can burrow into the stomach and intestines Hours later, he swallowed another two and began experiencing stomach pains. He was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary where he underwent a four-and-a-half hour operation. Surgeons removed 10cms of his bowel to enable them to extract the balls. His mother Sarah Webster, from Driffield, said: ""The surgeon came out and said that Freddie was stable but very poorly and told us the next 24 hours would be critical."" Freddie has made a good recovery but doctors fear the next child may not be so lucky Consultant paediatric surgeon Sanja Besarovic has written to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in the hope a more public official warning can be made. ""We have been able to save these children but I'm growing increasingly concerned that this is happening often,"" she said. ""Both of the children recovered well after surgery but the next child may not be so lucky.""

Saudis announce $64bn entertainment fund,"Other measures, like allowing cinemas to be opened, have already been announced Saudi Arabia says it will invest $64bn (Â£46bn) in developing its entertainment industry over the next decade. The head of the General Entertainment Authority said 5,000 events were planned this year alone, including those by Maroon 5 and Cirque du Soleil. Construction of the country's first opera house has also begun in Riyadh. The investment is part of a social and economic reform programme, known as Vision 2030, unveiled two years ago Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The 32 year old wants to diversify the economy and reduce the kingdom's reliance on oil, including by increasing household spending on culture and entertainment. In December, the government lifted a ban on commercial cinemas. Is Saudi Arabia on the cusp of change? Saudis plan to build $500bn mega city Profile: Prince Mohammed bin Salman General Entertainment Authority chief Ahmed bin Aqeel al-Khatib said: ""In the past, investors would go outside the kingdom to produce their work, and then showcase it back in Saudi Arabia. ""Today, change will happen and everything related to entertainment will be done here."" ""God willing, you will see a real change by 2020."" In January, circus troupe Cirque Eloize performed in Saudi Arabia for the first time A large entertainment city near Riyadh, roughly the size of Las Vegas, is already plannedas the country aims to boost its tourism sector. It follows a range of other firsts for the conservative Gulf kingdom - includingallowing women spectators to attend football matches last monthand announcing that women would be permitted to drive from June. Last year, Prince Mohammed declared his ambition that Saudi Arabia would once again be ""a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions, traditions and people"". Seventy per cent of the population were under 30 and they wanted a ""life in which our religion translates to tolerance, to our traditions of kindness"", he said.

N Korea to send general to Olympics,"South Korea says the visit of Kim Yong-chol (pictured) will be a chance to improve North-South relations North Korea will send one of its highest ranking figures, General Kim Yong-chol, to the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Gen Kim was the North's intelligence chief, and is believed to have plotted several attacks on South Korea. North Korea's attendance at the Winter Olympics is seen as a thaw in tense relations between the two Koreas. However, there are concerns Pyongyang has been using the event simply to improve its international image. US President Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, will be leading the US delegation to Pyeongchang over the weekend. However, South Korean officials say there will be no formal meeting between North Korea and the US at the event. North Korea baby rumours fascinate South Are North and South Korea friends again? Pence and N Korea planned Olympic meeting Gen Kim leads North Korea's department for inter-Korea relations, and used to head its spying agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The agency was accused of masterminding attacks on South Korea, including the sinking of the Cheonan navy ship which killed 46 South Korean sailors in 2010. His delegation will stay in South Korea for three days and is expected to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Earlier this month, US Vice-President Mike Pence attended the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, while North Korea leader Kim Jong-un's sister Kim Yo-jong represented Pyongyang. Mike Pence was seated directly in front of the North Korean delegation at the opening ceremony US officials say they were due to meet during the Games, but North Korea pulled out at the last moment. North Korea has been widely condemned for its repeated testing of nuclear weapons and conventional missiles. The US - among others - has warned against easing pressure on the North Koreans to abandon their nuclear programme and improve their human rights situation.

UK economic growth revised downwards,"The UK economy expanded by less than previously thought in the last three months of 2017, official figures say. GDP grew by 0.4% in the October-to-December period, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, down from the initial estimate of 0.5%. The revision was due to slower growth in production industries, the ONS said. In 2017 as a whole, the economy grew by 1.7%, also slightly lower than previously thought and the weakest since 2012. The ONS had previously estimated that the economy grew by 1.8% last year. The statistics body said that household spending grew by 1.8% last year, also the slowest annual rate since 2012. It said the slowdown was partly because of shoppers facing higher prices in stores. ""A number of very small revisions to mining, energy generation and service were enough to see a slight downward revision to quarterly growth overall,"" said ONS statistician Darren Morgan. Kamal Ahmed on the economy: Three better things Five key messages from the Bank of England One drag on the UK economy at the end of last year wasthe shutdown of the Forties pipeline systemfor a large part of December 2017. The closure of one of the UK's most important oil pipelines cost about Â£20m a day in lost activity, according to Oil and Gas UK. Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit, said that some areas of the UK economy looked ""worryingly weak"" in the final months of last year. The data suggested the construction industry is in recession, business investment was stagnant and household spending was seeing only ""modest"" growth, he said. Households have been squeezed by rising inflation coinciding with weak wage growth. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said that would hold back growth this year to 1.5%. ""This would not be disastrous by any means, but would place us towards the bottom of the G7 growth league table together with Italy and Japan, rather than at the top with Germany and the US. The UK's year-on-year growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 1.4%, making it the slowest growing of the world's wealthy nations (comparable figures for Canada are not yet available). The UK is also growing more slowly than the eurozone. The Bank of England is a bit more optimistic about growth prospects. Last month, it raised its growth forecast for the UK economy to 1.8% this year, from its previous forecast of 1.6% made in November. At the time, the Bank indicated that the pace of interest rate increases in the UK could accelerate if the economy remained on its current track. One nagging problem for the UK has been a lack of productivity growth since the financial crisis of 2007. But on Tuesday, official data showed signs of improvement. Output per hour rose 0.8% in the three months to December, the Office for National Statistics said. It follows growth of 0.9% in the previous period. That was the the strongest two-quarter period of productivity growth since the recession of 2008. There was also a better-than-expected rise in wages. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.5% year-on-year. Unemployment edged higher at the end of last year, but still remains low at 4.4%.

May heads to Chequers for Brexit talks,"Theresa May and 11 senior ministers have been thrashing out the UK's approach to Brexit in an eight-hour discussion at the PM's country retreat. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said everyone is said to have left Chequers happy implying ""baby steps forwards not a huge breakthrough"". The PM will set out the position in a speech next week, after a discussion by the full cabinet. There have been clear differences between ministers over the way forward. But Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told the prime minister had ""played a blinder"" and persuaded Brexiteers to shift their position. However, a cabinet Brexiteer source had said ""divergence has won the day"" with mutual recognition between the UK and EU on goods in future, rather than the UK being forced to stick to EU rules.

Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said on BBC Question Time the cabinet would agree on the Brexit position, following the Chequers talks. Laura Kuenssberg - a happy ending? UK publishes transition plans Labour's policy 'evolves' on customs union What will Brexit mean for Britain's overseas territories? Brexit: All you need to know ""What I can say to you is the outcome of those discussions will come to cabinet in the next few days, and late next week the prime minister will make a statement, a speech and outline what that position is."" Pressed on whether everyone in the cabinet would agree with it, he replied: ""Absolutely, yes."" Official cars make they way towards Chequers near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire The Brexit sub-committee includes key figures such as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond, who were on opposite sides of the EU referendum argument in 2016. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister and cabinet ministers met at Chequers for eight hours. ""They held discussions including about the automotive sector led by Greg Clark, agrifood led by Michael Gove, digital trade by Liam Fox and a discussion on the overall future economic partnership that was led by the prime minister."" Chief Whip Julian Smith and senior UK diplomats Tim Barrow and Ed Llewellyn were among those present, alongside the cabinet's Brexit sub-committee. Cream of sweetcorn soup with a ham hock croquette Guinness short rib of Dexter Beef with onions and parsnip mash Lemon tart with raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries Mrs May still has to get any agreement through the whole cabinet on Tuesday, through her party - and then through 27 other EU member states. Documents suggest European Commission negotiators will not approve of a UK proposal that seeks to select which EU rules to stick to post-Brexit and which to diverge from. Slidespublished online,externalby the commission say such an approach would be ""not compatible with the principles"" set out in the EU's own guidelines and posed a risk to the ""proper functioning"" of its single market. But an EU diplomat told the BBC ""we are hoping for a relationship that is as close as possible to the existing relationship"", adding that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier should be given a mandate ""to explore all possibilities"". Before the final arrangements with the EU kick in, a temporary transition period is planned - although the details have yet to be negotiated. On Wednesday, the UK set out its plans for how this ""status quo"" transition phase should work. The document suggests the UK will abide by new EU laws and be involved in talks on future fishing quotas, but will not be able to sign trade deals without the EU's permission. It also says the period should last as long as it takes to ""prepare and implement the new processes and new systems"". No 10 denied this meant it would be longer than the planned two years. But Sir Bill Cash, chairman of the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, warned that the UK could face an extra Â£4bn-Â£5bn Brexit ""divorce bill"" if the post-withdraw transition period extends beyond the EU's preferred end date of 31 December 2020. He said that the current Â£35-39bn agreement was intended to cover to the end of the current EU budget period at the end of 2020. For Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would like to see ""a customs union"" option on the table, which would ""solve some of the issues around Northern Ireland"" and enable the UK to influence future trade negotiations. Taking questions after a speech in London, he also said Labour would rather have a general election than a second referendum on Britain's EU membership because ""there needs to be a wider debate"" about the UK's future relationship with Europe. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry also told LBC that while Brexit meant the UK could not be in the customs union, a new agreement was needed: ""That we think is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union."" It could mean the PM faces the prospect of a Commons rebellion as Conservative MP Anna Soubry said she had cross-party support for an amendment to the trade bill, calling for the government to form ""a"" customs union with the EU after Brexit.

"University pension boss Â£82,000 pay rise","The pension scheme at the centre of a Â£6bn deficit row paid more than 100 of its own staff more than Â£100,000 The chief executive of the lecturers' pension scheme atthe centre of a university strikereceived a 17% pay rise worth an extra Â£82,000 this year. Bill Galvin's pay package had risen from Â£484,000 to Â£566,000, said a spokeswoman for the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). Running costs for the university pension scheme were Â£125m per year - including two staff earning over Â£1m. Mr Galvin has described the pension scheme as ""excellent value"". Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, said: ""Whatever happens with this dispute, it is time for a proper look at what is happening with USS. ""Staff forced out on strike today will no doubt look at the salaries enjoyed by some of those in charge of the scheme and wonder what exactly they are doing to justify the salary and safeguard the pensions."" University employers have claimed there is a Â£6bn deficit in the pension scheme - and although unions have challenged the size of the shortfall, they say proposals to address the deficit will mean cutting their retirement income by Â£10,000 per year. The pension scheme is run by professional managers and a board including university leaders and representatives of the UCU union. Lecturers strike in pension dispute Emotions run high on the picket lines University strike: What's it all about? Students' compensation bid for university strike Strikes at Northern Ireland universities Among board members is Dame Glynis Breakwell, who announcedshe was stepping down as vice-chancellor of the University of Bathafter a dispute over excessive pay for senior university staff. University staff at Cambridge were part of the protest over pension cuts There had been complaints about ""fat cat"" salaries for senior staff while lecturers' pay had been capped, but the head of the lecturers' pension scheme this year received a 17% increase. The running costs of the pension scheme for the last year of accounts, ending March 2017, were Â£124.9m, an increase of more than Â£6m on the previous year. Staff costs were Â£61m, including two staff earning between Â£1m and Â£1.25m, with 113 staff earning more than Â£100,000 - 18 more than in the previous year. The numbers earning between Â£100,000 and Â£150,000 had almost doubled in a year, from 22 to 40, a further 21 staff were earning between Â£150,000 and Â£200,000 and five were earning between Â£400,000 and Â£450,000. Chief executive Bill Galvin, with salary and benefits worth Â£566,000, was not the highest paid, with the top earners thought to be investment staff. Mr Galvin, writing in the annual accounts, said that ""no doubt that overall, USS provides excellent value for money for the products and services we provide"". A spokeswoman for the Â£60bn university pension scheme said it offered ""above-average investment performance at below-average cost"". ""Our investment performance has been consistently good - reducing the contributions that would otherwise be required of members and employers. ""USS is focused on delivering value for its members and its investment costs, relative to assets under management,"" said the spokeswoman, who said the running costs of the scheme were Â£61m lower than its peers, according to independent benchmarking. Universities UK and the Department for Education said such costs were a matter for the pension scheme.

Lectures cancelled in university strike,"Strikers are angry about changes to their pension There have been pickets on campuses as university staff begin a strike in more than 50 universities, in a dispute over pensions. Lecturers have walked out at universities including Oxford and Cambridge at the beginning of a month-long strike campaign. Petitions signed by 80,000 students, many backing the lecturers, are demanding refunds for lost teaching. Universities minister Sam Gyimah has called for more negotiations. But Mr Gyimah says students ""deserve to receive the education that they are paying for. For many, this is a vital time in their studies"". This video can not be played University strikes: What do students think? Members of the University and College Union are striking because changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme will leave a typical lecturer almost Â£10,000 a year worse off in retirement, they say. Younger academics could lose almost half of their total retirement income, says the union. But the employers' group Universities UK says the scheme has a deficit of more than Â£6bn which it cannot ignore. ""This industrial action is targeted at students. It will be young people and the next generation of students who will also suffer if their education deteriorates because employers are forced to make cuts to pay more into pensions,"" said a Universities UK spokesman. However, there are indications that UUK may be ready to re-open talks on the issue. UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: ""We have been calling for talks for weeks either directly or through Acas, so if UUK are willing to now meet without preconditions with a view to resolving this dispute this good news."" Under the proposed pension plan, the USS will change from a defined benefit scheme, giving members a guaranteed income in retirement, to a defined contribution scheme, where pensions are subject to changes in the stock market. Lecturers say the changes could cost them Â£10,000 a year in retirement The union says the existing scheme is performing well and UUK's determination to push through the changes and refusal to compromise has left them no alternative but to strike. ""Staff are angry and significant disruption on campuses across the UK now looks inevitable,"" said UCU general secretary Sally Hunt. The industrial action comes as figures suggest university bosses took home pay packages worth more than Â£268,000 on average last year. The Times Higher Education analysis of university financial accounts shows UK vice-chancellors saw their pay rise by just over Â£10,000 on average (4%) in 2016-17 - nearly four times the 1.1% increase awarded to staff. University strike: What's it all about? Students' compensation bid for university strike Strikes at Northern Ireland universities At London's City University, senior law lecturer Keith Simpson said the pensions proposals would devastate academics' living standards in retirement. ""They're not particularly well paid but they do have the benefits of some certainty that when they retire they will have a reasonable pension,"" he said. ""Under the proposals that are being put forward, that's gone. There is no certainty whatsoever and really we think this is a stand we've got to make."" The union estimates that over half a million teaching hours will be lost during an escalating four-week strike programme: week one - staff at 57 universities walk out this Thursday and Friday week two - the 57 will be joined by staff at four more institutions on a three-day strike from Monday weeks three and four - staff a total of 64 universities will strike for nine days Members will refuse to reschedule classes lost on strike days. Some students support the action, but others are angry Students at about 30 universities have signed petitions asking for refunds. At King's College London, petition organiser Robert Liow, a third year law student, said that if universities refused refunds they would be effectively profiting from the dispute as they would not be paying lecturers on strike days. ""I believe education is a public good and not a service to be sold - but we are being treated as consumers. ""If they insist on making us pay, we will insist on our money back."" Little Mix singer criticised for wearing dreads 'I took my wife's name - my boss refuses to accept it' Call to make 'upskirting' an offence City University's petition asks for the amount saved by not paying striking lecturers to be divided among the students affected. Katie Walters, co-organiser ofthe Cardiff University petition, said she feared the dispute could drag on into the summer term, affecting final exams and dissertations. ""Although we fully support the lecturers - they work so hard and deserve good pensions - this is a major disruption to our studies."" Feelings are also running high among students at universities without petitions. Georgia Davies at St Andrews fears the dispute will mean pickets outside university buildings, limiting access to libraries and potentially affecting her final degree result. ""I really don't fancy pushing past lecturers who are losing tens of thousands of pounds just to get a book out. ""We are being disadvantaged again. If I don't get a good 2:1, what's the point?"" she asked. Universities UK said institutions were doing all they could to minimise the impact of the industrial action on students before they reached the stage of claiming compensation. UUK called the strike action ""disappointing"" and said: ""The changes proposed will make the scheme secure, and sustainable, safeguarding the future of universities. ""University staff will still have a valuable pension scheme, with employer contributions of 18% of salary, double the private sector average,"" said a UUK spokesman. The proposed changes will affect staff at 68 older universities. Staff at post-1992 universities are members of a different pension scheme.

Former leader Henry Bolton quits UKIP,"UKIP says ousted leader Henry Bolton has now quit the party. The announcement came as Mr Bolton made a joint appearance with girlfriend Jo Marney on ITV's This Morning programme. The pair insisted they were not ""private racists"" after being confronted with messages posted by Ms Marney on social media, including her description of Grenfell Tower as ""a nest of illegal immigrants"". Asked if Ms Marney was worth losing his job over, Mr Bolton said: ""Yes."" But the 54-year-old blamed rivals in UKIP for using his relationship with the 25-year-old model, and the controversy around her social-media messages, to get rid him for political reasons. Ex-UKIP leader back with girlfriend He was also read a lengthy statement from his wife of 11 years, Tatiana Smurova-Bolton, whom he left shortly before Christmas. ""The past few months have been horrendous for me and my family,"" the statement said. ""Rather than trying to protect the privacy of the children he hurt so badly, my still-husband has given countless interviews proclaiming his feelings for his lover while still being legally married."" Mr Bolton claimed ""people within the party"" had ""aggravated the situation"" but added: ""I have brought about a situation which has caused a lot of hurt and distress and I am very, very sorry for that."" He defended Ms Marney over the message she had posted about Grenfell Tower, saying it had been taken out of context, and there was a debate to be had about illegal immigration. Ms Marney said ""the language that I used was not good"" but she had not meant to ""cause offence"". Asked about the private WhatsApp messages about Prince Harry's fiancee, Meghan Markle, who she said would ""taint"" the Royal Family, she said: ""My comments were disgusting - they were meant to be shocking."" But she had ""never intended"" the messages to be made public and they ""don't reflect my views"". ""Who can realistically say they have never said anything offensive in private?"" asked Ms Marney. Asked if the couple were ""private racists"", Mr Bolton said: ""No of course not."" Mr Bolton was voted out as party leader at a special meeting of UKIP members at the weekend, five months after his leadership victory. Interim UKIP leader Gerard Batten said Mr Bolton's resignation ""will draw a line under a sad period"" for the party. But he said it ""will allow us to concentrate on our core duty of representing the millions that have voted for us, and the 17.4 million whose decision in the referendum is being betrayed by a political class, especially the leadership of both the Conservatives and Labour"". He added: ""On a personal level, I have written to Henry expressing my and the party's best wishes in whatever it is that he chooses to do next'.""

Syria neighbours in fear of war - Iran,"This video can not be played Mr Araghchi said Iran was working to reduce tension in the Syrian rebel-held area of the Eastern Ghouta Iran's deputy foreign minister says the situation with its ally Syria is ""very complicated"" amid growing concern a wider regional war could erupt. ""Fear of war is everywhere in our region,"" Abbas Araghchi told the BBC. It comes amid warnings by Israel and the US over Iran's presence in Syria. Mr Araghchi told the BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet that Iran was there to fight terrorism, and dismissed warnings about Iran's intentions as ""propaganda"". Full transcript: Abbas Araghchi interview Israel warns Iran after strikes in Syria Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? ""Just imagine if we were not there. Now you would have Daesh [the Islamic State group] in Damascus, and maybe in Beirut and other places,"" the minister said. He deplored the suffering in the Damascus suburb of Ghoutawhere Syrian bombing in the past few days has killed scores of civilians. Mr Araghchi said Iran was in Syria to fight ""terrorist elements"" at the invitation of the Syrian government, and its alliance with Syria and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah aimed to ""combat the hegemonic policies"" of Israel. The deputy foreign minister refused to confirm that Iran had sent a drone into Israeli airspace from Syria earlier this month. He said the drone belonged to the Syrian army. This video can not be played Mr Netanyahu said Iran was falsely denying that it sent a drone into Israeli territory last week An Israeli warplane targeting Iranian sites in retaliation was shot down by Syrian air defences. This week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brandished what he said was part of the drone at a security conference in Munich and said Iran was the ""greatest threat to our world"". But Mr Araghchi said Israel was flying drones over Syria and other neighbouring countries. ""They shouldn't be angry when they are faced with something that they are doing against others on a daily basis,"" he said. Mr Araghchi also said that the 2015  Iran nuclear deal was at a ""critical moment"" following US threats that sanctions on Iran could be re-imposed. Last monthPresident Donald Trump said the deal's ""terrible flaws"" had to be fixed. Iran's deputy foreign minister said he did not believe the deal could survive without the US. The landmark accord between six global powers and Iran obliges Iran to agree to reduce uranium enrichment activity, dispose of enriched uranium stocks and modify a heavy water facility in return for sanctions to be lifted. However the White House wants EU signatories to agree permanent restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment. Under the current deal they are set to expire in 2025. Mr Trump also wants Iran's ballistic missile programme to be addressed. But Mr Araghchi said the US had to fulfil its side of the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) before other issues could be discussed. Is Trump killing the Iran nuclear deal? How sanctions have hit ordinary Iranians Iran nuclear deal: Key details ""Another deal on any other issue depends on how successful is the deal that we have already made, and we have remained fully compliant to that, and the other side has not fully complied,"" he said. ""If the JCPOA becomes a successful experience for Iran, then they are allowed to ask us for any other issues to negotiate this,"" he added. He said Mr Trump's derogatory remarks about the deal were undermining it and this was preventing Iran's economy from improving. This in turn had contributed to anti-government protests in Iran last month, Mr Araghchi said. ""Peoples' expectations from the JCPOA are not met, it's a fact,"" he said. ""Most of it is because of this atmosphere of uncertainty which President Trump has created out, around JCPOA, which prevents all big companies and banks to work with Iran, it's a fact, and it's a violation by the United States.""

"Anti-depressants work, major study says","This video can not be played Prof Andrea Cipriani said it was good news for patients and doctors Scientists say they have settled one of medicine's biggest debates after a huge study found that anti-depressants work. The study, which analysed data from 522 trials involving 116,477 people, found 21 common anti-depressants were all more effective at reducing symptoms of acute depression than dummy pills. But it also showed big differences in how effective each drug is. The authors of the report,published in the Lancet,external, said it showed many more people could benefit from the drugs. There were 64.7 million prescriptions for the drugs in England in 2016 - more than double the 31 million in 2006 - but there has been a debate about how effective they are, with some trials suggesting they are no better than placebos. The Royal College of Psychiatrists said the study ""finally puts to bed the controversy on anti-depressants"". Your experiences of being on anti-depressants: 'It's keeping me going' The so-called meta-analysis, which involved unpublished data in addition to information from the 522 clinical trials involving the short-term treatment of acute depression in adults, found the medications were all more effective than placebos. However, the study found they ranged from being a third more effective than a placebo to more than twice as effective. Lead researcher Dr Andrea Cipriani, from the University of Oxford, told the BBC: ""This study is the final answer to a long-standing controversy about whether anti-depressants work for depression. ""We found the most commonly prescribed anti-depressants work for moderate to severe depression and I think this is very good news for patients and clinicians."" This video can not be played ""There's still a stigma"" Christian Talbot, a comedian, said he first started taking anti-depressants three and a half years ago after he found talking therapies had been ineffective for him. His doctor told him his depression was due to his low levels of serotonin, which is thought to influence mood, emotion and sleep. Christian said he had been reluctant to take anti-depressants at first because he feared they might make him ""numb"" or dull his senses. But he said when he did take them the results were ""immediately beneficial"". ""It wasn't that I felt a huge change come over me but I did feel literally like there was a weight that came off my shoulders. I was less anxious and felt more even."" He said he felt there was a stigma around taking the drugs. ""I don't know if people are afraid of them or they're embarrassed about them, because it's a medication just like anything else, except it's for a mental health issue rather than a physical issue."" The most effective: agomelatine amitriptyline escitalopram mirtazapine paroxetine The least effective: fluoxetine fluvoxamine reboxetine trazodone The study's authors said the findings could help doctors to pick the right prescription, but it did not mean everyone should be switching medications. That is because the study looked at the average effect of drugs rather than how they worked for individuals of different ages or gender, the severity of symptoms and other characteristics. Researchers added that most of the data in the meta-analysis covered eight weeks of treatment, so the findings might not apply to longer-term use. And they said it did not mean that anti-depressants should always be the first form of treatment. At least one million more people in the UK would benefit from treatments, including anti-depressants, they said. ""Medication should always be considered alongside other options, such as psychological therapies, where these are available,"" Dr Cipriani added.

Georgia Davies at St Andrews fears the dispute will mean pickets outside university buildings, limiting access to libraries and potentially affecting her final degree result. ""I really don't fancy pushing past lecturers who are losing tens of thousands of pounds just to get a book out. ""We are being disadvantaged again. If I don't get a good 2:1, what's the point?"" she asked. Universities UK said institutions were doing all they could to minimise the impact of the industrial action on students before they reached the stage of claiming compensation. UUK called the strike action ""disappointing"" and said: ""The changes proposed will make the scheme secure, and sustainable, safeguarding the future of universities. ""University staff will still have a valuable pension scheme, with employer contributions of 18% of salary, double the private sector average,"" said a UUK spokesman. The proposed changes will affect staff at 68 older universities. Staff at post-1992 universities are members of a different pension scheme.

Reality Check: EU residency rights,"The claim:Allowing EU migrants who arrive during the transition period the right to stay would mean a million people have that right. Reality Check verdict:Potentially, a million people could come, but it's unlikely to be that high. Migration Watch's estimate is based on previous numbers of EU workers applying for National Insurance numbers in the UK, which included many people who travelled to the UK for short-term work and have now left the country. On the other hand, they exclude non-working dependants. Alp Mehmet, from Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for controls on migration, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday morning that allowing people arriving from the EU during the transition period the right to stay indefinitely and bring their dependents ""potentially means a million people"" having such rights. He based that on figures for the numbers of EU nationals applying for National Insurance numbers, which he said had been roughly half a million a year in recent years (and transition is expected to last about two years). The government and the EU are negotiating what happens during the transition period. And Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated shewill fight a proposal to give residency rights to EU citizensduring the period after Brexit. Everybody needs a National Insurance number (Nino) to work in the UK. The most recent figure,externalfrom the Department for Work and Pensions was for NI numbers allocated in the year to the end of September 2017, when the number was 548,000, and it had indeed been above half a million for at least the three years before then. But those figures were considerably higher than the migration statistics from the Office for National Statistics, the most recent year of which showed 230,000 people arriving from the EU and a net figure (after subtracting people leaving) of 107,000. The migration statistics count people arriving in the country who plan to stay for at least a year, and those who have been in the country for at least a year and leave. There was much discussion in 2016 of why there were so many more EU nationals getting National Insurance numbers than had been arriving in the UK. TheONS looked into it,externaland said the difference was due to short-term migrants. The migration figures cover people planning to stay for at least a year, whereas people applying for a National Insurance number could stay for shorter periods. One of the people questioning the size of the difference between the two figures was Prof Jonathan Portes, from King's College, London, who thinks more work is needed into why the discrepancy exists, especially because the migration figures have been falling faster than the National Insurance numbers. On the other hand, the National Insurance number figures cover only migrants wanting to work - their non-working dependants would be included in the ONS migration figures but not in the National Insurance figures. The key problem with the National Insurance figures is they include people who have worked for a short time and then left - in order to qualify for ""settled"" status under the current plans they would need to be in the country for five years. The proposal for settled status,outlined in the joint negotiated report between the EU and the UK,external, is that EU nationals who have been in the UK for five years (starting before the UK leaves the EU) will be eligible for the status, giving them indefinite leave to remain with the same access to public services as they have now. BBC Radio 4's Today programme presenter Nick Robinson, who was interviewing Mr Mehmet, countered the Nino figures with a figure of net migration from EU countries of about 9,000 a quarter. The ONS generally publishes the migration statistics as annual figures, but this quarterly one came froman ad hoc request,externaland is for April to June 2017. The figure that is normally quoted is that for the year to the end of June, which was 107,000.

"UK may extend 20,000 Syria refugee target","This video can not be played Home secretary Amber Rudd said resettling Syrians was an important commitment The government is considering whether the UK should agree to resettle more refugees from the Syrian war, once it hits its target of bringing in 20,000 by 2020, the home secretary has said. Amber Rudd said that 10,538 people have already been granted refuge under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme. The 2020 target was set by David Cameron in 2015. Speaking in Lebanon, Ms Rudd said she was already holding talks about what would follow when it was met. During a trip to a refugee camp on Monday, which could not be reported at the time, Ms Rudd said: ""20,000 is definitely achievable by 2020, and I hope that we may get there earlier than that in fact. ""At the moment I am consulting with stakeholders and really engaging with other departments to decide what we should have to replace that when we go forward after 2020."" Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? UK to accept 20,000 refugees from Syria by 2020 Why is there war in Syria? She visited an informal tented settlement in Qab Elias, a Lebanese town about 15 miles from the Syrian border, where she met some of the 46 families staying there. Ms Rudd said Britain was one of the largest donors to help with Syria's refugee crisis, having committed Â£2.46bn in funding since 2012. She spoke as Syrian bombing has killed scores of civilians during the past few daysin the rebel-held area of Eastern Ghouta. Ms Rudd met 46 families - some 200 people - staying at the camp in Lebanon Ms Rudd added that the British public should be ""proud"" of what the VPRS had achieved, saying: ""It is the largest number of any European country of resettlement from the region. ""People have been very kind about saying how effective it is and how good the care is when people get to the local authority.""

Davidson questions migration target,"The leader of the Scottish Conservatives has questioned the government's goal of reducing net migration below 100,000. In theDaily Telegraph,external, Ruth Davidson said ""we have to ask whether the target continues to be the right one"". ""The time for easy slogans is over,"" she added. Ms Davidson also called for students to be taken out of net migration figures, in contrast to Theresa May's insistence they should be included. The government has promised a new set of migration rules after Brexit. It has also promised to get net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those leaving -  to the tens of thousands. The target has never come close to being met since it was first proposed in 2010 and the government has not set a date by which it should be achieved. Free movement 'will end with Brexit' Reality Check: Migration to the UK All you need to know about Brexit UK judges 'need clarity after Brexit' According to the latest figures, net migration to the UK was estimated to be 248,000 in 2016, a fall of 84,000 from 2015. In her newspaper article, Ms Davidson said Brexit - which will mean the UK is no longer subject to EU free movement rules - would be a ""big reset button"" which should make it ""much easier"" to hit the target. She added: ""But we have to ask whether the target continues to be the right one?"" Citing low unemployment levels, she said ""potential for growth is facing ever greater limitations"". Neither her party nor Labour had ""sought to have a meaningful and sustained discussion with the public about the merits and drawbacks of immigration"", she said. ""Let's treat the British public like the grownups they are and have the mature conversation we need."" As home secretary and now prime minister, Mrs May has consistently resisted calls to exempt international students from immigration numbers. But Ms Davidson said most Britons did not think international students should be treated as migrants, adding: ""So let's start there. ""If people don't think that students should be included in the net migration numbers, let's take them out."" Ms Davidson was boosted by the general election as the Tories won 13 seats in Scotland. She has previously spoken of the need to welcome migrants and for her party to be ""internationalist in outlook"". She was a leading campaigner for a Remain vote in last year's EU referendum. Labour's shadow Scotland Office minister Paul Sweeney said: ""The Tories are in open warfare and these comments from Ruth Davidson show just deep the splits in the party run.""

More KFC outlets reopen as chaos eases,"Almost 700 of KFC's 900 UK outlets have reopened following a chicken supply fiasco that began about a week ago and forced many stores to shut their doors. However, the fast-food chain has not said how many are serving a full menu. KFC said on Wednesday that some would remain closed for the rest of the week, while others will have shortened hours. The closures followed KFC's decision to switch suppliers from Bidvest to DHL, which is using a single warehouse near Rugby for deliveries nationwide. DHL has blamed ""operational issues"" for the supply disruption from the purpose-built facility. KFC said more chicken deliveries would be be made to outlets on Thursday as teams ""continue to work flat out all hours to clear the backlog caused by the breakdown in the DHL distribution system"". DHL has apologised for the ""inconvenience and disappointment caused to KFC and their customers"" and said it aimed to restore normal service levels as soon as possible. The GMB union has criticised KFC's decision to move its contract from Bidvest, which national officer Mick Rix said was a ""very well respected, specialised logistics provider"", to one that lacked a track record in food distribution. The union has also claimed some KFC workers were being asked to take holiday while stores have been closed. A KFC spokespersontold Personnel Today,external: ""From the information we have been given, nine out of 10 (in 708 of 780 restaurants) of our team members will not be financially worse off this week than they would have been if we were fully operational. ""While not perfect, the remaining 10% are ensuring that they do everything possible to provide hours or take paid leave.""

Trump: Armed teachers could stop attacks,"This video can not be played President Trump met pupils and parents affected by several US school shootings. US President Donald Trump has said arming teachers could prevent school shootings like that which left 17 people dead last week in Florida. Teachers carrying a concealed gun could end attacks ""very quickly"", he said. Mr Trump floated the proposal - long-championed by the powerful NRA gun lobby - as emotional survivors of the 14 February massacre urged him to take measures to stop similar attacks. The US leader called for improved background checks on gun buyers. ""It's not going to be talk like it's been in the past,"" he said. President Trump listened to pleas for gun reform on Wednesday from about 40 students, teachers and families in the executive mansion's state dining room. Hundreds of teenagers from the Washington DC suburbs rallied outside at the time - some voicing support for arming teachers. This video can not be played School shooting survivor's tearful plea Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow died in last week's attack - the second-deadliest shooting at a US public school - said: ""We, as a country, failed our children.""

This video can not be played Victim's father tells Trump of rage Mark Barden - whose son Daniel was killed in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut - said more guns was not the answer.

'Arm me with books' - the teachers saying no to guns Florida survivor: 'I'm not an actor' After Florida, some owners give up guns At his White House event, Mr Trump promised to look ""very strongly"" at calls for educators to be armed with guns - a position long held by the National Rifle Association (NRA). President Trump holds his notes at the listening session. Point five says: ""I hear you"" ""If you had a teacher who was adept at firearms,"" he said, ""they could very well end the attack very quickly."" ""Where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them,"" he said, while acknowledging the plan was controversial, ""they would go for special training and they would be there, and you would no longer have a gun-free zone. America's gun culture in 10 charts On Thursday morning, Mr Trump criticised reporting of his remarks, stressing that he spoke of the need to train teachers properly. Allow Twitter content?

Stoneman Douglas High School had an armed guard on duty during last week's attack - but he never discharged his gun. The local sheriff told reporters the deputy never encountered the shooter. But putting an armed teacher in every classroom is a divisive topic - a 2013 poll by the National Education Association found only 22% of teachers said they approved of the idea of arming staff, while 68% of teachers said they were opposed. And 72% of teachers said they would not want to carry a gun even if the law allowed. Six radical ways to stop US school shootings Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? In Colorado, free training is provided for teachers who wish to arm themselves- part of which involves imagining one of their own students entering the classroom with a gun. This video can not be played Florida shooting survivor Lorenzo Prado mistaken for the gunman A ban on some types of weapons, advocated for by many students, is unpalatable for supporters of the second amendment - which governs the right to bear arms. Lawmakers in Florida's state legislature rejected a proposal on Tuesday to even debate banning such weapons. They said, however, that will consider raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles - like the one police say was used in the massacre - from 18 to 21. Mr Trump's listening session came a day after he directed his administrationto take steps to ban gun ""bump stocks"". The accessories - which enable a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute - were used by a gunman who killed 58 concert-goers in Las Vegas last October. The NRA - which contributed anestimated $30m (Â£21m) to help elect Mr Trump,external- opposes a total ban on bump stocks but supports some regulation of the devices and some changes to background check legislation. In Florida, survivors of the shooting poured into the state capital to demand lawmakers restrict sales of assault rifles.

Record numbers of EU nationals leaving UK,"The number of EU citizens leaving the UK is at its highest level for a decade with 130,000 emigrating in the year to September,figures show.,external But far more EU nationals (220,000) moved to the UK in the same period, the Office for National Statistics found. It means net EU migration - the difference between arrivals and departures - was 90,000, the lowest for five years. The ONS said Brexit could be a factor in people's decisions to move. Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said migration was complicated and could be influenced by lots of different reasons. The figures also show that more British people are emigrating than are returning to live in the UK. Of those EU nationals arriving in the UK, fewer were coming for ""work-related reasons"", in particular to ""look for work"". By contrast, immigration from countries outside the European Union is going up which means the UK population is continuing to grow at a similar level to early 2014. Some 285,000 non-EU citizens arrived in the UK in the 12-month period to September, and 80,000 departed. This gives a net increase of 205,000, the highest for six years. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said this was largely driven by more people coming to study in the UK and an uncharacteristic dip in the previous year's figures that may have been corrected. He also speculated whether firms were starting to struggle to recruit or retain people from the EU, forcing them to look outside the EU. Overall, net migration is estimated to have fallen by 29,000 to 244,000 in the same period. This includes 73,000 British people coming back to the UK and 125,000 Britons leaving. The overall net migration figure is still well short of the government's target to reduce net migration to below 100,000, a pledge made in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 Tory manifestos. By home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw What explanation could there be for the decline in EU migration other than Brexit?  In the two years before the June 2016 referendum, the number of EU nationals arriving in Britain was stable at about 240,000 to 280,000. But every quarter since then has recorded falls, from 284,000 to 220,000. At the same time, the number of EU leavers, which hadn't risen higher than 100,000 since 2010, began to rise, from 95,000 to 130,000. Whether it's a feeling that EU citizens aren't wanted in the UK, uncertainty about their future or the growing relative strength of other EU economies, there has been a notable shift away from Britain's shores. Nevertheless, overall net migration remains at historically high levels, well above the government's controversial target, with a rise in migration from outside Europe. Caroline Nokes, immigration minister, said the latest figures demonstrated that the UK was still attracting the ""brightest and best people"" to come to work and study and described the increase in the number of overseas students as a ""huge positive"". ""We are a country that is open for business,"" she added. ""We want to have great relations with our European neighbours going forward but at the same time we need to have a sustainable migration system,"" she said. Asked whether falling numbers would adversely affect some sectors, in particular the NHS, Ms Nokes said the independent migration advisory committee was due to report its findings on EU patterns to the government in September so decisions could be made based on evidence.

""This deficit hurts us all and highlights the immigration mess the government has created,"" she said. The ONS figures also show that in 2017, the UK granted asylum, alternative forms of protection or resettlement to almost 15,000 people, 40% of whom were under 18. Separate figures from the Home Office showedmore than 10,500 people have been granted refuge in the UK after fleeing the conflict in Syria, under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement scheme. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who is in Lebanon near the Syrian border, said the government was considering extending its commitment to rehome 20,000 people by 2020. This video can not be played ""The UK has given us everything... but we miss our country"" Other figures from the Home Office,externalshow there were 141,302 applications made for British citizenship in 2017, an increase of 8% on the previous year. This was 39% lower than the peak of 232,262 in 2013. There is evidence that more EU citizens, who have settled in the UK, are applying for citizenship, with applications more than doubling from 15,460 in 2016 to 38,528 in 2017.

Time to arm US teachers?,"Teachers take part in the Faster active shooter training in Colorado in 2017 At least 17 people have died after a 19-year-old ex-pupil opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. It's the deadliest school shooting since 2012, when 26 people were killed in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. Two weeks ago, the BBC's Joel Gunter looked at whether arming US teachers could help prevent future bloodshed. Two schoolchildren died on Tuesday and 14 others suffered bullet wounds when a classmate opened fire outside a school in Benton, Kentucky. It was the third shooting incident at a school in 48 hours and the 11th in the three weeks since the start of the year. The victims were Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, both 15. A 15-year-old boy was arrested and charged with the attack. The story fell somewhere into the middle of the day's news agenda. ""Americans have accepted these common atrocities as part of life here,"" wrote one commenter on the New York Times website. ""Another day, another shooting spree, and no political will to do anything about it."" But there is political will building behind a certain sort of gun legislation â reforms that aim to increase, rather than decrease, the number of firearms in schools and other public buildings, and arm teachers and school staff as a means of defence. Hours after the shooting in Kentucky, Republican State Senator Steve West rushed to file a bill that would allow Kentucky schools to have armed school marshals patrol the site. His bill joins another in the state which seeks to loosen gun restrictions around college campuses. Mr West's bill received cross-party support from state Democratic Senator Ray Jones. ""We need armed officers in every school in Kentucky,"" Mr Jones said. ""That is a small price to pay if it saves one child's life."" The bill joins a raft of state legislation in recent years designed at putting more guns in schools. Most recently, the Michigan State Senate passed a bill in November which would allow teachers at primary, middle and high schools to carry a concealed handgun in class. Similar bills have been filed this year in Florida, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia. If successful, those states would join at least nine that already allow some form of concealed carry in high schools. Each fatal school shooting reignites a long-running debate over whether the solution is more gun control, or more guns. Efforts to arm teachers and school staff were jumpstarted in the wake of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook elementary in Connecticut, in which 20 children and six teachers died. Facing a public outcry at the massacre, and renewed calls for gun control, the NRA pushed heavily in the opposite direction. ""The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun,"" said the NRA's Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, a week after the shooting, and the catchphrase evolved into a philosophy that underpinned the NRA's key legislative priorities. The lobby group published a report calling for armed officers or staff in every school in America,external, and in 2013, the year after Sandy Hook, seven states enacted laws permitting teachers or school staff to carry guns. ""Over the past two or three years we've seen an explosion of legislative proposals to force schools to permit guns or to arm teachers,"" said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""And it's not just pushing the idea that people need guns in schools to be safe, it's the idea that people need guns everywhere - city streets, public parks, even government buildings."" Teachers are given training on a gun range, as well as in tactical situations But advocates say these kinds of reforms are the only meaningful way to protect schoolchildren. They point in particular to more rural schools, where an emergency response from police may take too long in the context of an active shooter incident. They also argue that gun-free zones are creating ""soft targets"". In Kentucky, home to Tuesday's shooting, Republican State Senator Tim Moore introduced bills in 2017 and again in 2018 in an effort to reduce restrictions around guns on school and college campuses. ""Whenever in our country people with evil intent seek to harm others, including innocent children, they will seek locations where they know there's going to be minimal chance of resistance,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""Allowing law abiding citizens who are properly trained, properly vetted, with a thorough background check and criminal check â¦ that is a deterrent."" School shootings erupted into the public consciousness in April 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. That massacre has since been eclipsed by shootings at Virginia Tech college (33 dead), Sandy Hook elementary school (25 dead), and 203 other shooting incidents in or around schools. According toan FBI study of 160 active shooter incidents between 2000 and 2013,external, nearly a quarter  occurred in educational settings, and more of half of those were at junior or secondary schools. Fourteen years after Columbine, and eight miles down the road, Littleton suffered another shooting. Karl Pierson, 18, went to Arapahoe High School in December 2013 with two guns and shot 17-year-old Clare Davis in the head, before killing himself in the school's library. A parent embraces her child after a shooting at Arapahoe High School, Colorado in 2013 One of the first police officers on the scene that day was Swat team member Quinn Cunningham. Still a serving officer, he now runs three-day active-shooter training sessions for armed teachers. The ""Faster"" training courses - funded by Coloradans for Civil Liberties and the Independence Institute - include a day of ""mindset development"" - preparing teachers for the possibility that they will have to shoot dead one of their own students. Mr Cunningham, 44, asks the teachers to close their eyes and imagine the student entering the classroom with a gun. In reality, a teacher might have just a split-second to assess the situation and respond. This is the most difficult and emotional part of the training, and reduces some of the participants to tears. ""But if we can have them win in their minds first, against that student, then when it comes to the actual incident they will prevail,"" Mr Cunningham said. America's gun culture in 10 charts Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? Five members of staff from Fleming High School in north-east Colorado volunteered last year for the training, which takes place in the summer break to keep students in the dark about who's involved. One teacher who took part, who asked to remain anonymous, said she decided to picture her favourite student during the preparation exercises, in an effort to harden herself to the worst possible eventuality. ""Teachers aren't really supposed to have favourites but you know, you have the ones that are close to you,"" she said. ""But if that student made the poor decision to endanger everyone, I'm going to have to do something about it."" The school now has posters at every entrance stating that some of its teachers are armed. The students spent ""about a week or two"" trying to work out who was carrying guns, before giving up, the teacher said. Her wardrobe changed ""quite a bit"" to accommodate a handgun, she said. ""It's just dressing to fit the gun."" Training on the range in Colorado The volunteers at Fleming High were subjected to background checks and a voice stress analysis, similar to a lie detector test, said school superintendent Steve McCracken. All five passed and now carry guns in the school. ""At the end of the day, no one in our school or community is in favour of having guns, but if a bad guy comes to the school we are now able to take care of it,"" he said. ""We do not have a local police department in our little town, and the sheriff's office could be at least 15 to 20 minutes away on a good day. The main reason for this is to close that gap."" Some staff vocally opposed the presence of guns and one teacher later left the school, but the general reaction from staff and the community was supportive, he said. In a 2013 poll by the National Education Association,external, only 22% of teachers said they approved of the idea of arming staff, while 68% of teachers said they were opposed.  In another survey the same year, 72% of teachers said they would not want to carry a gun even if the law allowed. In Michigan, when the state senate passed legislation in November that extended concealed carry to high schools, churches, day care centres, and sporting events, former teacher-turned-Democratic state senator Jim Ananich was among a vocal minority who opposed the bill. He said he thought the ""overwhelming majority"" of his former colleagues would be against the idea. ""Trying to play Rambo just doesn't fit with the reality of what happens in a stressful situation,"" he said. ""Untrained individuals are much more likely to shoot a bystander, a police officer, or a child."" The three days of training administered by Faster - and the legal minimum standard in Michigan of just eight hours for armed teachers - was not nearly enough, he said. ""Pursuing the NRA philosophy that you can put guns into the hands of teachers and untrained individuals, and expect them to make decisions that law enforcement or military are supposed to make, is backwards and it's dangerous."" Faster offers three days of training, which some argue is inadequate Those fighting to keep guns out of schools say arming teachers is a bad solution to the wrong problem, particularly in states that lack laws around securing firearms in the home. According to the Giffords Law Centre,27 states and the District of Columbia have some sort of Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws,external, which dictate how securely guns should be stored in the home. The CAP laws in Kentucky, where the shooter reportedly took a gun from his parents' closet, are among the weakest of all those states. Parents or guardians will only break the law if they knowingly provide a gun to a child convicted of a violent crime or likely to commit a crime. ""If we want to talk about preventing school shootings, we should be talking about stopping kids getting their hands on guns in the first place,"" said Mr Skaggs, chief counsel at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. ""Those are the laws we should be looking at."" On the ground, groups like the Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus are fighting state-by-state against the NRA, its state-level affiliates and other gun-advocacy groups to defeat pro-gun schools legislation. ""We - the collective gun violence prevention community - are defeating most of the bills right now, but the intensity on the other side is there,"" said Andy Pelosi, director of Keep Guns off Campus. ""The NRA has its fingerprints all over this issue now, they want to push guns everywhere,"" he said. The NRA did not respond to a request for comment.

Universities braced for strikes,"Strikers are angry about changes to their pension There have been pickets on campuses as university staff begin a strike in more than 50 universities, in a dispute over pensions. Lecturers have walked out at universities including Oxford and Cambridge at the beginning of a month-long strike campaign. Petitions signed by 80,000 students, many backing the lecturers, are demanding refunds for lost teaching. Universities minister Sam Gyimah has called for more negotiations. But Mr Gyimah says students ""deserve to receive the education that they are paying for. For many, this is a vital time in their studies"". This video can not be played University strikes: What do students think? Members of the University and College Union are striking because changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme will leave a typical lecturer almost Â£10,000 a year worse off in retirement, they say. Younger academics could lose almost half of their total retirement income, says the union. But the employers' group Universities UK says the scheme has a deficit of more than Â£6bn which it cannot ignore. ""This industrial action is targeted at students. It will be young people and the next generation of students who will also suffer if their education deteriorates because employers are forced to make cuts to pay more into pensions,"" said a Universities UK spokesman. However, there are indications that UUK may be ready to re-open talks on the issue. UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: ""We have been calling for talks for weeks either directly or through Acas, so if UUK are willing to now meet without preconditions with a view to resolving this dispute this good news."" Under the proposed pension plan, the USS will change from a defined benefit scheme, giving members a guaranteed income in retirement, to a defined contribution scheme, where pensions are subject to changes in the stock market. Lecturers say the changes could cost them Â£10,000 a year in retirement The union says the existing scheme is performing well and UUK's determination to push through the changes and refusal to compromise has left them no alternative but to strike. ""Staff are angry and significant disruption on campuses across the UK now looks inevitable,"" said UCU general secretary Sally Hunt. The industrial action comes as figures suggest university bosses took home pay packages worth more than Â£268,000 on average last year. The Times Higher Education analysis of university financial accounts shows UK vice-chancellors saw their pay rise by just over Â£10,000 on average (4%) in 2016-17 - nearly four times the 1.1% increase awarded to staff. University strike: What's it all about? Students' compensation bid for university strike Strikes at Northern Ireland universities At London's City University, senior law lecturer Keith Simpson said the pensions proposals would devastate academics' living standards in retirement. ""They're not particularly well paid but they do have the benefits of some certainty that when they retire they will have a reasonable pension,"" he said. ""Under the proposals that are being put forward, that's gone. There is no certainty whatsoever and really we think this is a stand we've got to make."" The union estimates that over half a million teaching hours will be lost during an escalating four-week strike programme: week one - staff at 57 universities walk out this Thursday and Friday week two - the 57 will be joined by staff at four more institutions on a three-day strike from Monday weeks three and four - staff a total of 64 universities will strike for nine days Members will refuse to reschedule classes lost on strike days. Some students support the action, but others are angry Students at about 30 universities have signed petitions asking for refunds. At King's College London, petition organiser Robert Liow, a third year law student, said that if universities refused refunds they would be effectively profiting from the dispute as they would not be paying lecturers on strike days. ""I believe education is a public good and not a service to be sold - but we are being treated as consumers. ""If they insist on making us pay, we will insist on our money back."" Little Mix singer criticised for wearing dreads 'I took my wife's name - my boss refuses to accept it' Call to make 'upskirting' an offence City University's petition asks for the amount saved by not paying striking lecturers to be divided among the students affected. Katie Walters, co-organiser ofthe Cardiff University petition, said she feared the dispute could drag on into the summer term, affecting final exams and dissertations. ""Although we fully support the lecturers - they work so hard and deserve good pensions - this is a major disruption to our studies."" Feelings are also running high among students at universities without petitions. Georgia Davies at St Andrews fears the dispute will mean pickets outside university buildings, limiting access to libraries and potentially affecting her final degree result. ""I really don't fancy pushing past lecturers who are losing tens of thousands of pounds just to get a book out. ""We are being disadvantaged again. If I don't get a good 2:1, what's the point?"" she asked. Universities UK said institutions were doing all they could to minimise the impact of the industrial action on students before they reached the stage of claiming compensation. UUK called the strike action ""disappointing"" and said: ""The changes proposed will make the scheme secure, and sustainable, safeguarding the future of universities. ""University staff will still have a valuable pension scheme, with employer contributions of 18% of salary, double the private sector average,"" said a UUK spokesman. The proposed changes will affect staff at 68 older universities. Staff at post-1992 universities are members of a different pension scheme.

Sadiq Adan Mohamed, 20, died after being stabbed in Malden Road, Camden, at about 22:10 GMT on Tuesday. He was one of two men stabbed to death in Camden that night. Abdikarim Hassan, 17, died in Bartholomew Road at 21:08. Mr Mohamed's mother, Fowsiya Abdi, said: ""Please I beg you, people who got a knife, children - stop please."" Abdikarim Hassan (l) and Sadiq Adan Mohamed (r) were both killed in Camden on Tuesday Another of her sons was stabbed to death - also aged 20 - in September 2017. Her sister's brother has also been killed. She said for both her sons, it was a case of ""wrong place, wrong time"", and she fears for her other children. Mr Mohamed was given first aid but died at the scene near the junction with Marsden Street. Ms Abdi had heard rumours her son had been attacked before the police confirmed it for her. The Met Police is trying to determine if the killings of both young men on Tuesday night are linked. This video can not be played Special correspondent Ed Thomas has witnessed the reality of knife crime Ms Abdi said: ""I'm feeling pain. I can't sleep even, I can't sleep tonight."" Earlier Mr Mohamed's family released a statement saying: ""This is now the constant theme in our community. ""We are made to believe that the police are here to protect us, but how does a mother feel her kids are protected when she has lost two in the same vicinity within months? ""We have lots of questions and need answers. Somebody has to listen to us."" The Met Police is trying to establish whether the two deaths are linked Neighbour Layla Awod said Abdikarim Hassan was on his way back home from college when he was stabbed. She said his mother saw him lying on the floor dying after being refused to pass through the police security cordon. She knew it was her son when she called his mobile phone and heard it ringing the other side of the cordon, she said. Mr Hassan's uncle, Yusuf Ahmed, said the teenager came to the UK from Somalia when he was two years old and was the eldest of six children. He was a student at Westminster College, liked playing football, and was a ""good guy"" who was ""always smiling"". Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales On a knife edge: Rising violence in London Following the deaths, additional police patrols were sent to Camden overnight and a Section 60 order - giving them powers to stop and search people - was authorised across the borough until 07:00. A police spokesperson said murder investigations had been launched but no arrests had been made and ""urgent inquiries are under way to establish the full circumstances"". Sixteen people have been stabbed to death in London since the start of 2018. Five of those were teenagers. Less than two miles away from Tuesday night's first stabbing - and only minutes earlier - a 16-year-old boy was stabbed in Aldenham Street, Camden. Paramedics took the boy to a central London hospital with non life-threatening injuries. A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of GBH with intent, but has since been released. No further action will be taken against him. Camden Police were called to another stabbing on Tuesday afternoon where a man, thought to be in his 40s, was attacked in Kilburn High Road shortly before 15:30. He was taken to hospital by London Air Ambulance and is in a stable condition. The force has not said if either attack was linked to the two fatal stabbings. A large police cordon was set up around the road where Mr Mohamed was killed A 19-year-old man who lives near Bartholomew Road told BBC Radio London stabbings were now ""everyday behaviour for these youngsters"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""desperately saddened"" by the deaths. ""I am asking the prime minister and the home secretary to urgently meet with me to discuss how we can work together to tackle the evil of knife attacks."" Meanwhile Cressida Dick, the commissioner for the Met Police, asked all Londoners to ""think about what you can do to help us tackle this blight on our city"". She urged young Londoners to ""stop and think"" before carrying a knife. The government's Serious Violence Strategy will be published in the next few months, a Home Office spokesperson said. ""Tackling this crime requires a new way of thinking,"" the spokesperson added.

Domestic abusers 'more likely to be jailed',"People convicted of domestic abuse offences in England and Wales will be more likely to go to prison in future, under new sentencing guidelines. Courts have been told that offences that take place in the home should be considered more serious than similar offences that take place elsewhere. Non-physical forms of abuse - like threats on social media - will also now be taken into consideration. Charity Refuge described the move as ""a huge step forward"". The Sentencing Council says domestic offences should be treated more seriously because they represent a ""violation of trust and security"" normally associated with intimate or family relationships. There is also the potential for victims of domestic abuse and their children to suffer ""lasting trauma"", and for the perpetrators to present a ""continuing threat to the victims' safety"". The appalling cost of domestic abuse The women still struggling to vote 'I didn't know emotional abuse was a thing' The new guidelines - which take effect in May - contrast sharply with those issued 12 years ago which state offences in a domestic context should be seen as ""no less serious"" than others. They also say that: Provocation will not be considered as a mitigating factor in sentencing, except in rare circumstances The penalty for domestic abuse should be determined by the seriousness of the crime - not by the wishes of the victim Magistrates' and Crown Courts should take ""great care"" where the offender or victim requests a less severe sentence in the interests of any children For the first time, sentencing guidelines also explicitly recognise the growth of domestic abuse perpetrated through technology - including email, text, social networking and tracking devices. This video can not be played A woman who was beaten up by her ex-boyfriend on why she shared selfies of her injuries By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent These guidelines signal a significant change of emphasis in the way courts deal with domestic abuse. Since the last guidance was issued in 2006 there's been more awareness about the nature of a crime that was once dismissed by police as ""just a domestic"". The official cross-government definition of domestic abuse was widened in 2013 to include incidents of controlling or coercive behaviour; two years later it was made a specific offence; and the Home Office is now planning fresh legislation to strengthen existing measures. Tougher sentences will help deliver the message that society won't tolerate abusive relationships - but practical help is needed for victims while offenders may require more than a spell behind bars to alter their behaviour. PM to oversee new domestic violence law According to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, about 4.3m women and 2.4m men aged between 16 to 59 experienced some form of domestic abuse in the year to March 2017. Sentencing Council member Jill Gramann said abuse came in many forms and included harassment, assault and sex offences. She said the new guidance would ""ensure that courts have the information they need to deal with the great range of offending and help prevent further abuse occurring"". Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said the charity had campaigned for crimes committed in a domestic context to be treated ""as seriously, if not more seriously"" than any other. ""I am glad that the courts will be encouraged to recognise that everybody has the right to feel safe in their own home,"" she said. ""These sentencing guidelines better reflect the reality of domestic violence today."" 10% of young women 'face domestic abuse' Domestic abuse 10% of London crime Domestic abuse: 'Focus more on children' PM to oversee new domestic violence law Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

What will cabinet decide on Brexit at Chequers?,"The art of predicting what happens in important private political meetings is tricky at best, and pointless at worst. So as Theresa May gathers her close colleagues together at Chequers on Thursday, making guesses - even educated ones - about what will be achieved is imprecise. But let's take that gamble. It is safe to say that the differences in the cabinet are real, if not as dramatic and dastardly - or indeed as straightforward - as portrayed. UK's transition plans released It is, therefore, also safe to say that getting to a clear, detailed and bold picture after months of tensions, in one day, is unlikely if not impossible. And if very much is to move forward and be agreed it will either require, as one minister gently lamented, ""the PM to actually make a decision"", overtly, on her own position and force others along - or for others to budge. One former minister described the situation as this: ""If everyone is happy it's a fudge. If anything's genuinely decided someone has to be unhappy. ""Either Philip Hammond has to agree that he is signed up to divergence, or Boris Johnson has to agree that he can accept alignment, or, someone resigns."" Number 10 would, of course, not agree with that characterisation. In recent days, despite the foot-stamping from Brexiteers, there has been a detectable sense around government that a form of agreement - or at least the next steps that look like progress - can be reached on Thursday. No-one around SW1 expects a big bust up, or a big flounce out (which would be awkward in any case given that Chequers has a very, very long drive), or public hysterics from anyone in cabinet after the meeting. And it is fairly likely there will be a sign-off for a slightly more advanced version of what Theresa May spelt out rather cryptically in her speech in Florence all those months ago. With the catchy title of ""managed divergence"", that relates to the ""three baskets"" approach (don't blame me for making up these names). As we have discussed here before, the UK government wants to offer the EU an approach to the relationship between the two sides after Brexit that goes something like this... In basket one (I know), there are some areas in which the UK and the EU might want to achieve the same kind of outcomes as before, and the UK would have no problem using exactly the same rules - and ways of following the rules - for good. Think of aviation, for example. No-one in the industry, or really anyone in government you can find, thinks there is much wrong with being in the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The upheaval of leaving probably isn't worth it - essentially, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The other way of thinking of this is - same goals, same means. In this particular case, by the way, it is not agreed and the EU is sceptical, but it is likely that the UK will try to find a way to stay in the EASA. In basket two are areas where the UK might want to have the same goals, but want to get there on its own terms - same goals, different means. An example here might be animal inspection. The UK wants to have the same high standards of animal welfare, potentially they would say, even better conditions and guarantees. But there is a view in some quarters that the European inspection regime takes too long and costs too much. So the UK might want to set up its own systems to carry out the actual inspections, even though ministers want British pigs and chickens to be just as well looked after (don't mention the chlorine) as their continental cousins. Common standards but different rules. The third basket is where it gets a lot trickier - where the UK essentially wants to choose what we do and how we do it. This is probably an over-simplified version of the complexity that's on the table. I am not going to get into the differences between recognition, equivalence, and the rest - there is more jargon out there than anyone could ever wish for, but if it's your thing, my colleague Norman Smith has a great primerhere. And there are other very vexed questions too, not least on customs arrangements, intricately tied to the issue of the Irish border. One minister told me this week the consequences of leaving the EU after the implementation period without some form of customs arrangement will be graphically spelt out to Brexiteers tomorrow. This is certainly not exhaustive, and given the levels of secrecy in government about the real details of the plans, it is impossible to be entirely sure what is going on. But talking to senior government figures, this is the territory where Theresa May hopes to get the cabinet together - with what was described to me as ""a little bit of scaring the Brexiteers into compromise"". It is not, repeat not, a final version of the deal the UK will get. It would be sign-off on a political approach that Theresa May can then put to the EU and, importantly, the public in her next big speech at the end of next week. There is a whole other question then, about whether Brussels will accept this as an opening offer on our relationship in the future. What then does Theresa May do if her calibrated compromise (otherwise known as what she could get through) is rejected by the EU? There have already been reports they are simply not up for it. Over recent months diplomats have suggested to me that they see the three basket approach as messing with the single market. But without some progress on Thursday, even with a strong flavour of fudge, progress towards a deal on the vital implementation period that business and Number 10 so eagerly wants next month could stall. PS:Wondering why the document on implementation was so delayed yesterday? Maybe not, but it's interesting, honest. Cabinet ministers only received the document about the two-year period after Brexit into their red boxes on Tuesday night. Sources say that some were ""deeply unimpressed"" by what was in it and the fact that there had been no chance to give it official sign-off or discussion. Government sources are adamant it was only a write-up of a government policy on the transition that was agreed at a committee meeting on 17 January. Only a skirmish, not a big bust up, but not exactly the sign that all is completely well in the group that is making these big decisions.

Barclays reports rise in annual profits,"The collapse of outsourcing giant Carillion has cost Barclays Â£127m. The charge was one of a number of hefty one-off costs contained in Barclays' latest annual results. Last year, the bank lost Â£2.5bn related to the sale of Barclays Africa Group and a Â£900m charge related to changes in US tax rules. Including those costs the bank lost Â£1.9bn in 2017. But with one-off charges stripped out, underlying profits were Â£3.5bn, up 10%. Carillion collapsed in January with debts estimated at Â£1.5bn. It was the second-biggest UK construction company and Barclays was one of five key lenders to the company. Barclays, along with HSBC, voted in favour of lending more money to Carillion just days before it collapsed. But other banks voted against, sealing the company's fate. Barclays said the ""bulk"" of a Â£127m charge on its latest quarterly accounts related to Carillion. However, it is thought that of the five big lenders to Carillion, Barclays had the smallest exposure. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley faces legal headaches Barclays' results last year were boosted by a reduction in costs over the year and the rise in the value of the dollar and euro against the pound. Chief executive Jes Staley said he was ""pleased"" with how this year had started. In particular, he mentioned an encouraging performance for the bank's markets unit, which sells and trades shares, debt and other financial products. Last year, that unit saw income tumble 15% to Â£4.5bn. The markets division is part of Barclays Investment Bank, which saw income slide by 22% to Â£2bn. Lloyds hails 'landmark' year HSBC profits jump on Asia growth Mr Staley said the bank had made ""considerable strategic progress"" in 2017. Part of his strategy has been to cut costs by shutting bank branches and cutting thousands of jobs. As a result, it saw costs fall by 5% last year. Mr Staley said that the latest restructuring was over and he did not see further significant job cuts. While the bank's financial performance is solid, it has some serious legal problems ahead. Earlier this month,the Serious Fraud Office charged Barclays Bank PLCwith ""unlawful financial assistance"" related to billions of pounds raised from Qatar in 2008. The bank is also being sued by the US Justice Department, which is accusing it of misleading investors about the quality of loans being used to back financial products from 2005 to 2007. Mr Staley himself is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over his handling of a whistleblower, who raised concerns about the recruitment of a senior Barclays executive. ""Barclays is spinning many plates at the moment, and inevitably there are some breakages,"" said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor. ""Its exit from the African business has been costly, litigation and conduct fines remain a financial thorn in the side, whilst the investment bank had a difficult end to the year."" However, Mr Hunter said there were some ""pockets of hope"", including strength in its traditional High Street banking business and growth in the credit card unit. Barclays said it would more than double its dividend payout to shareholders next year to 6.5p a share. That helped to boost Barclays' share price by 4%.

May heads to Chequers for Brexit talksSenior ministers gather to try to reach a deal on the government's Brexit strategy.2h2 hours agoUK Politics,"Theresa May and 11 senior ministers have been thrashing out the UK's approach to Brexit in an eight-hour discussion at the PM's country retreat. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said everyone is said to have left Chequers happy implying ""baby steps forwards not a huge breakthrough"". The PM will set out the position in a speech next week, after a discussion by the full cabinet. There have been clear differences between ministers over the way forward. But Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told the prime minister had ""played a blinder"" and persuaded Brexiteers to shift their position. However, a cabinet Brexiteer source had said ""divergence has won the day"" with mutual recognition between the UK and EU on goods in future, rather than the UK being forced to stick to EU rules.

Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said on BBC Question Time the cabinet would agree on the Brexit position, following the Chequers talks. Laura Kuenssberg - a happy ending? UK publishes transition plans Labour's policy 'evolves' on customs union What will Brexit mean for Britain's overseas territories? Brexit: All you need to know ""What I can say to you is the outcome of those discussions will come to cabinet in the next few days, and late next week the prime minister will make a statement, a speech and outline what that position is."" Pressed on whether everyone in the cabinet would agree with it, he replied: ""Absolutely, yes."" Official cars make they way towards Chequers near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire The Brexit sub-committee includes key figures such as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond, who were on opposite sides of the EU referendum argument in 2016. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister and cabinet ministers met at Chequers for eight hours. ""They held discussions including about the automotive sector led by Greg Clark, agrifood led by Michael Gove, digital trade by Liam Fox and a discussion on the overall future economic partnership that was led by the prime minister."" Chief Whip Julian Smith and senior UK diplomats Tim Barrow and Ed Llewellyn were among those present, alongside the cabinet's Brexit sub-committee. Cream of sweetcorn soup with a ham hock croquette Guinness short rib of Dexter Beef with onions and parsnip mash Lemon tart with raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries Mrs May still has to get any agreement through the whole cabinet on Tuesday, through her party - and then through 27 other EU member states. Documents suggest European Commission negotiators will not approve of a UK proposal that seeks to select which EU rules to stick to post-Brexit and which to diverge from. Slidespublished online,externalby the commission say such an approach would be ""not compatible with the principles"" set out in the EU's own guidelines and posed a risk to the ""proper functioning"" of its single market. But an EU diplomat told the BBC ""we are hoping for a relationship that is as close as possible to the existing relationship"", adding that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier should be given a mandate ""to explore all possibilities"". Before the final arrangements with the EU kick in, a temporary transition period is planned - although the details have yet to be negotiated. On Wednesday, the UK set out its plans for how this ""status quo"" transition phase should work. The document suggests the UK will abide by new EU laws and be involved in talks on future fishing quotas, but will not be able to sign trade deals without the EU's permission. It also says the period should last as long as it takes to ""prepare and implement the new processes and new systems"". No 10 denied this meant it would be longer than the planned two years. But Sir Bill Cash, chairman of the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, warned that the UK could face an extra Â£4bn-Â£5bn Brexit ""divorce bill"" if the post-withdraw transition period extends beyond the EU's preferred end date of 31 December 2020. He said that the current Â£35-39bn agreement was intended to cover to the end of the current EU budget period at the end of 2020. For Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would like to see ""a customs union"" option on the table, which would ""solve some of the issues around Northern Ireland"" and enable the UK to influence future trade negotiations. Taking questions after a speech in London, he also said Labour would rather have a general election than a second referendum on Britain's EU membership because ""there needs to be a wider debate"" about the UK's future relationship with Europe. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry also told LBC that while Brexit meant the UK could not be in the customs union, a new agreement was needed: ""That we think is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union."" It could mean the PM faces the prospect of a Commons rebellion as Conservative MP Anna Soubry said she had cross-party support for an amendment to the trade bill, calling for the government to form ""a"" customs union with the EU after Brexit.

'Tougher' sentences for domestic abuse,"People convicted of domestic abuse offences in England and Wales will be more likely to go to prison in future, under new sentencing guidelines. Courts have been told that offences that take place in the home should be considered more serious than similar offences that take place elsewhere. Non-physical forms of abuse - like threats on social media - will also now be taken into consideration. Charity Refuge described the move as ""a huge step forward"". The Sentencing Council says domestic offences should be treated more seriously because they represent a ""violation of trust and security"" normally associated with intimate or family relationships. There is also the potential for victims of domestic abuse and their children to suffer ""lasting trauma"", and for the perpetrators to present a ""continuing threat to the victims' safety"". The appalling cost of domestic abuse The women still struggling to vote 'I didn't know emotional abuse was a thing' The new guidelines - which take effect in May - contrast sharply with those issued 12 years ago which state offences in a domestic context should be seen as ""no less serious"" than others. They also say that: Provocation will not be considered as a mitigating factor in sentencing, except in rare circumstances The penalty for domestic abuse should be determined by the seriousness of the crime - not by the wishes of the victim Magistrates' and Crown Courts should take ""great care"" where the offender or victim requests a less severe sentence in the interests of any children For the first time, sentencing guidelines also explicitly recognise the growth of domestic abuse perpetrated through technology - including email, text, social networking and tracking devices. This video can not be played A woman who was beaten up by her ex-boyfriend on why she shared selfies of her injuries By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent These guidelines signal a significant change of emphasis in the way courts deal with domestic abuse. Since the last guidance was issued in 2006 there's been more awareness about the nature of a crime that was once dismissed by police as ""just a domestic"". The official cross-government definition of domestic abuse was widened in 2013 to include incidents of controlling or coercive behaviour; two years later it was made a specific offence; and the Home Office is now planning fresh legislation to strengthen existing measures. Tougher sentences will help deliver the message that society won't tolerate abusive relationships - but practical help is needed for victims while offenders may require more than a spell behind bars to alter their behaviour. PM to oversee new domestic violence law According to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, about 4.3m women and 2.4m men aged between 16 to 59 experienced some form of domestic abuse in the year to March 2017. Sentencing Council member Jill Gramann said abuse came in many forms and included harassment, assault and sex offences. She said the new guidance would ""ensure that courts have the information they need to deal with the great range of offending and help prevent further abuse occurring"". Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said the charity had campaigned for crimes committed in a domestic context to be treated ""as seriously, if not more seriously"" than any other. ""I am glad that the courts will be encouraged to recognise that everybody has the right to feel safe in their own home,"" she said. ""These sentencing guidelines better reflect the reality of domestic violence today."" 10% of young women 'face domestic abuse' Domestic abuse 10% of London crime Domestic abuse: 'Focus more on children' PM to oversee new domestic violence law Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Universities braced for strikesLecturers at 64 universities walk out over changes they say could halve their retirement income.,"Strikers are angry about changes to their pension There have been pickets on campuses as university staff begin a strike in more than 50 universities, in a dispute over pensions. Lecturers have walked out at universities including Oxford and Cambridge at the beginning of a month-long strike campaign. Petitions signed by 80,000 students, many backing the lecturers, are demanding refunds for lost teaching. Universities minister Sam Gyimah has called for more negotiations. But Mr Gyimah says students ""deserve to receive the education that they are paying for. For many, this is a vital time in their studies"". This video can not be played University strikes: What do students think? Members of the University and College Union are striking because changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme will leave a typical lecturer almost Â£10,000 a year worse off in retirement, they say. Younger academics could lose almost half of their total retirement income, says the union. But the employers' group Universities UK says the scheme has a deficit of more than Â£6bn which it cannot ignore. ""This industrial action is targeted at students. It will be young people and the next generation of students who will also suffer if their education deteriorates because employers are forced to make cuts to pay more into pensions,"" said a Universities UK spokesman. However, there are indications that UUK may be ready to re-open talks on the issue. UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: ""We have been calling for talks for weeks either directly or through Acas, so if UUK are willing to now meet without preconditions with a view to resolving this dispute this good news."" Under the proposed pension plan, the USS will change from a defined benefit scheme, giving members a guaranteed income in retirement, to a defined contribution scheme, where pensions are subject to changes in the stock market. Lecturers say the changes could cost them Â£10,000 a year in retirement The union says the existing scheme is performing well and UUK's determination to push through the changes and refusal to compromise has left them no alternative but to strike. ""Staff are angry and significant disruption on campuses across the UK now looks inevitable,"" said UCU general secretary Sally Hunt. The industrial action comes as figures suggest university bosses took home pay packages worth more than Â£268,000 on average last year. The Times Higher Education analysis of university financial accounts shows UK vice-chancellors saw their pay rise by just over Â£10,000 on average (4%) in 2016-17 - nearly four times the 1.1% increase awarded to staff. University strike: What's it all about? Students' compensation bid for university strike Strikes at Northern Ireland universities At London's City University, senior law lecturer Keith Simpson said the pensions proposals would devastate academics' living standards in retirement. ""They're not particularly well paid but they do have the benefits of some certainty that when they retire they will have a reasonable pension,"" he said. ""Under the proposals that are being put forward, that's gone. There is no certainty whatsoever and really we think this is a stand we've got to make."" The union estimates that over half a million teaching hours will be lost during an escalating four-week strike programme: week one - staff at 57 universities walk out this Thursday and Friday week two - the 57 will be joined by staff at four more institutions on a three-day strike from Monday weeks three and four - staff a total of 64 universities will strike for nine days Members will refuse to reschedule classes lost on strike days. Some students support the action, but others are angry Students at about 30 universities have signed petitions asking for refunds. At King's College London, petition organiser Robert Liow, a third year law student, said that if universities refused refunds they would be effectively profiting from the dispute as they would not be paying lecturers on strike days. ""I believe education is a public good and not a service to be sold - but we are being treated as consumers. ""If they insist on making us pay, we will insist on our money back."" Little Mix singer criticised for wearing dreads 'I took my wife's name - my boss refuses to accept it' Call to make 'upskirting' an offence City University's petition asks for the amount saved by not paying striking lecturers to be divided among the students affected. Katie Walters, co-organiser ofthe Cardiff University petition, said she feared the dispute could drag on into the summer term, affecting final exams and dissertations. ""Although we fully support the lecturers - they work so hard and deserve good pensions - this is a major disruption to our studies."" Feelings are also running high among students at universities without petitions. Georgia Davies at St Andrews fears the dispute will mean pickets outside university buildings, limiting access to libraries and potentially affecting her final degree result. ""I really don't fancy pushing past lecturers who are losing tens of thousands of pounds just to get a book out. ""We are being disadvantaged again. If I don't get a good 2:1, what's the point?"" she asked. Universities UK said institutions were doing all they could to minimise the impact of the industrial action on students before they reached the stage of claiming compensation. UUK called the strike action ""disappointing"" and said: ""The changes proposed will make the scheme secure, and sustainable, safeguarding the future of universities. ""University staff will still have a valuable pension scheme, with employer contributions of 18% of salary, double the private sector average,"" said a UUK spokesman. The proposed changes will affect staff at 68 older universities. Staff at post-1992 universities are members of a different pension scheme.

""They held discussions including about the automotive sector led by Greg Clark, agrifood led by Michael Gove, digital trade by Liam Fox and a discussion on the overall future economic partnership that was led by the prime minister."" Chief Whip Julian Smith and senior UK diplomats Tim Barrow and Ed Llewellyn were among those present, alongside the cabinet's Brexit sub-committee.

Documents suggest European Commission negotiators will not approve of a UK proposal that seeks to select which EU rules to stick to post-Brexit and which to diverge from. Slidespublished online,externalby the commission say such an approach would be ""not compatible with the principles"" set out in the EU's own guidelines and posed a risk to the ""proper functioning"" of its single market. But an EU diplomat told the BBC ""we are hoping for a relationship that is as close as possible to the existing relationship"", adding that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier should be given a mandate ""to explore all possibilities"". Before the final arrangements with the EU kick in, a temporary transition period is planned - although the details have yet to be negotiated. On Wednesday, the UK set out its plans for how this ""status quo"" transition phase should work. The document suggests the UK will abide by new EU laws and be involved in talks on future fishing quotas, but will not be able to sign trade deals without the EU's permission. It also says the period should last as long as it takes to ""prepare and implement the new processes and new systems"". No 10 denied this meant it would be longer than the planned two years. But Sir Bill Cash, chairman of the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, warned that the UK could face an extra Â£4bn-Â£5bn Brexit ""divorce bill"" if the post-withdraw transition period extends beyond the EU's preferred end date of 31 December 2020. He said that the current Â£35-39bn agreement was intended to cover to the end of the current EU budget period at the end of 2020. For Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would like to see ""a customs union"" option on the table, which would ""solve some of the issues around Northern Ireland"" and enable the UK to influence future trade negotiations. Taking questions after a speech in London, he also said Labour would rather have a general election than a second referendum on Britain's EU membership because ""there needs to be a wider debate"" about the UK's future relationship with Europe. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry also told LBC that while Brexit meant the UK could not be in the customs union, a new agreement was needed: ""That we think is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union."" It could mean the PM faces the prospect of a Commons rebellion as Conservative MP Anna Soubry said she had cross-party support for an amendment to the trade bill, calling for the government to form ""a"" customs union with the EU after Brexit.

'Tougher' sentences for domestic abuseGuidelines say courts should now view offences more seriously than those committed against strangers.3h3 hours agoUK,"People convicted of domestic abuse offences in England and Wales will be more likely to go to prison in future, under new sentencing guidelines. Courts have been told that offences that take place in the home should be considered more serious than similar offences that take place elsewhere. Non-physical forms of abuse - like threats on social media - will also now be taken into consideration. Charity Refuge described the move as ""a huge step forward"". The Sentencing Council says domestic offences should be treated more seriously because they represent a ""violation of trust and security"" normally associated with intimate or family relationships. There is also the potential for victims of domestic abuse and their children to suffer ""lasting trauma"", and for the perpetrators to present a ""continuing threat to the victims' safety"". The appalling cost of domestic abuse The women still struggling to vote 'I didn't know emotional abuse was a thing' The new guidelines - which take effect in May - contrast sharply with those issued 12 years ago which state offences in a domestic context should be seen as ""no less serious"" than others. They also say that: Provocation will not be considered as a mitigating factor in sentencing, except in rare circumstances The penalty for domestic abuse should be determined by the seriousness of the crime - not by the wishes of the victim Magistrates' and Crown Courts should take ""great care"" where the offender or victim requests a less severe sentence in the interests of any children For the first time, sentencing guidelines also explicitly recognise the growth of domestic abuse perpetrated through technology - including email, text, social networking and tracking devices. This video can not be played A woman who was beaten up by her ex-boyfriend on why she shared selfies of her injuries By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent These guidelines signal a significant change of emphasis in the way courts deal with domestic abuse. Since the last guidance was issued in 2006 there's been more awareness about the nature of a crime that was once dismissed by police as ""just a domestic"". The official cross-government definition of domestic abuse was widened in 2013 to include incidents of controlling or coercive behaviour; two years later it was made a specific offence; and the Home Office is now planning fresh legislation to strengthen existing measures. Tougher sentences will help deliver the message that society won't tolerate abusive relationships - but practical help is needed for victims while offenders may require more than a spell behind bars to alter their behaviour. PM to oversee new domestic violence law According to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, about 4.3m women and 2.4m men aged between 16 to 59 experienced some form of domestic abuse in the year to March 2017. Sentencing Council member Jill Gramann said abuse came in many forms and included harassment, assault and sex offences. She said the new guidance would ""ensure that courts have the information they need to deal with the great range of offending and help prevent further abuse occurring"". Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said the charity had campaigned for crimes committed in a domestic context to be treated ""as seriously, if not more seriously"" than any other. ""I am glad that the courts will be encouraged to recognise that everybody has the right to feel safe in their own home,"" she said. ""These sentencing guidelines better reflect the reality of domestic violence today."" 10% of young women 'face domestic abuse' Domestic abuse 10% of London crime Domestic abuse: 'Focus more on children' PM to oversee new domestic violence law Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Influential US preacher Billy Graham dies,"This video can not be played Billy Graham preached to more than 200 million people worldwide US evangelist Billy Graham - one of the most influential preachers of the 20th Century - has died aged 99. He died at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, a spokesman for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said. In a 60-year career, he is estimated to have preached to hundreds of millions of people around the world. Former presidents are among the many who have been paying tribute. President Trump called him ""great"" and a ""very special man"". After becoming one of the best-known promoters of Christianity in the US, Graham embarked on his global mission with an event in London in 1954. Graham reached millions of worshippers through TV - the first to use the medium to convey the Christian message on such a scale. Billy Graham: The man dubbed God's Ambassador Born in 1918 and raised on his family's dairy farm in Charlotte, North Carolina, Billy Graham became a committed Christian at the age of 16 after hearing a travelling evangelist. He was ordained a minister in 1939, aged 21. Graham's public profile was raised in the United States when he held a two-month ministry in a giant tent in Los Angeles in 1949. Preaching in Paris in 1986 His global mission took him to all corners of the world including Nigeria and communist North Korea. An early sermon outside the US took place before 12,000 worshippers in 1954 in Harringay Arena, London. At first ambivalent about the civil rights movement in the US, he became more sympathetic in the 1950s, preaching to racially integrated congregations. Six things Billy Graham believed His fiery delivery became more measured with advancing years and controversy surrounding the techniques of mass evangelism. Graham avoided the scandals - sexual and financial -  which dogged some contemporary televangelists through the decades. A social conservative, he opposed same-sex marriage and abortion. Graham preached his final revival meeting in New York in 2005 at the age of 86. As the end of his life approached, he said: ""I know that soon my life will be over. I thank God for it, and for all He has given me in this life. But I look forward to Heaven."" In a tweet, President Donald Trump called him a special man. He wrote: ""The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man."" Former President Barack Obama said he was a guide to millions of Americans. Allow Twitter content?

UK singer Sir Cliff Richard, who announced he had become Christian at a Billy Graham event in London in 1966, said the world had lost someone special. ""Dr Billy Graham was the most honourable and honest of men.  His faith was obvious and I found him inspiring to be with,"" the pop singer said. ""His rallies were always moving and enlightening and he presented a 'hope' to many who didn't know that one existed."" Billy Graham was close to US presidents from Harry Truman, through Richard Nixon to Barack Obama. He played golf with Gerald Ford and went on holiday with George H W Bush. The latter's son, George W Bush, credits him with restoring his faith in 2010. This video can not be played Billy Graham was close to many US presidents over the decades Graham endorsed Nixon for the presidency but went on to criticise him over the Watergate scandal. Mr Obama became the 12th president to meet Graham when he visited the preacher at his hilltop home in North Carolina in 2010. Graham later acknowledged that his closeness to power risked compromising his message. ""If I had to do it over again, I would also avoid any semblance of involvement in partisan politics. ""An evangelist is called to do one thing, and one thing only: to proclaim the Gospel.""
