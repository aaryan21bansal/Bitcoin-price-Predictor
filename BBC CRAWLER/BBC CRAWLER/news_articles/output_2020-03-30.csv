Rescue flights for stranded Britons,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab said charter flights will be arranged for countries where commercial flights have stopped. Tens of thousands of Britons stranded abroad by the coronavirus pandemic will be flown home under a new arrangement between the government and airlines. BA, Virgin and Easyjet are among airlines working with the government to fly Britons back to the UK. The government has also pledged Â£75m to charter special flights to bring home UK nationals from countries where commercial flights are unavailable. The number of people who have died with the virus in the UKhas reached 1,408. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said an ""unprecedented"" number of UK travellers were trying to get home ""from young backpackers to retired couples on cruises"". ""We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people travelling around the world,"" he said. Under the new arrangement, airlines would be responsible for getting stranded passengers home where commercial routes remain an option. Where commercial routes do not exist, government financial support will enable special charter flights - operated by the partner airlines and others - to fly to priority countries to bring back UK residents. Mr Raab said priority would be given to the most vulnerable - including the elderly or those with pressing medical needs - and also to countries where there are large numbers of British tourists trying to return to the UK. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry criticised the plans as ""just more of the same"", and called for ""a fresh, comprehensive and fully-funded strategy to bring our British nationals home"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Outlining the partnership, Mr Raab said airlines should offer alternative flights ""at little to no cost where routes have been cancelled"" and allow passengers to change tickets - including between carriers. He added: ""So for those still in those countries where commercial options are still available: don't wait. Don't run the risk of getting stranded. ""The airlines are standing by to help you - please book your tickets as soon as possible."" Virgin, easyJet, Jet2 and Titan Airways signed a memorandum of understanding relating to the arrangement on Monday, while British Airways has also said it will work with government to get people home. Other airlines are expected to join the new arrangement, Mr Raab said. June and Leslie Webb, both 77-years-old with underlying health conditions, are trying to return to Southend, Essex, from Goa, western India. The couple were due to return to Britain on Monday after a two-and-a-half week trip, but their flight was cancelled after India declared a 21-day lockdown on 24 March. They have since booked a non-refundable Â£700 flight for 2 April, which was also cancelled, their daughter-in-law Sally Webb told BBC News. ""My mother-in-law is in remission from cancer and my father-in-law is diabetic,"" Mrs Webb said. ""The situation is getting desperate."" She added that the couple had about a week's worth of medication left and were reporting food shortages where they were staying. Mrs Webb has been working with her sister-in-law to get them home, but said the government briefing was ""the first bit"" of information they had received about repatriation efforts. ""It doesn't give us a lot of hope because obviously India is on lockdown,"" she said. ""The fact is that even if the UK are able to get the Indian government to release the lockdown, they have got to get all of the other Brits as well as our in-laws home. ""We just want a flight, any flight and we want them home safe."" Mrs Webb added that she would like further details about how long it would take to get a flight, ""just so I could give my in laws some reassurance"". Speaking to BBC News following the daily briefing, Ms Thornberry said she was ""disappointed"" that there was not more detail and that some questions ""simply hadn't been addressed"". ""What happens if your insurance has run out whilst you are waiting to get on a flight, what happens if your food or your medicine is running out - there aren't any specific answers to that,"" she said. Ms Thornberry added that she had received ""worrying"" emails from British people around the world about commercial flights, including one family of six who had been told it would cost Â£61,000 to get them home from Australia to Yorkshire. ""That's simply unacceptable,"" she said. Instructions for UK travellers to return home can be found on the government'sforeign travel advice website,external. The Foreign Office said it has already helped hundreds of thousands of British tourists return from around the globe including 8,500 from Morocco, about 5,000 from Cyprus, and an estimated 150,000 from Spain. From the moment countries started closing their borders, it only felt like a matter of time until the government had to step in in a more concrete way to get a vast number of stranded British people home. Up until now, the Foreign Office has been pressuring countries to lift travel restrictions and co-ordinating with UK airlines that have been running empty planes out to destinations to bring people home. It was a commercial operation and it worked up until a point. But with so many people stuck in all corners of the globe, and anger growing among many who found themselves in precarious situations, the government ultimately had to provide funding to ensure a more extensive repatriation programme was possible. Airlines are in dire financial straits and Â£75m is, in aviation terms, a relatively small sum. But by helping government now, they'll be hoping government helps them through this crisis and beyond. Later in the news briefing, the UK's chief scientific adviser said there were early signs that social distancing measures in the UKwere ""making a difference"". Sir Patrick Vallance said people were heeding the advice to stay at home to keep the pressure off the NHS. As of 09:00 BST on Monday, 22,141 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus, while 112,805 have tested negative, according to the Department of Health. The total number of people who have died with the virus in the UK reached 1,408, as measured before 17:00 BST on Sunday. The deaths include a further 159 people in England, six in Scotland, 14 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. There are currently 9,000 people in hospitals in England with coronavirus, up from 6,000 on Friday. The Brits stranded abroad due to coronavirus Why are Brits abroad struggling to get home?

Food vouchers for free school meals children,"Ministers are responding to fears that children on free school meals could go hungry Families with children eligible for free school meals in England will be able to claim weekly shopping vouchers while schools are closed due to the coronavirus outbreak, say ministers. The scheme will allow schools to issue vouchers worth Â£15 a week per child. Headteachers have warned that even with the vouchers, some parents will struggle to feed their children. But the Department for Education says the rate exceeds that normally paid to schools for free school meals. Schools across the UK were forced to close earlier this month to all pupils, except the children of key workers such as doctors, nurses and supermarket delivery drivers, as well as some vulnerable children and those with more serious special educational needs. How schools and charities plan to feed children UK schools closed from Friday Around 1.3 million in children in England are entitled to free school meals and, until now, schools have been making their own arrangements. Schools will be able to continue to provide meals for collection or delivery themselves, but where this is not possible the voucher system will ensure children do not lose out. Schools will be able to order the voucher codes online from Tuesday, and ministers hope parents could start receiving them the same day. Families will be issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth Â£15, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. ""No child should go hungry as a result of the measures introduced to keep people at home,"" said England's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. In Scotland, the government has pledged that all children eligible for free school meals will still receive them through their local authorities The Welsh government is developing a national voucher scheme for children eligible for free school meals but - in the meantime - schools and local authorities are charged with continuing to provide meals throughout the Easter break In Northern Ireland, the government is introducing direct payments to families whose children normally get free school meals Headteachers' leaders welcomed the scheme although the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, Geoff Barton, warned that Â£3 a day would still leave families struggling, ""Let's be under no illusions, this will be a tough situation,"" said Mr Barton. ""It will be challenging for parents and carers who already have the extra cost of children unexpectedly at home for an extended period."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, added: ""There may be some kinks to work out of the scheme, especially as it has been developed at pace, but at least there is some certainty available now."" Mr Whiteman said heads would work with government to make sure the scheme worked as effectively as possible. The government says the value of the vouchers, which exceeds the rate paid to schools for free school meals, recognises the fact that families will not be able to buy food in bulk, and could incur higher costs.

Rent-to-own giant BrightHouse folds as virus hits,"BrightHouse has faced an influx of compensation claims BrightHouse - the biggest rent-to-own operator in the UK - has collapsed, with administrators now attempting to salvage parts of the business. Customers should continue to make the monthly payments required to keep their household goods, with administrators now acting as the collecting agent. The company had been struggling after an influx of compensation claims forselling to people who could not repay. Its shops were then shut owing to coronavirus restrictions on retailers. Julie Palmer, from corporate recovery business Begbies Traynor, said: ""Coronavirus was the final nail in the coffin for BrightHouse."" 'I paid Â£2,000 for a Â£450 TV' says rent-to-own victim Price cap plan for rent-to-own sector BrightHouse, the trading name of Caversham Finance Limited, has 240 shops and 2,400 employees, whose jobs are now at serious risk. The firm's collapse came minutes before Italian restaurant chain Carluccio'salso fell into administration. Collectively, the two firms employ 4,500 people. BrightHouse's 200,000 rent-to-own customers make monthly payments for household appliances, in effect renting goods (and paying interest) until they have paid in full. Many are on low incomes and find it difficult to access credit from mainstream lenders to pay for fridges, TVs, washing machines and other electrical items. Only about a third are in work. Customers should continue to make payments in the usual way, the administrators confirmed, although for some the closure of shops and no doorstep collection owing to coronavirus means that should bedone in a different way,external. Failing to make repayments, even now the company is in administration, could lead to extra charges and harm a credit score. However, those unable to pay for practical reasons owing to coronavirus will not be charged extra or have their credit score affected. All new rent-to-own agreements and cash loans, which the company also provided, will now be stopped. Servicing, warranties, and insurance claims will continue at present, as will delivery of essential items already ordered, but in line with coronavirus restrictions. These services operated alongside the rent-to-own service. The collapse,which was trailed on Friday, means that the administrators - Grant Thornton - will now try to find buyers for all, or some, of the business. The company's website was still operating on Monday morning. Alongside many other lenders of high-cost credit, the company was being challenged by people who said they were given credit when they should not have been. In October 2017, the company was fined nearly Â£15m by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), for not acting as a ""responsible lender"". Some of those customers were given rental agreements, despite being unable to realistically afford to make the repayments. In January, the business said it was under pressure from dealing with additional mis-selling claims Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes theDebt Camel blog,external, said: ""Customers need to think if they can manage to make the repayments. ""If their income has fallen because of coronavirus, they should ask for a payment break. And if the item is just too expensive, they should ask for a lower payment arrangement. They may be able to make an affordability complaint and get a refund of the interest they have paid on previous items."" However, anyone eligible for compensation may now find they have to wait longer, and receive a fraction of what they might have expected. Terri Carter faced pressure after missing a repayment Rules, introduced last year,restricted the cost of rent-to-own, following claims of spiralling debts. The FCA ruled that interest charged would be capped to as much as the cost of the product. Prices were also controlled, with shops only able to charge no more than the median - the middle price - of three mainstream retailers, including delivery and installation charges. Shops were also prevented from increasing their prices for insurance premiums, extended warranties, or arrears charges, to recoup lost revenue from the price cap. Before the rules were brought in, spiralling interest charges meant some rent-to-own consumers had ended up paying more than four times the retail price they would have paid in normal shops. Among those who were unhappy with how the business operated was Terri Carter, a paralegal from Great Yarmouth. She had ordered a TV through BrightHouse after running out of money when furnishing her new home. She went into the store to explain that she needed to miss a repayment, only later to find a woman in a suit, accompanied by two ""big blokes"", banging on her door. At home with her son, they threatened to take away her TV, and she felt forced to agree to making extra payments. ""I work in law so I knew my rights, but what if that happens to someone older, or someone who has just had a baby?"" she said. Angela Clements, founder of not-for-profit buy-now-pay-later operator Fair for You, said: ""While my heart goes out to BrightHouse's staff who will lose their jobs, I hope that its collapse will make other lenders think twice before trying to make easy money out of hard-working families in this way. ""There is a clear need to support and rapidly scale the affordable lending sector so that other high cost credit doesn't keep mutating in that gap."" Are you a customer of BrightHouse?

"Delay Brexit deadline amid coronavirus, say MEPS","The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has contracted coronavirus Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been urged by a group of MEPs to delay his Brexit deadline as countries around the world battle the coronavirus. The European Parliamentâs largest group of MEPs said the pandemic puts pressure on the chance of securing a trade deal by the planned date. The PMâs spokesman insisted there were no plans to change the timetable. It comes as EU and UK representatives met to discuss implementing the Brexit withdrawal agreement over video link. Under the agreement, the UK enters a transition period where it will continue to follow EU rules until 31 December 2020, by which time both sides say they hope to have agreed a trade deal. Brexit talks: Differences clear after a week Full UK-EU deal 'impossible' by deadline What to expect from UK-EU talks Downing Street said the talks to agree a deal are continuing to take place over the phone, amid the coronavirus outbreak. The EUâs chief negotiator Michel Barnier has contracted the disease, and his opposite UK number David Frost has had to self-isolate. The European Peopleâs Party MEP Christophe Hansen, a negotiator on the parliament's international trade committee, said: ""Under these extraordinary circumstances, I cannot see how the UK government would choose to expose itself to the double whammy of the coronavirus and the exit from the EU single market, which will inevitably add to the disruption, deal or no deal. ""I can only hope that common sense and substance will prevail over ideology. ""An extension of the transition period is the only responsible thing to do."" And the German MEP David McAlister said: ""The coronavirus pandemic complicates the already very ambitious schedule. ""The EU has always been open to extending the transition period - the ball is now clearly in the British court.â The European Parliament will get a say in ratifying any future trade deal. When asked if an extension was possible, the prime ministerâs spokesman said: ""The transition period ends on December 31 2020. This is enshrined in UK law."" The UK has also held a meeting with the European Commission to talk about implementing the withdrawal agreement. Following the meeting between European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic and UK senior minister Michael Gove, a commission statement said that âthe proper and timely implementation of the withdrawal agreement is a key priority for the EU"". It added: âThis concerns in particular safeguarding the rights of around 4.5 million EU citizens and UK nationals, and maintaining peace and stability on the island of Ireland in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, while ensuring the integrity of the single market.â The statement also said both sides had âagreed on the importance for the UK to set out its plans over the coming months with regard to the implementation of the protocol on Ireland/Northern Irelandâ. It said there was ""an urgent need to present a detailed timetable and proceed with the necessary measures, such as preparing for the introduction of customs procedures for goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.â Under the Brexit deal reached in 2019, Northern Ireland will continue to follow EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods. The rest of the UK will stop following these rules at the end of 2020.

"Carluccio's collapses with 2,000 jobs under threat","Italian restaurant chain Carluccio's has gone into administration, blaming ""challenging trading conditions"" exacerbated by the coronavirus. Administrator FRP is ""urgently looking at options"" for the future of the firm. These include mothballing the business using government support, as well as trying to sell all or parts of it. Most of the company's 2,000 employees will be paid through the government's job retention scheme while these options are explored. This allows for staff to be paid up to 80% of their salary. The restaurant chain's collapse came minutes after rent-to-own firm  BrightHouse - the biggest rent-to-own operator in the UK - also collapsed. Collectively, the two firms employ 4,500 people. Rent-to-own giant BrightHouse collapses Carluccio's had already warned it was facing permanent branch closures due to the coronavirus. Before the outbreak it was hitby the crunch in the casual dining sectorand recently urged the state to step in. Geoff Rowley, joint administrator and partner at FRP, said: ""We are operating in unprecedented times and the issues currently facing the hospitality sector following the onset of Covid-19 are well documented. ""In the absence of being able to continue to trade Carluccio's, in the short term, we are urgently focused on the options available to preserve the future of the business and protect its employees."" Mr Rowley said FRP looked forward to working with HMRC to access the support it provided for companies in administration and their employees. He added: ""As this fast-moving situation progresses, we will remain in regular communication with all employees and key stakeholders, and will provide a further update in due course."" Denise (name changed) has been working for Carluccio's for the past four years and was employed at its branch in the Grand Central shopping centre in Birmingham when it first emerged that the chain was in trouble. ""We weren't told anything,"" she said. ""We found out via BBC News."" Denise said Carluccio's staff had been assured that their March salary would be paid as normal, but when they got their payslips, they found that they had received only 50% of what they were owed. ""That's holiday pay, sick pay, they've deducted 50% of everything,"" she told the BBC. ""I can't pay my rent this month. I don't have children, but other people who have are having to make decisions about whether to pay rent, heating bills or food bills."" She said that officials from the Unite union were contacting Carluccio's on their behalf, seeking clarification about when the other half of the money would be paid. ""We've received legal advice and we've been told that what they've done is illegal,"" she said, adding that the deductions brought their pay to below the minimum wage. Antonio Carluccio founded the chain in 1999 John Colley, associate dean at Warwick Business School, told the BBC that firms in the sector were likely to follow Carluccio's into administration. ""They over expanded, as did many other restaurant chains,"" he said. Price wars and increases in the minimum wage had put restaurants under severe pressure, he added. ""I think the fact that Carluccio's was so quick to go into administration says that this was not due to coronavirus,"" said Prof Colley. ""All the issues were there anyway and this is just the last straw."" Restrictions aimed at curbing the coronavirus pandemichave recently forced all cafes and restaurants to close. Carluccio's has faced some difficult times in recent years, closing a third of its restaurants in 2018as part of a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) rescue plan. Like many in the casual dining sector, it has felt the brunt of a fall in consumer spending, combined with higher business rates, and increases in the National Living Wage. Prezzo and Byron also used CVAs to close restaurants while Jamie's Italian went into administration last year. The chain was founded more than 20 years ago by celebrity chef and restaurateur Antonio Carluccio, who died aged 80 in 2017.

Easter egg crackdown over essential status 'wrong',"Convenience stores selling Easter eggs are facing interference from âheavy-handedâ officials trying to restrict the range of goods they can sell under coronavirus curbs, a trade body says. Some shops have been told by police and local councils that the chocolate eggs are considered non-essential goods. The Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) blamed âoverzealous enforcement and a misreading of the rulesâ. It has told shopkeepers to carry on selling a full range of goods. âThe government have defined which stores can remain open, and that includes convenience stores, including newsagents and off-licences,â said ACS chief executive James Lowman. âThere is no government definition of which products can be sold within those stores. âIn the cases where officers have challenged retailers and shoppers in this way, itâs brought confusion, distracted retailers in the busiest weeks of their lives and increased the interactions between people at a time when the government is trying to minimise them.â The attempt to restrict the kinds of goods sold in convenience stores drew a scathing reaction from retail analyst Richard Hyman. ""Quite frankly, it sounds bonkers,"" he said. ""This is a time when being excessively pedantic seems rather absurd. ""It's certainly right that if restrictions are going to be applied, they should be applied to types of outlet, not types of product."" He said the current rules, which put no restrictions on the items essential retailers can sell, were common sense and pointed out that supermarkets also had Easter eggs for sale. ""Going beyond that, what difference does it make if they do sell some Easter eggs? I suppose they might argue that it's taking up space on shelves that could be used for other items,"" Mr Hyman said. Some social media users shared the same opinion, with one saying that chocolate was ""the only thing keeping me sane"" during the pandemic. Another thought that purchasing Easter eggs is acceptable if you are already visiting a shop for essential items - or buying them as ""eggstras"". Exactly what qualifies as an ""essential"" business which is allowed to stay open during the coronavirus pandemic has caused confusion in some quarters. The official list,externalof essential retailers put together by the Cabinet Office includes off-licences, supermarkets and pharmacies as well as newsagents and corner shops. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do i protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The ACS said it had a partnership with Buckinghamshire and Surrey Trading Standards, which had confirmed that there should be no restriction on the categories of goods sold in convenience stores. An ACS spokesman told the BBC that âonly a few membersâ  had faced this âheavy-handedâ approach, adding:  âWe hope that itâs ended there.â The association said that if any retailers continued to face such challenges, they should get in touch with the name of the local authority or police force and officer, so that it could follow up with them. After strict new restrictions were brought in by government earlier this week, it issued a list of âessential retailersâ, that are allowed to stay open. They include: Supermarkets and other food shops Pharmacies Off-licences and licensed shops selling alcohol, including those within breweries Petrol stations Newsagents Bicycle shops Home and hardware stores Launderettes and dry cleaners Garages Pet shops Post offices Banks Sports Direct boss 'deeply' sorry for virus blunders Tesco restricts online orders to 80 items each Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

US in good shape to meet virus 'peak' - TrumpThe US president says hospitals will have enough ventilators to cope wit the outbreak.,"This video can not be played The US president launched a scathing attack on a CNN journalist Donald Trump has said the US will be in ""a very good shape"" in terms of the number of ventilators available by the time the coronavirus outbreak peaks. The president said at least 10 US companies were now making the medical devices, and some might be exported. The virus can cause severe respiratory issues, and ventilators help keep patients breathing. However, several state and local officials have warned hospitals are at risk of running out of equipment. Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, the US state with the second-highest number of cases, was the latest to raise the alarm, saying the ""need [was] dire"". ""We need more ventilators... This is real life. This is life and death,"" he said on Twitter. Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' What this crisis reveals about the US The US has more than 163,000 confirmed virus cases and over 3,000 deaths. On Monday, officials announced 540 new deaths in a 24-hour period, the deadliest day yet in the country. New York City is the worst-hit place in the US, with 914 confirmed fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China. Speaking at Monday's Coronavirus Task Force briefing at the White House, Mr Trump said: ""We have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators, and we say go ahead because, honestly, other countries - they'll never be able to do it."" Asked whether there would be enough ventilators for all patients in the US who needed them during a predicted peak in infections in two weeks' time, Mr Trump responded: ""I think we're going to be in a very good shape."" He said more than a million Americans had been tested for the virus, ""more than any other country by far. Not even close"". He accused a reporter who pointed out that South Korea had tested proportionally more people when measured by population size of negativity. He added that he should be congratulated on his administration's progress in fighting the virus. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Trump also repeated his allegations that some US state governors were ""hoarding"" critical medical equipment, and that items including face masks were being stolen from hospitals. He gave no evidence for either claim. Mr Trump said ""challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days"", but that social distancing could save more than a million American lives. ""We will have a great victory,"" he added. Asked by a CNN correspondent whether his previous comments downplaying the threat of the outbreak were wrong, the president responded that they were ""all true"". ""I don't want panic in the country. I could cause panic much better than even you,"" he told the reporter. Mr Trump has been accused of slowness in implementing measures to stem the spread of the virus as he feared the economic impact could hurt his re-election prospects later this year. ""The economy is number two on my list, we're going to save a lot of lives,"" he insisted. Nationwide guidelines being implemented by many states say citizens must continue to avoid non-essential travel, going to work, and eating at restaurants or bars. Gatherings are limited to groups of under 10 people. But stricter restrictions apply to millions in some of the worst-hit states. This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death On Saturday residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were advised not to travel elsewhere within the country for 14 days. Non-essential gatherings in New York City are banned and most businesses are closed as the city faces more than 33,000 cases. Police can issue fines of $250-500 (Â£200-Â£400). In California, a ""shelter in place"" order remains. The availability of ventilators is a major concern among health professionals as demand has surged. A number of states and cities have warned that they will soon not have enough to treat patients suffering from Covid-19. Last week,New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said key medical supplies could run outat the start of April. Warning have also been made by governors Andrew Cuomo, of New York, and John Bel Edwards, of Louisiana. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Trump accused hospitals in some states of ""hoarding"" ventilators, face masks and other critical medical supplies. ""We do have a problem with hoarding... including ventilators. Hospitals need to release them - in some cases they have too many, they have to release medical supplies and equipment,"" he said. Hospitals ""can't hold [ventilators] if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road"", he said, alleging that some were ""stocked up"".

Lack of childcare 'forces key workers to stay home',"Key workers say they are being forced to take time off work because they do not have access to childcare. Schools, nurseries and childminders were told to close their doors last week to all except vulnerable children and the children of key workers, such as NHS staff and delivery drivers. But many nurseries say staying open for such small numbers of children has not been financially viable. They also say staff need better protection from the coronavirus. The National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) estimates around half of nurseries have completely closed for the duration of the coronavirus crisis. But for key workers who need childcare, the closures have meant having to take time off to look after their children. Parents heed calls not to send children to school Teachers to estimate grades after exams cancelled NHS consultant Vesna Pavasovic told the BBC that she would have to take time off work to look after her daughter, because their local nursery is now closed. ""We are putting our lives at risk for the entire nation and this is without any doubt our duty. ""Equally, it's the duty of the UK government to secure, without any delay, the funding for the designated schools and nurseries supporting key workers."" Catherine says it's not easy to switch childcare providers Catherine Phelvin and her husband, both NHS clinical workers, said the nursery of their one-year-old child closed at short notice last week. ""For various reasons and this really left us quite stuck,"" said Catherine. ""If we don't have adequate childcare provision for our youngest pre-school children, it's difficult for two key worker parents or indeed single parents to continue working - even their current hours, let alone, doing extra hours. ""As well as the emotional side of this, obviously it's not that easy just to switch childcare providers. ""And there's also potentially a financial cost to us as individuals, for having to find new childcare out short notice."" Eleanor Deslow also works for the NHS and her husband is a key worker in the automotive industry. ""Last Wednesday just gone, we were told that our nursery is closing - this has left us in a situation where we currently do not have any childcare."" The couple used to rely on older relatives, but government advice states children should not be left with anyone who should be following social distancing advice - for example the over-70s or those with certain health conditions. Eleanor is worried her husband could lose his job Eleanor says her husband has now been given the option to take furlough. ""It would mean he'd be on 80% wages. But if he takes that he may not have a job to return to in three months. ""So after being promised our son would be looked after at nursery, there is no guarantee of safety being promised that the outcome will be looked after at a nursery by the government because we are key workers. ""We are now in a position, that in three months time, my husband may not have a job."" The Bright Horizons Nursery has closed ""the majority"" of its 300 childcare centres. In a statement it said it had established a number of its nurseries as ""hubs to help key worker families"" and had waived fees. NDNA chief executive Purnima Tanuku said a number of nurseries across the UK were opening their doors to children of key workers and vulnerable children ""at this challenging time"". ""However, this is causing them many difficulties which have been exacerbated by unclear guidance regarding furloughing workers."" Ms Tanuku also said staff needed greater protection from the virus: ""Nursery practitioners are putting their lives on the line when they turn up to work, as it's near impossible to distance themselves from young children. ""We would like some protective equipment to be made available and acknowledgement of their dedication and commitment to these children at this difficult time."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said it had asked nurseries and other childcare providers to close ""except for the children of critical workers and vulnerable children"". ""The government has put a range of measures in place to support providers including continuing to fund free entitlements even if children are not attending, a business rate holiday for private providers, and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to support workers."" If critical workers do not have access to their usual childcare place, she added, they should contact their local authority to arrange an alternative. The government is also looking to pass emergency legislation to ""require educational institutions or childcare providers to stay open"". A spokeswoman for the Welsh government added: ""We are working with local authorities to identify sufficient childcare for 0-4 year olds in settings across Wales for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers."" But the Professional Association of Childcare ad Early Years raised concerns that many childminders would not qualify for the government help drawn up in response to the coronavirus epidemic. Chief executive Liz Bayram said: ""We remain especially worried about the sustainability of the 40,000 registered childminders in England and Wales. ""Most do not qualify for the current government support available to business. They are self-employed sole traders - only 3% deliver early education places so will not benefit from continuation in that funding."" Most were on low incomes and many were single parents who could only look to the benefit system for support, she added.

Millions of garden plants set to be binned,"Millions of plants, shrubs and trees could be binned in the coming days and weeks, meaning ruin for UK growers. The closure of 2,000 garden centres and nurseries mean makers of what's called ""ornamental horticulture"" have no outlet for their plants. The Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) is asking the government for financial assistance of up to Â£250m to help the industry avoid collapse. It warned that up to a third of producers could go bust. Ornamental plant growers' main assets are their inventory of plants - and they are facing a loss of nearly their entire 2020 income, according to the HTA. As one grower put it: ""My car dealer down the road is shut. However painful that will be - they will still have all their vehicles. ""At roughly the same value, in three months' time, if I'm a nursery producing seasonal plants it will be nil."" The government recently banned all ""non-essential"" retailin the UK, to try to stop the spread of Covid-19. James Barnes, who chairs the HTA, told the BBC's Today programme that the industry had ""hit a perfect storm"". ""Growers will have spent the last three or four months building up supplies which they can't sell and all of this stock is perishable,"" he said. ""If they can't sell it, it can't get to the end user, it can't get in the ground, then it has to be written off. They'll have to be literally thrown away."" Mr Barnes said the HTA was trying to persuade the government to bring in a scrappage scheme for plants that would provide specific assistance to growers. The closure of garden centres due to the pandemic comes at the worst possible moment for producers like Neil Alcock - the beginning of the peak March to July gardening season. He's the managing director of Seiont Nurseries in north Wales, which grows and supplies young plants to the retail supply chain. Neil Alcock is the managing director of Seiont Nurseries in Caernarfon, north Wales He told BBC Breakfast: ""This should be our busiest time of year. Last week in fact, we should have had the busiest in our entire history - but that's when the coronavirus kicked in. ""We had sold thousands of plants, but then cancellations came in from everywhere. No ifs, no buts, the whole retail supply chain stopped for us."" Neil said that the firm had seen a downturn costing them about Â£100,000 worth of orders. The value of stock during this key trading period is typically three to four times the year-end value of most businesses. This is the period at which they are most extended financially and feel unwilling, or unable, to take on additional debt available through government schemes that offer guarantees to lenders but not borrowers. Online sales are not the answer, according to industry leaders who say that there is not enough delivery capacity to even make a dent in the stranded inventory belonging to UK growers. The HTA told the BBC that ""the seasonality of the garden industry and the perishable nature"" of many plants puts the UK industry in a difficult position. There are about 23 million gardeners in the UK, and at a time when many people are spending more time in their gardens (for those lucky enough to have one), there is a very real prospect that the country's gardens and villages will fail to bloom in the months ahead. Without assistance, it's not just the plants that may wither and die. Large parts of the gardening industry may do the same. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do i protect myself?

Rescue flights for stranded BritonsForeign Office to work with airlines to get tens of thousands home - and spend Â£75m on other charter flights.,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab said charter flights will be arranged for countries where commercial flights have stopped. Tens of thousands of Britons stranded abroad by the coronavirus pandemic will be flown home under a new arrangement between the government and airlines. BA, Virgin and Easyjet are among airlines working with the government to fly Britons back to the UK. The government has also pledged Â£75m to charter special flights to bring home UK nationals from countries where commercial flights are unavailable. The number of people who have died with the virus in the UKhas reached 1,408. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said an ""unprecedented"" number of UK travellers were trying to get home ""from young backpackers to retired couples on cruises"". ""We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people travelling around the world,"" he said. Under the new arrangement, airlines would be responsible for getting stranded passengers home where commercial routes remain an option. Where commercial routes do not exist, government financial support will enable special charter flights - operated by the partner airlines and others - to fly to priority countries to bring back UK residents. Mr Raab said priority would be given to the most vulnerable - including the elderly or those with pressing medical needs - and also to countries where there are large numbers of British tourists trying to return to the UK. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry criticised the plans as ""just more of the same"", and called for ""a fresh, comprehensive and fully-funded strategy to bring our British nationals home"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Outlining the partnership, Mr Raab said airlines should offer alternative flights ""at little to no cost where routes have been cancelled"" and allow passengers to change tickets - including between carriers. He added: ""So for those still in those countries where commercial options are still available: don't wait. Don't run the risk of getting stranded. ""The airlines are standing by to help you - please book your tickets as soon as possible."" Virgin, easyJet, Jet2 and Titan Airways signed a memorandum of understanding relating to the arrangement on Monday, while British Airways has also said it will work with government to get people home. Other airlines are expected to join the new arrangement, Mr Raab said. June and Leslie Webb, both 77-years-old with underlying health conditions, are trying to return to Southend, Essex, from Goa, western India. The couple were due to return to Britain on Monday after a two-and-a-half week trip, but their flight was cancelled after India declared a 21-day lockdown on 24 March. They have since booked a non-refundable Â£700 flight for 2 April, which was also cancelled, their daughter-in-law Sally Webb told BBC News. ""My mother-in-law is in remission from cancer and my father-in-law is diabetic,"" Mrs Webb said. ""The situation is getting desperate."" She added that the couple had about a week's worth of medication left and were reporting food shortages where they were staying. Mrs Webb has been working with her sister-in-law to get them home, but said the government briefing was ""the first bit"" of information they had received about repatriation efforts. ""It doesn't give us a lot of hope because obviously India is on lockdown,"" she said. ""The fact is that even if the UK are able to get the Indian government to release the lockdown, they have got to get all of the other Brits as well as our in-laws home. ""We just want a flight, any flight and we want them home safe."" Mrs Webb added that she would like further details about how long it would take to get a flight, ""just so I could give my in laws some reassurance"". Speaking to BBC News following the daily briefing, Ms Thornberry said she was ""disappointed"" that there was not more detail and that some questions ""simply hadn't been addressed"". ""What happens if your insurance has run out whilst you are waiting to get on a flight, what happens if your food or your medicine is running out - there aren't any specific answers to that,"" she said. Ms Thornberry added that she had received ""worrying"" emails from British people around the world about commercial flights, including one family of six who had been told it would cost Â£61,000 to get them home from Australia to Yorkshire. ""That's simply unacceptable,"" she said. Instructions for UK travellers to return home can be found on the government'sforeign travel advice website,external. The Foreign Office said it has already helped hundreds of thousands of British tourists return from around the globe including 8,500 from Morocco, about 5,000 from Cyprus, and an estimated 150,000 from Spain. From the moment countries started closing their borders, it only felt like a matter of time until the government had to step in in a more concrete way to get a vast number of stranded British people home. Up until now, the Foreign Office has been pressuring countries to lift travel restrictions and co-ordinating with UK airlines that have been running empty planes out to destinations to bring people home. It was a commercial operation and it worked up until a point. But with so many people stuck in all corners of the globe, and anger growing among many who found themselves in precarious situations, the government ultimately had to provide funding to ensure a more extensive repatriation programme was possible. Airlines are in dire financial straits and Â£75m is, in aviation terms, a relatively small sum. But by helping government now, they'll be hoping government helps them through this crisis and beyond. Later in the news briefing, the UK's chief scientific adviser said there were early signs that social distancing measures in the UKwere ""making a difference"". Sir Patrick Vallance said people were heeding the advice to stay at home to keep the pressure off the NHS. As of 09:00 BST on Monday, 22,141 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus, while 112,805 have tested negative, according to the Department of Health. The total number of people who have died with the virus in the UK reached 1,408, as measured before 17:00 BST on Sunday. The deaths include a further 159 people in England, six in Scotland, 14 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland.

Trump extends US guidelines to end of April,"This video can not be played ""Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won"" President Donald Trump has said federal coronavirus guidelines such as social distancing will be extended across the US until at least 30 April. He had previously suggested that they could be relaxedas early as Easter, which falls in mid-April. ""The highest point of the death rate is likely to hit in two weeks,"" Mr Trump said. He appeared to be referring to peak infection rates that experts fear could overwhelm hospitals. White House medical adviserDr Anthony Faucihad earlier warned thatthe virus could kill up to 200,000 Americans. Dr Fauci said that it was ""entirely conceivable"" that millions of Americans could eventually be infected. Live: Our rolling coronavirus coverage Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' What this crisis reveals about the US The US now has more than 153,000 confirmed cases. As of Monday afternoon, 2,828 deaths had been recorded in the country in relation to Covid-19, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China. Speaking during the White House coronavirus briefing on Sunday, Mr Trump called social distancing measures ""the way you win"", adding that the US ""will be well on our way to recovery"" by June. Suggesting that the ""peak"" of death rates in the US was likely to hit in two weeks, Mr Trump said that ""nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won - that would be the greatest loss of all"". Analysts suggest that when Mr Trump referred to a peak in the ""death rate"", he probably meant the total number of recorded infections. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak He said the decision to extend social distancing was made after he heard that ""2.2 million people could have died if we didn't go through with all of this"", adding that if the death toll could be restricted to less than 100,000 ""we all together have done a very good job"". Mr Trump had previously said that Easter - 10-13 April - would be a ""beautiful time"" to be able to open at least some sections of the country. On Sunday he said that lifting restrictions at Easter was ""just an aspiration"". ""I wish we could have our old life back... but we're working very hard, that's all I know."" He said that ""rapid testing"" had been approved to get Covid-19 results within five minutes, and that doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers would get them. Earlier tweets, Mr Trump touted a New York Times article which called the president's daily briefings a ""ratings hit"". However, he claimed in his briefing the ratings figures ""don't matter to me"". ""What matters to me is that we have a victory over this thing as soon as possible"" he said. This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death Nationwide measures mean citizens must continue to avoid non-essential travel, going to work, and eating at restaurants or bars. Gatherings are limited to groups of under 10 people. But stricter restrictions apply to millions in some of the worst-hit states. A field hospital has been built in Central Park as New York City deals with more than 33,000 cases On Saturday residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were instructed not to travel elsewhere within the country for 14 days. Non-essential gatherings in New York City are banned and most businesses are closed as the city faces more than 33,000 cases. Police can issue fines of $250-500 (Â£200-Â£400). In California, a ""shelter in place"" order remains. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Trump accused hospitals in some states of ""hoarding"" ventilators, face masks and other critical medical supplies. ""We do have a problem with hoarding... including ventilators. Hospitals need to release them - in some cases they have too many, they have to release medical supplies and equipment,"" he said. Hospitals ""can't hold [ventilators] if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road"", he said, alleging that some were ""stocked up"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lack of medical supplies 'a national shame' The availability of ventilators is a major concern among health professionals as demand has surged. A number of states have warned that they will soon not have enough to treat patients suffering from Covid-19. The virus can cause severe respiratory issues as it attacks the lungs, and ventilators help to keep patients breathing. More than 33,000 people are now confirmed to have died worldwide after being infected with the new coronavirus. Some of the latest major global developments include: InGermanythe number of confirmed cases has jumped to over 57,000 - an increase of 4,751 Australiahas tightened its restrictions, with public gatherings now limited to just two people and playgrounds, outdoor gyms and parks closed from Monday South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has said emergency cash payments will be made to all households except the top 30% by income In theUK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed that about 20,000 former NHS staff had returned to work to help the fight against coronavirus Spainrecorded a new daily record of deaths, reporting 838 victims on Sunday Italyrecorded 756 new deaths over 24 hours, bringing the total to 10,779 - a slight drop in the daily toll Francereported 292 new deaths, bringing its total to 2,606 as specially modified trains began transporting patients from the worst-hit areas to hospitals in the south Tight new restrictions in theRussiancapital Moscow allow residents to leave their homes only for medical emergencies, essential work and to shop for food or medicine The price of oil has sunk to levels not seen since 2002as demand for crude collapses Coronavirus could infect 'millions' of Americans Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' Reopening the US by Easter 'a beautiful timeline' Video, 00:01:04Reopening the US by Easter 'a beautiful timeline' Trump orders 'time-wasting' GM to make ventilators Economic meltdown brings political pain Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Coronavirus: UK measures 'making a difference'People are heeding the advice to stay home to keep pressure off the NHS - and it's working, says advisor.","Police officers from North Yorkshire Police stop motorists in cars to check that their travel is ""essential"" People are heeding the advice to stay at home to keep pressure off the NHS, and there are early signs that it is working, the UK's chief scientific adviser has said. Sir Patrick Vallance told a news conference that social distancing measures are ""making a difference"". Transmission of coronavirus in the community is thought to be decreasing, which could mean fewer infections. Hospital admissions data suggests cases are not rising as fast as feared. There are currently 9,000 people in hospitals in England with coronavirus, up from 6,000 on Friday. This amounts to about one in ten of all hospital beds in the country. The latest number of deaths announced in the UK of people with the virus has reached 1,408. The deaths include a further 159 people in England, six in Scotland, 14 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick said the NHS was seeing around an additional 1,000 patients a day and described this daily rise as ""stable"". ""That shows that it's going up not in an increasing amount but in a constant amount, which may suggest that we're already beginning to see some effect,"" he said. After the daily number of deaths fell for the second day, he also cautioned against paying ""too much attention"" to day-to-day fluctuations in figures, explaining ""we need to look over time and see what's happening"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Of the 1,000-a-day rise in hospital patients, he told reporters at the daily briefing: ""I do expect that number to continue. I expect people coming every day to be about that, it may go up a little bit. ""And in two or three weeks you would expect that to stabilise and to start to go down a bit."" He said the figures suggested the UK was ""not on a fast acceleration"" - but warned that ""we expect this to get worse"" over the next couple of weeks because of the ""lag"" in social distancing measures taking effect. He said it was ""premature"" to put a timescale on how long social distancing measures would need to be in place. He said instead the focus needed to be on making sure hospital admissions were not accelerating above a level that the NHS could cope with. Among those who have died was 55-year-old ear, nose and throat consultantAmged El-Hawraniwho died at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, on Saturday. His death follows that ofan organ transplant consultantlast week, who became the first working NHS surgeon to die after testing positive for the virus. Mr El-Hawrani's brotherpaid tribute to him on Monday as a hero- ""just like every doctor and every nurse and anyone working at the NHS"". He added that his brother ""would have been heavily exposed"" to the virus. ""He worked so hard, both private and NHS, at many hospitals. He saw hundreds and hundreds of patients. We don't know how many patients he was exposed to."" By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics, BBC News There is a glimmer of hope in these figures: had deaths continued to grow at that recent daily rate of roughly a third a day, we might have expected to see 350 new deaths on Sunday and 450 today. Instead, we've seen slight falls: 260 deaths on Saturday, 209 on Sunday and a further fall to 180 today. But we shouldn't get carried away too soon: last week's Sunday-into-Monday figures also showed slight dips on the previous Saturday. But by Tuesday, they resumed the upward march. It's still too soon to know whether this is a real ray of hope, a blip caused by different working practices at the weekend or some mixture of the two. Special hospitals are being set up in Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff and London, where a new Nightingale hospital with 4,000 to 5,000 beds has been set up at the ExCel Centre. It will start receiving its first patients this week. Around one in four doctors are off work at the moment either with symptoms or isolating because family members have symptoms, the head of the Royal College of Physicians estimated. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said: ""You talk to people on the front line and there is intense pressure. Staffing is a problem... they say it's very, very difficult, particularly in London. The situation for staffing is getting worse in Birmingham, and as one source put it - normal wards are turning into Covid wards. ""So you can build new hospitals, bring back volunteers - people who've retired, nurses and doctors, and so on - but staffing them, I think, is going to be an issue."" In other developments, the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has announcedmeasures to help Britons stranded abroad. Airlines including BA, Virgin and easyJet will work with the government to help fly tens of thousands of Britons back to the UK. Mr Raab said the Foreign Office has also set aside Â£75m to charter special flights where commercial ones are unavailable. Elsewhere, Clarence House confirmedthe Prince of Wales is now out of self-isolation, following his diagnosis of coronavirus last week. A palace official said Prince Charles, 71, was in good health. In a video posted online on Sunday,Prime Minister Boris Johnson saidthe public appeared to be obeying the restrictions set out by government to slow the spread of the virus, adding that train use was down 95% and bus use down 75%. The prime minister also confirmed 20,000 former NHS staff have returned to work to help deal with the coronavirus outbreak, adding the country would get through the crisis ""together"". In pictures: Daily life with the coronavirus Mr Johnson - who became the first world leader to announce he had the virus - has continued to lead the country's response to the pandemic, carrying out meetings over video link while self-isolating in his Downing Street flat. On Monday, a No 10 source confirmed that his chief adviser Dominic Cummings had developed symptoms of the virus and was self-isolating at home. In other developments: Pharmaceutical company Johnson and Johnson hopes to start coronavirus vaccine trials in humans by September Police in Scotland issued 25 fines over the weekend to people breaking the coronavirus restrictions, such as businesses that were still open. The force also said it received a significant number of calls including from people reporting others who were breaking rules Meanwhile, thousands of airline staff from EasyJet and Virginare being offered work in the new NHS Nightingale Hospital.

The long-runningBBC Radio 4 soap The Archersis going to feature a coronavirus storyline. Producers said the episodes - from early-May - will feature fewer interacting characters ""sharing more of their private thoughts with the listener"", reflecting social distancing across the UK.

Those that have made changes include Middlesbrough, Mansfield, Luton and Plymouth, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicefound. Local authorities are also redeploying some staff, such as those in council-run gyms that have been ordered to shut down,to other essential tasks.  Parking operator NCP is offering free parking where it has control of charges to those who have to travel, although many of its car parks have also closed. Councillor James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: ""No health worker, social care worker or anyone volunteering for the NHS, should have to pay parking charges as they tackle the coronavirus and support communities.""

Children, parents and teachers at Roade Primary in Northamptonshire, who are all staying at home, filmed themselves each singing a line of the 1972 classic. Head teacher Mark Currell said he wanted families to know the school was ""thinking about them all"". As well as the surge of volunteers stepping forward to help the NHS there are armies of people doing good in their local communities. Katie Dixon, a nursing student at Birmingham City University, has recruited nearly 1,000 people in the city to help vulnerable people, with 250 more volunteers waiting to start, according to the university. She said it ""quickly became apparent"" more people wanted to help in her own area, Kings Heath, so she set up a separate group to coordinate it. We have a real sense of community where I live, which is so lovely, especially at a time like this when so many are worried.  Itâs been a whirlwind, but we are making a difference and thatâs what itâs all about.  Weâre still being inundated with offers of help and now the elderly and vulnerable in our local area are getting in touch for support. Itâs been hard work, but to know we are making a difference, even if only at a local postcode level, is everything."" Katie Dixon Graham is living apart from his wife and triplets who are at risk from coronavirus complications. An MP went back to work as a doctor ""volunteering on the NHS front line"". Kieran Mullan, Conservative MP for Crewe and Nantwich, said on Sunday he was back at work as a volunteer and urged people to stay at home to save lives. On Facebook he gave thanks to the hundreds of thousands of people that have also volunteered to help. ""Thank-you for the comments but the thanks should really be for the people that do this day in, day out all year round,"" he said. Dr Mullan was elected in the December general election. James LawBBC News The advice to stay at home means many people suddenly have more time on their hands.

"Coronavirus: UK measures 'making a difference'People are heeding the advice to stay home to keep pressure off the NHS - and it's working, says advisor.Health","Police officers from North Yorkshire Police stop motorists in cars to check that their travel is ""essential"" People are heeding the advice to stay at home to keep pressure off the NHS, and there are early signs that it is working, the UK's chief scientific adviser has said. Sir Patrick Vallance told a news conference that social distancing measures are ""making a difference"". Transmission of coronavirus in the community is thought to be decreasing, which could mean fewer infections. Hospital admissions data suggests cases are not rising as fast as feared. There are currently 9,000 people in hospitals in England with coronavirus, up from 6,000 on Friday. This amounts to about one in ten of all hospital beds in the country. The latest number of deaths announced in the UK of people with the virus has reached 1,408. The deaths include a further 159 people in England, six in Scotland, 14 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick said the NHS was seeing around an additional 1,000 patients a day and described this daily rise as ""stable"". ""That shows that it's going up not in an increasing amount but in a constant amount, which may suggest that we're already beginning to see some effect,"" he said. After the daily number of deaths fell for the second day, he also cautioned against paying ""too much attention"" to day-to-day fluctuations in figures, explaining ""we need to look over time and see what's happening"".

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Of the 1,000-a-day rise in hospital patients, he told reporters at the daily briefing: ""I do expect that number to continue. I expect people coming every day to be about that, it may go up a little bit. ""And in two or three weeks you would expect that to stabilise and to start to go down a bit."" He said the figures suggested the UK was ""not on a fast acceleration"" - but warned that ""we expect this to get worse"" over the next couple of weeks because of the ""lag"" in social distancing measures taking effect. He said it was ""premature"" to put a timescale on how long social distancing measures would need to be in place. He said instead the focus needed to be on making sure hospital admissions were not accelerating above a level that the NHS could cope with. Among those who have died was 55-year-old ear, nose and throat consultantAmged El-Hawraniwho died at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, on Saturday. His death follows that ofan organ transplant consultantlast week, who became the first working NHS surgeon to die after testing positive for the virus. Mr El-Hawrani's brotherpaid tribute to him on Monday as a hero- ""just like every doctor and every nurse and anyone working at the NHS"". He added that his brother ""would have been heavily exposed"" to the virus. ""He worked so hard, both private and NHS, at many hospitals. He saw hundreds and hundreds of patients. We don't know how many patients he was exposed to."" By Robert Cuffe, head of statistics, BBC News There is a glimmer of hope in these figures: had deaths continued to grow at that recent daily rate of roughly a third a day, we might have expected to see 350 new deaths on Sunday and 450 today. Instead, we've seen slight falls: 260 deaths on Saturday, 209 on Sunday and a further fall to 180 today. But we shouldn't get carried away too soon: last week's Sunday-into-Monday figures also showed slight dips on the previous Saturday. But by Tuesday, they resumed the upward march. It's still too soon to know whether this is a real ray of hope, a blip caused by different working practices at the weekend or some mixture of the two. Special hospitals are being set up in Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Cardiff and London, where a new Nightingale hospital with 4,000 to 5,000 beds has been set up at the ExCel Centre. It will start receiving its first patients this week. Around one in four doctors are off work at the moment either with symptoms or isolating because family members have symptoms, the head of the Royal College of Physicians estimated. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said: ""You talk to people on the front line and there is intense pressure. Staffing is a problem... they say it's very, very difficult, particularly in London. The situation for staffing is getting worse in Birmingham, and as one source put it - normal wards are turning into Covid wards. ""So you can build new hospitals, bring back volunteers - people who've retired, nurses and doctors, and so on - but staffing them, I think, is going to be an issue.""

Â£1.1bn 'reprioritised' fund to tackle coronavirusThe cash is aimed at helping businesses and public services come through the pandemic.Wales politicsComments,"First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced new funding to help businesses come through the coronavirus pandemic A Â£1.1bn support package for the economy and public services in Wales has been unveiled. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the fighting fund was to help businesses ""weather the coronavirus storm"", at the daily Welsh Government briefing. Further schemes will be announced throughout the week as part of the package of support. The package consists of cash reallocated from existing budgets and new money from the UK Treasury. Speaking at the daily briefing on Monday, Mr Drakeford said: ""The effect on the economy is extraordinary"" adding the money would be targeted to ""specific Welsh needs"". The Â£1.1bn being announced is ""reprioritised"" money. There will be a Â£500m economy crisis fund for businesses, charities and social enterprises to help them to survive the crisis so that they can provide jobs and products in the future. Money which would have been used for enforcing speed limits will be repurposed as roads are much quieter Mr Drakeford said this money was over and above what had been given to businesses by the UK government to help those firms who need to go into hibernation during the pandemic. As part of that fund, Â£100m will be administered by the Development Bank for Wales to help firms with cashflow problems including loans between Â£5,000 and Â£250,000 with minimal interest payments attached. The remaining Â£400m will form an emergency fund giving Â£10,000 to firms employing fewer than nine people, grants of Â£100,000 to business with 10 to 250 employees as well as support for larger companies that are significantly important to Wales and have their headquarters here. Responding to the announcement, Paul Davies AM, leader of the Welsh Conservatives said: ""The Welsh Government's Â£1.1bn announced today consists of only 25% of Welsh Government money as the rest is from European funding and the UK Treasury. ""Surely, we must see ministers re-prioritising their budgets even further as the emergency the country finds itself in cannot be business as usual."" He called on the Welsh Government to ""immediately bring forward a supplementary budget as the first minister promised last week"". The Welsh Government, by the way that they are allocating these funds, is recognising the importance of manufacturing firms to jobs and livelihoods in Wales. The UK government has prioritised retail, leisure and hospitality businesses but in Wales the help is available for all sections of the economy including social enterprises and charities. Companies will have to apply for the support and meet certain criteria. I understand that there have been detailed discussions within the Welsh Government about how its spending plans could be altered to prioritise financial help for health and economy during the crisis. For instance money has been moved from the Welsh Government's international trade department and also money that was to have been spent on enforcing speed limits on highways will now be prioritised to help protect jobs in the wider economy. I also understand that around one quarter of the Â£1.1bn has come from European Union funds that had been given to help new businesses start up. It will now be used to help existing businesses survive. The BBC understands that about 25% of the Â£1.1bn is from its existing budget. Half of the Â£1.1bn comes from the consequential of what has been announced in Westminster, for example, money for the health service or railways. However the Welsh Government, unlike the UK government, is not giving rate relief to the very biggest of properties, such as the biggest Tesco and Sainsbury's. Cafes and bars are particularly at risk from the tight restrictions That money - approximately Â£12m - which, in England, would have gone to those big business sites, will fund other businesses, social enterprises and charities. The Â£1.1bn announced on Monday is in addition to the Â£1.4bn announced by Economy Minister Ken Skates earlier. The first minister also said Wales should get more money to deal with coronavirus because of the legacy of mining and heavy industries on the population's health. ""We have an older, sicker population. Our history of coal mining and heavy industry means we have people with breathing problems that the coronavirus is particularly likely to affect. ""Money should come to Wales based on our need, not simply our population share,"" he told the press conference. Â£24m fund launched to help co-ordinate volunteers What is the help for businesses? Wages, sick pay and time off explained Mr Drakeford said he had ""no doubt at all"" the lockdown restrictions would go beyond three weeks and warned individuals and businesses to expect a ""long haul"". He was responding to comments made by England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries yesterday, who said she expected the restrictions tocontinue for up to six months. Mr Drakeford said: ""There is no doubt at all that we are facing restrictions beyond the three weeks of the immediate period that we made on Monday of last week. ""I think there will be a gradual reduction in restrictions over time."" He added: ""We may need significant restrictions for longer than the original three weeks and beyond that period there will be time when we don't just go from everything being restricted to nothing being restricted. That's going to be a long haul, a difficult haul for individuals and businesses."" Mr Drakeford also announced that antibody tests would be coming over the next weeks or months but were not ready yet. He paid tribute to health and social care workers and said the response from people wanting to volunteer was ""amazing"". Mr Drakefordannounced severe restrictionson people and businesses last Monday, including shutting all high street shops except those selling food, as well as pharmacies, banks and post offices. The Welsh Government's cabinet met last week to discuss how to prioritise its existing funds. It has already been announcedWelsh ministers will invest Â£1.4bn to help companiesthrough grants and business rate relief. Economy Minister Ken Skates previously saidthe Welsh Government would match plans announced by UK Chancellor Rishi Sunakto help English businesses. It included a business rate holiday for all firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors for 12 months and funding grants of between Â£10,000 and Â£25,000 for small businesses. But the Welsh Government has since decided not to give business rate relief to the ""fewer than 200 properties across Wales"" with a rateable value of Â£500,000 and above. The money will instead be used to create a Â£100m fund to help other businesses, social enterprises and charities during the coronavirus crisis. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Businesses will start to receive the emergency funds by the middle of the week. Last week, the UK government announceda scheme to pay 80% of the wages of employeesunable to work during the crisis anda separate package allowing self-employed workers to apply for a grant worth 80% of their average monthly profits.

Rescue flights for stranded BritonsForeign Office to work with airlines to gets tens of thousands home - and spend Â£75m on other charter flights.UK,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab said charter flights will be arranged for countries where commercial flights have stopped. Tens of thousands of Britons stranded abroad by the coronavirus pandemic will be flown home under a new arrangement between the government and airlines. BA, Virgin and Easyjet are among airlines working with the government to fly Britons back to the UK. The government has also pledged Â£75m to charter special flights to bring home UK nationals from countries where commercial flights are unavailable. The number of people who have died with the virus in the UKhas reached 1,408. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said an ""unprecedented"" number of UK travellers were trying to get home ""from young backpackers to retired couples on cruises"". ""We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people travelling around the world,"" he said. Under the new arrangement, airlines would be responsible for getting stranded passengers home where commercial routes remain an option. Where commercial routes do not exist, government financial support will enable special charter flights - operated by the partner airlines and others - to fly to priority countries to bring back UK residents. Mr Raab said priority would be given to the most vulnerable - including the elderly or those with pressing medical needs - and also to countries where there are large numbers of British tourists trying to return to the UK. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry criticised the plans as ""just more of the same"", and called for ""a fresh, comprehensive and fully-funded strategy to bring our British nationals home"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Outlining the partnership, Mr Raab said airlines should offer alternative flights ""at little to no cost where routes have been cancelled"" and allow passengers to change tickets - including between carriers. He added: ""So for those still in those countries where commercial options are still available: don't wait. Don't run the risk of getting stranded. ""The airlines are standing by to help you - please book your tickets as soon as possible."" Virgin, easyJet, Jet2 and Titan Airways signed a memorandum of understanding relating to the arrangement on Monday, while British Airways has also said it will work with government to get people home. Other airlines are expected to join the new arrangement, Mr Raab said. June and Leslie Webb, both 77-years-old with underlying health conditions, are trying to return to Southend, Essex, from Goa, western India. The couple were due to return to Britain on Monday after a two-and-a-half week trip, but their flight was cancelled after India declared a 21-day lockdown on 24 March. They have since booked a non-refundable Â£700 flight for 2 April, which was also cancelled, their daughter-in-law Sally Webb told BBC News. ""My mother-in-law is in remission from cancer and my father-in-law is diabetic,"" Mrs Webb said. ""The situation is getting desperate."" She added that the couple had about a week's worth of medication left and were reporting food shortages where they were staying. Mrs Webb has been working with her sister-in-law to get them home, but said the government briefing was ""the first bit"" of information they had received about repatriation efforts. ""It doesn't give us a lot of hope because obviously India is on lockdown,"" she said. ""The fact is that even if the UK are able to get the Indian government to release the lockdown, they have got to get all of the other Brits as well as our in-laws home. ""We just want a flight, any flight and we want them home safe."" Mrs Webb added that she would like further details about how long it would take to get a flight, ""just so I could give my in laws some reassurance"". Speaking to BBC News following the daily briefing, Ms Thornberry said she was ""disappointed"" that there was not more detail and that some questions ""simply hadn't been addressed"". ""What happens if your insurance has run out whilst you are waiting to get on a flight, what happens if your food or your medicine is running out - there aren't any specific answers to that,"" she said. Ms Thornberry added that she had received ""worrying"" emails from British people around the world about commercial flights, including one family of six who had been told it would cost Â£61,000 to get them home from Australia to Yorkshire. ""That's simply unacceptable,"" she said. Instructions for UK travellers to return home can be found on the government'sforeign travel advice website,external. The Foreign Office said it has already helped hundreds of thousands of British tourists return from around the globe including 8,500 from Morocco, about 5,000 from Cyprus, and an estimated 150,000 from Spain. From the moment countries started closing their borders, it only felt like a matter of time until the government had to step in in a more concrete way to get a vast number of stranded British people home. Up until now, the Foreign Office has been pressuring countries to lift travel restrictions and co-ordinating with UK airlines that have been running empty planes out to destinations to bring people home. It was a commercial operation and it worked up until a point. But with so many people stuck in all corners of the globe, and anger growing among many who found themselves in precarious situations, the government ultimately had to provide funding to ensure a more extensive repatriation programme was possible. Airlines are in dire financial straits and Â£75m is, in aviation terms, a relatively small sum. But by helping government now, they'll be hoping government helps them through this crisis and beyond. Later in the news briefing, the UK's chief scientific adviser said there were early signs that social distancing measures in the UKwere ""making a difference"". Sir Patrick Vallance said people were heeding the advice to stay at home to keep the pressure off the NHS. As of 09:00 BST on Monday, 22,141 people in the UK have tested positive for coronavirus, while 112,805 have tested negative, according to the Department of Health. The total number of people who have died with the virus in the UK reached 1,408, as measured before 17:00 BST on Sunday. The deaths include a further 159 people in England, six in Scotland, 14 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland.

I Love Rock 'N' Roll writer dies of coronavirusAlan Merrill co-wrote and sang the glam rock classic before Joan Jett made it famous.Entertainment & Arts,"The singer had a long and varied career in music, with bands in Japan, the UK and the US The co-writer and original singer of I Love Rock 'N' Roll, Alan Merrill, has died after contracting coronavirus. His daughter Laurashared the news,external, saying the 69-year-old had been healthy enough to play shows a few weeks ago. ""He played down the 'cold' he thought he had,"" she wrote, before warning other families not to be complacent. ""You don't think It'll happen to you or your strong family. It has,"" she wrote. ""Stay home if not for you, for others. For my dad. This thing is real."" I Love Rock 'N' Roll became a global hit for Joan Jett in 1982 and has been covered by artists ranging from Britney Spears to Weird Al Yankovic. A parody version, I Love Sausage Rolls, was last year's Christmas number one in the UK, with proceeds going to charity. Coronavirus also claimed the life of country singer Joe Diffie over the weekend, while the family of Nashville legend John Prine said he was critically ill on a ventilator and being treated for Covid-19 symptoms. Prine, an influential singer-songwriter who is known for lyrical, melancholy folk songs like Hello In There and Angel From Montgomery, has previously survived cancer twice. As news of his condition broke, musicians including Joan Baez, Bette Midler and Kacey Musgraves sent the Grammy Award winner their love and support. Allow YouTube content?

Alan Merrill, who was born Allan Preston Sachs in New York, had a long and varied career as a musician. He signed his first record deal as lead singer of the band The Lead, who had a big hit in Japan with Aoi Bara (Blue Rose). After releasing two successful solo albums and hosting TV shows and acting in soap operas, he left Japan for the UK in 1974 to form The Arrows, who put a glam rock sheen on classic pop melodies. The group scored hits with A Touch Too Much and My Last Night With You, and I Love Rock 'N' Roll was written by Merrill and guitarist Jake Hooker as ""a knee-jerk response to the Rolling Stones' It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)"" in 1975. Originally issued on the B-side of The Arrows' single Broken Down Heart, it became a hit after DJs started playing the flip side instead. Its success led to the band getting a weekly ITV series, with musical guests including Marc Bolan, Slade and The Bay City Rollers - and that was where US singer Joan Jett first heard, and fell in love with, I Love Rock 'N' Roll.

Breaking|Breaking newsRescue flights for stranded BritonsUK government announces new plan to fly home tens of thousands of Britons stranded by coronavirus pandemicUK,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab said charter flights will be arranged for countries where commercial flights have stopped. Tens of thousands of Britons stranded abroad by the coronavirus pandemic will be flown home under a new arrangement between the government and airlines. BA, Virgin and Easyjet are among airlines working with the government to fly Britons back to the UK. The government has also pledged Â£75m to charter special flights to bring home UK nationals from countries where commercial flights are unavailable. The number of people who have died with the virus in the UKhas reached 1,408. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said an ""unprecedented"" number of UK travellers were trying to get home ""from young backpackers to retired couples on cruises"". ""We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people travelling around the world,"" he said. Under the new arrangement, airlines would be responsible for getting stranded passengers home where commercial routes remain an option. Where commercial routes do not exist, government financial support will enable special charter flights - operated by the partner airlines and others - to fly to priority countries to bring back UK residents. Mr Raab said priority would be given to the most vulnerable - including the elderly or those with pressing medical needs - and also to countries where there are large numbers of British tourists trying to return to the UK. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry criticised the plans as ""just more of the same"", and called for ""a fresh, comprehensive and fully-funded strategy to bring our British nationals home"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Outlining the partnership, Mr Raab said airlines should offer alternative flights ""at little to no cost where routes have been cancelled"" and allow passengers to change tickets - including between carriers. He added: ""So for those still in those countries where commercial options are still available: don't wait. Don't run the risk of getting stranded. ""The airlines are standing by to help you - please book your tickets as soon as possible."" Virgin, easyJet, Jet2 and Titan Airways signed a memorandum of understanding relating to the arrangement on Monday, while British Airways has also said it will work with government to get people home. Other airlines are expected to join the new arrangement, Mr Raab said. June and Leslie Webb, both 77-years-old with underlying health conditions, are trying to return to Southend, Essex, from Goa, western India. The couple were due to return to Britain on Monday after a two-and-a-half week trip, but their flight was cancelled after India declared a 21-day lockdown on 24 March.

"Lack of childcare 'forces key workers to stay home'As many childcare providers close their doors, key workers with young children tell the BBC they are ""stuck"".Family & Education","Key workers say they are being forced to take time off work because they do not have access to childcare. Schools, nurseries and childminders were told to close their doors last week to all except vulnerable children and the children of key workers, such as NHS staff and delivery drivers. But many nurseries say staying open for such small numbers of children has not been financially viable. They also say staff need better protection from the coronavirus. The National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) estimates around half of nurseries have completely closed for the duration of the coronavirus crisis. But for key workers who need childcare, the closures have meant having to take time off to look after their children. Parents heed calls not to send children to school Teachers to estimate grades after exams cancelled NHS consultant Vesna Pavasovic told the BBC that she would have to take time off work to look after her daughter, because their local nursery is now closed. ""We are putting our lives at risk for the entire nation and this is without any doubt our duty. ""Equally, it's the duty of the UK government to secure, without any delay, the funding for the designated schools and nurseries supporting key workers."" Catherine says it's not easy to switch childcare providers Catherine Phelvin and her husband, both NHS clinical workers, said the nursery of their one-year-old child closed at short notice last week. ""For various reasons and this really left us quite stuck,"" said Catherine. ""If we don't have adequate childcare provision for our youngest pre-school children, it's difficult for two key worker parents or indeed single parents to continue working - even their current hours, let alone, doing extra hours. ""As well as the emotional side of this, obviously it's not that easy just to switch childcare providers. ""And there's also potentially a financial cost to us as individuals, for having to find new childcare out short notice."" Eleanor Deslow also works for the NHS and her husband is a key worker in the automotive industry. ""Last Wednesday just gone, we were told that our nursery is closing - this has left us in a situation where we currently do not have any childcare."" The couple used to rely on older relatives, but government advice states children should not be left with anyone who should be following social distancing advice - for example the over-70s or those with certain health conditions. Eleanor is worried her husband could lose his job Eleanor says her husband has now been given the option to take furlough. ""It would mean he'd be on 80% wages. But if he takes that he may not have a job to return to in three months. ""So after being promised our son would be looked after at nursery, there is no guarantee of safety being promised that the outcome will be looked after at a nursery by the government because we are key workers. ""We are now in a position, that in three months time, my husband may not have a job."" The Bright Horizons Nursery has closed ""the majority"" of its 300 childcare centres. In a statement it said it had established a number of its nurseries as ""hubs to help key worker families"" and had waived fees. NDNA chief executive Purnima Tanuku said a number of nurseries across the UK were opening their doors to children of key workers and vulnerable children ""at this challenging time"". ""However, this is causing them many difficulties which have been exacerbated by unclear guidance regarding furloughing workers."" Ms Tanuku also said staff needed greater protection from the virus: ""Nursery practitioners are putting their lives on the line when they turn up to work, as it's near impossible to distance themselves from young children. ""We would like some protective equipment to be made available and acknowledgement of their dedication and commitment to these children at this difficult time."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said it had asked nurseries and other childcare providers to close ""except for the children of critical workers and vulnerable children"". ""The government has put a range of measures in place to support providers including continuing to fund free entitlements even if children are not attending, a business rate holiday for private providers, and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to support workers."" If critical workers do not have access to their usual childcare place, she added, they should contact their local authority to arrange an alternative. The government is also looking to pass emergency legislation to ""require educational institutions or childcare providers to stay open"". A spokeswoman for the Welsh government added: ""We are working with local authorities to identify sufficient childcare for 0-4 year olds in settings across Wales for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers."" But the Professional Association of Childcare ad Early Years raised concerns that many childminders would not qualify for the government help drawn up in response to the coronavirus epidemic. Chief executive Liz Bayram said: ""We remain especially worried about the sustainability of the 40,000 registered childminders in England and Wales. ""Most do not qualify for the current government support available to business. They are self-employed sole traders - only 3% deliver early education places so will not benefit from continuation in that funding."" Most were on low incomes and many were single parents who could only look to the benefit system for support, she added.

Producers said the episodes - from early-May - will feature fewer interacting characters ""sharing more of their private thoughts with the listener"", reflecting social distancing across the UK. Actors will record the forthcoming episodes from their homes, rather than busy studios, to protect the numerous cast and crew. A painter from Leeds who is best known for his colourful murals of Leeds United on telecom boxes has changed tack - to say thank you to the NHS.  Andy McVeigh, who has dubbed himself the 'Burley Banksy', has spent many monthspainting street furniture with drawings of his beloved Leeds United.

The incident then attracted a huge amount support from volunteers willing to help out. David has since been contacted by a charity who are now doing his shopping.

Easter egg crackdown over essential status 'wrong'Officials trying to stop convenience stores selling Easter eggs are told they have misread the rules.,"Convenience stores selling Easter eggs are facing interference from âheavy-handedâ officials trying to restrict the range of goods they can sell under coronavirus curbs, a trade body says. Some shops have been told by police and local councils that the chocolate eggs are considered non-essential goods. The Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) blamed âoverzealous enforcement and a misreading of the rulesâ. It has told shopkeepers to carry on selling a full range of goods. âThe government have defined which stores can remain open, and that includes convenience stores, including newsagents and off-licences,â said ACS chief executive James Lowman. âThere is no government definition of which products can be sold within those stores. âIn the cases where officers have challenged retailers and shoppers in this way, itâs brought confusion, distracted retailers in the busiest weeks of their lives and increased the interactions between people at a time when the government is trying to minimise them.â The attempt to restrict the kinds of goods sold in convenience stores drew a scathing reaction from retail analyst Richard Hyman. ""Quite frankly, it sounds bonkers,"" he said. ""This is a time when being excessively pedantic seems rather absurd. ""It's certainly right that if restrictions are going to be applied, they should be applied to types of outlet, not types of product."" He said the current rules, which put no restrictions on the items essential retailers can sell, were common sense and pointed out that supermarkets also had Easter eggs for sale.

Alan Merrill, who was born Allan Preston Sachs in New York, had a long and varied career as a musician. He signed his first record deal as lead singer of the band The Lead, who had a big hit in Japan with Aoi Bara (Blue Rose). After releasing two successful solo albums and hosting TV shows and acting in soap operas, he left Japan for the UK in 1974 to form The Arrows, who put a glam rock sheen on classic pop melodies. The group scored hits with A Touch Too Much and My Last Night With You, and I Love Rock 'N' Roll was written by Merrill and guitarist Jake Hooker as ""a knee-jerk response to the Rolling Stones' It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)"" in 1975. Originally issued on the B-side of The Arrows' single Broken Down Heart, it became a hit after DJs started playing the flip side instead. Its success led to the band getting a weekly ITV series, with musical guests including Marc Bolan, Slade and The Bay City Rollers - and that was where US singer Joan Jett first heard, and fell in love with, I Love Rock 'N' Roll.

"1968, the year that haunts hundreds of womenThe godfather of fake newsI met my boyfriend 12 years after giving birth to his childDetroit's abandoned jewelSearching for the missing girl"," By Ly Truong The man had come in to buy soy sauce. Tran Thi Ngai was working as a midwife and nurse, but that morning she was looking after her parents’ shop in southern Vietnam while they were out. He had grenades hanging from his armour, guns on his belt. It was the summer of 1967, and the Vietnam War - pitting South Vietnamese forces, the US and its allies, against the North Vietnamese Communists - was escalating. As he approached the counter, he held out the money. As Tran reached to take it, he grabbed her arm, then her hair, and dragged her into the back room of the shop. There he raped her. “It felt as if my life was over,” Tran says. All she could do was channel her energies into working harder than ever. When she noticed her stomach swelling she assumed she was just putting on weight. Then one day she felt a kick and realised she was pregnant. Her parents were horrified that she was expecting a baby out of wedlock - a major taboo. The country’s social mores were heavily influenced by Confucianism, and women were expected to remain virgins until they were married. “My parents called me ‘chửa hoang' (pregnant out of wedlock) - they beat me up badly. “I didn’t want to carry on living. I felt completely dead inside.” She tried to kill herself several times but survived - “it felt as if the foetus was fighting for me”. Her parents only stopped beating her once she gave birth - in February 1968. She was overwhelmed by how beautiful her baby girl was, but was soon overtaken by anxiety. “I was worried about my child growing up, worried about money, worried about how I could get back to work to earn a living.” She named the baby Oanh. But, hard as it is to comprehend, she wanted to recognise the baby’s father in some way. The middle name would be Kim. That was the soldier’s surname. Her rapist was neither Vietnamese nor American. He was South Korean. Four years earlier his nation had joined the US in fighting the Communist Vietcong in South Vietnam. Not long after giving birth, Tran woke one night to find that Kim had appeared again, looking for her. “He didn’t say a word, stood there for one or two minutes, then left,” she says. South Korean soldiers (""ROK Tigers"") in Qui Nhon, Vietnam South Korean soldiers (""ROK Tigers"") in Qui Nhon, Vietnam A few days later, another South Korean soldier arrived. He had been sent by Kim to take Tran and the baby to his base - that of the 28th regiment of the South Korean White Horse Division - in a remote mountainous area south of her home town. Ashamed and isolated, she felt she had no other choice. She got into the car and spent the next two years with her rapist. She was terrified the entire time, fearing for her life and that of the child. “It was coercion, rape, no love was there,” she says. Tran had another baby girl with Kim, before being abandoned when he moved to another base. Tran Thi Ngai today She found her way back to her parents in Phu Hiep, trying to work as many hours as possible to feed her children, until Kim once again sent a comrade to her. But this time the soldier - whose name she recalls was Park - was there, at least ostensibly, to help with the children. “He carried them in his arms, fed them, cared for them while I was out working.” And then one day, Park, too, assaulted her. Tran conceived another baby - a boy this time. Her family’s social standing was now irrevocably damaged. “It got to a point when living in the village became too difficult. Villagers shunned me, accused me of having a Korean husband, [luring the Koreans] here to kill the Vietnamese,” she says. She and her parents fled to another part of the province, but her reputation followed her. “If I introduced myself as ‘Ngai’, people would say ‘Oh yes, Ms Ngai. Beautiful, but she doesn’t have a husband.’” They would ask her why she hadn’t aborted her children. She says that as a midwife she couldn’t entertain the idea. “My job was to help other women give birth - I took care of their babies, I carried them, I embraced them, washed them, cut their cords. How could I even think of destroying my own baby?” says Tran, her voice breaking. In the same month Tran was giving birth to her first child, 11-year-old Nguyen Thi Thanh’s life was also changing forever. On the morning of 25 February 1968 Nguyen heard screaming coming from the far side of her village of Ha My - not far from the now-popular tourist town of Hoi An - and saw smoke filling the sky. She ran down the lane to see what was happening. South Korean soldiers were pointing their guns at her. She ran back to the house to tell her mother, Le Thi Tho, that the village was surrounded. “As I finished my sentence they poured into our house.” Later reports were to suggest the soldiers were members of the Blue Dragon Division, a notorious South Korean marine corps. They ordered her entire family, along with another woman and her children, and a friend of her younger brother, into the underground shelter in their front yard. They threw grenades in after them, killing Nguyen’s aunt and her infant cousin instantly. She says her mother tried to shield her and her brother. “‘We are doomed, my baby,’ my mother cried out. “My whole body was burning and then felt numb... I could see other people’s blood all over me,” Nguyen says. Nguyen’s eight-year-old brother lost a leg and eventually died of his injuries in hospital. Only Nguyen and one of her cousins, both badly injured, survived, crawling to a neighbour’s for help. She says that the soldiers then burned her house down. “I could hear the popping and crackling sounds from burning bamboo. I smelt smoke, fire.” More than 135 people in Ha My were killed that day, with just a dozen of the villagers surviving, she says. Although she says South Korean soldiers had regularly visited Ha My before, looking for Vietcong, she has no idea why 25 February 1968 was different. “We don’t know why they were so aggressive that day. They even killed three and four-month-old babies.” Nguyen Thi Thanh, pictured at 16, five years after the massacre Nguyen Thi Thanh, pictured at 16, five years after the massacre What is known is that this period marked a turning point in the Vietnam War. In late January of that year the North Vietnamese and Vietcong launched the infamousTet Offensive- a bloody military campaign against the South Vietnamese, the US and their allies. The retaliations were vicious, the most notorious being theMy Lai massacre- the gang rape and mass murder of Vietnamese civilians by US troops in March 1968. Nguyen Thi Thanh today Nguyen did not witness the immediate aftermath of the killings in Ha My - she was taken to hospital in Da Nang. But her older brother told her he watched as the soldiers returned the next day with tractors to flatten the village, destroying the bodies. Korean soldiers bulldoze a Vietnamese village, north of Bong Sen Korean soldiers bulldoze a Vietnamese village, north of Bong Sen While there has not been an apology for the atrocities perpetrated by the US during the 20-year Vietnam war, there has been an acknowledgement in the form ofreparationsand a damningwar crimes tribunal. But South Korea’s government, which now has close economic ties with Vietnam, appears unwilling to engage in a review of its role in the war. Seoul sent approximately 320,000 troops in a move analysts say was rooted in a fear of a “domino effect” spread of Communism. South Korea’s ministry of defence sent a letter to Nguyen and 102 other survivors last September saying it has no record of any civilian killings carried out by its military in Vietnam and there needs to be a joint investigation by both governments in tandem to check the facts, but that this is currently unachievable. A group of South Korean soldiers with a blindfolded Vietcong suspect  One woman who has made it her life’s mission to discover the truth is South Korean researcher Ku Su-jeong. While doing a PhD in Vietnamese history in the 1990s, she was given a document by an official in Vietnam’s foreign ministry, describing atrocities carried out by the South Koreans. She managed to finally secure an unauthorised copy from a Vietnamese government official for a fee, and has spent the past 20 years visiting Vietnamese villages and talking to survivors. She believes about 9,000 South Vietnamese civilians were killed in about 80 massacres carried out by the South Koreans, although there is no way of independently verifying her research. Ku believes there are still other deaths unaccounted for and often hears from people who want her to investigate alleged extra-judicial killings. “I still receive calls from people who ask me to come to their village,” she says. Her lifetime of research has come at a personal cost. Two months after her findings were published in a South Korean newspaper article in April 1999, about 2,000 veterans in their 50s, all wearing army uniform, gathered in front of the paper’s headquarters in Seoul. The men trashed the building and some also vandalised Ku’s home, she says. She and her mother had to move to a high security apartment. The South Korea Veterans’ Association also attempted to sue her for defamation and fraud, although the case was dropped. It is not possible to prove who was responsible for the massacre that killed Nguyen’s family in Ha My. But one South Korean veteran, Ryu Jin-sung, says his division was responsible for a similar massacre just two weeks before the Ha My killings. Ryu’s company was on patrol when a bullet was fired at them from the direction of Phong Nhi and Phong Nhat, two villages a few miles from Ha My. Attacks began as retaliation - the company dividing into three units to attack the villages from three different directions. Ryu Jin-sung Ryu Jin-sung Ryu’s unit was the first to move out, after his comrade shot dead an unarmed elderly man. That evening he heard his comrades boasting about killing young children and women, and the next day he saw bodies of civilians laid out on the side of the road. “There was a large crowd. When we got there, they yelled and screamed at us. It felt as if they were about to kill me, their eyes fixed on me. “I used the barrel of 	my rifle to make my way through. I saw corpses, I saw bereaved families - their anger. Even today it’s still very vivid.” Ryu says that those who deny a massacre took place in Phong Nhi and Phong Nhat are either misinformed or unwilling to admit the truth. The BBC arranged a meeting between Ryu and Nguyen, now 63, in a restaurant in Seoul. Both say, like many Vietnamese traumatised by the war, that they are haunted by ghosts. Ryu by that of the old man he saw being shot in Phong Nhi and Phong Nhat; Nguyen by her younger brother. Nguyen and Ryu meet After swapping stories of the war, Ryu finally reads out a simple phrase he has prepared in advance in Vietnamese. “I am sorry,” he says. Nguyen simply nods in acknowledgement. He serves her some food, she smiles, and they continue with the meal. As she leaves the restaurant, Nguyen says she feels a burden has been lifted, but is still holding out hope for an official apology from Seoul. Asked for comment, the South Korean government told the BBC in a statement that since establishing formal diplomatic relations in 1992, the two countries “have made together continuous efforts to develop their bilateral relations in a future-oriented manner on the basis of the shared view that they should put their unfortunate past behind them and move forward to the future”. South Korea is now one of Vietnam’s largest investors, with economic giants like Samsung and LG Electronics pouring billions of dollars into building factories there. South Korean journalist Koh Kyoung-tae, who first published researcher Ku Su-jeong’s controversial findings, says the idea that South Korean soldiers may have carried out atrocities doesn’t fit with the nation’s sense of itself as a victim. Koh Kyoung-tae “We Koreans say that we have 5,000 years of history and we’ve always been the victim. We’ve been colonised by Japan, Mongolia, China… and we endured it. It’s kind of like we’re proud of our victim mindset.” South Korea also spent decades lobbying Japan for a similar apology over the hundreds of thousands of South Korean women forced to work as World War Two sex slaves. Nguyen, who is deaf in one ear and seriously scarred all over her body as a result of her injuries, blames her own country for ignoring the issue. The Vietnamese government turned down two BBC requests to film for an accompanying documentary. “Vietnam is afraid of anything that affects the relationship between the two countries so they don’t want to clarify it,” she says. Back in Phu Hiep, Tran Thi Ngai, now 79, is also still wrestling with the fallout of the war. She says her children have faced a lifetime of abuse and discrimination, mocked for being “lai dai han” (the Vietnamese term for the children of Vietnamese and Korean parents). Her father was tortured and beaten to death under house arrest in 1977 as punishment for allowing his daughter to have relations with a South Korean. Tran herself was put in detention or prison three times between 1975 and 1978. While it has not been possible to verify her specific case, the aftermath of the Vietnam War was an intense period of retribution, the country still riven with division. Vietnamese pressure group Justice for Lai Dai Han is simply pushing for an apology to the victims of rape by South Korean soldiers and those conceived as a result. There are estimated to be about 800 of the victims’ children still alive. One prominent campaigner for the group is Tran Thi Ngai’s son, Tran Van Ty, who was beaten up regularly on his way to school for having a South Korean father. Former UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, the international ambassador for the group, says there is no reason why an apology should adversely affect relations “if handled properly. “Vietnam and South Korea have agreed, ‘Let’s go forward, let’s not look back,’ which I understand, but you’ve got to make exceptions to that sometimes. “In some cases, in order to look forward you’ve got to settle things in the past.” The group is pushing for an inquiry by the UN Human Rights Council. Survivors of the massacres allegedly carried out by the South Korean military also filed a legal case against the South Korean government this month. If the judge finds grounds to pursue it, the first hearing could be heard as early as this summer - though it is expected to take several years to reach a conclusion. “An apology might not be worth much, but it means a lot to us,” says Nguyen Thi Thanh. A bronze sculpture by British artist Rebecca Hawkins is meanwhile touring the UK, inspired by the story of Tran Thi Ngai and her son. “Mother and Child” shows two figures trapped by a strangler fig - a plant native to Vietnam which smothers the trees it wraps around. “We need the South Koreans to acknowledge what happened,” Tran says. “They sent troops to Vietnam - it wasn’t us who went to their country.”  Left: Tran Thi Ngai with her son Tran Van Ty and the artist Rebecca Hawkins / Right: The sculpture “Mother and Child”  Left: Tran Thi Ngai with her son Tran Van Ty and the artist Rebecca Hawkins / Right: The sculpture “Mother and Child” Left: Tran Thi Ngai with her son Tran Van Ty and the artist Rebecca Hawkins / Right: The sculpture “Mother and Child”  This story is part of theCrossing Dividesseason, bringing people together in a fragmented world Author: Ly Truong Illustration: Jilla Dastmalchi Researcher: Hyung Eun Kim Images: Derrick Evans, Getty Images, Alamy Online Producer: James Percy Editor: Sarah Buckley  Published: 27 March 2020 "
The godfather of fake newsI met my boyfriend 12 years after giving birth to his childDetroit's abandoned jewelSearching for the missing girl," By Anisa Subedar Christopher Blair takes a sip of his coffee. Then he carefully focuses on one of the three screens in front of him. He’s in his home office, 45 minutes outside Portland, Maine, on the US East Coast. Stroking his thick beard, he looks at his bookmarks bar. He takes another sip before his coffee goes cold, inhales long and hard, then logs into the back end of one of his many websites. He begins by choosing a subject. Which “lucky” politician will be on the receiving end of his attention today? Bill Clinton? Hillary Clinton? One of the Obamas? Or maybe the subject of his story won’t be a person, but a policy. Gun control? Police brutality? Feminism? Anything that will push buttons. Christopher Blair Next, the details. Perhaps he’ll make up a controversial incident, a crime, a new law or a constitutional amendment. “Changing” the US constitution is particularly fun - he’s already written more than 30 fake amendments. (There are only 27 genuine ones.) Blair sits back in his chair and focuses intently on the screen. He leans forward, places his hands on the keyboard and starts the same way he does every time. Caps lock. BREAKING. Colon... BREAKING: Clinton Foundation Ship Seized at Port of Baltimore Carrying Drugs, Guns and Sex Slaves The words flow from the thoughts in his head. Unconnected to reality, he needs no research, and no notes. His fingers rhythmically tap the keys. Letters form into words, words into sentences and sentences into a blog of about 200 words. It doesn’t take long to write. Publish. Blair sits back in his chair and watches the likes and shares roll in. More than 3,000 miles (5,000km) away in a small town an hour east of the Belgian capital, Brussels, there’s another office in another family home. Outside, children play in the garden on a warm summer’s afternoon. Maarten Schenk navigates the steep set of stairs to his basement office. There’s an L-shaped desk in one corner - in another, a cooler is filled with bottles of peach-flavoured iced tea. His desk resembles Blair’s. On it, sit three computer monitors, with the machine hard drives tucked away neatly underneath. On one of the screens, he suddenly notices a lot of activity. The US is waking up, and spiking numbers on one page catch Schenk’s attention. He watches as one particular story is gathering momentum and is quickly being shared on Facebook and other social networks. Maarten Schenk Schenk logs into his own website and starts to type. His job is to tell the world that what he’s seeing online - the story that’s currently going viral about a Clinton Foundation ship, allegedly carrying drugs, guns and sex slaves - is a complete fabrication. It’s fake news. During the 2016 US presidential election, journalists began noticing a rash of viral made-up stories on Facebook. Bizarrely, many of the pages appeared to be posted by people from the Balkans and, afterBuzzFeed reportedon an unusual cluster of pages, reporters flocked to a small town called Veles in Macedonia. “The Americans loved our stories and we make money from them,” one fakertold the BBC. “Who cares if they are true or false?” The stories were, in the main, pitched to Donald Trump supporters. They included rumours about Hillary Clinton’s health problems and illegal dealings, stories about luminaries like Pope Francis lining up behind the Republican candidate, and other false news sure to either please or rile Trump’s supporters. It’s now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences In December 2016, Hillary Clinton gave a speech in which she slammed “the epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda” that had flooded social media over the past year. “It's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences,” she said. It wasn’t immediately clear if she was referring to the election. At the time, some journalists interpreted her remarks as a reference to “pizzagate”, a conspiracy theory that grew to tremendous proportions online, and which promptedone man to storm into a Washington DC restaurant and fire an assault rifle. But regardless of Clinton’s meaning, the term was taken up by her victorious opponent and used in a completely different way a few weeks later. You are fake news At a fractious press conference President-elect Trump refused to take a question from CNN reporter Jim Acosta. “I’m not going to give you a question,” Trump said. “You are fake news.” Since then, “fake news” has been atopic of mainstream obsession and debate, although what is meant by the term varies hugely. Some insist on the original definition - fake stories of the type pumped out by those Macedonian teenagers. Others lump in politically motivated conspiracy theories - perhaps what Hillary Clinton was getting at. But people have also used “fake news” to describe honest mistakes, opinion, spin, propaganda or - like President Trump - news outlets or reporting that they simply don’t like. Not only that, but often stuck under the banner of “fake news” is satire or parody, which on the surface appears harmless, but could still fool people - with potentially negative consequences. Christopher Blair grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts, a city on the northern outskirts of Boston. His stepfather was a committed Democrat who once ran for the Massachusetts state senate. Christopher Blair (l) Blair spent more than two decades as a construction worker, a trade that took a toll on his body. So in the late 2000s, when the Great Recession hit and his industry slumped, he started looking for another source of income in liberal political blogging. He found he loved to write and had a real flair for making words come alive. He began a blog, the first of many. There was a liberation in being able to say what he wanted - arguing in favour of a range of positions on the left-hand side of American politics. But although it was fun and a few people started reading, blogging didn’t pay. And so he tried another tactic. He began to write fabricated, made up tales that looked like real news headlines. Streams of consciousness flowed from his head to the keyboard. When he saw the results online, the hundreds and thousands of likes and shares his posts were getting, he felt validated. Far more people were interested in fake news than Blair’s opinions or true stories. Not everyone was convinced. “You’re wasting all this time,” his wife told him. “It will never amount to anything.” But once his fake news started to get clicks, he was able to use Google’s advertising platform to convert page views into money. In 2014, he quit his day job completely. “Once writing became lucrative enough to not destroy my body in construction any more,” he says with a laugh, “that’s when it became time to stay at home with the kids and do this.” Blair created online identities using pseudonyms and aliases like Busta Troll and Flagg Eagleton. He took on the personas of patriotic Americans outraged at President Obama, liberals, feminists, the Black Lives Matter movement and more. He delighted in people who took the lies for the truth and shared the stories as if they came from real news websites. The success of the fakes led Blair to create a Facebook page called America’s Last Line of Defense. It was dedicated to fake news stories aimed at staunch Republicans and supporters of President Donald Trump. The headlines were sensational and sometimes even offensive. They had one aim - to provoke an emotional response that would get people to share them. • BREAKING: Torture Chamber in Bill Clinton’s Basement Described As A ‘Kill Room’ • BREAKING: New Orleans Saints Stranded on Runway in London After Pilot Takes A Knee and Walks Off • BREAKING: Obama, Soros and the Dems Ordered The Shutdown to Stage A Coup Blair himself describes the headlines he writes as “racist and bigoted”.

But they went viral - and those shares turned into clicks, which turned into cash. Back in Belgium, computer programmer Maarten Schenk had created software that could detect which stories were trending on Facebook. He called it Trendolizer. He would then write about them on his blog. But he struggled to find an audience. He was up against some of the world’s biggest media organisations. By the time he noticed a post was trending and wrote about it, big news sites had already covered it. But like Blair, Schenk discovered a niche when it came to fake news. For all of the people who who liked and shared fictional stories believing them to be real, there were others who appreciated someone who could identify those that were fake. Just because it’s trending, doesn’t mean it’s true When he discovered false stories and blogged about them, his site traffic went up. Not by an astonishing amount - he wasn’t making as much money as Blair - but enough for him to concentrate on debunking fake news. His blogLead Storiesbecame focused on the fakes, with the tagline: “Just because it’s trending, doesn’t mean it’s true”. Schenk also noticed patterns and repeated online behaviour. For example, on a weekly basis he saw fake stories about the death of Hillary Clinton. Every Saturday, he would read that the Democratic nominee had died - in a ballooning accident, boat crash or from a heart attack. Or hit on the head with a monster truck tyre. As he debunked the fake stories, Schenk began to collect information about fake news websites and the people behind them. His database allowed him to track the fakers across the internet, even as their websites and Facebook pages were taken down. He noticed broad themes. In addition to Hillary Clinton, voter fraud was a popular subject for fake stories, as were immigration and Islam. And given the Wild West nature of the fake news world, he increasingly found that more and more sites - including some of those from Macedonia - were stealing content, copy and pasting from other fake news sites. In fact, many were stealing content from just one source. That source was Christopher Blair. By early 2017, there was a lot of talk about the rise of Facebook-enabled fake viral news stories. But that didn’t mean that social media companies were doing anything about it. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg had famously scoffed at the suggestion that the fakes could sway voters. “Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook... influenced the election in any way - I think is a pretty crazy idea,”  he said just after the 2016 presidential election. But the frenetic political climate in America meant fake news writers like Blair were more successful than ever before. He hired other writers to churn out the fakes. And the money kept flowing in. “It was every day, all day,” he says. “We were getting results with what we were doing.” Christopher Blair and his dog But the good times couldn’t last forever. The political winds began to turn against him. Blair, a committed liberal Democrat, was being lumped in with a whole host of people accused of peddling lies to inflate support for President Trump. In Belgium, Maarten Schenk was increasingly drawn into the game of cat and mouse. Fake news writers were finding better, more creative and devious ways to capture an unwitting audience. But at the same time, Schenk was developing his systems, getting better at identifying the fake news writers and, crucially, getting his debunks in front of a wider audience. “I want to be just a Google search away,” when people think they’re looking at a false story, he says. Schenk estimates there’s about 200 dedicated fact-checking organisations worldwide - not nearly enough, he says. “As long as there is potential for profit, people will keep trying,” he says. “People will find new filters and then they [the fake news writers] will find ways to get around the filters.” In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey tore through Texas, killing dozens and causing billions of dollars of damage to Houston and the surrounding areas. Across the country in Maine, Blair sensed an opportunity to use his creative writing skills. He made up a story about a fictional imam in a fictional mosque in Texas. The imam, he wrote, refused to shelter non-Muslims during the storm. He found out, he got really upset... I immediately removed it and sent him a million apologies It would clearly whip up Blair’s fan base. And it was all untrue. But there was one problem. The photo that was used to accompany the story was of a real imam, the leader of a mosque in Canada. Ibrahim Hindy had never even visited Texas, but he was suddenlythe target of fake news. “He found out, he got really upset,” says Blair. “He was all over Twitter about how we were racists, xenophobes. The whole nine yards. I immediately removed it and sent him a million apologies.” It wasn’t the only time that Blair’s falsehoods had snared real people. Another of his websites carried a story about a US soldier who was a deserter. But he used the name and picture of a real person who had nothing to do with the story. Schenk noticed it going viral. And when he checked it out, he realised that a real person had been unfairly inserted into a fake story. He messaged Blair and got him to remove the story. But the two men continued messaging online. And that’s where Blair revealed his secret, his real reason for writing fake news. Blair liked it that Schenk had called him out. There was something that made him stand out from other fact checkers, simply by the fact that he had communicated with him. Other fact-checking websites, he says, write debunking blog posts, but never talk to him before they do. Schenk stood up to Blair, pointed out the mistake and got the fake story removed from the internet. And so Blair invited Schenk into a secret Facebook group with fans of his work. It was there that Schenk learnt the truth about Blair, and got an insight into what drove one fake news writer. “He basically explained his whole schtick,” says Schenk. “How they [fake news writers] work.” There were heavy hints in the disclaimers that Blair slapped all over his websites and Facebook pages. The Last Line of Defense has one that reads:  “We are here to provide you with information you can use to continue being as informed as a conservative feels comfortable with. Please don't use our page in conjunction with Google or the news, it will only serve to confuse you further.” Satire - not news, not opinion, and not propaganda - is how Blair describes his work. His aim is to trick conservative Americans into sharing false news, in the hope of showing what he calls their “stupidity”. “We’ve gone out of our way to market it as satire, to make sure that everybody knows that this isn’t real,” he says, pointing out that some of his pages have more prominent disclaimers than the world-famous satire site The Onion. Once his stories go viral, the Facebook comments burst forth. And that’s when Christopher Blair the fake news writer becomes Christopher Blair the crusading left-wing troll. “The mission with the trolling first and foremost is we pull them into the comments [section underneath each fake article],” he says. It's then that he starts on the offensive. The faker becomes the exposer, weeding out and reporting the most extreme users among his fans. “I can show you hundreds of profiles we’ve had taken down,” he says. He claims that he’s exposed Ku Klux Klan members and hardcore racists. “We’ve had people fired from their jobs,” he says. “We’ve exposed them to their families. Say what you want about me being a monster. I’m pretty proud.” Blair and his small army of writers and allies also have other ways of fighting their ideological opponents.  And one of his politically motivated stunts has become legendary in the internet world. “It was a mission that went on for months,” he says. The goal was to infiltrate conservative Facebook pages and take them over, by winning over the trust of their administrators to the point where they were given admin privileges themselves, which they then used to throw out the original owners. “There was an army of people involved,” he says, estimating that his group took control of 26 conservative Facebook pages. “The pictures [originally on the pages] were of Obama being lynched and depicting him as a Muslim. All those stupid hate posts that are on a typical conservative page. We just tore them up, threw them away. “We took their pages over and replaced everything with pictures of goats,” he says. “I called the army of trolls and they showed up. For days it was goats on top of goats.” Schenk knows the story well. “They called themselves the ‘goatherd’,” he says. The episode was more evidence of Blair’s real motivation - politically motivated pranksterism. As public awareness about fake viral stories grew, so did pressure on social media companies to do something about it. Mark Zuckerberg said his personal challenge for 2018 was to “fix” the social site, to combat hate and abuse, but also fake news. In April, 2018, he was called in front of Congress to answer questions about a host of issues, the fakers on his platform being one of them. As a result, in July, Facebookannounced algorithm changesdesigned to boost content from “friends, family and groups”. The company, realising it had an image problem, launched an ad campaign to reassure users that they would be protected from “spam, clickbait, fake news and data misuse”. Some Facebook pages were deleted, while other publishers found that their posts were not travelling as far or as fast as they once had done. I’m not some monster. I’m a liberal... the goal isn’t money For Blair, the money began to dry up. Largely because of Facebook’s changes, he says he now makes a fraction of what he did at the height of the fake news boom. But he insists money was never the motivator, and instead he claims to be a “leader of the resistance” against President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. “I’m not some monster. I’m a liberal,” he says. “The goal isn’t money.” “There hasn’t been any money in six months. [But] go look at my page, I’m still active, I’m still doing it. I’m still writing. “I still believe and I always will.” Blair and Schenk had swapped messages online, but they’d never actually spoken until recently, when I called them both at the same time andrecorded the conversation for BBC Trending. They hadn't needed much convincing, and were keen to talk to each other. But the conversation started awkwardly. Two men who were usually not short of words were suddenly reticent, unsure of what to say. Schenk began by saying that on one level, he admired Blair. “He’s very good at what he does,” he says. “His stories have always been quite easy to debunk because they mostly say, right at the end, it’s all fake - and also [it says the same] in the header of his sites.” But Schenk will still write about them if they go viral - the fact that something is presented as satire doesn’t stop him from debunking it. “I see my job as a fact checker. My job is not to give an opinion about it,” he says. What I do is an art form “Whether you agree with it or not, what I do is an art form,” Blair says. “The stuff that I write a lot of the time - I read it and I laugh at myself. It’s ridiculous.” Schenk points out that Blair’s posts often lead him to other fake news writers, ones who don’t use disclaimers and who are much more straightforwardly spreading lies. The Macedonian teenagers aren’t the only ones copying and pasting from Blair - other fake news writers around the world do the same. Because of this, Schenk says, “he’s a great way of finding actual fake news sites.” I’m not trying to shut you down And so it turns out that a conversation that could have been angry or combative is actually quite friendly. Even when Blair adamantly states he won’t stop writing fake stories. “I don’t know that [Maarten] wants to close me down. Maybe he does.” Then he speaks directly to his opposite number: “You’re welcome to try,” he chuckles. “I can most definitely assure you that I’m not trying to shut you down,” Schenk replies. As the conversation winds down, I ask Blair - this godfather of fake news - and the man who tracked him down, if they have any parting words. “Don’t ever stop doing what you’re doing,” Blair says. And, with a hint of respect in his voice, Schenk replies: “Likewise.” Built with Shorthand"
I met my boyfriend 12 years after giving birth to his childDetroit's abandoned jewelSearching for the missing girl,"When Jessica Share bought sperm from a sperm bank in order to start a family, she never imagined that more than a decade later she would meet the donor - and would feel a strong attraction to him. In 2005, when my eldest daughter was born, I became the first lesbian parent I had ever met. This was the American Midwest, and the only lesbians I'd heard about with children had usually given birth to them in a previous, heterosexual relationship. My girlfriend and I, however, had had to start from scratch. Ever since we'd met we had dreamed about having kids together. We decided on four and together we chose their names. The next step was more difficult. My girlfriend suggested her brother-in-law could help. He was receptive, but I took a gay and lesbian legal rights course offered by the college of law at my university, and quickly gave up on the idea of a known donor. Courts had been known to give them custody rights, calling their gift of sperm an act of parenting. When birth moms died, children were removed from their homes to be placed with men they barely knew. Luckily, we discovered a sperm bank that shipped right to our home, where the anonymous donors signed paperwork that legally barred them from ever seeking custody of the children they helped create. Because I was writing a doctoral dissertation at home, I would carry the first baby. We matched the donor to my partner - who was by now my wife - choosing someone of average height  and weight who had studied literature, had wavy brown hair, and liked sports. The donor listed his profession as a writer, musician, and taxi driver. My wife and I romantically imagined he was refusing to get a desk job, but instead collecting the stories of those he'd pick up in his cab, readying to write the Great American Novel. Jessica Share spoke to Outlook on the BBC World Service You canlisten again here There was little additional information on the donor, but the rudimentary health history that donors complete assured us we knew a lot more than we would have ever gotten from a casual boyfriend. We never saw a picture. Getting pregnant at home was fascinating - a home science experiment that I took seriously. Sperm supplied to buyers rarely tops half a lip-balm cap of liquid and it comes nestled in a 3ft-tall liquid nitrogen tank with an overnight shipping return label. Gloves are required for extricating the tiny plastic vial, which first sits on the counter and then warms to body temperature in the hand. The local pharmacist can supply a tiny syringe to use to inseminate. Because things that have been frozen aren't as robust as their fresh counterparts, revived sperm live just a single day. If an egg is not waiting for them, they will die. Getting every last sperm as close to the egg as possible became a solemn monthly ritual. I would inseminate twice, just to cover the entire possible window an egg might be waiting. After all, it takes five full hours to even swim the length of a uterus. I learned this, along with every fact I could related to using donor semen to conceive. Seven months later I was pregnant with our first child and my wife and I were overjoyed. I told my grandparents that we were expecting. My grandmother gasped, ""Oh, it's due in June!"" and my grandfather asked curiously about artificial insemination. We gave hardly a thought to the donor that we assumed we would never meet. My wife was particularly hostile to the idea of ever letting our children know him - she felt that love made a family, and I agreed. But we paid homage to his literary genes by reading thousands of books to our gestating bookworm. When Alice was born, she was perfect. All thoughts that the particularity of the DNA wasn't important went out the window. We agreed that we should clone this incredible being we had created with our love. We ordered sperm from the same donor and repeated the whole process, my wife giving birth to our second daughter when Alice was 18 months old. Both girls shared plenty of traits. Knowing how my wife and I looked as children, it became a fun pastime to pick out the characteristics only the girls shared: they were both extraordinarily tall, not average height, as the donor claimed to be. Both had long, thin mouths, small noses, electric eyes that look like emeralds under water, and impeccable vocabularies. But when the girls were one and three years old, my wife declared she was ending our relationship. There had been no conflict in our family, so I was shocked and heartbroken. She said she did not want to talk about it and there was nothing I could do to repair our marriage. I continued parenting the sisters five days a week for a few years. But when Alice was 10, my ex-partner blocked Alice on her phone, cut off all contact with her, and refused to return her younger sister following a vacation. This remains the case today. On my ex-wife's side of the family, Alice's grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins haven't so much sent her a birthday greeting in two years. Alice spends her days dreaming of the sister she was raised with and who she is afraid she will never see again. Alice knows more deeply than most children that family is neither genetically created nor forged through parenting alone. Parenting did not make her mama stay. And although genetics was a small piece of what her family looked like for a decade, that also seemed like an unimportant part of who she was. However, Alice wondered where her ancestors came from. My mother had often told stories about the family's Cornish heritage to anyone who would listen. Wanting to know what her genetic heritage was, Alice requested a DNA testing kit from her grandmother for Christmas when she was 11 years old. The results came back about eight weeks later. I clicked on the DNA Relatives section of the site, not thinking anything would come of it. But the first thing I read was, ""Aaron Long: 50%. Father."" ""Bryce Gallo: 25%. Half-brother"" was right behind. Of course, I had known this might happen, but it hadn't seemed likely. Before writing a note on the site, I searched for Aaron online to see what I could learn. There are a lot of Aaron Longs in the world, so I set to work finding ""the one."" I searched a professional social network for clues. Squinting at each Aaron Long, I wondered if I would recognise the donor right away. One of the sperm vials listed the date of donation (1994), which helped narrow down birth and college graduation years. There was just one man with a master's degree in literature in the correct age range, with the name Aaron Long. In his photo, he was wearing an olive-green silk turban and blowing a trombone. His profile said he was employed as a ""communications specialist"" and placed him in Seattle. A writer and a musician. On another social media site, I discovered a Seattleite named Aaron Long with the correct workplace and with photos of each of his school portraits through the years. There was no doubt. My daughters make that stupid face. I quickly wrote a message to him on the DNA testing site. It read: Hi Aaron, I actually have two daughters who'd match you (my ex has my youngest daughter; she's not on the DNA testing site). If you're interested in trading family photos, etc., we're available. I used the ""curiosity hook,"" thinking he'd have to write back to see pictures of my youngest daughter. Aaron wrote back immediately, sharing details I already knew from my sleuthing. He asked if I had any questions for him, and I asked if he was the shortest person in his family. I already knew the answer. He was. We agreed to become friends on a social networking site and Aaron sent a 50-page long life history, which I devoured. He'd spent several years in a band in the town where we lived. How many times had we walked past him in the supermarket, I wondered? I also wrote to Bryce, who had just graduated college. He told me he found Madi, a 19-year-old half-sister, and had also been in touch with other parents. He said there were a total of six children from Aaron, and that mine were #7 and #8. Bryce told me he had been raised with a little sister, but perhaps Madi, an only child, would be interested in developing a relationship with Alice? Alice had to be cajoled into writing her life story for Aaron, and getting to know her DNA relatives is only mildly exciting for her. She is grieving the loss of her sister. I try to tell her she has a special job of guarding these people, getting to know them, and keeping them for her sister when she is able to meet them. However, she would rather have her sister. A few months later, Bryce and Madi made plans to visit Aaron in Seattle. Alice was interested to see whether the siblings and Aaron resembled her. I agreed to let her take part. Aaron hosted a party to which he invited multiple housemates, friends from elementary school, high school, and college. All of his ex-girlfriends, and their new partners and children, were invited. They would all camp on the roof and celebrate meeting his biological children. I quickly learned that Aaron does not have a single friend he wouldn't welcome back into his fold. We visited the local sculpture garden, played a ""nature or nurture"" game that illuminated some shocking similarities, and took a road trip to an arts festival. In spite of Bryce's initial protests, he and Madi vied for Alice's affection. During the vacation when they met, all three went out to grab dinner. Alice came back with ice cream from one and pizza from the other. Later, Bryce mailed her a star of David. Madi sent an amethyst. Both are symbols of the different things she has in common with each. I had been dating a man for a few years who is also named Aaron David, with a similar last name. On our vacation, donor Aaron flirtatiously suggested there had been a mix-up at the Bureau of Boyfriends. I smiled and demurred. I was already in a relationship and was conscious that donor Aaron was an important person to my kids, but not someone who should necessarily be part of my own life. I didn't want to spoil it for them. When my relationship with old Aaron ended, I found myself wondering if my children's person could also be my person, and if Seattle was a place for us to land while we figured it out. Aaron's kindness and continued connection with his exes convinced me that it would be safe to give it a chance. One night, we walked the neighbourhood and sat in a local cemetery, talking about DNA, what the kids were like, and what our dreams were. When heterosexual people meet and date and get married, they often look with devotion at one another and think it would be wonderful to have little people who look like both of them. I'd already spent a decade with those little people. I spent my first date with Aaron relaying their lives to him. I already knew him and knew he was just like these people I love more than anyone else in the world. He was already family in some ways. His smirk and his colouring are those of my youngest daughter. His empathy and socialism? My eldest. This video can not be played Jessica describes meeting the sperm donor who'd fathered her daughter It's hard to tell if DNA played a role in our relationship. I know that I am attracted to Aaron for all the reasons that seemed wonderful when shopping for him in a sperm donor catalogue years ago. He is thoughtful, persistent, and academically-minded. He is enchanted by words. He is empathetic, versed in stories about people and the strange things they sometimes do. He doesn't much care what's expected of him. He often plays his own music. To his own drum. Sometimes in a turban. How many people think a cab-driving musician and writer is the ideal genetic material? Alice and I moved into Aaron's co-op in summer 2017. It's such a large building that there was plenty of room for another of Aaron's bio-kids to move in. Madi, originally from the east coast, found Aaron's (and Seattle's) right-brained left-wing personality endearing and moved out this spring to live with all of us. We've even joined a Girl Scout troop with another of Aaron's bio-kids who is the age of my youngest daughter and lives about an hour away.

I quickly discovered that as a mom, I would gladly take any of our new half-siblings right inside, make them lunch, do their laundry, and take care of them forever. They are the siblings of my children, the genetic aunts and uncles of my grandchildren. I don't parent them, but I feel inexplicably drawn toward feeding them. Some are the spitting image of Alice. Others resemble my youngest daughter. They don't all look like Aaron, but they undeniably resemble one another. Aaron's ageing mom has also moved in, along with her cat, Bill. Down the hall, Alice and I got a kitten. By making a family in all these new ways through the years, I've learned more about what family means than anyone would want to. DNA has become far more important than it was when I first picked a donor from a page. Yet it hasn't replaced the truism that families are built on love, not genes. Being open to that love is what ultimately makes a family. Everyone can be welcomed and stay in the fold. There is room for many different kinds of relationships. Who knows how many more of Aaron's bio-kids there are - he's estimated there could be as many as 67. The building may eventually cease to accommodate all of them, but I've got the sandwiches, and the door's open. All stills provided by Jessica Share.

Detroit's abandoned jewelSearching for the missing girl," by Jonathan Marcus Rick Novasky has never forgotten the day back in the 1980s when he was working a shift in the ticket office at Detroit’s Michigan Central Station. “A gentleman walked up to the ticket window with tears rolling down his cheeks,” he says. “I asked him if he needed help. The man just pointed toward the subway where everybody boarded the trains and said, ‘that's where I last saw my oldest brother back in 1943. He turned around, waved to us and then got on his train.  We never saw him again. He was killed in the Pacific.’ “That was some 30 years ago,” says Novasky, a tremor in his voice, “and it still hits me even today.” Michigan Central was once one of the grandest railway stations in the United States - the gateway to a fabulously wealthy city, dominated by the auto industry. Thousands of workers passed through the building in search of new lives - immigrants from Europe and the Middle East along with black workers, part of the “great migration” northwards, from the prejudice and poverty of the agricultural South. But Detroit’s days of lavish prosperity are long gone. The station has been closed and abandoned for more than 30 years. Its tower, like the keep of a derelict fortress, is a poignant symbol of a once-great city’s decline. Now Michigan Central is being given a new life by the industry that created Detroit’s wealth. In 2018 the Ford Motor Company bought the building and began the huge task of refurbishing it as the centrepiece of a new campus, devoted to high-tech vehicles and the future of transportation. Looming over the Corktown neighbourhood, the station is going to be transformed, along with the local area. What does the history of Michigan Central tell us about the rise, fall, and perhaps rise again of Motor City? Detroit’s new railway station opened for business in December 1913 without much fanfare. It was forced into service early because the station it was set to replace was destroyed by a fire. Michigan Central was designed in the then-popular Beaux Arts style by architects who had previously worked together on New York’s Grand Central Station. The structure was dominated by a 15-storey tower. When built, it was the tallest railway station in the world. It looked out over 18 tracks, raised above street level on a broad viaduct. Only two of those tracks remain, carrying heavy freight trains operated by Canadian Pacific. Just a short distance away the tracks from Michigan Central enter a tunnel, diving under the Detroit River into Canada. This was the route taken by many of the famous trains that connected the city with New York - the Twilight Limited, the Mercury and the Wolverine - names redolent of the golden age of rail travel. The Empire State Express connected Detroit and Cleveland with Buffalo and New York. It was inaugurated on 7 December 1941 (the same day as the bombing of Pearl Harbor - unfortunately for the New York Central Railroad’s publicity department). During World War Two the station was a hive of activity with troops arriving and departing. Former Detroit cop Ray Downing remembers seeing his older brother and uncle off at Michigan Central and meeting them whenever they came home on leave. “The station was absolutely packed,” he says. “The building was just cavernous - it meant a new world to me every time I went there.” During the early 1960s Downing was based at a police precinct just around the corner from Michigan Central. It’s the mundane nature of the job he recalls - searching for lost children, dealing with drunks and so on. Despite Detroit’s subsequent reputation for crime and violence, he remembers it fondly. “Even in a neighbourhood with a railway station, it was reasonably peaceful and law-abiding,” he says. Michigan Central was the place where workers arrived to take up new jobs in the growing automobile industry. “It was the Ellis Island of Detroit,” says labour historian and lecturer Steve Babson. 1911: An immigrant to Detroit at Michigan Central 1911: An immigrant to Detroit at Michigan Central In 1908, Henry Ford’s Piquette Avenue factory began turning out the first of the famous Model-T cars - a stripped down, simplified automobile that ushered in the era of mass motoring. Before Ford, building a motor car had been a highly skilled job for craftsmen. But Ford brought in technologies for a mass production process. Huge stamping presses to take sheet metal and turn it into the key body components of a car, small disc grinders powerful enough to remove surplus metal, and even new types of paint. “The reason the Ford Model-T was black,” says Babson, “was because it was the only paint that would dry fast enough to keep pace with the production process.” Mass production needed workers, and lots of them. They came from all over the globe. Many of them arrived from Britain, via Canada. But as early as 1907 the Detroit Board of Commerce asked the immigrant reception centre at Ellis Island in New York harbour to direct skilled workers to the city - immigrants from Italy, Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Workers came from further afield too. The city came to have one of the largest Chaldean Catholic communities outside Iraq, with the first members arriving in the 1920s. In 1906 the workforce in Detroit stood at about 80,000. By 1911 it was 175,000 and growing. Over a 30-year period there was a fivefold increase in Detroit’s population - most of that by 1925. The first step many of them made in the city was on the platform at Michigan Central. World War One saw a significant rise in the arrival of black workers from the American South, as immigration routes from Europe were closed off. Agricultural difficulties after the war only encouraged more southerners - black and white - to leave the land and seek their future in Detroit. By now Detroit was one of the wealthiest cities in the US. But the good times were brief. The crash of 1929 and the depression of the 1930s hit the city hard. Recovery was slow and sporadic. Things were only gradually improving by the late 1930s. World War Two pumped a new shot of adrenalin into Detroit’s industrial veins. Most of the auto-makers were turned over to war production and Detroit became the veritable arsenal of democracy. After the war the motor industry thought it would simply return to the way things were. The US emerged from World War Two as the world’s dominant economic power. But as Babson puts it: “The motor industry’s decline was established by its dominance.” US manufacturers concentrated on upmarket vehicles, leaving entry-level models to others. Japanese imports - initially of low quality, but quickly improving - took a larger and larger share of the market. Efforts to counter them produced some disastrous vehicles like the Chevrolet Vega, which rotted from within and the Ford Pinto, which was prone to catch fire in accidents. Detroit was changing too. In July 1967, tensions caused by racism, unemployment and police brutality ignited into five days of full-scale rioting, after a raid on a drinking club in an African-American neighbourhood. Forty-three people died - most of whom were African-American - and more than 1,000 were injured. More than 400 buildings were damaged so badly they had to be demolished. “The heaviest casualty was the city itself,” according to its first black mayor, Coleman Young. “The riot,” he said, “put Detroit on the fast track to economic desolation.” 1967: A federal soldier stands guard during the Detroit riots 1967: A federal soldier stands guard during the Detroit riots The more affluent - usually white - residents had already been moving to the suburbs. The riots accelerated this process. An estimated 22,000 people left the city in 1966. Two years later, that figure hit 80,000. Many of the areas destroyed in the rioting were never rebuilt and the scars remain visible to this day. In 1988 the dwindling railway service ended. Michigan Central was closed and abandoned. But worse was to come. The auto industry remained essential for Detroit’s future but it was not faring well. In 2009 both General Motors and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy. And just four years later - in July 2013 - the city itself went the same way, the largest municipality ever to go bankrupt in the US.

Bardelli was born in Detroit. He has always lived here, and has spent some 30 years driving past the abandoned station building wishing something could be done about it. Now he is in charge of making it happen. Working from the original plans for the station, he explains that his first task is to dry the building out and assess the scale of any damage. Richard Bardelli Richard Bardelli Looking up at the tower, he points out darker spots in the stonework that indicate water infiltration. The building has a steel frame but many winters of freezing and thawing mean some of the limestone is coming away. “We will take some of that brick out,” he says cheerily, “check the steel behind it and see what needs to be done.” Inside the station is a lofty hall lit by high steel-framed windows, the glass long since smashed. The walls of cracked plaster are sprinkled with graffiti but there is no missing the almost ecclesiastical grandeur of the place. There is a stillness, a calm, a sense of purpose, despite all the debris and scaffolding. The ground floor is divided into three main areas - a waiting room (where you can still see the outlines of the heavy wooden seats on the floor), an arcade, and the main concourse. The ticket counter is just off the arcade and, from the concourse, gates lead to subways that took passengers up to the platforms above. Bardelli is fast becoming as much architectural historian as construction engineer. He points upwards to the ceiling which comprises thousands of small tiles. This technique is called Guastavino vaulting, he says - self-supporting arches made up of layers of terracotta tiles: “There are about 20,000 of them up there. We are going to take down or re-point every piece. Luckily it’s in pretty good shape.” The scale of the restoration work is fast becoming apparent. The old station had a range of public facilities split between the sexes, reflecting the social mores of the time. “On the women’s side there was a tea room and rest room at the eastern end of the building,” Bardelli says. “At the western end there was the men’s reading room, tea room and so on. There was a large restaurant and areas for shops.” The plan is that a good part of the restored building will again be public space. For the moment, though, the building is an empty shell, stripped by vandals of anything that could be removed. Michigan Central still has a place in many Detroiters’ hearts. As soon as plans were announced to renovate the station, local people began to return fixtures and artefacts which had found their way elsewhere. In one case an anonymous caller rang to say that he had left a large station clock in an abandoned location, and that Ford needed to send somebody over to recover it quickly. That clock was once mounted on the covered roof over the carriage entrance. A clock returned anonymously to Michigan Central A clock returned anonymously to Michigan Central This prompted the company to put out a call for any other objects or artefacts to be returned - no questions asked. In came a variety of items - door plates, elevator call buttons, office lamps, ornate staircase finials, even old fire extinguishers. Every item that has been returned has a story. Joe Mifsud - local businessman and entrepreneur - is co-owner of a new restaurant, The Cork and Gabel on Michigan Avenue. You can see the front of the station building from its doorway. For some years he has been buying lots in the area and on one he found a huge piece of masonry. “I guessed it was a drinking fountain,” he says. “I knew it had to have come from the station. It just got moved around on a pallet for years as we bought up the rest of the property. It just shuffled from one space to the next.” When he heard about Ford’s purchase of the building he rang them and they said: “Please, bring it over.” Mifsud is a local, a third-generation Corktown native. He remembers “skating” on the station's highly polished floor as a boy. Mifsud began developing businesses in the area some 13 years ago. He accepts that at the time things were pretty grim. When he purchased his restaurant building (it used to be an old doughnut factory), it was abandoned with no doors and windows. So what prompted him to take the risk?  “We're on a major artery, Michigan Avenue,” he says. “It's close to downtown Detroit. I just thought it had to come back. And we're so close to the heart of the city that it would come our way. And thank goodness it did.” Michigan Central illuminated for Winter Fest celebrations, 2018 Michigan Central illuminated for Winter Fest celebrations, 2018 Bill Ford, the executive chairman of Ford Motor Company and great-grandson of Henry Ford, remembers the Detroit of his youth: “Everything I did... was in the city - my barber, my doctor, my dentist, [where] I bought my clothes. The city was where everything happened.” Re-purposing the station is in one sense going back to his famous family’s roots. Corktown, not surprisingly, derives its name from the fact that it was settled by Irish immigrants from County Cork. That too is where the Ford family has its origins. Bill Ford Bill Ford But this is a move driven by judgement as much as sentiment. “The decay of the train station was a symbol for the decay of Detroit,” says Ford. “I would drive by this train station on a very frequent basis and it always really bothered me - there was so much that was positive starting to take place in the city. But this was always sitting there as a reminder, the past was always looming.” He was determined that if there was ever a chance to do something with the building he would step in. And the profound changes in the automobile industry provided just such an opportunity. Fewer young people are getting driving licences, patterns of car ownership are changing. Not far ahead the prospect of autonomous vehicles and electric propulsion looms large. “Our future was looking very different,” he says. “Ford needed to attract talent from all around the world.” He devised a plan to purchase not just Michigan Central, but other buildings in the Corktown area, and build what he calls “a mobility campus”. “We are going to create a neighbourhood where we can test out a lot of the new ideas.” The aim is to develop an attractive environment akin to the high-tech campuses of Silicon Valley in California. One of Detroit’s leading industry analysts, Michelle Krebs, agrees with Ford that the company’s future cannot simply be in building cars: “In the future the money will be made in the services around the car.” However, she says that this brings fresh challenges for Ford and its competitors: “Before, they all competed against each other. Now they're competing not just against each other but also against technology companies.” The new campus will employ 2,500 Ford workers along with a similar number from partner companies. Throughout Corktown there could be several thousand more jobs linked to the project in one way or another. Pamela Alexander, the director of community development for Ford’s philanthropic arm, the Motor Company Fund, is keen to stress what she says is the company’s long-standing commitment to the area. A graffiti artist at Ford's launch ceremony for the Michigan Central project A graffiti artist at Ford's launch ceremony for the Michigan Central project It is investing in training and affordable housing. A newsletter goes out to all local households. “Ford was listening to the community,” she says, “even before the announcement of the terminal project.” Ford mounted a Halloween party at the station last year (this is a city, she points out, where in many areas it is not safe for kids to go out and trick-or-treat). There was also a Winter Fest over nine evenings with refreshments and a light show on the station building. Ford is making all the right noises. But change inevitably means disruption and there are all sorts of concerns among the local community. Tricia Talley is is uneasy with the phrase “rebirth of Detroit”. There were always people here, she says. “The ‘rebirth’ is mainly about white people coming back to the centre of the city.” As president of the North Corktown Neighbourhood Association (NCNA), she was initially excited at news of the Ford project. But she remains concerned that not enough jobs will go to Corktown residents - “the people who stayed and weathered the storm”. Talley first came to the area in 2006. At that time much of North Corktown was empty. As gentrification slowly got under way, young white people began moving in - “urban pioneers” as she calls them, just a touch ironically. “We even got bike lanes,” she says. Tricia Talley and Rhonda Greene, Corktown residents Tricia Talley and Rhonda Greene, Corktown residents The trendy new hotel restaurant in which she’s sitting is itself a small example of the change in the neighbourhood. A decade or so ago the building was a dive, renting out rooms in three-hour blocks and infamously providing vending machines dispensing lighters, condoms and women’s underwear. Sitting with Talley is Rhonda Greene, another Corktown resident on the NCNA’s board. She says she also has mixed feelings about the project. “If that building comes back to life,” she tells me, “then the Corktown area too will come back to life. We wanted the city’s attention,” she says. However, she worries that Ford’s “louder voice” may drown out those of local people. Both women agree that there must be no false dawn. But as Greene notes sadly, “we are used to being disappointed.” House prices are certainly going up. Local estate agents Ryan Cooley and Lauren Bruyninga have been watching the changes to the area for more than a decade. Cooley says about 80% of their business is now residential property. In 2008 the average sales price was about $35,000. In 2018, it was $250,000. Bruyninga says when she first came to Detroit, “people would come downtown to work and then five o’clock would happen, and the whole city would be dead - I mean desolate, scary, quiet. But now you see the downtown is developed - it’s pushing to the outskirts - and hopefully it will push out to the neighbourhoods as well.” Local councillor Raquel Castaneda-Lopez represents District 6, encompassing Corktown, North Corktown and the surrounding neighbourhoods that will be affected by the Ford project. Councillor Raquel Castaneda-Lopez is worried locals will be priced out of Corktown Councillor Raquel Castaneda-Lopez is worried locals will be priced out of Corktown Castaneda-Lopez was happy that Ford bought Michigan Central because the property had been blighted for many years. But she worries about over-reliance upon Ford. “Part of the reason Detroit is in the condition it is,” she explains, “is because we depended solely upon the automobile industry to build us up. And then as the auto industry moved out and left the city there was a lot of decay.” She resists the notion that Ford is “saving” Corktown, pointing to the small-business owners on Michigan Avenue’s commercial quarter who stuck it out and contributed to the area’s resurgence. “Ultimately,” she says, “it's the small businesses that tend to employ locally and have a more significant impact on local economies.” Ford is receiving large tax incentives from Detroit in return for investing locally. The figures are complicated but some estimates say the company is getting an initial package of tax breaks of up to $207m, in return for investing $738m across its five Corktown sites. “We really are doing this for our future,” Bill Ford insists. “This isn't a tax play. If we had never showed up those revenues would never have come to these neighbourhoods. Anywhere we go and build a facility, the local community works with us. That's true in America. That's true anywhere in the world.” Ten minutes by car from Michigan Central, the Detroit Institute of Arts provides a similar parable of the city’s rise and fall. Housed in a grand building on Woodward Avenue (just across the road from an equally grand public library), the institute, like Michigan Central, evokes the high point of Detroit’s success. It has one of the most extensive art collections in the United States - one that would grace any capital city in the world. But then at one time Detroit was richer than any capital city. Highlights of the institute include a variety of Dutch Masters including a Rembrandt. But one of its most famous treasures is inextricably linked to the auto industry. The Detroit Industry Murals were painted between 1932 and 1933 by the great Mexican artist Diego Rivera (husband to the artist Frida Kahlo). These massive artworks were commissioned directly for the institute, and they depict car manufacturing at the Ford company’s River Rouge plant. There are two main frescoes on the north and south walls. One shows the assembly of V8 engine blocks, while the other depicts completed transmissions rolling along the production line. Henry Ford’s son, Edsel (Bill’s grandfather) contributed $20,000 to help defray the costs of the project. He is depicted at the right-hand side of one of the panels. Edsel Ford is featured (second from right) in this detail from Rivera's mural Edsel Ford is featured (second from right) in this detail from Rivera's mural Few cities in modern times have seen a downturn in fortune as spectacular as Detroit. Urban blight and decay are not unusual. But the scale and scope of what happened to Detroit are. Well within living memory, the population of the city has collapsed. From more than 1.8 million in 1950, it stood at a little over 700,000 by 2010. And with the collapse in population came a collapse in local tax income. Increasingly the city could not pay for itself or the basic services that its remaining residents needed. In 2013 the emergency manager appointed to run the city’s affairs was looking for assets that could be liquidated, and floated the idea of selling many of the institute’s artworks - “just like the furniture out of an office building”, according to local art historian Jeffrey Abt. Eventually, what Abt describes as a “grand bargain” was reached and the 2,800 artworks earmarked for sale (worth a total of between $750-$800m) remain in the institute’s collection. While a price can be put on artworks, it is almost impossible to calculate the human cost of Detroit’s decline. It was in effect depopulated. Tens of thousands of buildings were empty and abandoned. Detroit became a city with a failing heart and a poor, mainly black, population. It was surrounded by more affluent, often white suburbs, with little interest in the goings-on at City Hall. This was the city I first visited some 20 years ago. Downtown was bleak and forbidding. It is the only city I have ever seen with abandoned skyscrapers. At night it was dark and dangerous. In the neighbourhoods surrounding the city, many streets looked like war-zones. Every third or fourth house was either burnt out or an empty lot. Those that remained were dilapidated and forlorn. Whole blocks of streets had been abandoned, and grass was growing through the foundations creating urban prairies. There wasn’t much in the way of a tourist industry in Detroit. Visitors might come to see the home of the Motown music phenomenon. Otherwise, it seemed that there was only abandonment and ruins - grand names from the past such as the once swanky Book-Cadillac Hotel, or slowly collapsing factories like the Packard Plant and the Fisher Body Plant 21. Lowell Boileau - artist, enthusiast for Detroit’s future and my guide on successive visits to the city, established a website to commemorate many of these great old buildings. He called it The Fabulous Ruins of Detroit. Over them all - sentinel-like - stood the crumbling edifice of Michigan Central. Boileau says he was delighted by Ford’s purchase of the station. Downtown Detroit had been undergoing a resurgence, but there was still “this huge ruin of a building, made worse by the fact that there were no other buildings around it - a symbol of the city’s failure”. Lowell Boileau Lowell Boileau Detroit was a city beyond crisis. Even today there are still vast numbers of empty lots and abandoned areas. Lowell is sanguine about the city’s long-term prospects. “I don't know what the future will hold,” he says. “But this is the pounding heart of Detroit, the historical centre of the city and you have to have a healthy heart before those limbs out there can prosper. “Visitors now come to Detroit and suddenly they are not seeing abandoned buildings in the centre of the city. They're seeing a vibrant happening place, with these beautiful 1920s-era buildings glistening again.” Boileau rhapsodises about his home city: “I know that Jerusalem has been destroyed many times. I know Rome has been sacked. I know cities go through cycles and Detroit has similarly gone through that. “I know enough history,” he says, “to know that nothing is final. It will go through its ups and downs.” When the final train left and the station closed its doors in 1988 the local newspaper - the Detroit Free Press - tried to put this sombre moment into a wider context. “The shutdown of Michigan Central,” it declared, “should be the occasion of serious reflection about what we once were; what we have lost; and what, given sufficient will, we could regain.” So, might the trains ever come back to Michigan Central one day? Bill Ford does not rule this out completely. “Right now, the tracks stop about a mile short of the station. But yes, I would love the trains to come back. “Obviously,” he adds, “that's not within Ford's control but we're already starting to talk to some of the regional transportation people about just that. It's very early days, but I think it would be wonderful.”  Ten minutes by car from Michigan Central, the Detroit Institute of Arts provides a similar parable of the city’s rise and fall.

Highlights of the institute include a variety of Dutch Masters including a Rembrandt. But one of its most famous treasures is inextricably linked to the auto industry. The Detroit Industry Murals were painted between 1932 and 1933 by the great Mexican artist Diego Rivera (husband to the artist Frida Kahlo). These massive artworks were commissioned directly for the institute, and they depict car manufacturing at the Ford company’s River Rouge plant. There are two main frescoes on the north and south walls. One depicts the assembly of V8 engine blocks, while the other shows completed transmissions rolling along the production line. Henry Ford’s son, Edsel Ford (Bill’s grandfather) contributed $20,000 to help defray the costs of the project. He is depicted at the right-hand side of one of the panels. This detail from the mural shows Edsel Ford (second from right) This detail from the mural shows Edsel Ford (second from right) Few cities in modern times have seen a downturn in fortune as spectacular as Detroit. Urban blight and decay are not unusual. But the scale and scope of what happened to Detroit are. Well within living memory, the population of the city has collapsed. From more than 1.8 million in 1950, it stood at a little over 700,000 by 2010. And with the collapse in population came a collapse in local tax income. Increasingly the city could not pay for itself or the basic services that its remaining residents needed. In 2013 the emergency manager appointed to run the city’s affairs was looking for assets that could be liquidated, and floated the idea of selling many of the institute’s artworks - “just like the furniture out of an office building”, according to local art historian Jeffrey Abt. Eventually, what Abt describes as a “grand bargain” was reached and the 2,800 artworks earmarked for sale (worth a total of between $750-$800m) remain in the institute’s collection. While a price can be put on artworks, it is almost impossible to calculate the human cost of Detroit’s decline. It was in effect depopulated. Tens of thousands of buildings were empty and abandoned. Detroit became a city with a failing heart and a poor, mainly black, population. It was surrounded by more affluent, often white suburbs, with little interest in the goings-on at City Hall. This was the city I first visited some 20 years ago. Downtown was bleak and forbidding. It is the only city I have ever seen with abandoned sky-scrapers. At night it was dark and dangerous. In the neighbourhoods surrounding the city, many streets looked like war-zones. Every third or fourth house was either burnt out or an empty lot. Those that remained were dilapidated and forlorn. Whole blocks of streets had been abandoned, and grass was growing through the foundations creating urban prairies. There wasn’t much in the way of a tourist industry in Detroit. Visitors might come to see the home of the Motown music phenomenon. Otherwise, it seemed that there was only abandonment and ruins - grand names from the past such as the once swanky Book-Cadillac Hotel, or slowly collapsing factories like the Packard Plant and the Fisher Body Plant 21. Lowell Boileau - artist, enthusiast for Detroit’s future and my guide on successive visits to the city - established a website to commemorate many of these great old buildings. He called it The Fabulous Ruins of Detroit. Over them all - sentinel-like - stood the crumbling edifice of Michigan Central. Boileau says he was delighted by Ford’s purchase of the station. Downtown Detroit had been undergoing a resurgence, but there was still “this huge ruin of a building, made worse by the fact that there were no other buildings around it - a symbol of the city’s failure”. Lowell Boileau Lowell Boileau Detroit was a city beyond crisis. Even today there are still vast numbers of empty lots and abandoned areas. Lowell is sanguine about the city’s long-term prospects. “I don't know what the future will hold,” he says. “But this is the pounding heart of Detroit, the historical centre of the city and you have to have a healthy heart before those limbs out there can prosper. “Visitors now come to Detroit and suddenly they are not seeing abandoned buildings in the centre of the city. They're seeing a vibrant happening place, with these beautiful 1920s-era buildings glistening again.” Boileau rhapsodises about his home city: “I know that Jerusalem has been destroyed many times. I know Rome has been sacked. I know cities go through cycles and Detroit has similarly gone through that. “I know enough history,” he says, “to know that nothing is final. It will go through its ups and downs.” When the final train left and the station closed its doors in 1988 the local newspaper - the Detroit Free Press - tried to put this sombre moment into a wider context. “The shutdown of Michigan Central,” it declared, “should be the occasion of serious reflection about what we once were; what we have lost; and what, given sufficient will, we could regain.” So, might the trains ever come back to Michigan Central one day? Bill Ford does not rule this out completely. “Right now, the tracks stop about a mile short of the station. But yes, I would love the trains to come back. “Obviously,” he adds, “that's not within Ford's control but we're already starting to talk to some of the regional transportation people about just that. It's very early days, but I think it would be wonderful.”"

"Carluccio's collapses with 2,000 jobs under threatThe future of some 2,000 of the restaurant's employees hang in the balance.Business","Italian restaurant chain Carluccio's has gone into administration, blaming ""challenging trading conditions"" exacerbated by the coronavirus. Administrator FRP is ""urgently looking at options"" for the future of the firm. These include mothballing the business using government support, as well as trying to sell all or parts of it. Most of the company's 2,000 employees will be paid through the government's job retention scheme while these options are explored. This allows for staff to be paid up to 80% of their salary. The restaurant chain's collapse came minutes after rent-to-own firm  BrightHouse - the biggest rent-to-own operator in the UK - also collapsed. Collectively, the two firms employ 4,500 people. Rent-to-own giant BrightHouse collapses Carluccio's had already warned it was facing permanent branch closures due to the coronavirus. Before the outbreak it was hitby the crunch in the casual dining sectorand recently urged the state to step in. Geoff Rowley, joint administrator and partner at FRP, said: ""We are operating in unprecedented times and the issues currently facing the hospitality sector following the onset of Covid-19 are well documented. ""In the absence of being able to continue to trade Carluccio's, in the short term, we are urgently focused on the options available to preserve the future of the business and protect its employees."" Mr Rowley said FRP looked forward to working with HMRC to access the support it provided for companies in administration and their employees. He added: ""As this fast-moving situation progresses, we will remain in regular communication with all employees and key stakeholders, and will provide a further update in due course."" Denise (name changed) has been working for Carluccio's for the past four years and was employed at its branch in the Grand Central shopping centre in Birmingham when it first emerged that the chain was in trouble. ""We weren't told anything,"" she said. ""We found out via BBC News."" Denise said Carluccio's staff had been assured that their March salary would be paid as normal, but when they got their payslips, they found that they had received only 50% of what they were owed. ""That's holiday pay, sick pay, they've deducted 50% of everything,"" she told the BBC. ""I can't pay my rent this month. I don't have children, but other people who have are having to make decisions about whether to pay rent, heating bills or food bills."" She said that officials from the Unite union were contacting Carluccio's on their behalf, seeking clarification about when the other half of the money would be paid. ""We've received legal advice and we've been told that what they've done is illegal,"" she said, adding that the deductions brought their pay to below the minimum wage. Antonio Carluccio founded the chain in 1999 John Colley, associate dean at Warwick Business School, told the BBC that firms in the sector were likely to follow Carluccio's into administration. ""They over expanded, as did many other restaurant chains,"" he said. Price wars and increases in the minimum wage had put restaurants under severe pressure, he added. ""I think the fact that Carluccio's was so quick to go into administration says that this was not due to coronavirus,"" said Prof Colley. ""All the issues were there anyway and this is just the last straw."" Restrictions aimed at curbing the coronavirus pandemichave recently forced all cafes and restaurants to close. Carluccio's has faced some difficult times in recent years, closing a third of its restaurants in 2018as part of a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) rescue plan. Like many in the casual dining sector, it has felt the brunt of a fall in consumer spending, combined with higher business rates, and increases in the National Living Wage. Prezzo and Byron also used CVAs to close restaurants while Jamie's Italian went into administration last year.

EasyJet grounds entire fleet of planes due to virusThe budget airline says it cannot currently give a date for when it will restart commercial flights.BusinessComments,"EasyJet has grounded its entire fleet of planes and said it cannot give a date for when they will restart. The budget airline said it had made the move due to the ""unprecedented travel restrictions"" imposed by governments globally due to the virus pandemic. It had already cancelled most services but had been running rescue flights to repatriate Britons stranded abroad. ""We will continue to work with government bodies to operate additional rescue flights as requested,"" it said. EasyJet has flown 650 rescue flights so far taking 45,000 people home. The move came as regional airline Loganair said airlines were unlikely to survive without a government bailout. The pandemic has had a severe impact on airlines, Loganair boss Jonathan Hinkles told the BBC's Tom Burridge. He said that any airline saying it could survive without government help ""would probably be lying"". EasyJet said its cabin crew would be furloughed, with staff paid 80% of their wage from 1 April through the government's job retention scheme. The airline's boss, Johan Lundgren, said he was ""working tirelessly"" to make sure the airline was ""well positioned to overcome the challenges of coronavirus"". ""I am extremely proud of the way in which people across EasyJet have given their absolute best at such a challenging time,"" he added. EasyJet's headquarters are at London Luton Airport and it has 331 planes. In normal times, it serves 159 airports and 1,051 routes. Mr Lundgren said the airline had operated its last rescue flight on Sunday 29 March, but would continue to offer further rescue flights ""as requested"". If your flight has been cancelled you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days under EU air passengers' rights rules. But getting your cash may prove tricky as the airline - along with British Airways - has removed the usual option where passengers would be sent a link that took them to the booking and they could request their money back online within seconds. Instead many airlines are trying to persuade passengers to take vouchers instead. To get your money back you'll have to phone the airline. EasyJet told the BBC: ""Customers on cancelled flights can transfer to an alternative flight free of charge or receive a voucher for the value of their booking online or claim a refund through our contact centre. ""We are experiencing higher than average wait times so we would thank customers for their patience and assure them that these entitlements will be available long after their cancelled flight has flown."" The vast bulk offlights to and from the UK have been groundeddue to travel restrictions imposed to control the spread of coronavirus, with many airlines expected to seek government help to survive. Virgin Atlantic has already indicated thatit will seek a bailoutand other airlines are expected to follow suit. The government has said it will only step in to help struggling airlines ""as a last resort"" on a case-by-case basis. But industry group the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned of an ""apocalypse"" in the aviation sector as it urged governments around the world to help. Easyjet said on Monday it would not need a bailout. ""We have no plans currently to ask the government for bespoke support as outlined by the chancellor,"" it said. However, it added: ""To support recovery in the future, we believe that further actions will be needed such as a temporary removal of Aviation Passenger Duty and Air Traffic Control Charges.""

Loganair operates routes to the UK's most remote airports such as Barra in the Outer Hebrides, and it is still ferrying people, mail and essential goods, such as pharmaceutical products, out to about 15 island airports. Nevertheless, the Scottish carrier has had to ground half of its fleet and dramatically slash its flying schedule. This has put its entire operation in jeopardy. ""We can't just shut down"", Mr Hinkles said. ""Morally, we have to fly."" Loganair operates routes to the UK's most remote airports All airlines have called for additional support measures from the government to weather the storm. The industry group Airlines UK and the Airport Operators Association haveasked the governmentto cover air traffic control charges and payments to the Civil Aviation Authority until the end of this year. Airlines also want a six-month suspension of the Air Passenger Duty tax, which brings in Â£3bn every year to the Treasury. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said that the aviation sector is ""important to the UK economy"". They added: ""We are willing to consider the situation of individual firms, so long as all other government schemes have been explored and all commercial options exhausted, including raising capital from existing investors."" Meanwhile there is still a fair amount of traffic coming to and from London's Heathrow airport. That is because the amount of cargo handling via Heathrow has doubled in recent days as vital supplies are being moved around the globe, including medical equipment, the airport told the BBC.

Rent-to-own giant BrightHouse collapses,"BrightHouse has faced an influx of compensation claims BrightHouse - the biggest rent-to-own operator in the UK - has collapsed, with administrators now attempting to salvage parts of the business. Customers should continue to make the monthly payments required to keep their household goods, with administrators now acting as the collecting agent. The company had been struggling after an influx of compensation claims forselling to people who could not repay. Its shops were then shut owing to coronavirus restrictions on retailers. Julie Palmer, from corporate recovery business Begbies Traynor, said: ""Coronavirus was the final nail in the coffin for BrightHouse."" 'I paid Â£2,000 for a Â£450 TV' says rent-to-own victim Price cap plan for rent-to-own sector BrightHouse, the trading name of Caversham Finance Limited, has 240 shops and 2,400 employees, whose jobs are now at serious risk. The firm's collapse came minutes before Italian restaurant chain Carluccio'salso fell into administration. Collectively, the two firms employ 4,500 people. BrightHouse's 200,000 rent-to-own customers make monthly payments for household appliances, in effect renting goods (and paying interest) until they have paid in full. Many are on low incomes and find it difficult to access credit from mainstream lenders to pay for fridges, TVs, washing machines and other electrical items. Only about a third are in work. Customers should continue to make payments in the usual way, the administrators confirmed, although for some the closure of shops and no doorstep collection owing to coronavirus means that should bedone in a different way,external. Failing to make repayments, even now the company is in administration, could lead to extra charges and harm a credit score. However, those unable to pay for practical reasons owing to coronavirus will not be charged extra or have their credit score affected. All new rent-to-own agreements and cash loans, which the company also provided, will now be stopped. Servicing, warranties, and insurance claims will continue at present, as will delivery of essential items already ordered, but in line with coronavirus restrictions. These services operated alongside the rent-to-own service. The collapse,which was trailed on Friday, means that the administrators - Grant Thornton - will now try to find buyers for all, or some, of the business. The company's website was still operating on Monday morning. Alongside many other lenders of high-cost credit, the company was being challenged by people who said they were given credit when they should not have been. In October 2017, the company was fined nearly Â£15m by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), for not acting as a ""responsible lender"". Some of those customers were given rental agreements, despite being unable to realistically afford to make the repayments. In January, the business said it was under pressure from dealing with additional mis-selling claims Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes theDebt Camel blog,external, said: ""Customers need to think if they can manage to make the repayments. ""If their income has fallen because of coronavirus, they should ask for a payment break. And if the item is just too expensive, they should ask for a lower payment arrangement. They may be able to make an affordability complaint and get a refund of the interest they have paid on previous items."" However, anyone eligible for compensation may now find they have to wait longer, and receive a fraction of what they might have expected. Terri Carter faced pressure after missing a repayment Rules, introduced last year,restricted the cost of rent-to-own, following claims of spiralling debts. The FCA ruled that interest charged would be capped to as much as the cost of the product. Prices were also controlled, with shops only able to charge no more than the median - the middle price - of three mainstream retailers, including delivery and installation charges. Shops were also prevented from increasing their prices for insurance premiums, extended warranties, or arrears charges, to recoup lost revenue from the price cap. Before the rules were brought in, spiralling interest charges meant some rent-to-own consumers had ended up paying more than four times the retail price they would have paid in normal shops. Among those who were unhappy with how the business operated was Terri Carter, a paralegal from Great Yarmouth. She had ordered a TV through BrightHouse after running out of money when furnishing her new home. She went into the store to explain that she needed to miss a repayment, only later to find a woman in a suit, accompanied by two ""big blokes"", banging on her door. At home with her son, they threatened to take away her TV, and she felt forced to agree to making extra payments. ""I work in law so I knew my rights, but what if that happens to someone older, or someone who has just had a baby?"" she said. Angela Clements, founder of not-for-profit buy-now-pay-later operator Fair for You, said: ""While my heart goes out to BrightHouse's staff who will lose their jobs, I hope that its collapse will make other lenders think twice before trying to make easy money out of hard-working families in this way. ""There is a clear need to support and rapidly scale the affordable lending sector so that other high cost credit doesn't keep mutating in that gap."" Are you a customer of BrightHouse?

Trump extends US virus guidelines to end of April,"This video can not be played ""Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won"" President Donald Trump has said federal coronavirus guidelines such as social distancing will be extended across the US until at least 30 April. He had previously suggested that they could be relaxedas early as Easter, which falls in mid-April. ""The highest point of the death rate is likely to hit in two weeks,"" Mr Trump said. He appeared to be referring to peak infection rates that experts fear could overwhelm hospitals. White House medical adviserDr Anthony Faucihad earlier warned thatthe virus could kill up to 200,000 Americans. Dr Fauci said that it was ""entirely conceivable"" that millions of Americans could eventually be infected. Live: Our rolling coronavirus coverage Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' What this crisis reveals about the US The US now has more than 153,000 confirmed cases. As of Monday afternoon, 2,828 deaths had been recorded in the country in relation to Covid-19, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China. Speaking during the White House coronavirus briefing on Sunday, Mr Trump called social distancing measures ""the way you win"", adding that the US ""will be well on our way to recovery"" by June. Suggesting that the ""peak"" of death rates in the US was likely to hit in two weeks, Mr Trump said that ""nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won - that would be the greatest loss of all"". Analysts suggest that when Mr Trump referred to a peak in the ""death rate"", he probably meant the total number of recorded infections. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak He said the decision to extend social distancing was made after he heard that ""2.2 million people could have died if we didn't go through with all of this"", adding that if the death toll could be restricted to less than 100,000 ""we all together have done a very good job"". Mr Trump had previously said that Easter - 10-13 April - would be a ""beautiful time"" to be able to open at least some sections of the country. On Sunday he said that lifting restrictions at Easter was ""just an aspiration"". ""I wish we could have our old life back... but we're working very hard, that's all I know."" He said that ""rapid testing"" had been approved to get Covid-19 results within five minutes, and that doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers would get them. Earlier tweets, Mr Trump touted a New York Times article which called the president's daily briefings a ""ratings hit"". However, he claimed in his briefing the ratings figures ""don't matter to me"". ""What matters to me is that we have a victory over this thing as soon as possible"" he said. This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death Nationwide measures mean citizens must continue to avoid non-essential travel, going to work, and eating at restaurants or bars. Gatherings are limited to groups of under 10 people. But stricter restrictions apply to millions in some of the worst-hit states. A field hospital has been built in Central Park as New York City deals with more than 33,000 cases On Saturday residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were instructed not to travel elsewhere within the country for 14 days. Non-essential gatherings in New York City are banned and most businesses are closed as the city faces more than 33,000 cases. Police can issue fines of $250-500 (Â£200-Â£400). In California, a ""shelter in place"" order remains. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Trump accused hospitals in some states of ""hoarding"" ventilators, face masks and other critical medical supplies. ""We do have a problem with hoarding... including ventilators. Hospitals need to release them - in some cases they have too many, they have to release medical supplies and equipment,"" he said. Hospitals ""can't hold [ventilators] if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road"", he said, alleging that some were ""stocked up"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lack of medical supplies 'a national shame' The availability of ventilators is a major concern among health professionals as demand has surged. A number of states have warned that they will soon not have enough to treat patients suffering from Covid-19. The virus can cause severe respiratory issues as it attacks the lungs, and ventilators help to keep patients breathing. More than 33,000 people are now confirmed to have died worldwide after being infected with the new coronavirus.

EasyJet grounds entire fleet of planes due to virus,"EasyJet has grounded its entire fleet of planes and said it cannot give a date for when they will restart. The budget airline said it had made the move due to the ""unprecedented travel restrictions"" imposed by governments globally due to the virus pandemic. It had already cancelled most services but had been running rescue flights to repatriate Britons stranded abroad. ""We will continue to work with government bodies to operate additional rescue flights as requested,"" it said. EasyJet has flown 650 rescue flights so far taking 45,000 people home. The move came as regional airline Loganair said airlines were unlikely to survive without a government bailout. The pandemic has had a severe impact on airlines, Loganair boss Jonathan Hinkles told the BBC's Tom Burridge. He said that any airline saying it could survive without government help ""would probably be lying"". EasyJet said its cabin crew would be furloughed, with staff paid 80% of their wage from 1 April through the government's job retention scheme. The airline's boss, Johan Lundgren, said he was ""working tirelessly"" to make sure the airline was ""well positioned to overcome the challenges of coronavirus"". ""I am extremely proud of the way in which people across EasyJet have given their absolute best at such a challenging time,"" he added. EasyJet's headquarters are at London Luton Airport and it has 331 planes. In normal times, it serves 159 airports and 1,051 routes. Mr Lundgren said the airline had operated its last rescue flight on Sunday 29 March, but would continue to offer further rescue flights ""as requested"". If your flight has been cancelled you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days under EU air passengers' rights rules. But getting your cash may prove tricky as the airline - along with British Airways - has removed the usual option where passengers would be sent a link that took them to the booking and they could request their money back online within seconds. Instead many airlines are trying to persuade passengers to take vouchers instead. To get your money back you'll have to phone the airline. EasyJet told the BBC: ""Customers on cancelled flights can transfer to an alternative flight free of charge or receive a voucher for the value of their booking online or claim a refund through our contact centre. ""We are experiencing higher than average wait times so we would thank customers for their patience and assure them that these entitlements will be available long after their cancelled flight has flown."" The vast bulk offlights to and from the UK have been groundeddue to travel restrictions imposed to control the spread of coronavirus, with many airlines expected to seek government help to survive. Virgin Atlantic has already indicated thatit will seek a bailoutand other airlines are expected to follow suit. The government has said it will only step in to help struggling airlines ""as a last resort"" on a case-by-case basis. But industry group the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned of an ""apocalypse"" in the aviation sector as it urged governments around the world to help. Easyjet said on Monday it would not need a bailout. ""We have no plans currently to ask the government for bespoke support as outlined by the chancellor,"" it said. However, it added: ""To support recovery in the future, we believe that further actions will be needed such as a temporary removal of Aviation Passenger Duty and Air Traffic Control Charges.""

"Johnson hails return of 20,000 former NHS staff","Boris Johnson tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week Some 20,000 former NHS staff have returned to work to help the fight against coronavirus, Boris Johnson has revealed in a video posted online. The prime minister, who is self-isolating after testing positive for the virus, said the country would get through the crisis ""together"". It comes after England's deputy chief medical officersaid it could be six months before life returns to ""normal"". The number of people who have died with the virus in the UK has reached 1,228. Among those to have died isAmged El-Hawrani, a 55-year-old ear, nose and throat consultant at Queen's Hospital Burton. And last week an organ transplant consultant diedafter testing positive for the virus. Prof Andrew Goddard, the head of the Royal College of Physicians, said ""about one in four"" of its workforce was currently off work, either with symptoms or isolating because family members have symptoms. ""I've got lots of colleagues sitting at home... They themselves don't have symptoms and are chomping at the bit to try and get back to work,"" he said, adding that widespread testing would mean staff who are well can return to work.

LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Labour has called on the government to scale up testing to ""sufficient levels"", giving the example of Germany, which is reportedly testing up to 500,000 people a week. It comes after confusion over the number of tests being carried out, after ministers said the government had hit its target of 10,000 tests a day at the weekend. But care minister Helen Whately said on Monday that, while there was capacity to carry out 10,000 tests, the actual number tested was more like 7,000. PHE said the number of people tested may be lower because some people use more than one test. NHS workers are being tested for the virus at a temporary drive-through centre in the car park of Chessington World of Adventures, Surrey Key workers - including NHS, care staff and transport workers - are still allowed to travel to work Meanwhile, the prime minister has continued to lead the country's response to the pandemic while self-isolating in his Downing Street flat. On Monday, a No 10 source confirmed Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, has developed symptoms of the virus and was self-isolating at home.

""If we look at the number of new hospital admissions per day for instance, that does appear to be slowing down a little bit now. It's not yet plateaued, so the numbers can be increasing each day, but the rate of increase has slowed."" Asked how many people may have been infected in the UK, Prof Ferguson said it varied across the country. ""(In) Central London it could be as many as 3% to 5% of the population has been infected, maybe more in individual hotspots. In the country as a whole, the UK, maybe 2% or 3%.""

Easter eggs are 'essential' small shops insist,"Convenience stores selling Easter eggs are facing interference from âheavy-handedâ officials trying to restrict the range of goods they can sell under coronavirus curbs, a trade body says. Some shops have been told by police and local councils that the chocolate eggs are considered non-essential goods. The Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) blamed âoverzealous enforcement and a misreading of the rulesâ. It has told shopkeepers to carry on selling a full range of goods. âThe government have defined which stores can remain open, and that includes convenience stores, including newsagents and off-licences,â said ACS chief executive James Lowman. âThere is no government definition of which products can be sold within those stores. âIn the cases where officers have challenged retailers and shoppers in this way, itâs brought confusion, distracted retailers in the busiest weeks of their lives and increased the interactions between people at a time when the government is trying to minimise them.â The attempt to restrict the kinds of goods sold in convenience stores drew a scathing reaction from retail analyst Richard Hyman. ""Quite frankly, it sounds bonkers,"" he said. ""This is a time when being excessively pedantic seems rather absurd. ""It's certainly right that if restrictions are going to be applied, they should be applied to types of outlet, not types of product."" He said the current rules, which put no restrictions on the items essential retailers can sell, were common sense and pointed out that supermarkets also had Easter eggs for sale. ""Going beyond that, what difference does it make if they do sell some Easter eggs? I suppose they might argue that it's taking up space on shelves that could be used for other items,"" Mr Hyman said. Some social media users shared the same opinion, with one saying that chocolate was ""the only thing keeping me sane"" during the pandemic. Another thought that purchasing Easter eggs is acceptable if you are already visiting a shop for essential items - or buying them as ""eggstras"". Exactly what qualifies as an ""essential"" business which is allowed to stay open during the coronavirus pandemic has caused confusion in some quarters. The official list,externalof essential retailers put together by the Cabinet Office includes off-licences, supermarkets and pharmacies as well as newsagents and corner shops. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do i protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak The ACS said it had a partnership with Buckinghamshire and Surrey Trading Standards, which had confirmed that there should be no restriction on the categories of goods sold in convenience stores. An ACS spokesman told the BBC that âonly a few membersâ  had faced this âheavy-handedâ approach, adding:  âWe hope that itâs ended there.â The association said that if any retailers continued to face such challenges, they should get in touch with the name of the local authority or police force and officer, so that it could follow up with them. After strict new restrictions were brought in by government earlier this week, it issued a list of âessential retailersâ, that are allowed to stay open. They include: Supermarkets and other food shops Pharmacies Off-licences and licensed shops selling alcohol, including those within breweries Petrol stations Newsagents Bicycle shops Home and hardware stores Launderettes and dry cleaners Garages Pet shops Post offices Banks Sports Direct boss 'deeply' sorry for virus blunders Tesco restricts online orders to 80 items each Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

EasyJet grounds entire fleet of planes due to virusThe budget airline says it cannot currently give a date for when it will restart commercial flights.Business,"EasyJet has grounded its entire fleet of planes and said it cannot give a date for when they will restart. The budget airline said it had made the move due to the ""unprecedented travel restrictions"" imposed by governments globally due to the virus pandemic. It had already cancelled most services but had been running rescue flights to repatriate Britons stranded abroad. ""We will continue to work with government bodies to operate additional rescue flights as requested,"" it said. EasyJet has flown 650 rescue flights so far taking 45,000 people home. The move came as regional airline Loganair said airlines were unlikely to survive without a government bailout. The pandemic has had a severe impact on airlines, Loganair boss Jonathan Hinkles told the BBC's Tom Burridge. He said that any airline saying it could survive without government help ""would probably be lying"". EasyJet said its cabin crew would be furloughed, with staff paid 80% of their wage from 1 April through the government's job retention scheme. The airline's boss, Johan Lundgren, said he was ""working tirelessly"" to make sure the airline was ""well positioned to overcome the challenges of coronavirus"". ""I am extremely proud of the way in which people across EasyJet have given their absolute best at such a challenging time,"" he added. EasyJet's headquarters are at London Luton Airport and it has 331 planes. In normal times, it serves 159 airports and 1,051 routes. Mr Lundgren said the airline had operated its last rescue flight on Sunday 29 March, but would continue to offer further rescue flights ""as requested"". If your flight has been cancelled you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days under EU air passengers' rights rules. But getting your cash may prove tricky as the airline - along with British Airways - has removed the usual option where passengers would be sent a link that took them to the booking and they could request their money back online within seconds. Instead many airlines are trying to persuade passengers to take vouchers instead. To get your money back you'll have to phone the airline. EasyJet told the BBC: ""Customers on cancelled flights can transfer to an alternative flight free of charge or receive a voucher for the value of their booking online or claim a refund through our contact centre. ""We are experiencing higher than average wait times so we would thank customers for their patience and assure them that these entitlements will be available long after their cancelled flight has flown."" The vast bulk offlights to and from the UK have been groundeddue to travel restrictions imposed to control the spread of coronavirus, with many airlines expected to seek government help to survive. Virgin Atlantic has already indicated thatit will seek a bailoutand other airlines are expected to follow suit. The government has said it will only step in to help struggling airlines ""as a last resort"" on a case-by-case basis. But industry group the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned of an ""apocalypse"" in the aviation sector as it urged governments around the world to help. Easyjet said on Monday it would not need a bailout. ""We have no plans currently to ask the government for bespoke support as outlined by the chancellor,"" it said. However, it added: ""To support recovery in the future, we believe that further actions will be needed such as a temporary removal of Aviation Passenger Duty and Air Traffic Control Charges.""

Loganair operates routes to the UK's most remote airports such as Barra in the Outer Hebrides, and it is still ferrying people, mail and essential goods, such as pharmaceutical products, out to about 15 island airports.

Loganair operates routes to the UK's most remote airports All airlines have called for additional support measures from the government to weather the storm. The industry group Airlines UK and the Airport Operators Association haveasked the governmentto cover air traffic control charges and payments to the Civil Aviation Authority until the end of this year. Airlines also want a six-month suspension of the Air Passenger Duty tax, which brings in Â£3bn every year to the Treasury.

Government cracks down on coronavirus fake news,"The government is cracking down on misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. A rapid response unit within the Cabinet Office is working with social media firms to remove fake news and harmful content. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said action was needed ""to stem the spread of falsehoods and rumours, which could cost lives"". The specialist unit is dealing with as many as 10 incidents each day. It will try to tackle a range of issues online, such as fake ""experts"" issuing false medical information and criminals running phishing scams. Last Tuesday, for example, hours after the government started sending texts urging people to stay at home, several fake versions of the message began circulating on social media.

One of them told people they had been fined for breaking the rules. Mr Dowden added: ""We need people to follow expert medical advice and stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. ""It is vital that this message hits home and that misinformation and disinformation which undermines it is knocked down quickly."" The government is also re-launching a campaign called ""Don't Feed the Beast"", urging the public to think carefully about what they share online. This video can not be played How can you spot ""fake news""? It comes as the former chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee called for knowingly sharing misinformation about Covid-19 to be made an offence. Conservative MP Damian Collins said: ""The information contagion around Covid-19 is so dangerous, because there is so much that people don't know and so much happening all the time, that it is very easy for false rumours to take hold and spread."" Mr Collins is also launching an online service where members of the public can post screenshots of coronavirus-related information they have been sent. Social media companies have also announced measures to try to fight the spread of misinformation about the virus. Twitter has said it will remove content that promotes unverified claims. Last week, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Reddit also said they would work with governments on the issue and to help those in self-isolation.

University admissions could see emergency controlsUniversities are considering fixed limits on student numbers amid financial worries over admissions.Family & Education,"University applications have been caught up in the uncertainty of the coronavirus outbreak Universities in England could face fixed limits on how many students they each recruit, in a bid to create more stability and reduce financial threats. There are concerns that the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus could leave some universities with too few applicants to stay financially viable. It is understood that emergency controls are being considered to stop a free-for-all in student recruitment. But Universities UK said any ""stability measures"" had not yet been decided. ""Financial support from government for universities is necessary,"" said the university group's chief executive Alistair Jarvis. But he said any response such as controls on student numbers would need ""more detailed consideration"" and so far had not been approved by Universities UK. ""There would need to be a clear case of the benefits, any proposal would have to be sector-led not imposed, strictly time-limited and carefully crafted to avoid unintended consequences,"" he said. Universities told to stop unconditional offers in coronavirus confusion Teachers to estimate grades after exams cancelled Universities could scrap use of predicted grades A government source described the idea as ""speculation"". But the vice chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, Sir Chris Husbands, said student number controls were necessary during the current crisis ""to ensure that institutions have a viable first-year-student population"". Sir Chris, in a paper for the Higher Education Policy Institute, says ""radical action is needed on university admissions for the foreseeable future. This means suspending the market in admissions"". The aim would be to encourage more stability in an admissions round caught up in the coronavirus outbreak, which has closed schools and universities and cancelled exams. Universities are divided over whether to back student number controls More students than usual might defer entry and take a gap year - with universities uncertain about whether they will be able to re-open campuses for the autumn. Universities are also expecting a fall in overseas student numbers - making funding from home students even more important. Last week the higher education watchdog intervened to stop universities making unconditional offers, after fears that some were recruiting large numbers of students by promising places regardless of their grades. With A-level exams scrapped and grades set to be based on teachers' assessments, the Office for Students and the universities minister Michelle Donelan were concerned that anxious students might switch to the promise of an unconditional offer. But there were also concerns that the volatility around this year's applications could leave some universities with such a shortage of students that it would threaten their financial stability. Universities are understood to remain divided over a response. Introducing student number controls would mean individual universities would not be allowed to expand. This would ensure that the share of students between universities stayed similar to the current levels, providing them with more security over tuition fee income. But student number controls would also mean a limit on student choice - so that popular universities would not be able to add extra places. It will also raise questions about what will happen if universities have offered more places than they will be allowed to provide. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: ""The crisis is fast becoming the catalyst for the return of student number caps."" He warned that it might bring short-term stability, but at the expense of stopping the expansion of university places and limiting the choices of individual students. A Department for Education spokeswoman said the department would ""continue working closely with the sector to manage the impact of coronavirus"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Trump extends US virus guidelines beyond Easter,"This video can not be played ""Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won"" President Donald Trump has said federal coronavirus guidelines such as social distancing will be extended across the US until at least 30 April. He had previously suggested that they could be relaxedas early as Easter, which falls in mid-April. ""The highest point of the death rate is likely to hit in two weeks,"" Mr Trump said. He appeared to be referring to peak infection rates that experts fear could overwhelm hospitals. White House medical adviserDr Anthony Faucihad earlier warned thatthe virus could kill up to 200,000 Americans. Dr Fauci said that it was ""entirely conceivable"" that millions of Americans could eventually be infected. Live: Our rolling coronavirus coverage Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' What this crisis reveals about the US The US now has more than 153,000 confirmed cases. As of Monday afternoon, 2,828 deaths had been recorded in the country in relation to Covid-19, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China. Speaking during the White House coronavirus briefing on Sunday, Mr Trump called social distancing measures ""the way you win"", adding that the US ""will be well on our way to recovery"" by June. Suggesting that the ""peak"" of death rates in the US was likely to hit in two weeks, Mr Trump said that ""nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won - that would be the greatest loss of all"". Analysts suggest that when Mr Trump referred to a peak in the ""death rate"", he probably meant the total number of recorded infections. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak He said the decision to extend social distancing was made after he heard that ""2.2 million people could have died if we didn't go through with all of this"", adding that if the death toll could be restricted to less than 100,000 ""we all together have done a very good job"". Mr Trump had previously said that Easter - 10-13 April - would be a ""beautiful time"" to be able to open at least some sections of the country. On Sunday he said that lifting restrictions at Easter was ""just an aspiration"". ""I wish we could have our old life back... but we're working very hard, that's all I know."" He said that ""rapid testing"" had been approved to get Covid-19 results within five minutes, and that doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers would get them. Earlier tweets, Mr Trump touted a New York Times article which called the president's daily briefings a ""ratings hit"". However, he claimed in his briefing the ratings figures ""don't matter to me"". ""What matters to me is that we have a victory over this thing as soon as possible"" he said. This video can not be played Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death Nationwide measures mean citizens must continue to avoid non-essential travel, going to work, and eating at restaurants or bars. Gatherings are limited to groups of under 10 people. But stricter restrictions apply to millions in some of the worst-hit states. A field hospital has been built in Central Park as New York City deals with more than 33,000 cases On Saturday residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were instructed not to travel elsewhere within the country for 14 days. Non-essential gatherings in New York City are banned and most businesses are closed as the city faces more than 33,000 cases. Police can issue fines of $250-500 (Â£200-Â£400). In California, a ""shelter in place"" order remains. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Trump accused hospitals in some states of ""hoarding"" ventilators, face masks and other critical medical supplies. ""We do have a problem with hoarding... including ventilators. Hospitals need to release them - in some cases they have too many, they have to release medical supplies and equipment,"" he said. Hospitals ""can't hold [ventilators] if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road"", he said, alleging that some were ""stocked up"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: Lack of medical supplies 'a national shame' The availability of ventilators is a major concern among health professionals as demand has surged. A number of states have warned that they will soon not have enough to treat patients suffering from Covid-19. The virus can cause severe respiratory issues as it attacks the lungs, and ventilators help to keep patients breathing. More than 33,000 people are now confirmed to have died worldwide after being infected with the new coronavirus. Some of the latest major global developments include: InGermanythe number of confirmed cases has jumped to over 57,000 - an increase of 4,751 Australiahas tightened its restrictions, with public gatherings now limited to just two people and playgrounds, outdoor gyms and parks closed from Monday South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has said emergency cash payments will be made to all households except the top 30% by income In theUK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed that about 20,000 former NHS staff had returned to work to help the fight against coronavirus Spainrecorded a new daily record of deaths, reporting 838 victims on Sunday Italyrecorded 756 new deaths over 24 hours, bringing the total to 10,779 - a slight drop in the daily toll Francereported 292 new deaths, bringing its total to 2,606 as specially modified trains began transporting patients from the worst-hit areas to hospitals in the south Tight new restrictions in theRussiancapital Moscow allow residents to leave their homes only for medical emergencies, essential work and to shop for food or medicine The price of oil has sunk to levels not seen since 2002as demand for crude collapses Coronavirus could infect 'millions' of Americans Trump backs away from New York 'quarantine' Reopening the US by Easter 'a beautiful timeline' Video, 00:01:04Reopening the US by Easter 'a beautiful timeline' Trump orders 'time-wasting' GM to make ventilators Economic meltdown brings political pain Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

How do ventilators work?,"The government has said it will buy thousands of ventilators to help ease the pressure on hospitals caused by the coronavirus crisis. For patients with the worst effects of the infection, a ventilator can offer the best chance of survival. Simply put, a ventilator takes over the body's breathing process when disease has caused the lungs to fail. This gives the patient time to fight off the infection and recover. Various types of medical ventilation can be used. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), some 80% of people with Covid-19 - the disease caused by coronavirus - recover without needing hospital treatment. But one person in six becomes seriously ill. In these severe cases, the virus causes damage to the lungs, causing the body's oxygen levels to drop and making it harder to breathe. To alleviate this, a ventilator is used to push air, with increased levels of oxygen, into the lungs. The ventilator also has a humidifier, which adds heat and moisture to the air supply so it matches the patient's body temperature. Patients are given medication to relax the respiratory muscles so their breathing can be fully regulated by the machine. All medical ventilation requires close supervision from trained staff People with milder symptoms may be given ventilation using facemasks, nasal masks or mouthpieces which allow air or an oxygen mixture to be pushed into the lungs. This is known as ""non-invasive"" ventilation, as no internal tubes are required. Another form of ventilation - continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP - keeps a patient's airways continuously open, Early reports from Lombardy in northern Italy suggest about 50% of patients given CPAP have avoided the need for full mechanical ventilation. A type of CPAP ventilation using a hood, where pressurised oxygen is pumped in via a valve, reduces the risk of airborne transmission of the virus. Oxygen hoods reduce the risk of disease transmission Intensive Care Units (ICUs) would generally put patients suffering acute respiratory distress on mechanical ventilation quickly, to ensure oxygen levels in the body stay normal. However Dr Shondipon Laha, from the Intensive Care Society, told the BBC that unless they become seriously ill, most patients with Covid-19 would not need a mechanical ventilator and could be treated at home or with supplementary oxygen. Although there were risks when using ventilators, such as not knowing who would suffer long-term effects, he said, sometimes a ventilator was ""the only way of getting oxygen into the patient"". Another issue, Dr Laha explained, was having enough trained staff to operate the ventilators correctly. The UK is understood to currently have about 10,000 ventilators having added to the previous stock of just over 8,000 by increasing production and sourcing other machines from overseas. A number of ventilatorshave also been acquired from private hospitals. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the country needs 18,000 machines for when the virus peaks, down from an original estimate of 30,000. Mr Hancock told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on 5 April that projected demand had come down because social distancing measures were working. The exact type of extra ventilators needed, and who makes them, is still being finalised. The delay is linked to a changing understanding of how to treat patients requiring ventilation,external, according to the Financial Times. The Smiths ParaPac ventilator is designed to be easily transported A consortium of UK manufacturers is leading efforts to produce a version of a machine built by Oxfordshire company Penlon. On 16 April, it was announced that the Penlon Prima ESO2 devices had been approved and thathundreds are expected to be built for hospitals over the next week. By the start of May, it is hoped that 1,500 a week will be made. As part of that same initiative, the first ventilators - portable ParaPac devices from Luton-based firm Smiths - have been delivered to wards over the last few days. The consortium includes Airbus, Rolls Royce and a number of Formula One racing teams. A separate machine being designed and built from scratch by Dyson is also being considered by the government. Production of other types of non-invasive ventilator is also being scaled up, with a government order of some 10,000 VenturaCPAP devicesdesigned by University College London Engineers with industry partners Mercedes-AMG-HPP.

Â£1.1bn fund to tackle coronavirus to be announcedThe cash is aimed at helping businesses and public services come through the pandemic.Wales politics,"First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced new funding to help businesses come through the coronavirus pandemic A Â£1.1bn support package for the economy and public services in Wales has been unveiled. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the fighting fund was to help businesses ""weather the coronavirus storm"", at the daily Welsh Government briefing. Further schemes will be announced throughout the week as part of the package of support. The package consists of cash reallocated from existing budgets and new money from the UK Treasury. Speaking at the daily briefing on Monday, Mr Drakeford said: ""The effect on the economy is extraordinary"" adding the money would be targeted to ""specific Welsh needs"". The Â£1.1bn being announced is ""reprioritised"" money. There will be a Â£500m economy crisis fund for businesses, charities and social enterprises to help them to survive the crisis so that they can provide jobs and products in the future. Money which would have been used for enforcing speed limits will be repurposed as roads are much quieter Mr Drakeford said this money was over and above what had been given to businesses by the UK government to help those firms who need to go into hibernation during the pandemic. As part of that fund, Â£100m will be administered by the Development Bank for Wales to help firms with cashflow problems including loans between Â£5,000 and Â£250,000 with minimal interest payments attached. The remaining Â£400m will form an emergency fund giving Â£10,000 to firms employing fewer than nine people, grants of Â£100,000 to business with 10 to 250 employees as well as support for larger companies that are significantly important to Wales and have their headquarters here. Responding to the announcement, Paul Davies AM, leader of the Welsh Conservatives said: ""The Welsh Government's Â£1.1bn announced today consists of only 25% of Welsh Government money as the rest is from European funding and the UK Treasury. ""Surely, we must see ministers re-prioritising their budgets even further as the emergency the country finds itself in cannot be business as usual."" He called on the Welsh Government to ""immediately bring forward a supplementary budget as the first minister promised last week"". The Welsh Government, by the way that they are allocating these funds, is recognising the importance of manufacturing firms to jobs and livelihoods in Wales. The UK government has prioritised retail, leisure and hospitality businesses but in Wales the help is available for all sections of the economy including social enterprises and charities. Companies will have to apply for the support and meet certain criteria. I understand that there have been detailed discussions within the Welsh Government about how its spending plans could be altered to prioritise financial help for health and economy during the crisis. For instance money has been moved from the Welsh Government's international trade department and also money that was to have been spent on enforcing speed limits on highways will now be prioritised to help protect jobs in the wider economy. I also understand that around one quarter of the Â£1.1bn has come from European Union funds that had been given to help new businesses start up. It will now be used to help existing businesses survive. The BBC understands that about 25% of the Â£1.1bn is from its existing budget. Half of the Â£1.1bn comes from the consequential of what has been announced in Westminster, for example, money for the health service or railways. However the Welsh Government, unlike the UK government, is not giving rate relief to the very biggest of properties, such as the biggest Tesco and Sainsbury's. Cafes and bars are particularly at risk from the tight restrictions That money - approximately Â£12m - which, in England, would have gone to those big business sites, will fund other businesses, social enterprises and charities. The Â£1.1bn announced on Monday is in addition to the Â£1.4bn announced by Economy Minister Ken Skates earlier. The first minister also said Wales should get more money to deal with coronavirus because of the legacy of mining and heavy industries on the population's health. ""We have an older, sicker population. Our history of coal mining and heavy industry means we have people with breathing problems that the coronavirus is particularly likely to affect. ""Money should come to Wales based on our need, not simply our population share,"" he told the press conference. Â£24m fund launched to help co-ordinate volunteers What is the help for businesses? Wages, sick pay and time off explained Mr Drakeford said he had ""no doubt at all"" the lockdown restrictions would go beyond three weeks and warned individuals and businesses to expect a ""long haul"". He was responding to comments made by England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries yesterday, who said she expected the restrictions tocontinue for up to six months. Mr Drakeford said: ""There is no doubt at all that we are facing restrictions beyond the three weeks of the immediate period that we made on Monday of last week. ""I think there will be a gradual reduction in restrictions over time."" He added: ""We may need significant restrictions for longer than the original three weeks and beyond that period there will be time when we don't just go from everything being restricted to nothing being restricted. That's going to be a long haul, a difficult haul for individuals and businesses."" Mr Drakeford also announced that antibody tests would be coming over the next weeks or months but were not ready yet. He paid tribute to health and social care workers and said the response from people wanting to volunteer was ""amazing"". Mr Drakefordannounced severe restrictionson people and businesses last Monday, including shutting all high street shops except those selling food, as well as pharmacies, banks and post offices. The Welsh Government's cabinet met last week to discuss how to prioritise its existing funds. It has already been announcedWelsh ministers will invest Â£1.4bn to help companiesthrough grants and business rate relief. Economy Minister Ken Skates previously saidthe Welsh Government would match plans announced by UK Chancellor Rishi Sunakto help English businesses. It included a business rate holiday for all firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors for 12 months and funding grants of between Â£10,000 and Â£25,000 for small businesses. But the Welsh Government has since decided not to give business rate relief to the ""fewer than 200 properties across Wales"" with a rateable value of Â£500,000 and above. The money will instead be used to create a Â£100m fund to help other businesses, social enterprises and charities during the coronavirus crisis. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Australia clamps down on gatherings,"President Trump says he's confident US hospitals will have enough ventilators to meet 'peak' of crisis Italy's death toll rises to 11,591 as the lockdown is extended to 12 April New York governor Andrew Cuomo pleads for health workers from other states to help out UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announces a deal with airlines to rescue stranded Britons 180 more people have died in the UK, bringing total virus deaths to 1,408 The Spanish foreign minister says the upward rise in Spanish cases appears to be flattening out The Hungarian government has been granted the power to rule by decree Ritu Prasad, Ashitha Nagesh, Joshua Nevett, Deirdre Finnerty, Holly Honderich, Rob Corp, Andreas Illmer, Frances Mao, Krutika Pathi and Owen Amos We are pausing our live page coverage for the day. Thanks
for following all the latest updates with us. Here are some of the most noteworthy developments of the day:   What else did the US president say? Wrapping up an almost hour-long briefing, Donald Trump said while a nationwide stay at home order had been discussed, such a measure would be ""pretty unlikely"". ""If we do that we will let you know,"" he said, adding that the order would be ""tough"" to enforce. Asked why the US remained behind countries like South Korea in terms of the testing rate per capita, Trump said he should be congratulated on his administration's progress - and repeated earlier comments that the US is testing faster than any other country. The president also doubled down on assertions from Sunday that states were ""hoarding"" critical medical supplies.  Trump says he thinks the US will be in ""very good shape"" supplying states with ventilators and other medical supplies by the time the outbreak ""peaks"" in two weeks. ""We have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators and we say go ahead,"" he said at his daily White House press briefing. Some states ""are ramping up to a level that they're not going to have to"", he added. Trump yesterday accused governors of ""hoarding"" critical medical equipment.  The vicar for the diocese of Rome, Angelo De Donatis, has
tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first known Catholic cardinal to
do so. The 66-year-old was admitted to hospital in Rome
after falling ill with Covid-19 symptoms. Cardinal De Donatis, who was reported to be in a good condition,
said he felt âcalm and confidentâ in a statement on Monday. It is not clear if the cardinal has had any contract with
Pope Francis recently. Pope Francis appointed De Donatis to preside over the diocese
as the vicar of Rome in 2017. On Saturday, the pope said neither he nor his closest aides
have tested positive for coronavirus. Watch our video ofPope Francis giving a solitary prayer service to an empty St Peter's Square last week. The cardinal was admitted to hospital with a fever Medical equipment shortages have been a key issue across the US. President Trump says private companies working with the government are soon going to outpace the nation's needs. He says 8,100 ventilators have been sent out thus far. Four hundred more are going to Michigan, 300 to New Jersey, 150 to Illinois, 150 to Louisiana, 50 to Connecticut. He says the government has distributed to date millions of masks, face shields, surgical gowns and gloves. Mr Trump adds that the Ford Motor Company will be producing 50,000 new ventilators and doing so ""in less than 100 days"". Nine other companies are also working on ventilator production. ""As we outpace what we need, we'll be sending them to Italy, we're going to be sending them to France, we're going to be sending them to Spain where they have tremendous problems,"" Mr Trump added. The president says the US will specifically be ""sending $100m-worth of things - surgical and medical and hospital things - to Italy"".  Addressing the US mask shortage, President Trump says new equipment to sanitise masks will be sent out to the regional hotspots. Each mask can be disinfected 20 times and the new machine can take on 120,000 masks per day, Mr Trump says. Two disinfecting machines are now in Ohio; one is in New York City; two more are being shipped to Washington DC and Seattle. Back at the White House press conference, the US has tested a million people for Covid-19, officials say. President Trump also unveils Abbott labs' new ""highly accurate"" five-minute test. He unboxes one of the new kits at the briefing. Dr Stephen Hahn, the US drug agency commissioner, says Abbott worked with the government to deliver these new tests quickly. Dr Hahn also says other labs are continuing to scale up the production of tests and sending them out to states. USA Rugby, the national body for rugby union the US, has filed for bankruptcy amid ""insurmountable financial constraints"" due to the coronavirus pandemic. Chairwoman Barbara O'Brien said this was ""the most challenging period this organisation has faced"". ""While the current climate is of course much larger than rugby, we remain focused with stakeholders and supporters in the continued effort toward a balanced rugby community where the game can truly grow,"" she added. In a statement on its website, USA Rugby said World Rugby is financially helping them navigate the bankruptcy process. The men's and women's US national teams will start playing again after the pandemic is over, the organisation added. The LA Sevens were held earlier this month President Donald Trump is now speaking at the White House. He begins the daily briefing today by emphasising that following official rules will help curb the spread of Covid-19. ""By very vigorously following the guidelines we could save more than one million American lives"", he says, adding these decisions will ""determine the fate of this virus and the fate of our victory"". He called on all Americans to do their part, saying this was a shared patriotic duty. ""Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days and these are a very vital 30 days we're sort of putting it all on the line."" People have criticised Las Vegas authorities for turning a car park into an outdoor sleeping area for homeless people. Photos of people lying on the ground in painted white boxes - one person per space - have gone viral on social media, with some users questioning why the homeless people weren't put up in the city's hotels, which have been closed. But officials have praised the makeshift sleeping area. Lisa Morris Hibbler, chief community services officer for the city of Las Vegas,told local CBS-affiliate 8 News Now,externalthat the boxes were ""spaced so that they're social distancing"". According to US media, the area was set up as a last-minute makeshift area for the city's homeless community after someone in one of the main shelters tested positive for coronavirus.

US President Donald Trump and his Covid-19 task force are due to update the nation on the virus outbreak in a few minutes. The daily briefing comes as more states have ordered residents to stay at home and medical workers across the nation continue to plead for more equipment. There are now 156,931 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US and 2,945 deaths, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. New York remains the nation's epicentre, accounting for at least 790 coronavirus-related deaths. Air Canada - the country's largest airline - will temporarily lay off more than 15,000 workers this week, the Canadian Press reports. The airline has already announced it would lay off 5,150 flight attendants and has put 600 of its 4,400 pilots on unpaid leave as the company struggles to stay afloat amid border closures and travel cancellations prompted by the outbreak of Covid-19. Calgary-based WestJet announced last week that 6,900 employees would be laid off. The airline said that 90% of those lay offs were voluntary. In the US, major airlines United and Delta have so far avoided lay offs, first asking thousands of thousands of employees to take unpaid leave, or early retirement plans. Both will be beneficiaries of the $2tn (Â£1.7tn) aid bill signed by Donald Trump this week, though industry executives have warned the boost may not be enough to see the crisis through. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will remain in self-quarantine despite testing negative for coronavirus for a third time, a government spokesperson says. Mrs Merkel, 65, started working from home after her doctor tested positive for coronavirus on 22 March. She had received a vaccination against pneumonia from the doctor a few days earlier. On Thursday night a government spokesperson said Mrs Merkel would continue to work from home for a few more days. Other world leaders have been self-isolating, including UKPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Mrs Merkel has had three tests for coronavirus, all of which have proved negative Liberty University, an evangelical Christian institution in Lynchburg, Virginia, has pushed back againsta New York Times article,externalthat says nearly a dozen students are now sick with Covid-19 symptoms after the school allowed spring breakers to return to campus. As of Monday, the Times says one student has tested positive. The university's president, Jerry Falwell Jr, made the decision to welcome thousands of students back last week, telling Fox News that people were over-reacting to the pandemic. The institutionissued a response,externalon Sunday saying the article was ""misleading"" and it was not aware of ""any students in its residence halls testing positive for Covid-19, or in fact, being tested at all"". Liberty said four students had been asked to self-quarantine after returning from the New York City area, and that some students who did not live on campus had reported symptoms. Amid the row, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam on Monday issued a stay at home order lasting until 10 June. The order also mandates all higher education institutions to end in-person classes - which local media say may be due to Liberty's policy. Another 418 people have died of the coronavirus in France - the highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period. The total death toll is now 3,024, although French officials only count those who die in hospitals. A total of 44,550 people in France have now tested positive for Covid-19 - an 11% rise from yesterday. The country has been in lockdown since 17 March. The coronavirus pandemic has become a global health crisis
affecting at least 177 countries. The total number of confirmed cases globally
surged above 750,000 on Monday, a grim new milestone for a disease that was
first detected in one Chinese city around four months ago. Given the global scale of the health emergency, it is difficult
to comprehend how Covid-19 has proliferated so quickly. To help you make sense of the pandemic, you canread our visual guide, which includes maps and charts with the latest data on deaths, cases and
recoveries. There are a total of 22,141 confirmed infections and 1,408 deaths from coronavirus
in the UK, according to the latest figures from Public Health England. Most of those cases are concentrated in England, where London,
the West Midlands and the South East are the worst-affected regions. The number of infections may be far greater because not
everyone who suspects they have contracted the virus has been tested. To see how many cases there are where you live,you can enter your postcode, council or NHS area in our search tool. Ferdinand OmondiBBC News, Nairobi Sales of fresh fish in Kenya have risen as imports from China have dropped amid the coronavirus pandemic. Sellers in Dunga Beach on the shores of Lake Victoria report a jump in trade of about 40% over two weeks. ""The fishermen are really now smiling at the Lake Victoria region because we are receiving more visitors. Dunga is really crowded with a lot of the residents of Kisumu coming to buy the fresh fish because people fear the Chinese boxed fish due to the coronavirus,"" says Maurice Misodhi, a fisherman and leader at the Dunga Beach Management Unit. Cargo from China is allowed to enter Kenya but only on condition that vessels are fumigated at the point of exit. Local fish costs about twice as much as frozen fish from China, of which Kenya imported more than $23m (Â£19m) worth in 2018. Chinese fish used to make up about 50% of the market. But the scarcity of Chinese fish isnât good news for everyone. Caroline Ochieng, a fish seller, says she is struggling to make a decent profit because Chinese fish is cheaper than local lake fish. ""That is the reason we want the Chinese fish to be in supply as well as that from our own lake - so that as we do business we don't feel the burden."" Before the coronavirus outbreak, local fishermen complained that cheap imports harmed local trade so much that they often resorted to eating their catch themselves or giving much of it away. There are worries that local fishermen wonât be able to keep up with new demand for fresh fish. But for now at least, they are making the most of the surge in trade. Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter More than 47 million Americans could lose their jobs in the next three months, pushing the US unemployment rate above 32%. Thatâs according to arecent analysis by the Federal Reserve,external, which describes it as a âback-of-the-envelopeâ calculation. However, the heavy economic cost is already clear, with a record 3.28 million Americans filing for unemployment last week. Those numbers are expected to rise. In just one example, US department store Macyâs on Monday, said it had placed most of its 130,000 workers on unpaid leave, citing the loss of âthe majority of our salesâ. It said it would continue to pay for staff health
 insurance until the end of May. UK politicians have been reacting to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab's announcement thatthe government will work with commercial airlinesto help British nationals stranded abroad get back home. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said it was ""more of the same... more reliance on commercial flights which - for too many British travellers based in too many locations - are simply not an option at present"". She called for ""a fresh, comprehensive and fully-funded strategy to bring our British nationals home... that is not what we got today, and that is not good enough"". Lib Dem leader Ed Davey welcomed the foreign secretary's words but said ""questions remain about why this announcement has taken so long"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Traders at Swansea Market have started delivery services as the Covid-19 lockdown continues. The market had remained open until Saturday but has now been closed. âA number of our food traders offer a home delivery service and - thanks to them still having access to the market that will go on,"" said Nick Jones, chairman of Swansea Market Traders Federation. It is home to more than 100 businesses and casual traders and attracts about 80,000 shoppers each week. Traders at Swansea Market have begun delivery services The coronavirus continues to have a big impact on Welsh farming, from concerns about the health and safety of farmers and their stock, to the loss in value of their produce. Speaking about a lack of skilled workforce and a shortage of foreign farm workers due to the virus, Aled Jones, deputy president of National Farmers' Union of Cymru, said: ""Farmers work in such a way where they would likely
sacrifice themselves in order to continue to care for the animals. ""If I or my
son fell ill, how could we stay away yet still arrange milking and the day to
day running of the farm? We have a huge duty of care to these animals. ""Of
course we have a responsibility not to infect anyone else who also works on the
farm but it does keep me up at night as I worry about how we would cope."" On the subject of prices and trends, Rhys Davies, chief executive of Dolgellau Farmers Marts, said: ""We are working very closely with the relevant authorities, under
strict guidelines, to try and keep this sector going. ""But the food chain is
extremely complicated and you only need one small thing within that chain to
break it down entirely. ""We are seeing a huge reduction in sheep value as the
wholesale market, supplying hotels and restaurants, has completely disappeared. ""We are seeing more sales in retail but there people are wanting more of the
cheap meats like mince, as steaks and other prime cuts are left unwanted."" A senior intensive care consultant stranded in India is desperate to get home to Wales to treat patients struck by coronavirus, his colleague has said. Dr Venkat Sundaram, the clinical lead for intensive care at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, flew to India several weeks ago to visit his sick father who has since died. The coronavirus pandemic has left him unable to find a flight home so his colleagues want the UK and Welsh governments to help him get back. Dr Dafydd Williams, an intensive care registrar at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff who worked with Dr Sundaram for 18 months, said: âHeâs the clinical lead for intensive care at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, so heâs needed back here. âICU consultants are going to be delivering the front line services to patients, but as a clinical lead he will also be crucial to planning the intensive care capacity and response. âWeâre asking for the UK and Welsh governments to urgently work with the Indian government to get him home.â Earlier, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said tens of thousands of Britons stranded abroad would be flown home under a new arrangement between the government and airlines.

grass fires as the world tackles the coronavirus pandemic is depressing, a manager for the Woodland
Trust has said. On Wednesday Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service took two hours to extinguish a large grass fire which had been deliberately
started at the truist's Coed Maesmelin site near Skewen, Neath. Site Manager for the
Woodland Trust Chris Matts said: âItâs so depressing to think that, at this
moment of national crisis, anyone would wish to do such a thing.â He said a large area
of open ground has burned, destroying the eggs of ground nesting birds and
causing huge harm to voles and other wildlife including small mammals,
amphibians and reptiles. Fire
crews across Wales have dealt with a number of deliberately-started grass
fires over the past few weeks. Coronavirus has left many stranded abroad with no flights home. These people from Wales tell their stories.

Italian restaurant chainCarluccio's has gone into
administration, blaming ""challenging trading conditions"" made
worse by the coronavirus outbreak. Administrator FRP is ""urgently looking at options"" for
the future of the firm, which has two restaurants in Cardiff. These include mothballing the business using government support,
as well as trying to sell all or parts of it. Most of the company's 2,000 employees will be paid through the
government's job retention scheme while these options are explored. This allows for staff to be paid up to 80% of their salary. Earlier today,BrightHouse - the UK's largest rent-to-own household goods chain- went into administration, putting 2,400 jobs at risk. Dame Shirley Bassey has a challenge for everyone. ""Try holding the last line of Goldfinger for 20 seconds whilst washing your hands if you dare!"" she posted on Facebook.

A doctor talks about juggling work and family life with nursery closures. The health board for north Wales has said it is increasing bed numbers at three of its hospitals to
care for patients with Covid-19. Betsi
Cadwaladr University Health Board said work was also under way to
develop field hospitals away from its main sites to further increase the
number of beds available. It
said construction work had begun to install an additional 80 beds at Glan Clwyd
Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire. The board said more than 200 people had expressed an interest in joining its staff. More than 1,100 employees currently in non-clinical areas have also joined a
database of staff who can be redeployed to support clinical areas when needed, it added. The Welsh Ambulance Service has responded to criticism over its use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Earlier on Monday the GMB union said its members had reported being given no access to PPE, even when being sent to treat patients suspected of having Covid-19.

Thanks
for following all the latest updates with us. Here are some of the most noteworthy developments of the day:   What else did the US president say? Wrapping up an almost hour-long briefing, Donald Trump said while a nationwide stay at home order had been discussed, such a measure would be ""pretty unlikely"". ""If we do that we will let you know,"" he said, adding that the order would be ""tough"" to enforce. Asked why the US remained behind countries like South Korea in terms of the testing rate per capita, Trump said he should be congratulated on his administration's progress - and repeated earlier comments that the US is testing faster than any other country. The president also doubled down on assertions from Sunday that states were ""hoarding"" critical medical supplies.  Trump says he thinks the US will be in ""very good shape"" supplying states with ventilators and other medical supplies by the time the outbreak ""peaks"" in two weeks. ""We have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators and we say go ahead,"" he said at his daily White House press briefing. Some states ""are ramping up to a level that they're not going to have to"", he added. Trump yesterday accused governors of ""hoarding"" critical medical equipment.  The vicar for the diocese of Rome, Angelo De Donatis, has
tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first known Catholic cardinal to
do so. The 66-year-old was admitted to hospital in Rome
after falling ill with Covid-19 symptoms. Cardinal De Donatis, who was reported to be in a good condition,
said he felt âcalm and confidentâ in a statement on Monday. It is not clear if the cardinal has had any contract with
Pope Francis recently. Pope Francis appointed De Donatis to preside over the diocese
as the vicar of Rome in 2017. On Saturday, the pope said neither he nor his closest aides
have tested positive for coronavirus. Watch our video ofPope Francis giving a solitary prayer service to an empty St Peter's Square last week. The cardinal was admitted to hospital with a fever Medical equipment shortages have been a key issue across the US. President Trump says private companies working with the government are soon going to outpace the nation's needs. He says 8,100 ventilators have been sent out thus far. Four hundred more are going to Michigan, 300 to New Jersey, 150 to Illinois, 150 to Louisiana, 50 to Connecticut. He says the government has distributed to date millions of masks, face shields, surgical gowns and gloves. Mr Trump adds that the Ford Motor Company will be producing 50,000 new ventilators and doing so ""in less than 100 days"". Nine other companies are also working on ventilator production. ""As we outpace what we need, we'll be sending them to Italy, we're going to be sending them to France, we're going to be sending them to Spain where they have tremendous problems,"" Mr Trump added. The president says the US will specifically be ""sending $100m-worth of things - surgical and medical and hospital things - to Italy"".  Addressing the US mask shortage, President Trump says new equipment to sanitise masks will be sent out to the regional hotspots. Each mask can be disinfected 20 times and the new machine can take on 120,000 masks per day, Mr Trump says. Two disinfecting machines are now in Ohio; one is in New York City; two more are being shipped to Washington DC and Seattle. Back at the White House press conference, the US has tested a million people for Covid-19, officials say. President Trump also unveils Abbott labs' new ""highly accurate"" five-minute test. He unboxes one of the new kits at the briefing. Dr Stephen Hahn, the US drug agency commissioner, says Abbott worked with the government to deliver these new tests quickly. Dr Hahn also says other labs are continuing to scale up the production of tests and sending them out to states. USA Rugby, the national body for rugby union the US, has filed for bankruptcy amid ""insurmountable financial constraints"" due to the coronavirus pandemic. Chairwoman Barbara O'Brien said this was ""the most challenging period this organisation has faced"". ""While the current climate is of course much larger than rugby, we remain focused with stakeholders and supporters in the continued effort toward a balanced rugby community where the game can truly grow,"" she added. In a statement on its website, USA Rugby said World Rugby is financially helping them navigate the bankruptcy process. The men's and women's US national teams will start playing again after the pandemic is over, the organisation added. The LA Sevens were held earlier this month President Donald Trump is now speaking at the White House. He begins the daily briefing today by emphasising that following official rules will help curb the spread of Covid-19. ""By very vigorously following the guidelines we could save more than one million American lives"", he says, adding these decisions will ""determine the fate of this virus and the fate of our victory"". He called on all Americans to do their part, saying this was a shared patriotic duty. ""Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days and these are a very vital 30 days we're sort of putting it all on the line."" People have criticised Las Vegas authorities for turning a car park into an outdoor sleeping area for homeless people. Photos of people lying on the ground in painted white boxes - one person per space - have gone viral on social media, with some users questioning why the homeless people weren't put up in the city's hotels, which have been closed. But officials have praised the makeshift sleeping area. Lisa Morris Hibbler, chief community services officer for the city of Las Vegas,told local CBS-affiliate 8 News Now,externalthat the boxes were ""spaced so that they're social distancing"". According to US media, the area was set up as a last-minute makeshift area for the city's homeless community after someone in one of the main shelters tested positive for coronavirus.

US President Donald Trump and his Covid-19 task force are due to update the nation on the virus outbreak in a few minutes. The daily briefing comes as more states have ordered residents to stay at home and medical workers across the nation continue to plead for more equipment. There are now 156,931 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US and 2,945 deaths, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. New York remains the nation's epicentre, accounting for at least 790 coronavirus-related deaths. Air Canada - the country's largest airline - will temporarily lay off more than 15,000 workers this week, the Canadian Press reports. The airline has already announced it would lay off 5,150 flight attendants and has put 600 of its 4,400 pilots on unpaid leave as the company struggles to stay afloat amid border closures and travel cancellations prompted by the outbreak of Covid-19. Calgary-based WestJet announced last week that 6,900 employees would be laid off. The airline said that 90% of those lay offs were voluntary. In the US, major airlines United and Delta have so far avoided lay offs, first asking thousands of thousands of employees to take unpaid leave, or early retirement plans. Both will be beneficiaries of the $2tn (Â£1.7tn) aid bill signed by Donald Trump this week, though industry executives have warned the boost may not be enough to see the crisis through. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will remain in self-quarantine despite testing negative for coronavirus for a third time, a government spokesperson says. Mrs Merkel, 65, started working from home after her doctor tested positive for coronavirus on 22 March. She had received a vaccination against pneumonia from the doctor a few days earlier. On Thursday night a government spokesperson said Mrs Merkel would continue to work from home for a few more days. Other world leaders have been self-isolating, including UKPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who has tested positive for Covid-19. Mrs Merkel has had three tests for coronavirus, all of which have proved negative Liberty University, an evangelical Christian institution in Lynchburg, Virginia, has pushed back againsta New York Times article,externalthat says nearly a dozen students are now sick with Covid-19 symptoms after the school allowed spring breakers to return to campus. As of Monday, the Times says one student has tested positive. The university's president, Jerry Falwell Jr, made the decision to welcome thousands of students back last week, telling Fox News that people were over-reacting to the pandemic. The institutionissued a response,externalon Sunday saying the article was ""misleading"" and it was not aware of ""any students in its residence halls testing positive for Covid-19, or in fact, being tested at all"". Liberty said four students had been asked to self-quarantine after returning from the New York City area, and that some students who did not live on campus had reported symptoms. Amid the row, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam on Monday issued a stay at home order lasting until 10 June. The order also mandates all higher education institutions to end in-person classes - which local media say may be due to Liberty's policy. Another 418 people have died of the coronavirus in France - the highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period. The total death toll is now 3,024, although French officials only count those who die in hospitals. A total of 44,550 people in France have now tested positive for Covid-19 - an 11% rise from yesterday. The country has been in lockdown since 17 March. The coronavirus pandemic has become a global health crisis
affecting at least 177 countries. The total number of confirmed cases globally
surged above 750,000 on Monday, a grim new milestone for a disease that was
first detected in one Chinese city around four months ago. Given the global scale of the health emergency, it is difficult
to comprehend how Covid-19 has proliferated so quickly. To help you make sense of the pandemic, you canread our visual guide, which includes maps and charts with the latest data on deaths, cases and
recoveries. There are a total of 22,141 confirmed infections and 1,408 deaths from coronavirus
in the UK, according to the latest figures from Public Health England. Most of those cases are concentrated in England, where London,
the West Midlands and the South East are the worst-affected regions. The number of infections may be far greater because not
everyone who suspects they have contracted the virus has been tested. To see how many cases there are where you live,you can enter your postcode, council or NHS area in our search tool. Ferdinand OmondiBBC News, Nairobi Sales of fresh fish in Kenya have risen as imports from China have dropped amid the coronavirus pandemic. Sellers in Dunga Beach on the shores of Lake Victoria report a jump in trade of about 40% over two weeks. ""The fishermen are really now smiling at the Lake Victoria region because we are receiving more visitors. Dunga is really crowded with a lot of the residents of Kisumu coming to buy the fresh fish because people fear the Chinese boxed fish due to the coronavirus,"" says Maurice Misodhi, a fisherman and leader at the Dunga Beach Management Unit. Cargo from China is allowed to enter Kenya but only on condition that vessels are fumigated at the point of exit. Local fish costs about twice as much as frozen fish from China, of which Kenya imported more than $23m (Â£19m) worth in 2018. Chinese fish used to make up about 50% of the market. But the scarcity of Chinese fish isnât good news for everyone. Caroline Ochieng, a fish seller, says she is struggling to make a decent profit because Chinese fish is cheaper than local lake fish. ""That is the reason we want the Chinese fish to be in supply as well as that from our own lake - so that as we do business we don't feel the burden."" Before the coronavirus outbreak, local fishermen complained that cheap imports harmed local trade so much that they often resorted to eating their catch themselves or giving much of it away. There are worries that local fishermen wonât be able to keep up with new demand for fresh fish. But for now at least, they are making the most of the surge in trade. Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter More than 47 million Americans could lose their jobs in the next three months, pushing the US unemployment rate above 32%. Thatâs according to arecent analysis by the Federal Reserve,external, which describes it as a âback-of-the-envelopeâ calculation. However, the heavy economic cost is already clear, with a record 3.28 million Americans filing for unemployment last week. Those numbers are expected to rise. In just one example, US department store Macyâs on Monday, said it had placed most of its 130,000 workers on unpaid leave, citing the loss of âthe majority of our salesâ. It said it would continue to pay for staff health
 insurance until the end of May. UK politicians have been reacting to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab's announcement thatthe government will work with commercial airlinesto help British nationals stranded abroad get back home. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said it was ""more of the same... more reliance on commercial flights which - for too many British travellers based in too many locations - are simply not an option at present"". She called for ""a fresh, comprehensive and fully-funded strategy to bring our British nationals home... that is not what we got today, and that is not good enough"". Lib Dem leader Ed Davey welcomed the foreign secretary's words but said ""questions remain about why this announcement has taken so long"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"20,000 former NHS staff return to fight virus - PMIn a video posted online, Boris Johnson says the UK can get through the pandemic ""together"".UK","Boris Johnson tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week Some 20,000 former NHS staff have returned to work to help the fight against coronavirus, Boris Johnson has revealed in a video posted online. The prime minister, who is self-isolating after testing positive for the virus, said the country would get through the crisis ""together"". It comes after England's deputy chief medical officersaid it could be six months before life returns to ""normal"". The number of people who have died with the virus in the UK has reached 1,228. Among those to have died isAmged El-Hawrani, a 55-year-old ear, nose and throat consultant at Queen's Hospital Burton. And last week an organ transplant consultant diedafter testing positive for the virus. Prof Andrew Goddard, the head of the Royal College of Physicians, said ""about one in four"" of its workforce was currently off work, either with symptoms or isolating because family members have symptoms. ""I've got lots of colleagues sitting at home... They themselves don't have symptoms and are chomping at the bit to try and get back to work,"" he said, adding that widespread testing would mean staff who are well can return to work. TheUK government saidit was ramping up testing of NHS frontline workers. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW GUIDANCE:What must I do? NEW RESTRICTIONS:What are they? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Labour has called on the government to scale up testing to ""sufficient levels"", giving the example of Germany, which is reportedly testing up to 500,000 people a week. It comes after confusion over the number of tests being carried out, after ministers said the government had hit its target of 10,000 tests a day at the weekend. But care minister Helen Whately said on Monday that, while there was capacity to carry out 10,000 tests, the actual number tested was more like 7,000. PHE said the number of people tested may be lower because some people use more than one test. NHS workers are being tested for the virus at a temporary drive-through centre in the car park of Chessington World of Adventures, Surrey Key workers - including NHS, care staff and transport workers - are still allowed to travel to work Meanwhile, the prime minister has continued to lead the country's response to the pandemic while self-isolating in his Downing Street flat. On Monday, a No 10 source confirmed Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, has developed symptoms of the virus and was self-isolating at home. In the PM's video,which he posted on Twitter,external, he contradicted the view of Conservative prime minister from 1979-1990, Margaret Thatcher, that ""there is no such thing as society"".

Thanking the doctors, nurses and other former professionals who have returned to the NHS, as well as the 750,000 members of the public who have volunteered to help the country through the pandemic, he said: ""We are going to do it, we are going to do it together. ""One thing I think the coronavirus crisis has already proved is that there really is such a thing as society."" In pictures: Daily life with the coronavirus Mr Johnson said the public appeared to be obeying the restrictions set out by government to slow the spread of the virus, adding that train use was down 95% and bus use down 75%. Police officers from North Yorkshire Police stop motorists in cars to check that their travel is ""essential"" Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London andauthor of a report into the pandemic,told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were ""some early signs of slowing in some indicators"" in the UK. ""If we look at the number of new hospital admissions per day for instance, that does appear to be slowing down a little bit now. It's not yet plateaued, so the numbers can be increasing each day, but the rate of increase has slowed."" Asked how many people may have been infected in the UK, Prof Ferguson said it varied across the country. ""(In) Central London it could be as many as 3% to 5% of the population has been infected, maybe more in individual hotspots. In the country as a whole, the UK, maybe 2% or 3%.""

What are ventilators and how do they work?,"The government has said it will buy thousands of ventilators to help ease the pressure on hospitals caused by the coronavirus crisis. For patients with the worst effects of the infection, a ventilator can offer the best chance of survival. Simply put, a ventilator takes over the body's breathing process when disease has caused the lungs to fail. This gives the patient time to fight off the infection and recover. Various types of medical ventilation can be used. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), some 80% of people with Covid-19 - the disease caused by coronavirus - recover without needing hospital treatment. But one person in six becomes seriously ill. In these severe cases, the virus causes damage to the lungs, causing the body's oxygen levels to drop and making it harder to breathe. To alleviate this, a ventilator is used to push air, with increased levels of oxygen, into the lungs. The ventilator also has a humidifier, which adds heat and moisture to the air supply so it matches the patient's body temperature. Patients are given medication to relax the respiratory muscles so their breathing can be fully regulated by the machine. All medical ventilation requires close supervision from trained staff People with milder symptoms may be given ventilation using facemasks, nasal masks or mouthpieces which allow air or an oxygen mixture to be pushed into the lungs. This is known as ""non-invasive"" ventilation, as no internal tubes are required. Another form of ventilation - continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP - keeps a patient's airways continuously open, Early reports from Lombardy in northern Italy suggest about 50% of patients given CPAP have avoided the need for full mechanical ventilation. A type of CPAP ventilation using a hood, where pressurised oxygen is pumped in via a valve, reduces the risk of airborne transmission of the virus. Oxygen hoods reduce the risk of disease transmission Intensive Care Units (ICUs) would generally put patients suffering acute respiratory distress on mechanical ventilation quickly, to ensure oxygen levels in the body stay normal. However Dr Shondipon Laha, from the Intensive Care Society, told the BBC that unless they become seriously ill, most patients with Covid-19 would not need a mechanical ventilator and could be treated at home or with supplementary oxygen. Although there were risks when using ventilators, such as not knowing who would suffer long-term effects, he said, sometimes a ventilator was ""the only way of getting oxygen into the patient"". Another issue, Dr Laha explained, was having enough trained staff to operate the ventilators correctly. The UK is understood to currently have about 10,000 ventilators having added to the previous stock of just over 8,000 by increasing production and sourcing other machines from overseas. A number of ventilatorshave also been acquired from private hospitals. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the country needs 18,000 machines for when the virus peaks, down from an original estimate of 30,000. Mr Hancock told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on 5 April that projected demand had come down because social distancing measures were working. The exact type of extra ventilators needed, and who makes them, is still being finalised. The delay is linked to a changing understanding of how to treat patients requiring ventilation,external, according to the Financial Times. The Smiths ParaPac ventilator is designed to be easily transported A consortium of UK manufacturers is leading efforts to produce a version of a machine built by Oxfordshire company Penlon. On 16 April, it was announced that the Penlon Prima ESO2 devices had been approved and thathundreds are expected to be built for hospitals over the next week. By the start of May, it is hoped that 1,500 a week will be made. As part of that same initiative, the first ventilators - portable ParaPac devices from Luton-based firm Smiths - have been delivered to wards over the last few days. The consortium includes Airbus, Rolls Royce and a number of Formula One racing teams. A separate machine being designed and built from scratch by Dyson is also being considered by the government. Production of other types of non-invasive ventilator is also being scaled up, with a government order of some 10,000 VenturaCPAP devicesdesigned by University College London Engineers with industry partners Mercedes-AMG-HPP.

"Regional connectivity at risk, says airline boss","EasyJet has grounded its entire fleet of planes and said it cannot give a date for when they will restart. The budget airline said it had made the move due to the ""unprecedented travel restrictions"" imposed by governments globally due to the virus pandemic. It had already cancelled most services but had been running rescue flights to repatriate Britons stranded abroad. ""We will continue to work with government bodies to operate additional rescue flights as requested,"" it said. EasyJet has flown 650 rescue flights so far taking 45,000 people home. The move came as regional airline Loganair said airlines were unlikely to survive without a government bailout. The pandemic has had a severe impact on airlines, Loganair boss Jonathan Hinkles told the BBC's Tom Burridge. He said that any airline saying it could survive without government help ""would probably be lying"". EasyJet said its cabin crew would be furloughed, with staff paid 80% of their wage from 1 April through the government's job retention scheme. The airline's boss, Johan Lundgren, said he was ""working tirelessly"" to make sure the airline was ""well positioned to overcome the challenges of coronavirus"". ""I am extremely proud of the way in which people across EasyJet have given their absolute best at such a challenging time,"" he added. EasyJet's headquarters are at London Luton Airport and it has 331 planes. In normal times, it serves 159 airports and 1,051 routes. Mr Lundgren said the airline had operated its last rescue flight on Sunday 29 March, but would continue to offer further rescue flights ""as requested"". If your flight has been cancelled you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days under EU air passengers' rights rules. But getting your cash may prove tricky as the airline - along with British Airways - has removed the usual option where passengers would be sent a link that took them to the booking and they could request their money back online within seconds. Instead many airlines are trying to persuade passengers to take vouchers instead. To get your money back you'll have to phone the airline. EasyJet told the BBC: ""Customers on cancelled flights can transfer to an alternative flight free of charge or receive a voucher for the value of their booking online or claim a refund through our contact centre. ""We are experiencing higher than average wait times so we would thank customers for their patience and assure them that these entitlements will be available long after their cancelled flight has flown."" The vast bulk offlights to and from the UK have been groundeddue to travel restrictions imposed to control the spread of coronavirus, with many airlines expected to seek government help to survive. Virgin Atlantic has already indicated thatit will seek a bailoutand other airlines are expected to follow suit. The government has said it will only step in to help struggling airlines ""as a last resort"" on a case-by-case basis. But industry group the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned of an ""apocalypse"" in the aviation sector as it urged governments around the world to help. Easyjet said on Monday it would not need a bailout. ""We have no plans currently to ask the government for bespoke support as outlined by the chancellor,"" it said. However, it added: ""To support recovery in the future, we believe that further actions will be needed such as a temporary removal of Aviation Passenger Duty and Air Traffic Control Charges."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do i protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Loganair's Mr Hinkles warned that the connectivity of remote Scottish islands and rural communities across the UK ""cannot be maintained without air services"", arguing that government support for his airline was ""essential"". Loganair operates routes to the UK's most remote airports such as Barra in the Outer Hebrides, and it is still ferrying people, mail and essential goods, such as pharmaceutical products, out to about 15 island airports. Nevertheless, the Scottish carrier has had to ground half of its fleet and dramatically slash its flying schedule. This has put its entire operation in jeopardy. ""We can't just shut down"", Mr Hinkles said. ""Morally, we have to fly."" Loganair operates routes to the UK's most remote airports All airlines have called for additional support measures from the government to weather the storm. The industry group Airlines UK and the Airport Operators Association haveasked the governmentto cover air traffic control charges and payments to the Civil Aviation Authority until the end of this year. Airlines also want a six-month suspension of the Air Passenger Duty tax, which brings in Â£3bn every year to the Treasury. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said that the aviation sector is ""important to the UK economy"". They added: ""We are willing to consider the situation of individual firms, so long as all other government schemes have been explored and all commercial options exhausted, including raising capital from existing investors.""
