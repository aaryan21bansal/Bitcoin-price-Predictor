South Africa celebrates world cup win over England,"This video can not be played ""Amazing!"": South Africa rugby fans go wild at World Cup win South Africans have been celebrating after their rugby team beat England 32-12 in the world cup final in Japan. The victory under Siya Kolisi, the team's first black captain, was another symbolic moment for the Springboks. In 1995, former President Nelson Mandela famously celebrated on the podium with captain Francois Pienaar after their first world cup win. This is the third time that the Springboks have won the trophy equalling New Zealand's record. Andrew Harding: World Cup win a reminder of country's change The 'unique story' of South Africa's first black captain At the final whistle, fans at a public viewing centre in South Africa's main city Johannesburg were chanting Kolisi's name, the BBC's Milton Nkosi reports. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, who was in Japan for the final, tweeted: ""We are the champions."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Milton Nkosi, BBC News, Johannesburg People have been screaming chanting and singing, bringing back the spirit of 1995 when South Africa won the world cup for the very first time. And today, they are chanting captain Siya Kolisi's name. There will be celebrations here long into the night - across townships, cities and villages - because this win is not just on the pitch, it is not just about rugby. It is about the social cohesion that the country is still trying to achieve 25 years after the end of apartheid. This brings the whole nation together particularly in light of the sluggish economy, the unemployment rate is nearly 30%, and corruption has also become a high profile problem. But the victory will lift people's spirits and allow them for one day to forget their ills. South Africans have been tweeting their reaction. One fan, in Johannesburg, can be heard screaming with joy above the sound of vuvuzelas, or horns, being played in the neighbourhood. Allow Twitter content?

On Friday, there was a stark reminder from the economic ratings agency Moody's that all is not well, when it cut the outlook on its credit rating from stable to negative. Earlier in the week, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni painted a bleak picture of rising debt levels and floundering state-owned enterprises. The latest unemployment figure offers no relief. Data released on Tuesday show that 29.1% of the working-age population are jobless - the highest rate in 16 years. President Cyril Ramaphosa celebrated in Japan with the Springboks President Ramaphosa came to power in February last year promising a change from the economic problems and corruption that dogged his predecessor Jacob Zuma's presidency. But he has struggled to turn things around. Despite a burgeoning black middle class, the economic inequalities that apartheid entrenched live on, 25 years after its demise. Land ownership remains a major issue with the white minority still owning a disproportionate amount. The governing ANC has pledged to deal with this, but it is not yet clear how. Mr Ramaphosa will hope that the nation can be inspired by the Springbok captain's words, but come Sunday morning South Africans will still face these problems.

A reminder of country's change,"South Africans have been celebrating the country's third World Cup trophy win Across South Africa, they've been blowing their vuvuzelas, hugging, crying, grinning until it hurts, honking their car horns, pouring and throwing and spraying beer in all directions. They are celebrating a comprehensive victory that seems all the sweeter for being set against a backdrop of economic hardship, rising inequality, populist race-baiting, staggering official corruption and serious concerns about this young, boisterous nation's future. ""We can achieve anything if we work together as one,"" said Siya Kolisi, South Africa's now iconic black captain after the match in Japan. And in bars, homes, halls, and giant open-air public viewing areas, his words seemed - at least for a moment - to ring true. ""I have never seen, since I've been alive, I have never seen South Africa like this,"" Kolisi went on, and back home the crowds, black and white, nodded and cheered. South Africa celebrates world cup win over England I want to inspire every kid - Kolisi ""I'm so happy!"" screamed a black schoolgirl jumping for joy with her friends at a sports centre in a suburb of Johannesburg. ""We've gone through so much as a country and this is something positive we can celebrate as a country,"" said a woman watching at a luxury resort outside the city. ""I feel this win will reunite us as a country. We've been segregated, with so much going on. So this win means so much,"" said her friend. Today's squad has twelve black players and is a truly national team South Africa has always cherished its reputation for pulling off miracles. After all, this was the nation that steered itself away from civil war and plotted a negotiated path out of racial apartheid towards democracy. A year later, in 1995, a smiling Nelson Mandela watched the national team win its first Rugby World Cup and used that moment to build on his dream of a ""rainbow nation"". But the 1995 team had just one black player and many black South Africans struggled to share the enthusiasm of Mandela, and of their white compatriots so soon after the end of apartheid. Today's squad has twelve black players and has become a truly national team. This video can not be played ""Amazing!"": South Africa rugby fans go wild at World Cup win ""We have come a long way from 1995 to where we are today. We are demonstrating to the world that we are a diverse and united nation,"" said President Cyril Ramaphosa, who had gone to Japan to be with the Springbok team. And there were other signs of South Africa's progress on display today. Not just a black captain and a diverse squad, but smaller details like the fact that so many more whites in the crowd now appear to have learned the words to their multi-lingual national anthem - bellowing out all the African verses in the minutes before the match began. Fans have described the Springboks' win as something positive for the country But can success in a rugby competition transform a nation's fortunes? Of course not. South Africans are all too aware that, come Monday, their economy will still be on the brink of being downgraded to junk status by international ratings agencies. Youth unemployment will remain around the 50% mark. The power utility Eskom will continue to deliver blackouts as it hovers dangerously close to collapse. And the racial polarisation that has become entrenched in the country's political scene will carry on. ""No we're not (united),"" said one of several voices on Twitter, responding to President Ramaphosa's message. ""Only our rugby team is a beacon of hope in the dark and dismal chaos that the ANC created and which you perpetuate.""

Amazon land defender shot dead by illegal loggers,"Paulo Paulino Guajajara worked to combat logging gangs in the Amazon A young indigenous land defender has been shot dead and another wounded by illegal loggers in Brazil's Amazon. Paulo Paulino Guajajara was reportedly attacked and shot in the head while hunting on Friday inside the Arariboia reservation in Maranhao state. He was a member of Guardians of the Forest, a group formed to combat logging gangs in the area. The killing increases concerns about escalating violence against Amazon forest protectors. Non-profit group Survival International, which advocates for isolated communities, says at least three Guardians have previously been killed, along with many of their relatives. In September, an official who had worked to protect indigenous peoplewas murdered in the city of Tabatinga. Brazil's populist President Jair Bolsonaro has drawn intense domestic and international criticism for failing to protect the Guardians' territory in the eastern Amazon region. Brazil's indigenous people: 'We fight for the right to exist' Bolsonaro: What are his policies? He has often stated support for farmers and loggers working in the area, while criticising environmental campaigners and slashing the budget of the Brazil's environmental agency. Brazil's justice minister SÃ©rgio Moro said federal police were investigating the incident. ""We will spare no effort to bring those responsible for this serious crime to justice,"" he tweeted. Authorities say he was shot in the head during an ambush by illegal loggers who had invaded the reservation. Paulo Paulino Guajajara holds a gun during a search for illegal loggers in September Another indigenous man, Tainaky Tenetehar, was injured in the attack. Brazilian police said one of the loggers was also killed in a subsequent shootout. Brazil's pan-indigenous organization APIB said Paulo Paulino Guajajara's body was still lying in the forest where he was gunned down. The APIB, which represents many of Brazil's 900,000 indigenous people, said Mr Bolsonaro's government had serious questions to answer. ""The Bolsonaro government has indigenous blood on its hands,"" it said in a statement. The killing increases concerns about escalating violence against Amazon forest protectors. ""The increase in violence in indigenous territories is a direct result of his hateful speeches and steps taken against our people."" The land defender, who was in his late twenties and had a son, was a Guajajara leader. The young man leaves behind a son The Guajajaras are one of Brazil's largest indigenous groups with some 20,000 people. In 2012, they started the Guardians of the Forest to protect the Arariboia Indigenous Territory. ""I'm scared at times, but we have to lift up our heads and act. We are here fighting,"" he told Reuters news agency this year. ""There is so much destruction of nature happening, good trees with wood as hard as steel being cut down and taken away,"" he added. ""We have to preserve this life for our children's future.""

Sturgeon: Scotland's future 'must be in our hands',"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland at a ""crossroads moment"" Thousands of independence supporters have heard Nicola Sturgeon call for ""Scotland's future to be put into Scotland's hands"". The first minister told a major rally in Glasgow the time would come to break away from the ""chaos of Westminster"" in a second independence poll next year. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said a new Scottish independence referendum was not ""desirable or necessary"". The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats also oppose a further vote. Ms Sturgeon was one of a number of SNP politicians and independence campaigners to speak at the #indyref2020 rally in George Square. It was thefirst time she had spoken at an independence rally since 2014. The event prompted a counter demonstration by dozens of unionist supporters who waved flags and blew whistles as supporters of Scottish independence gathered. The SNP leader focused on the UK-wide election on 12 December at the event, which was organised byThe National newspaper,external. She has made it clear thatshe wants to hold a poll on the issue next yearand said the general election was a ""crossroads moment"" for Scotland. Ms Sturgeon told the pro-indy crowds: ""Over the next few weeks, it is our job to convince everyone we know to come out on December the 12th and send the biggest, loudest most resounding message to Westminster. ""That it is time for Scotland to choose our own future. It is time for Scotland to be an independent country. ""An independent country that will be the best of friends and family with our neighbours across the British Isles, across Europe and across the world."" Ministers urged to agree indyref2 question test Election 2019: Questions facing Scotland's parties FMQs: Rolling out the red carpet for indyref2? The first minister told the crowd the general election was ""the most important election for Scotland in our lifetimes"". ""The future of our country is on the line,"" she said. ""And there is no doubt whatsoever that Scotland stands at a crossroads moment."" There were boos from the audience when she claimed a victory for Boris Johnson in the election would result in ""a future where Scotland gets ripped out of our European family of nations against our will, a future where the UK turns in on itself, a future of a hostile environment for migrants"". Instead, she said, there was ""a much better alternative"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""That alternative is not a UK Labour government that can't event make up its mind where it stands on the question of Brexit."" The first minister's speech came after she confirmed that she would send a letter ""before Christmas"" to whoever is in 10 Downing Street, requesting the Scottish Parliament is granted powers to hold another independence referendum. The indyref2020 rally prompted a counter-demonstration by pro-unionists Asked whether she believed Labour would grant the Section 30 order, Ms Sturgeon answered: ""Yes"". ""If people in Scotland demonstrate the desire - as I believe they will in this election - for an independence referendum, then I don't believe Westminster opposition to the principle or to the timetable to that will prove sustainable,"" she said. In response, Jeremy Corbyn said only a Labour government would be able to boost Scotland's economy and see ""the levels of poverty in Scotland, particularly in the big cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee, being reduced"". An unconventional piper joined the pro-independence crowds in George Square He added: ""Scottish independence would mean a massive gap between what Scotland raises in taxation and what the Scottish people need at the present time. ""I think the much better option is a Labour government for the whole of the UK."" A really simple guide to the UK general election How late can you register to vote in a general election? The Tories criticised Nicola Sturgeon for prioritising indyref2 ""above all else"". Scottish Conservative MSP for Glasgow, Annie Wells, said: ""While Nicola Sturgeon is banging on about indyref2, I'm out talking to people about the state of their local schools, the drug deaths crisis and violent crime taking over our streets, and the problems at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. ""Instead of tackling the day-to-day things that Glaswegians care about, Nicola Sturgeon is headlining a nationalist rally. ""So this election is about stopping Nicola Sturgeon from dividing our communities all over again, and only a vote for the Scottish Conservatives will do that.""

"Musician reunited with Â£250,000 violin in car park","Stephen Morris was handed back his violin in a Waitrose car park A 310-year-old violin worth Â£250,000 that was left on a train in south London has been returned to its owner. The instrument was handed over to professional musician Stephen Morris in a supermarket car park in Beckenham after secret negotiations. Plain-clothes police officers attended in case the handover went wrong, as the man who had the violin said he had made a mistake and apologised. Mr Morris said having the violin back had not yet ""sunk in"". This video can not be played Mr Morris on the ""shock"" of getting back his violin ""I feel a bit battered and bruised,"" he said. ""I haven't had a great deal of sleep since it went missing,"" adding that he would have a beer to celebrate. The violin, which was made by master craftsman David Tecchler in 1709, was left on the London to Orpington train on 22 October when Mr Morris got out at Penge East with his bike. Stephen Morris had said losing the instrument was like ""having my arm cut off"" The 51-year-old from Sydenham, who has played on film scores including The Lord of the Rings and James Bond and recorded with David Bowie and Steve Wonder, was distraught. British Transport Police (BTP) later released a CCTV image of a man believed to have taken the violin as the train approached Bromley South and asked him to get in touch, sparking appeals on social media. The violin, pictured here, had recently been restored The breakthrough came on Thursday when Mr Morris received a direct Twitter message, which read: ""I recognise the person in the picture.  I think it may be somebody I know - I'd like to be of help. I know what it's like to leave valuables on a train."" Over the next 24 hours further contact was made with the person who had sent the message - it's suspected that he was in fact the individual who had taken the violin. Calling himself ""Gene"", which was not his real name, the man agreed to meet Mr Morris on Friday evening at a Waitrose car park near Beckenham train station. In an operation co-ordinated by the musician's friend and former police officer, Mike Pannett, a team of plain-clothes officers were placed on stand-by. ""Mike was the engine room for the whole thing,"" said Mr Morris. The violin is marked with Tecchler's name Shortly after 22:10 BST, the police team watched as ""Gene"", in his mid to late 20s, approached Mr Morris, shook his hand and transferred a holdall containing the violin. ""He was very apologetic, he said he wanted to hand it to me in person,"" he said. The violin and bows were intact and ""in tune"". ""It couldn't have ended in a happier way,"" Mr Morris said BTP said it would be taking no further action against the man because he had taken reasonable steps to contact the violin owner and had handed it back. Det Ch Insp Phil Briggs said the message from the start had been ""please return it"". ""It was a gentlemanly exchange with the victim,"" he said.

Blast kills nine children as they walk to school,"More than 1,100 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan from July 1 until September 30 (file picture) Nine children have been killed in a roadside blast in north-eastern Afghanistan as they made their way to school. The children - eight boys and a girl aged between seven and 10 - accidentally stepped on a deliberately-planted mine, officials said. So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the bomb. Last month, the UN said 1,174 Afghan civilians had been killed in the three months until the end of September. More than 3,000 people have also been injured over this period, the UN said. A month of killing in Afghanistan The Afghan war: The short and long story ""At 8.30am (04:00 GMT) this morning, tragically, nine school children were martyred in a landmine blast,"" Jawad Hejri, a spokesman for the Takhar provincial governor, told AFP news agency. He alleged that the roadside device had been planted by the Taliban, which had taken control of Takhar Province for several weeks before Afghan forces recently regained control. The militants routinely plant roadside devices as they leave a district in the hope of targeting advancing security forces. The Taliban has not responded to a request for comment on the incident. Last May, a landmine killed seven children and wounded two more in the southern province of Ghazni. In February, seven children were killed and 10 more wounded in Laghman province when a mortar shell exploded as they played with it.

"Airbnb bans 'party houses' after mass shooting""We must do better,"" rental company CEO says after mass shooting at unauthorised California party.US & Canada","Contra Costa County search and rescue officers approach the property in Orinda Airbnb has said it will ban ""party houses"" after a mass shooting at a California home rented through the company left five people dead. CEO Brian Chesky said in a tweet the company would take steps to ""combat unauthorized parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct"". ""We must do better, and we will. This is unacceptable,"" Mr Chesky added. Three people died at the house, in the city of Orinda, near San Francisco, and two more died later in hospital. The house was reportedly booked under a pretence for a small group, before being publicised on Instagram as the venue for a Halloween party which eventually drew a crowd of more than 100 people. The host did not authorise the party, Airbnb said. All of those who died were under 30. The fifth victim died in hospital on Friday night. By Saturday, police had not arrested or identified any suspects. Officers said they found two guns at the house. Mr Chesky said Airbnb would create a dedicated ""party house"" rapid response team and expand manual screening of high-risk reservations. The company, which is expected to float on the stock market in 2020, would also take action against users who violated its policies, he said. Allow Twitter content?

"Trump says Beto O'Rourke 'quit like a dog'The US Democratic presidential hopeful, a fierce Trump critic, ended his campaign on Friday.","This video can not be played President Trump mocked Beto O'Rourke at a rally in Mississippi US President Donald Trump has ridiculed Beto O'Rourke just hours after the Democratic presidential hopeful ended his campaign. The president used a profanity to describe his rival and said he ""quit like a dog"". Mr O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, was highly critical of Mr Trump after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August. He called the bloodshed a ""consequence"" of Mr Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. On Friday Mr O'Rourke said he was quitting the race for the White House as his campaign did not have ""the means to move forward successfully"". Mr Trump's response came days after he said Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had""died like a dog""during a US military operation in north-western Syria. This video can not be played Beto O'Rourke: ""We do not have the means to pursue this campaign successfully"" Speaking at a rally in Tupelo, Mississippi, the president branded Mr O'Rourke a ""poor, pathetic guy"". ""He came out of Texas a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be,"" Mr Trump declared. He had earlier mocked Mr O'Rourke on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

The Trump impeachment story explained The investigation was launched over allegations that Mr Trump improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election, which he denies.

Elizabeth Warren commended his ""commitment to ending gun violence"", while Bernie Sanders thanked him ""for running a campaign to bring millions of people together"". Mr O'Rourke, 47, ran for president in March after losing his 2018 bid to oust Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz. In that Senate race, he did better than any Democrat had in Texas for decades, running a campaign that invigorated the party nationwide and drew comparisons with former President Barack Obama. This video can not be played Who is Beto O'Rourke? His passionate delivery along with his good looks and background as a skateboarder and a punk rocker endeared him to liberals across the country. But Mr O'Rourke struggled to carry that energy into a White House race crowded with more than 20 Democratic candidates. As the initial buzz over his campaign began to subside, the former congressman tried to reboot his candidacy. He began to focus on gun control, and vowed to remove assault-style weapons from private ownership, saying in one televised debate: ""Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s."" But he could not catch up with front-runners like former Vice-President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. As he launched his campaign, he posed on the cover of Vanity Fair, telling the magazine about the White House race: ""Man, I'm just born to be in it."" He later said he regretted that move because it reinforced a ""perception of privilege."" In just about 12 months, Beto O'Rourke went from Democratic rock star to political rock bottom. During his 2018 Senate race, the former Texas congressman was fundraising like a top-tier presidential candidate. Beloved by Democrats across the country for his youthful energy, his passionate stump speeches became viral sensations. His obvious political skills in his home state did not translate on to the national stage, however, where a lack of campaign organisation and an inability to stand out on a crowded debate stage cost him dearly. Mr O'Rourke's relatively thin CV, which wasn't a concern for Democrats when he was facing conservative stalwart Ted Cruz in Texas, was also a liability in a match-up against senators and a former vice-president with extensive experience and in-depth policy knowledge. Some presidential hopefuls can run unsuccessful campaigns and end up with an elevated stature among party faithful - with more political prospects than when they began. Mr O'Rourke, whose campaign started high and trended only downward, was not so fortunate. He may have a second act in national politics, but his 2019 effort will be an experience he will have to overcome, not build on. Beto O'Rourke ends 2020 presidential bid.

"Labour pledges 'zero carbon' homes by 2022New builds would have solar panels and super-efficient insulation, the party says.Election 2019","The plans would involve installing ""super-efficient"" insulation in new homes Labour is promising to make all new-build homes ""zero carbon"" within three years, in an effort to curb housing shortages and tackle climate change. A Labour government would introduce ""tough"" standards for new builds which would see homes fitted with solar panels and not having gas boilers. The party says it would save Â£200 a year per house in energy bills. The Conservative Party described the plan as ""unrealistic"" and said it would slow house building. The proposals would mean the day-to-day running of the new homes would not add extra carbon to the atmosphere. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, on the campaign trail in Swindon on Saturday, said: ""There is no greater issue facing this world than the environmental disaster waiting to happen and the climate change that is happening very obviously all around us."" Central heating boilers 'threaten climate goals' Big lifestyle changes 'needed to cut emissions' UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 During a speech to supporters at Commonweal Sixth Form College, Mr Corbyn also responded to US President Donald Trump's recent remark thathe would be ""so bad"" as prime minister. Labour is hoping to take Swindon's two Conservative-held seats in next month's election He said Mr Trump was ""entitled to his choice"", adding: ""I'm prepared, as our Labour government, to meet anybody and put to them our views on peace, on justice, on human rights, on environmental sustainability, because our government will be a force for all of those things all over the world."" Mr Corbyn went on to say he would not back Nicola Sturgeon's call for a second referendum on Scottish independence. ""I think the much better option is a Labour government for the whole of the UK,"" he said. The speech also saw the Labour leader promise to end privatisation of the NHS, and lay out his plan to negotiate a new Brexit deal before offering the country a second referendum, which would include an option to stay in the EU. Reaching out to Leave and Remain voters, he said: ""Both of you need a Labour government that's going to bring people together."" Labour says their pledge to make all new-build homes 'zero carbon' by 2022 would be achieved through better efficiency standards and using low carbon and renewable energy sources. New homes would not be fitted with fossil fuel heating systems, such as gas boilers, as standard and would have ""super-efficient insulation"" and triple-glazed windows. The last Labour government introduced regulations to make all homes ""zero carbon"" by 2016, but it was scrapped by the Conservatives six months before it was due to come into force, Labour said. This video can not be played The eco-friendly council estate that won an architecture award Asked about the added cost of installing greener heating, Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey said it would be a ""relatively small"" sum compared to the total cost of new builds. ""It's totally do-able without big price increases,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. ""We really should be looking to house builders to absorb these costs as well because this is an industry, in recent years, that has made billions in profits and paid millions in bonuses to top executives,"" he said. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""As usual, Labour are setting unrealistic targets that would slow down house-building and put up house prices. ""Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are taking a practical, sensible approach to reducing emissions from homes. We are introducing a 'future homes standard' that will ensure new homes meet reductions in emissions by a third by 2020, and world-leading by 2025.""

World Cup win a reminder of country's change,"South Africans have been celebrating the country's third World Cup trophy win Across South Africa, they've been blowing their vuvuzelas, hugging, crying, grinning until it hurts, honking their car horns, pouring and throwing and spraying beer in all directions. They are celebrating a comprehensive victory that seems all the sweeter for being set against a backdrop of economic hardship, rising inequality, populist race-baiting, staggering official corruption and serious concerns about this young, boisterous nation's future. ""We can achieve anything if we work together as one,"" said Siya Kolisi, South Africa's now iconic black captain after the match in Japan. And in bars, homes, halls, and giant open-air public viewing areas, his words seemed - at least for a moment - to ring true. ""I have never seen, since I've been alive, I have never seen South Africa like this,"" Kolisi went on, and back home the crowds, black and white, nodded and cheered. South Africa celebrates world cup win over England I want to inspire every kid - Kolisi ""I'm so happy!"" screamed a black schoolgirl jumping for joy with her friends at a sports centre in a suburb of Johannesburg. ""We've gone through so much as a country and this is something positive we can celebrate as a country,"" said a woman watching at a luxury resort outside the city. ""I feel this win will reunite us as a country. We've been segregated, with so much going on. So this win means so much,"" said her friend. Today's squad has twelve black players and is a truly national team South Africa has always cherished its reputation for pulling off miracles. After all, this was the nation that steered itself away from civil war and plotted a negotiated path out of racial apartheid towards democracy. A year later, in 1995, a smiling Nelson Mandela watched the national team win its first Rugby World Cup and used that moment to build on his dream of a ""rainbow nation"". But the 1995 team had just one black player and many black South Africans struggled to share the enthusiasm of Mandela, and of their white compatriots so soon after the end of apartheid. Today's squad has twelve black players and has become a truly national team. This video can not be played ""Amazing!"": South Africa rugby fans go wild at World Cup win ""We have come a long way from 1995 to where we are today. We are demonstrating to the world that we are a diverse and united nation,"" said President Cyril Ramaphosa, who had gone to Japan to be with the Springbok team. And there were other signs of South Africa's progress on display today. Not just a black captain and a diverse squad, but smaller details like the fact that so many more whites in the crowd now appear to have learned the words to their multi-lingual national anthem - bellowing out all the African verses in the minutes before the match began. Fans have described the Springboks' win as something positive for the country But can success in a rugby competition transform a nation's fortunes? Of course not. South Africans are all too aware that, come Monday, their economy will still be on the brink of being downgraded to junk status by international ratings agencies. Youth unemployment will remain around the 50% mark. The power utility Eskom will continue to deliver blackouts as it hovers dangerously close to collapse. And the racial polarisation that has become entrenched in the country's political scene will carry on. ""No we're not (united),"" said one of several voices on Twitter, responding to President Ramaphosa's message.

South Africa win a reminder of country's change,"South Africans have been celebrating the country's third World Cup trophy win Across South Africa, they've been blowing their vuvuzelas, hugging, crying, grinning until it hurts, honking their car horns, pouring and throwing and spraying beer in all directions.

Family of balcony death woman felt 'abandoned',"Kirsty Maxwell was with a group of friends in Benidorm when she died in 2017 The family of a Scottish woman who fell to her death from a balcony in Spain have criticised a lack of support from UK authorities following her death. Kirsty Maxwell died in mysterious circumstances in Benidorm in 2017 while on a hen party weekend with friends. Her father, Brian Curry, said the family felt ""abandoned"" by the Foreign Office (FCO) in the days that followed. It comes asa report from MPs,externalsaid the right to consular support for families should be enshrined in law. Kirsty Maxwell, from Livingston in West Lothian, had only recently married when she travelled to Benidorm for a friend's hen party. Kirsty Maxwell: Spanish prosecutors believe fall was an accident Britons killed abroad: UK support 'patchy' Post-mortem casts doubt over 'natural death' The 27-year-old fell from the 10th floor balcony of a room where five men were staying on 29 April 2017.  The men were arrested but never charged. Her father said that in the hours following Kirsty's death, there was very little information from the authorities about what had happened. Kirsty Maxwell fell to her death from a 10th floor balcony of an apartment block He described how he and his wife took the first flight to Spain they could after a phone call to the family from a Spanish official in ""broken English"". He said the pair arrived in the early hours of the morning with nowhere to stay and no-one to meet them off the plane. Mr Curry said they ended up in a bus station hotel where they were eventually met by a Foreign Office official the following day. He said: ""The girl from the FCO was really nice, but I don't think she had the proper training to deal with what was involved. ""There didn't seem to be a procedure, in fact there was no procedure. Everyone seemed to be winging things."" Brian Curry said the family were given very little information about Kirsty's death Mr Curry described the experience as ""harrowing"" and said the lack of consular support compounded the family's grief. He added: ""I don't think they're prepared for something like this happening. ""We felt we were abandoned. We felt quite helpless. We were frustrated, we were angry."" The family's local MP, MP Hannah Bardell, set up a Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) to look into the consular assistance available to families whose loved-ones had died abroad. Ms Bardell said she took action following the deaths of Kirsty Maxwell andanother constituent Julie Pearson, both of whom died in suspicious circumstances. She has called for the creation of the ""Pearson Maxwell Protocol"" - a joined-up, cross-agency process that ""held the hands"" of a bereaved family from the point of notification of death, through travelling to the country of death and repatriation. She said MPs had listened to the testimony of 60 families from across the UK to produce their report. Ms Bardell said: ""Listening to harrowing evidence through this report, it is clear that changes must be made at the earliest opportunity. ""Experts have told us that these families are at risk of re-traumatisation and secondary victimisation as a result of their experiences with the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In a statement, the FCO said it was disappointed that the APPG had not engaged directly with them. They said: ""Last year we helped more than 22,000 British people overseas and the feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive. ""We are disappointed that the APPG declined our offer to meet with them and explain the professional and empathetic support we already give. We carefully consider all feedback we receive to continuously improve our service.""

Fracking halted after government pulls support,"Fracking at Cuadrilla Resources site in Lancashire in August caused a 2.9 magnitude earth tremor The government has called a halt to shale gas extraction - or fracking - in England amid fears about earthquakes. The indefinite suspension comes aftera report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA),externalsaid it was not possible to predict the probability or size of tremors caused by the practice. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said it may be temporary - imposed ""until and unless"" extraction is proved safe. Labour, Lib Dems and the Green Party  want a permanent ban. 'We have been guinea pigs for fracking' What is fracking and why is it controversial? Is the future of fracking now in doubt? Fracking firm in 'goodwill payments' after tremor Fracking was suspended at the end of August after activity by Cuadrilla Resources - the only company licensed to carry out the process - at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire caused a magnitude 2.9 earthquake. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said that, after the OGA concluded that further seismic activity could not be ruled out, ""further consents for fracking will not be granted"" unless the industry ""can reliably predict and control tremors"" linked to the process. However, it has stopped short of an outright ban. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme why that was, Mrs Leadsom said shale gas is a ""huge opportunity"" for the UK. ""We will follow the science and it is quite clear that we can't be certain. The science isn't accurate enough to be able to assess the fault lines, the geological studies have been shown to be inaccurate. So therefore, unless and until we can be absolutely certain, we are imposing a moratorium,"" she said. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyntweeted,externalthat the pause was an ""election stunt"" and that Labour would ban fracking permanently. Former Conservative energy minister Sam Gyimah, who is now a Liberal Democrat, said Mr Johnson's ""conversion to environmentalism"" was ""skin deep"". ""It's interesting that just as we approach an election he has decided he is against fracking."" Asked whether the UK should explore methods of delivering fracking safely, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said fossil fuels ""need to stay in the ground"" and that the government must make an ""absolute commitment"" to end it altogether. By Katie Prescott, BBC business correspondent Andrea Leadsom emphasises that this is not a ban - and the government is 'following the science'. However, scientists say it's hard to see a time with our current technology that fracking in the UK wouldn't cause earthquakes Professor Richard Davies from Newcastle University says: ""The UK is crisscrossed with faults and it's difficult to avoid them because the current imaging techniques used by the industry do not yet provide enough resolution to detect many of them."" The big question for the businesses working in this sector is whether they are happy to spend any more money in this regulatory environment. Do they think it's worth investing, in the hope that the ""science"" will one day find in their favour and the regulation could change? Or will they decide that two moratoriums in 10 years is just too many, and that fracking has no future in the UK. Friends of the Earth said legislation should be passed to make the fracking moratorium permanent. ""For nearly a decade local people across the country have fought a David and Goliath battle against this powerful industry,"" said chief executive Craig Bennett. Charity CPRE said it had long called for fracking to be stopped and said the move would help the UK meet its target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Anti-fracking campaigner Barbara Richardson, who has protested at Preston New Road, said she was ""cautiously optimistic"", adding that local people were ""worried"" about the impact of fracking. ""They want this to go away, they want some respite from this, they've been fighting this for five-and-a-half years,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Claire Stephenson from Frack Free Lancashire said campaigners were celebrating that the fracking industry in the UK is ""finished"", but added that protests will continue until an ""outright ban"" is in place. Susan Holliday, chair of Preston New Action Group said: ""We will only feel able to celebrate once Cuadrilla start work on decommissioning and the site is restored."" Fracking is a process in which liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil trapped within it. Assessment by the British Geological Survey in 2013 suggested there were enough resources in the Bowland Shale across northern England to potentially provide up to 50 years of current gas demand. Butresearch published in Augustestimated there were only five to seven years' supply. The UK's fracking industry, which has said the process could contribute significantly to future energy needs and create thousands of jobs, dismissed the report's findings. Fracking must be halted for 18 hours if it causes a tremor measuring 0.5 magnitude or above. The government announcement is the second time it has placed a moratorium on fracking. The first suspension, which lasted a year, was in November 2011 during the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. The fracking industry has faced fierce opposition from both communities and environmental groups. Local communities and environmental groups have protested against fracking Prime Minister Boris Johnson has in the past supported fracking,writing in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat the discovery of shale gas in the UK was ""glorious news for humanity"". A recent report by the National Audit Office found the UK had spent at least Â£32.7m supporting fracking since 2011. All fracking in Scotland has been suspended since 2013 andthe SNP recently confirmed a policy of ""no support"" for the extraction method. The Welsh Government has also opposed fracking for several years, with a ""moratorium"" in place since 2015, while there is a planning presumption against fracking in Northern Ireland.

The suspension in England will put pressure on Cuadrilla Resources which has so far invested Â£270m in the country's shale gas industry. Cuadrilla Resources has 30 full-time workers but also employs a number of contractors. A spokeswoman for Cuadrilla Resources declined to comment. The BBC understands Cuadrilla and other fracking companies were not told of the government's decision in advance. Ken Cronin, chief executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas, which represents fracking companies, said: ""Going forward, we are fully committed to working closely with the Oil and Gas Authority and other relevant regulators to demonstrate that we can operate safely and environmentally responsibly.""

PM urged to publish Russian interference report,"Boris Johnson is facing renewed calls to release a report assessing the threat posed by Russia to the UK's democratic processes. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve said its release was vital ahead of the general election because it contained information relevant to voters. Mr Grieve, chairman of Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, has accused the PM of sitting on the report ahead of the 12 December poll. The report was finalised in March 2019. Compiled by the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, it includes evidence from UK intelligence services concerning Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. The process for clearing it on security grounds was completed in the middle of October, but it has since been with Downing Street for final release. Mr Grieve - who sits as an independent MP for Beaconsfield after losing the Conservative whip - said the usual 10-day wait for release has passed, and if it is not published before Parliament dissolves on Tuesday it will not be published at all. Claims No 10 'sitting on' Russian interference report A really simple guide to the election,external Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I cannot think of a reason why he should wish to prevent this report being published. ""It's very demoralising for us when we find we put in months of work and at the end of it we're not getting an adequate response."" Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she was not aware of any hold-up. Speaking on the Today programme, she added: ""I don't think there's anything unusual about this. ""Many select committee reports are produced and the government has to respond properly, it cannot respond in haste."" Dominic Grieve says the report contains information ""germane"" to voters It is understood Mr Grieve had been hoping to publish the report on 28 October. The committee heard evidence from UK intelligence agencies such as GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 about Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 EU referendum and the 2017 general election. Previous disclosures would suggest these Russian activities did not match the scale of those directed against the 2016 US presidential election, and even in that case, there is considerable debate about how far people were actually influenced by these actions. Asked if there is useful information in the report for voters, Mr Grieve said: ""Yes I think there is. It's about information. ""I want to emphasise I'm not about to explain what's in the report, I'm not allowed to and I wouldn't dream of doing so. ""But the report is informative and people are entitled to information. It seems to us that this report is germane because we do know and I think it is widely accepted that the Russians have sought to interfere in other countries' democratic processes in the past."" By BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera Extensive evidence has been unearthed of Russian interference in US politics thanks to investigations likethe Mueller inquiry, but less has emerged when it comes to UK elections, including the Brexit referendum. And that is one reason why this report, simply entitled Russia has been so anticipated. How much evidence is there? It may be less than some hope but more than others expect. The committee's investigation is set against the wider challenge posed by Russian espionage and subversion directed against the West - which can range from cyber-hacking through social media activity to covert influence through individuals. This could potentially mean it treads on sensitive areas politically, but those who want to see the report released believe it is vital for the public to have an informed understanding of what Moscow and its agents are really up to as the UK heads to the polls. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn echoed Mr Grieve's call for the publication of the report, asking what the government ""have got to hide"". ""Yes it should be released,"" he said on Saturday. ""And I suspect that the reason it hasn't been published is because they're going to delay it past the dissolution of Parliament on Tuesday and then they can hide it away until some point in the future. ""If a report has been called for and written, and it should be in the public domain, then what have they got to hide?"" During a campaign visit in Kensington, west London, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson called allegations of Russian meddling in British politics ""deeply worrying"". She said Mr Grieve's stressing it should be published had given her ""cause for concern that the government is deliberately hiding it"". She added that it ""would be relevant heading into an election that the report is in the public domain"".

Labour pledges 'zero carbon' homes by 2022,"The plans would involve installing ""super-efficient"" insulation in new homes Labour is promising to make all new-build homes ""zero carbon"" within three years, in an effort to curb housing shortages and tackle climate change. A Labour government would introduce ""tough"" standards for new builds which would see homes fitted with solar panels and not having gas boilers. The party says it would save Â£200 a year per house in energy bills. The Conservative Party described the plan as ""unrealistic"" and said it would slow house building. The proposals would mean the day-to-day running of the new homes would not add extra carbon to the atmosphere. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, on the campaign trail in Swindon on Saturday, said: ""There is no greater issue facing this world than the environmental disaster waiting to happen and the climate change that is happening very obviously all around us."" Central heating boilers 'threaten climate goals' Big lifestyle changes 'needed to cut emissions' UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 During a speech to supporters at Commonweal Sixth Form College, Mr Corbyn also responded to US President Donald Trump's recent remark thathe would be ""so bad"" as prime minister. Labour is hoping to take Swindon's two Conservative-held seats in next month's election He said Mr Trump was ""entitled to his choice"", adding: ""I'm prepared, as our Labour government, to meet anybody and put to them our views on peace, on justice, on human rights, on environmental sustainability, because our government will be a force for all of those things all over the world."" Mr Corbyn went on to say he would not back Nicola Sturgeon's call for a second referendum on Scottish independence. ""I think the much better option is a Labour government for the whole of the UK,"" he said. The speech also saw the Labour leader promise to end privatisation of the NHS, and lay out his plan to negotiate a new Brexit deal before offering the country a second referendum, which would include an option to stay in the EU. Reaching out to Leave and Remain voters, he said: ""Both of you need a Labour government that's going to bring people together."" Labour says their pledge to make all new-build homes 'zero carbon' by 2022 would be achieved through better efficiency standards and using low carbon and renewable energy sources. New homes would not be fitted with fossil fuel heating systems, such as gas boilers, as standard and would have ""super-efficient insulation"" and triple-glazed windows. The last Labour government introduced regulations to make all homes ""zero carbon"" by 2016, but it was scrapped by the Conservatives six months before it was due to come into force, Labour said. This video can not be played The eco-friendly council estate that won an architecture award Asked about the added cost of installing greener heating, Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey said it would be a ""relatively small"" sum compared to the total cost of new builds. ""It's totally do-able without big price increases,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. ""We really should be looking to house builders to absorb these costs as well because this is an industry, in recent years, that has made billions in profits and paid millions in bonuses to top executives,"" he said. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""As usual, Labour are setting unrealistic targets that would slow down house-building and put up house prices. ""Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are taking a practical, sensible approach to reducing emissions from homes. We are introducing a 'future homes standard' that will ensure new homes meet reductions in emissions by a third by 2020, and world-leading by 2025.""

Trump says Beto O'Rourke 'quit like a dog',"This video can not be played President Trump mocked Beto O'Rourke at a rally in Mississippi US President Donald Trump has ridiculed Beto O'Rourke just hours after the Democratic presidential hopeful ended his campaign. The president used a profanity to describe his rival and said he ""quit like a dog"". Mr O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, was highly critical of Mr Trump after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August. He called the bloodshed a ""consequence"" of Mr Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. On Friday Mr O'Rourke said he was quitting the race for the White House as his campaign did not have ""the means to move forward successfully"". Mr Trump's response came days after he said Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had""died like a dog""during a US military operation in north-western Syria. This video can not be played Beto O'Rourke: ""We do not have the means to pursue this campaign successfully"" Speaking at a rally in Tupelo, Mississippi, the president branded Mr O'Rourke a ""poor, pathetic guy"". ""He came out of Texas a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be,"" Mr Trump declared. He had earlier mocked Mr O'Rourke on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Turning to the impeachment inquiry against him, the president said he believed an ""angry majority"" of American voters would support him. The Trump impeachment story explained The investigation was launched over allegations that Mr Trump improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election, which he denies.

Elizabeth Warren commended his ""commitment to ending gun violence"", while Bernie Sanders thanked him ""for running a campaign to bring millions of people together"". Mr O'Rourke, 47, ran for president in March after losing his 2018 bid to oust Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz. In that Senate race, he did better than any Democrat had in Texas for decades, running a campaign that invigorated the party nationwide and drew comparisons with former President Barack Obama. This video can not be played Who is Beto O'Rourke? His passionate delivery along with his good looks and background as a skateboarder and a punk rocker endeared him to liberals across the country. But Mr O'Rourke struggled to carry that energy into a White House race crowded with more than 20 Democratic candidates. As the initial buzz over his campaign began to subside, the former congressman tried to reboot his candidacy. He began to focus on gun control, and vowed to remove assault-style weapons from private ownership, saying in one televised debate: ""Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s."" But he could not catch up with front-runners like former Vice-President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. As he launched his campaign, he posed on the cover of Vanity Fair, telling the magazine about the White House race: ""Man, I'm just born to be in it."" He later said he regretted that move because it reinforced a ""perception of privilege."" In just about 12 months, Beto O'Rourke went from Democratic rock star to political rock bottom. During his 2018 Senate race, the former Texas congressman was fundraising like a top-tier presidential candidate. Beloved by Democrats across the country for his youthful energy, his passionate stump speeches became viral sensations. His obvious political skills in his home state did not translate on to the national stage, however, where a lack of campaign organisation and an inability to stand out on a crowded debate stage cost him dearly. Mr O'Rourke's relatively thin CV, which wasn't a concern for Democrats when he was facing conservative stalwart Ted Cruz in Texas, was also a liability in a match-up against senators and a former vice-president with extensive experience and in-depth policy knowledge. Some presidential hopefuls can run unsuccessful campaigns and end up with an elevated stature among party faithful - with more political prospects than when they began. Mr O'Rourke, whose campaign started high and trended only downward, was not so fortunate. He may have a second act in national politics, but his 2019 effort will be an experience he will have to overcome, not build on. Beto O'Rourke ends 2020 presidential bid.

German city declares a âNazi emergencyâ,"The anti-Islam Pegida movement began in Dresden in 2014 A city in eastern Germany has declared a ""Nazi emergency"", saying it has a serious problem with the far-right. Dresden, the capital of Saxony, has long been viewed as a bastion of the far-right and is the birthplace of the anti-Islam Pegida movement. Councillors in the city - a contender for the 2025 European Capital of Culture - have now approved a resolution saying more needs to be done to tackle the issue. But opponents say it goes too far. ""'Nazinotstand' means - similar to the climate emergency - that we have a serious problem. The open democratic society is threatened,"" local councillor Max Aschenbach, who tabled the motion, told the BBC. Mr Aschenbach, from left-leaning satirical political party Die Partei, said he believed it was necessary to take action because politicians were not doing enough to ""position themselves clearly"" against the far-right. Who is in Germany's Pegida movement? German parties outraged as neo-Nazi elected mayor Germany's far-right AfD: Victim or victor? ""The request was an attempt to change that. I also wanted to know what kind of people I'm sitting with in the city council of Dresden,"" he said. The resolution acknowledges that ""right-wing extremist attitudes and actions... are occurring with increasing frequency"" and calls on the city to help victims of far-right violence, protect minorities and strengthen democracy. Mr Aschenbach said adopting the motion showed the city council's commitment to fostering ""a free, liberal, democratic society that protects minorities and resolutely opposes Nazis."" Mr Aschenbach's resolution was put to a vote by Dresden's city council on Wednesday night and approved by 39 votes to 29, according to local media reports. Germany's governing Christian Democrats (CDU) were among those to reject the resolution. ""From our point of view, this was primarily an intended provocation,"" Jan Donhauser, chairman of the CDU City Council Group, told the BBC. ""'State of emergency' means the collapse or a serious threat to public order. That is not given rudimentarily. Furthermore, the focus on 'right-wing extremism' does not do justice to what we need. We are the guardians of the liberal-democratic basic order and no violence, no matter from which extremist side it comes, is compatible with it,"" he said. Mr Donhauser added that the ""vast majority"" of Dresdeners were ""neither right-wing extremists nor anti-democratic"". Mr Aschenbach said the city was not obliged to take any action following the adoption of his resolution, but that ""theoretically, existing measures should be given a higher priority and future decisions should follow this."" While opposing the resolution, the CDU said it hopes to ""strengthen the institutions that are best suited to combating politically motivated violence."" Kai Arzheimer, a German politics professor who has written extensively on far-right extremism, said the resolution's main impact was symbolic, but that it could mean that more money would be allocated to programmes combating extremism in the future. ""I don't think that any other German city has declared a 'Nazi emergency'. Resolutions against right-wing extremism are not so uncommon, however,"" he said. Dresden has long been known for its links to the far right. In the early 1990s, neo-Nazi groups began staging rallies there to remember what they called ""the bombing Holocaust"", when the city was bombed by British and American forces in 1945, Mr Arzheimer said. These groups went on to become active in surrounding areas and in southern Saxony. The state of Saxony has also long been a stronghold of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) and later the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. In state elections in September,support for the AfD surged, up 17.8% from 2014 to finish on 27.5%. Dresden is also where the anti-Islam Pegida (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West) movement began in 2014, and where it continues to hold rallies. This video can not be played Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West (Pegida) have held weekly protests since October Pegida supporters say people need to ""wake up"" to the threat of Islamist extremists. They want Germany to curb immigration and accuse the authorities of failing to enforce existing laws. The movement has spurred large counter-rallies in the city. Who is in Germany's Pegida movement?

Fans heartbroken as England lose to South AfricaFans were up early to watch England in their first final in 12 years - but things did not go their way.UK,"Red Rose fans watched as England failed to come close to the World Cup trophy Millions of England fans were left disappointed as Eddie Jones' men lost to South Africa in today's nail-biting Rugby World Cup final. Supporters were up early to watch the clash which saw the Springboks defeat England 32-12 in Japan. They filled pubs across the country, in the hope the favourites England might repeat their 2003 win. Tens of thousands of fans watched in Japan, alongside the Duke of Sussex, patron of the Rugby Football Union. The game, which kicked off at 09:00 GMT at the Yokohama International Stadium, was England's first World Cup final in 12 years. But things did not go their way from the start, with prop Kyle Sinckler knocked out in an accidental collision - before England conceded several penalties. Then the Springboks put the result beyond doubt with two tries in the second half. Springboks beat England to win World Cup England have been beaten up - Grayson Sinckler taken off with concussion England captain Owen Farrell (centre) and his team could not overcome South Africa Pubs in London began to empty even before the final whistle, as South Africa's name was engraved on the Webb Ellis cup for the third time. But England fans in the Admiralty pub, in London's Trafalgar Square, said, while they were disappointed, the best team had won. Michael O'Donnell, 58, from Kent, said the Springboks were ""a much stronger team physically"" on the day. ""While I'm disappointed with the result, nothing fell England's way and they [the Springboks] deserved the game,"" he said. ""Last week [in the semi-final against New Zealand] we were outstanding, and this week there was a little bit of nerves and it wasn't to be. ""I'm upset because the players truly believed they were going to win today. They will take it like men. We watched the best team win today."" Nails were bitten to the quick as fans in London watched the match slip away Paul Wylie, 57, of Sevenoaks, said South Africa had been ""strong and brutal"". ""I was worried that we peaked last week because it was a massive thing to beat New Zealand,"" he said. ""Their game today was too strong for us. They set their stall out and played a much tougher game. ""Getting to the final is a massive achievement in itself."" Some fans voiced their disappointment, accusing the England team of underperforming. Thomas Bishop, 30, said: ""I was expecting England to do better and they underperformed, if anything."" Dominic Maher, 34, added: ""It's the final and I just came out for the atmosphere, but England massively underperformed. They had a lot of spirit in the first half, but in the second half it went downhill rapidly."" After the match, England Rugby tweeted it was ""not the result we wanted"", before congratulating the Springboks on their win. Allow Twitter content?

So many England supporters turned up, they were forced to watch the game from outside, despite the rain. Tom Stagg, a fly-half for Harpenden Rugby Football Club (HRFC), said the loss was sad, adding it was ""going to end with a few beers"". ""We have four ex-players from the club in the final, to lose is obviously very disappointing but it has been such a great trip - and it has been awesome.""

Meanwhile fans at Crewe & Nantwich RUFC - the club where flanker Tom Curry and his twin brother Ben played up to the age of 16 - donned Tom Curry masks in anticipation of an England win, but were left disappointed on the final whistle. Heartbroken fans at Crewe & Nantwich RUFC Ahead of the match, vice chair Andy Pemberton, who did some coaching with the twins during their time at the club, said: ""To see one of your guys walking out, knowing he's played at the pitches here at Crewe & Nantwich is something special. The chest puffs out. ""You see him belting out the national anthem and it brings a tear to your eye."" But what may earlier have been tears of pride later turned to tears of disappointment. As England fans commiserated, Springbok supporters celebrated their victory up and down the country. Victory salutes from delighted South Africa fans In Bristol, hundreds of fans gathered at Ashton Gate stadium to cheer on their teams as they watched the game on the big screen. But as South Africa overpowered England, only a handful of Springbok fans, including Sean Viljoen and Mark Tonetti, were celebrating on the final whistle. Sean, 34, said: ""It was a big surprise. At the start of the second half England started dominating but our defence was outstanding. ""England made a lot of mistakes as well. ""We're so, so proud of the team.

"Blast kills nine children as they walk to schoolThe Afghan children accidentally triggered a roadside bomb on their way to class, officials say.Asia","More than 1,100 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan from July 1 until September 30 (file picture) Nine children have been killed in a roadside blast in north-eastern Afghanistan as they made their way to school. The children - eight boys and a girl aged between seven and 10 - accidentally stepped on a deliberately-planted mine, officials said. So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the bomb. Last month, the UN said 1,174 Afghan civilians had been killed in the three months until the end of September. More than 3,000 people have also been injured over this period, the UN said. A month of killing in Afghanistan The Afghan war: The short and long story ""At 8.30am (04:00 GMT) this morning, tragically, nine school children were martyred in a landmine blast,"" Jawad Hejri, a spokesman for the Takhar provincial governor, told AFP news agency. He alleged that the roadside device had been planted by the Taliban, which had taken control of Takhar Province for several weeks before Afghan forces recently regained control. The militants routinely plant roadside devices as they leave a district in the hope of targeting advancing security forces. The Taliban has not responded to a request for comment on the incident. Last May, a landmine killed seven children and wounded two more in the southern province of Ghazni. In February, seven children were killed and 10 more wounded in Laghman province when a mortar shell exploded as they played with it.

Fans heartbroken as England lose to South Africa,"Red Rose fans watched as England failed to come close to the World Cup trophy Millions of England fans were left disappointed as Eddie Jones' men lost to South Africa in today's nail-biting Rugby World Cup final. Supporters were up early to watch the clash which saw the Springboks defeat England 32-12 in Japan. They filled pubs across the country, in the hope the favourites England might repeat their 2003 win. Tens of thousands of fans watched in Japan, alongside the Duke of Sussex, patron of the Rugby Football Union. The game, which kicked off at 09:00 GMT at the Yokohama International Stadium, was England's first World Cup final in 12 years. But things did not go their way from the start, with prop Kyle Sinckler knocked out in an accidental collision - before England conceded several penalties. Then the Springboks put the result beyond doubt with two tries in the second half. Springboks beat England to win World Cup England have been beaten up - Grayson Sinckler taken off with concussion England captain Owen Farrell (centre) and his team could not overcome South Africa Pubs in London began to empty even before the final whistle, as South Africa's name was engraved on the Webb Ellis cup for the third time. But England fans in the Admiralty pub, in London's Trafalgar Square, said, while they were disappointed, the best team had won. Michael O'Donnell, 58, from Kent, said the Springboks were ""a much stronger team physically"" on the day. ""While I'm disappointed with the result, nothing fell England's way and they [the Springboks] deserved the game,"" he said. ""Last week [in the semi-final against New Zealand] we were outstanding, and this week there was a little bit of nerves and it wasn't to be. ""I'm upset because the players truly believed they were going to win today. They will take it like men. We watched the best team win today."" Nails were bitten to the quick as fans in London watched the match slip away Paul Wylie, 57, of Sevenoaks, said South Africa had been ""strong and brutal"". ""I was worried that we peaked last week because it was a massive thing to beat New Zealand,"" he said. ""Their game today was too strong for us. They set their stall out and played a much tougher game. ""Getting to the final is a massive achievement in itself."" Some fans voiced their disappointment, accusing the England team of underperforming. Thomas Bishop, 30, said: ""I was expecting England to do better and they underperformed, if anything."" Dominic Maher, 34, added: ""It's the final and I just came out for the atmosphere, but England massively underperformed. They had a lot of spirit in the first half, but in the second half it went downhill rapidly."" After the match, England Rugby tweeted it was ""not the result we wanted"", before congratulating the Springboks on their win. Allow Twitter content?

It's not known how many more are likely to be drunk as fans drown their sorrows. Glum faces at Harpenden Rugby Club the training ground of England captain Owen Farrell Harpenden Rugby Club - where three of the World Cup team, including captain Owen Farrell, began their rugby careers - hosted an event for several hundred fans. So many England supporters turned up, they were forced to watch the game from outside, despite the rain. Tom Stagg, a fly-half for Harpenden Rugby Football Club (HRFC), said the loss was sad, adding it was ""going to end with a few beers"". ""We have four ex-players from the club in the final, to lose is obviously very disappointing but it has been such a great trip - and it has been awesome."" Many supporters, including Mr Stagg, wore Owen Farrell face masks for the final. ""He was always a hell of a player,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

Heartbroken fans at Crewe & Nantwich RUFC Ahead of the match, vice chair Andy Pemberton, who did some coaching with the twins during their time at the club, said: ""To see one of your guys walking out, knowing he's played at the pitches here at Crewe & Nantwich is something special. The chest puffs out. ""You see him belting out the national anthem and it brings a tear to your eye."" But what may earlier have been tears of pride later turned to tears of disappointment. As England fans commiserated, Springbok supporters celebrated their victory up and down the country. Victory salutes from delighted South Africa fans In Bristol, hundreds of fans gathered at Ashton Gate stadium to cheer on their teams as they watched the game on the big screen. But as South Africa overpowered England, only a handful of Springbok fans, including Sean Viljoen and Mark Tonetti, were celebrating on the final whistle. Sean, 34, said: ""It was a big surprise. At the start of the second half England started dominating but our defence was outstanding. ""England made a lot of mistakes as well. ""We're so, so proud of the team.

PM urged to publish Russian interference reportDominic Grieve says it's essential to publish the document ahead of the general election.UK Politics,"Boris Johnson is facing renewed calls to release a report assessing the threat posed by Russia to the UK's democratic processes. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve said its release was vital ahead of the general election because it contained information relevant to voters. Mr Grieve, chairman of Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, has accused the PM of sitting on the report ahead of the 12 December poll. The report was finalised in March 2019. Compiled by the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, it includes evidence from UK intelligence services concerning Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. The process for clearing it on security grounds was completed in the middle of October, but it has since been with Downing Street for final release. Mr Grieve - who sits as an independent MP for Beaconsfield after losing the Conservative whip - said the usual 10-day wait for release has passed, and if it is not published before Parliament dissolves on Tuesday it will not be published at all. Claims No 10 'sitting on' Russian interference report A really simple guide to the election,external Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I cannot think of a reason why he should wish to prevent this report being published. ""It's very demoralising for us when we find we put in months of work and at the end of it we're not getting an adequate response."" Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she was not aware of any hold-up. Speaking on the Today programme, she added: ""I don't think there's anything unusual about this. ""Many select committee reports are produced and the government has to respond properly, it cannot respond in haste."" Dominic Grieve says the report contains information ""germane"" to voters It is understood Mr Grieve had been hoping to publish the report on 28 October. The committee heard evidence from UK intelligence agencies such as GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 about Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 EU referendum and the 2017 general election. Previous disclosures would suggest these Russian activities did not match the scale of those directed against the 2016 US presidential election, and even in that case, there is considerable debate about how far people were actually influenced by these actions. Asked if there is useful information in the report for voters, Mr Grieve said: ""Yes I think there is. It's about information. ""I want to emphasise I'm not about to explain what's in the report, I'm not allowed to and I wouldn't dream of doing so. ""But the report is informative and people are entitled to information. It seems to us that this report is germane because we do know and I think it is widely accepted that the Russians have sought to interfere in other countries' democratic processes in the past."" By BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera Extensive evidence has been unearthed of Russian interference in US politics thanks to investigations likethe Mueller inquiry, but less has emerged when it comes to UK elections, including the Brexit referendum. And that is one reason why this report, simply entitled Russia has been so anticipated. How much evidence is there? It may be less than some hope but more than others expect. The committee's investigation is set against the wider challenge posed by Russian espionage and subversion directed against the West - which can range from cyber-hacking through social media activity to covert influence through individuals. This could potentially mean it treads on sensitive areas politically, but those who want to see the report released believe it is vital for the public to have an informed understanding of what Moscow and its agents are really up to as the UK heads to the polls. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn echoed Mr Grieve's call for the publication of the report, asking what the government ""have got to hide"". ""Yes it should be released,"" he said on Saturday. ""And I suspect that the reason it hasn't been published is because they're going to delay it past the dissolution of Parliament on Tuesday and then they can hide it away until some point in the future. ""If a report has been called for and written, and it should be in the public domain, then what have they got to hide?"" During a campaign visit in Kensington, west London, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson called allegations of Russian meddling in British politics ""deeply worrying"". She said Mr Grieve's stressing it should be published had given her ""cause for concern that the government is deliberately hiding it"". She added that it ""would be relevant heading into an election that the report is in the public domain"".

"Bacteria dislodged by hospital clean-up workDecontamination work after a bug outbreak at a hospital dislodged more bacteria, new papers show.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","Work to clean up a hospital bacteria outbreak inadvertently led to more contamination, new documents reveal. Brain surgery was postponed at Edinburgh's Western General in March after a small number of patients contracted the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bug from showers and taps in a ward. A decontamination programme was ordered by NHS Lothian. But documents released by health watchdogs show this work is believed to have caused further problems. Surgeries cancelled after infection found Children's hospital delayed until autumn next year Health Protection Scotland (HPS) papers show a shower in the hospital's department of clinical neurosciences twice tested negative for the bacteria following the outbreak, and patients were allowed to keep using it. But later tests on the shower were positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa - a common bacteria that can be harmful to patients who are very vulnerable to infection - and it was taken out of service. HPS reports, released after a Freedom of Information request, show the ""current hypothesis is that remedial plumbing, extensive flushing and water pressure may have dislodged biofilm (a collection of microorganisms such as bacteria) within the water systems leading to the contamination in the recent samples"". NHS Lothian said it followed national testing guidelines and the dislodging of the biofilm did not lead to any further patient infections. It added that once the bug was identified, it was immediately taken out of use. What is Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection? The department of clinical neurosciences had been due to move into the new children's hospital in July but thatmove was postponed due to safety fearsabout the new complex and it is not expected to move there until spring next year. Tom Waterson, Scotland health committee chair at trade union Unison, said: ""The outbreak was a concern for patients and staff alike. ""They have been desperate to leave that facility because it is in dire need of modernisation and they were meant to have moved out of there months ago. ""My concern is that we now know there had been doubts about the move to the new building for a long time so why was there not more done on the maintenance of the neuroscience department."" The Scottish government has said it will provide about Â£6m in funding to help keep the existing Sick Kids hospital and neuroscience department up to scratch until the new facility is open next year. The department of clinical neurosciences is due to move into Edinburgh's new children's hospital next spring A total of 47 patients had elective procedures cancelled and rearranged as a result of the March outbreak. Further positive samples for the bug were identified in July and since then 18 samples (out of 2,926 taken) have tested positive for what the health board described as ""very low counts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa"". A spokeswoman for NHS Lothian said: ""The water sampling regime used is a national protocol for assessing Pseudomonas aeruginosa regardless of how the bacteria entered the water. ""As part of that protocol, outlets continue to be tested after remedial works have been carried out. ""On identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in shower water, the shower was immediately removed from patient use so that no patient exposure could occur."" It is not known what happened to the patients who contracted the bug in March as NHS Lothian said it was ""unable to discuss individual patients and their outcomes"".

Sturgeon: Independence within 'touching distance',"Nicola Sturgeon has claimed independence is ""within touching distance"" ahead of a speech to supporters at a major rally in Glasgow. She will ask for powers to hold another a referendum on Scotland's future in the UK shortly after next month's general election. However Jeremy Corbyn said a new Scottish independence poll was not ""desirable or necessary"". The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats also oppose a further vote. Ms Sturgeon is one of a number of SNP politicians and independence campaigners speaking at the #indyref2020 rally in George Square. It will be thefirst time she has spoken at an independence rally since 2014. The event prompted a counter demonstration by dozens of unionist supporters who waved flags and blew whistles as supporters of Scottish independence gathered. Ministers urged to agree indyref2 question test Election 2019: Questions facing Scotland's parties FMQs: Rolling out the red carpet for indyref2? Speaking ahead of the event organised byThe National newspaper,external, the SNP leader focused on the UK-wide election on 12 December. ""This election really is the most important one Scotland has faced in modern times,"" she said. ""So much is on the line - people are completely fed up with the mess at Westminster. ""But George Square will be packed as people from all backgrounds join together to demand a better future for Scotland."" Ms Sturgeon added that independence ""really is within touching distance"". She had faced criticism by some activists for not attending events such as theAll Under One Banner march in Edinburgh last month. However, the first minister did tweet ahead of that march to say she was not able to attend, but would be there ""in spirit"". Pro-independence marchers in Edinburgh last month walked from Holyrood Park to a rally in The Meadows On Friday the first minister confirmed that she would send a letter ""before Christmas"" to whoever is in 10 Downing Street, requesting the Scottish Parliament is granted powers to hold another independence referendum. She has made clear thatshe wants to hold a poll on the issue next year. Asked whether she believed Labour would grant the Section 30 order, Ms Sturgeon answered: ""Yes"". ""If people in Scotland demonstrate the desire - as I believe they will in this election - for an independence referendum, then I don't believe Westminster opposition to the principle or to the timetable to that will prove sustainable,"" she said. In response, Jeremy Corbyn said only a Labour government would be able to boost Scotland's economy and see ""the levels of poverty in Scotland, particularly in the big cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee, being reduced"". He added: ""Scottish independence would mean a massive gap between what Scotland raises in taxation and what the Scottish people need at the present time.

""Instead of tackling the day-to-day things that Glaswegians care about, Nicola Sturgeon is headlining a nationalist rally.

Apple TV's big debut with Aniston and Witherspoon âââââ,"Apple has made some good products over the years, real game-changers like the original 1984 all-in-one Macintosh, as well as all those nifty ""i"" gadgets: the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone and so on. Of course, there have been misses along the way. Remember the Newton? The Pippin? And what about the 2006 iPod hi-fi? It was the tech giant's attempt to muscle in on the lucrative speaker-doc market. But it was too late to the party, received lukewarm reviews, and was withdrawn a year later. The consumer expects Apple to be a leader not a follower. Lesson learnt? Possibly not. This Friday (1 November) saw the launch of Apple TV+, the company's Â£4.99-a-month original content streaming and download service. This marks the Cupertino-based company's entry into an already crowded and highly competitive marketplace with established players such as the BBC's iPlayer, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime. Disney is on its way too with a back-catalogue that puts Apple's handful of shows in the shade. It means the modest amount of initial content Apple is offering will have to be very good indeed to lure punters away from the competition. Or, maybe, boast one of those innovative twists on which the organisation's reputation and fortune are built. Well, there's not anything particularly fancy about the perfectly serviceable interface and user experience. And judging by the first three episodes of its starry blockbuster launch drama The Morning Show, it could find itself back in iPod hi-fi territory. The opening episode is as bad as anything I've seen since we entered this golden age of telly, which, arguably, started in 1994 with Friends (still the most popular show on Netflix). There is a connectionâ¦ Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) and her sister Jill (Reese Witherspoon - Season Six, Feb 2000) are back in Manhattan together. But they've changed their names to Alex and Bradley respectively and aren't sisters at all, but TV news journalists. Alex is the successful co-anchor of The Morning Show, while Bradley has flown in from West Virginia where she was plying her trade as a reporter with a nose for hard news and an appetite for a fight. Back in 2000, Jennifer Aniston as Rachel was joined in this episode of the hit TV series Friends by Reese Witherspoon, who played her sister Jill Nearly 20 years on, Reese Witherspoon (Bradley Jackson) and Jennifer Aniston (Alex Levy) star in and executive produce The Morning Show The action (I use the term loosely) starts at around 03:00 when Chip Black (Mark Duplass), The Morning Show's executive producer, receives a call bearing bad news from his boss (there are a lot of calls throughout, all on iPhones funnily enough). ""We're destroyed,"" say Chip gloomily into the receiver. He phones The Morning Show's co-anchor Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell). ""Someone better be dead, buddy,"" growls Mitch, which, to be fair, is exactly my reaction when the BBC Radio 4's Today Programme calls me at some unearthly hour. And then Alex's alarm goes off and she gets up and goes to work in a bit of a daze. Only to be confronted by Chip standing awkwardly with his hands in his trouser pockets making them look like jodhpurs. He is a picture of anguish. ""Oh my god, who died?"" asks Alex. Chip gulps. Nobody, it turns out. Something much worse as far as Alex is concerned. Mitch, her co-host and ""TV husband"" on the morning news show for the past 15 years, turns out to be a workplace ""sexual predator"". We don't know Mitch, we don't know the show (although it appears to be referencing NBC's Today Show, from which host Matt Lauer was fired in 2017 following allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denies), we don't know Alex, and what we've seen of Chip so far is enough to suggest we don't want to know him either. Steve Carell plays Mitch Kessler, who is fired as The Morning Show's co-host over allegations of sexual misconduct This is a problem. Because The Morning Show lurches straight into high-drama mode with Alex taking the lead through gritted teeth and fighting back tears because her beloved Mitch has been summarily fired. Which leaves you thinking... so what. It's all too soon. We're not on board yet. We're not invested in the characters or the story. It's only a few minutes in and we don't care. It's like having Christmas in July, we're not ready. The upshot of which is that the terrible script, laboured directing, and wooden acting are cruelly exposed. The dialogue is clunkier than a misfiring moped, written with an ear not of tin but of stone. I don't know if you remember Victoria Wood's spoof soap opera Acorn Antiques, but if you do it is just like that but not as funny. That is to say, it is amateurish, which is remarkable given the cost ($300m, or Â£232m, for 20 episodes according to Bloomberg, a figure contested by the drama's director Mimi Leder) and the star cast. None of that matters, though, if you haven't got the basics right, which in the world of TV means one thing above all else, and that is the writing. A script riddled with cliches such as those pouring from Mitch's mouth as he sulks at home with his squad while watching Alex explain to America why he isn't beside her, won't do: ""Everything's changed and they forgot to send me the memo."" Or ""Since the dawn of time men have used their power to attract women."" Or ""I didn't hold a gun to anyone's head. It was consensual. Most of them came on to me."" Steve Carell is a decent actor, but even he cannot make these lines land. Nor can Aniston and Witherspoon when it's their turn to deliver speeches designed to establish their characters but are so inelegantly crowbarred into the boilerplate plot that they have the opposite effect. The cliches don't stop with the script. The characters are straight out of central casting, which is hopeless given the show's ambition to explore the 21st Century entertainment industry post #MeToo, #OscarsSoWhite and #TimesUp. We have Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup) the know-it-all male boss who only cares about ratings and his career. We have Alex, seen as an ageing anchor whose vulnerability and newly found righteousness might just be the thing that brings the viewers back to a tired show. And we have the relationship between an older man and younger woman. So far, so Network. The difference being Network was made in 1976 when a TV newsroom drama felt fresh. Not so much 43 years later, when the subject is so common it has become a genre. Billy Crudup plays Cory Ellison, the ratings-obsessed president of UBA's News Division, with Mark Duplass, who is Charles Black, The Morning Show's stressed executive producer In the film Network, Peter Finch is news anchor Howard Beale, who gets poor ratings and then tells viewers he's as ""mad as hell"" It's not all terrible. The third episode is not nearly as bad. The contrived plot set-ups are in place, the dialogue is more focused, and the characters are beginning to show signs of life. But problems remain. This is supposed to be a contemporary piece about gender politics. And yet the two female lead characters are depicted as emotionally volatile women making decisions on impulse, while their male boss from whom they seek to wrest control is portrayed as intellectual, analytical and psychologically stable. The show's muddled thinking is evident again when a character is introduced claiming Mitch sexually assaulted her. Surely this provides some real drama at last to lift us out of Alex's tedious contract negotiations? But no. We hardly see or hear a word from the alleged victim. Her story is deemed not important. Instead, it's all about Alex again and how she is or isn't going to handle the interview with Mitch's accuser. The poetry of Robert Frost is evoked at one point, and there's a nod towards the famous queuing scene in Annie Hall, suggesting the show's creators know what good writing looks like. But they are woefully short of the mark in the first three episodes that are currently available to see. Maybe the next seven eps are going to be a knock-out. It is certainly moving in the right direction. But all I can do at this juncture is paraphrase the old-time Hollywood mogul Sam Goldwyn and say: Apple TV+ has raised writing to a new low.

"Trump says Beto O'Rourke 'quit like a dog'The US Democratic presidential hopeful, a fierce Trump critic, ended his campaign on Friday.US & Canada","This video can not be played President Trump mocked Beto O'Rourke at a rally in Mississippi US President Donald Trump has ridiculed Beto O'Rourke just hours after the Democratic presidential hopeful ended his campaign. The president used a profanity to describe his rival and said he ""quit like a dog"". Mr O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, was highly critical of Mr Trump after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August. He called the bloodshed a ""consequence"" of Mr Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. On Friday Mr O'Rourke said he was quitting the race for the White House as his campaign did not have ""the means to move forward successfully"". Mr Trump's response came days after he said Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had""died like a dog""during a US military operation in north-western Syria. This video can not be played Beto O'Rourke: ""We do not have the means to pursue this campaign successfully"" Speaking at a rally in Tupelo, Mississippi, the president branded Mr O'Rourke a ""poor, pathetic guy"". ""He came out of Texas a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be,"" Mr Trump declared. He had earlier mocked Mr O'Rourke on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

He also described former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination, as mentally deficient, and said he was ""dropping like a rock"". Turning to the impeachment inquiry against him, the president said he believed an ""angry majority"" of American voters would support him. The Trump impeachment story explained The investigation was launched over allegations that Mr Trump improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election, which he denies. Announcing the end of his campaign, Mr O'Rourke tweeted:""Our campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively.,external ""In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee."" In a blog post thanking supporters,external, he wrote: ""We confronted institutional, systemic racism and called out Donald Trump for his white supremacy and the violence that he's encouraged against communities that don't look like, pray like or love like the majority in this country."" Democratic frontrunners tweeted their tributes to Mr O'Rourke after he stood aside. Mr Biden said he had inspired many. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Elizabeth Warren commended his ""commitment to ending gun violence"", while Bernie Sanders thanked him ""for running a campaign to bring millions of people together"". Mr O'Rourke, 47, ran for president in March after losing his 2018 bid to oust Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz. In that Senate race, he did better than any Democrat had in Texas for decades, running a campaign that invigorated the party nationwide and drew comparisons with former President Barack Obama. This video can not be played Who is Beto O'Rourke? His passionate delivery along with his good looks and background as a skateboarder and a punk rocker endeared him to liberals across the country. But Mr O'Rourke struggled to carry that energy into a White House race crowded with more than 20 Democratic candidates. As the initial buzz over his campaign began to subside, the former congressman tried to reboot his candidacy. He began to focus on gun control, and vowed to remove assault-style weapons from private ownership, saying in one televised debate: ""Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s."" But he could not catch up with front-runners like former Vice-President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. As he launched his campaign, he posed on the cover of Vanity Fair, telling the magazine about the White House race: ""Man, I'm just born to be in it."" He later said he regretted that move because it reinforced a ""perception of privilege."" In just about 12 months, Beto O'Rourke went from Democratic rock star to political rock bottom. During his 2018 Senate race, the former Texas congressman was fundraising like a top-tier presidential candidate. Beloved by Democrats across the country for his youthful energy, his passionate stump speeches became viral sensations. His obvious political skills in his home state did not translate on to the national stage, however, where a lack of campaign organisation and an inability to stand out on a crowded debate stage cost him dearly. Mr O'Rourke's relatively thin CV, which wasn't a concern for Democrats when he was facing conservative stalwart Ted Cruz in Texas, was also a liability in a match-up against senators and a former vice-president with extensive experience and in-depth policy knowledge. Some presidential hopefuls can run unsuccessful campaigns and end up with an elevated stature among party faithful - with more political prospects than when they began. Mr O'Rourke, whose campaign started high and trended only downward, was not so fortunate. He may have a second act in national politics, but his 2019 effort will be an experience he will have to overcome, not build on. Beto O'Rourke ends 2020 presidential bid.

Thousands join Sturgeon in indyref2 rallying call,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland at a ""crossroads moment"" Thousands of independence supporters have heard Nicola Sturgeon call for ""Scotland's future to be put into Scotland's hands"". The first minister told a major rally in Glasgow the time would come to break away from the ""chaos of Westminster"" in a second independence poll next year. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said a new Scottish independence referendum was not ""desirable or necessary"". The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats also oppose a further vote. Ms Sturgeon was one of a number of SNP politicians and independence campaigners to speak at the #indyref2020 rally in George Square. It was thefirst time she had spoken at an independence rally since 2014. The event prompted a counter demonstration by dozens of unionist supporters who waved flags and blew whistles as supporters of Scottish independence gathered. The SNP leader focused on the UK-wide election on 12 December at the event, which was organised byThe National newspaper,external. She has made it clear thatshe wants to hold a poll on the issue next yearand said the general election was a ""crossroads moment"" for Scotland. Ms Sturgeon told the pro-indy crowds: ""Over the next few weeks, it is our job to convince everyone we know to come out on December the 12th and send the biggest, loudest most resounding message to Westminster. ""That it is time for Scotland to choose our own future. It is time for Scotland to be an independent country. ""An independent country that will be the best of friends and family with our neighbours across the British Isles, across Europe and across the world."" Ministers urged to agree indyref2 question test Election 2019: Questions facing Scotland's parties FMQs: Rolling out the red carpet for indyref2? The first minister told the crowd the general election was ""the most important election for Scotland in our lifetimes"". ""The future of our country is on the line,"" she said. ""And there is no doubt whatsoever that Scotland stands at a crossroads moment."" There were boos from the audience when she claimed a victory for Boris Johnson in the election would result in ""a future where Scotland gets ripped out of our European family of nations against our will, a future where the UK turns in on itself, a future of a hostile environment for migrants"". Instead, she said, there was ""a much better alternative"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""That alternative is not a UK Labour government that can't event make up its mind where it stands on the question of Brexit."" The first minister's speech came after she confirmed that she would send a letter ""before Christmas"" to whoever is in 10 Downing Street, requesting the Scottish Parliament is granted powers to hold another independence referendum. The indyref2020 rally prompted a counter-demonstration by pro-unionists Asked whether she believed Labour would grant the Section 30 order, Ms Sturgeon answered: ""Yes"".

The third episode is not nearly as bad. The contrived plot set-ups are in place, the dialogue is more focused, and the characters are beginning to show signs of life. But problems remain. This is supposed to be a contemporary piece about gender politics. And yet the two female lead characters are depicted as emotionally volatile women making decisions on impulse, while their male boss from whom they seek to wrest control is portrayed as intellectual, analytical and psychologically stable. The show's muddled thinking is evident again when a character is introduced claiming Mitch sexually assaulted her. Surely this provides some real drama at last to lift us out of Alex's tedious contract negotiations? But no. We hardly see or hear a word from the alleged victim. Her story is deemed not important. Instead, it's all about Alex again and how she is or isn't going to handle the interview with Mitch's accuser. The poetry of Robert Frost is evoked at one point, and there's a nod towards the famous queuing scene in Annie Hall, suggesting the show's creators know what good writing looks like. But they are woefully short of the mark in the first three episodes that are currently available to see. Maybe the next seven eps are going to be a knock-out. It is certainly moving in the right direction. But all I can do at this juncture is paraphrase the old-time Hollywood mogul Sam Goldwyn and say: Apple TV+ has raised writing to a new low.

"Johnson rejects pact with Farage for electionThe Tory leader also hits back at Donald Trump's criticism of his Brexit deal, in a BBC interview.Election 2019","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Election pact with Brexit Party 'risks putting Corbyn into No 10' Boris Johnson has rejected the suggestion from Nigel Farage and Donald Trump that he should work with the Brexit Party during the election. The Tory leader told the BBC he was ""always grateful for advice"" but he would not enter into election pacts. His comments come after the US president said Mr Farage and Mr Johnson would be ""an unstoppable force"". Downing Street sources say there are no circumstances in which the Tories would work with the Brexit Party. In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the ""difficulty"" of doing deals with ""any other party"" was that it ""simply risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10"". ""The problem with that is that his [Mr Corbyn's] plan for Brexit is basically yet more dither and delay,"" Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson also said there was ""no question of negotiating on the NHS"" as part of any future trade deal with the US, but he did not rule out expanding the amount of private provision in the health service in the future. But Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said the public ""can't trust the Tories on the NHS"", saying they would ""increase privatisation even further and do a deal with Donald Trump"". Kuenssberg: Colourful words no guarantee of election success First head-to-head TV election debate announced Jeremy Corbyn vows to 'transform' UK Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? A really simple guide to the UK general election Farage calls on Johnson to 'build Leave alliance' When pushed on whether he would rule out a deal with Mr Farage, Mr Johnson replied: ""I want to be very, very clear that voting for any other party than this government, this Conservative governmentâ¦ is basically tantamount to putting Jeremy Corbyn in."" The UK is going to the polls on 12 December following a further delay to the UK's departure from the EU, to 31 January 2020. The BBC will be talking to other party leaders during the course of the campaign. US president Donald Trumptold Nigel Farage's LBC show on Thursday,externalthat the Brexit Party leader should team up with Mr Johnson to do ""something terrific"" and he also criticised the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement. Meanwhile, Mr Farage has called on the prime minister to drop his Brexit deal, unite in a ""Leave alliance"" or face a Brexit Party candidate in every seat in the election. Mr Johnson said there were ""lots of reasons"" why he thought a Labour government would be a ""disaster"". He said he Labour government would lead to a renegotiation with Brussels on a Brexit deal, then another referendum. ""Why go through that nightmare again?"" he said. The prime minister also suggested that the US president was wrong to believe a trade deal would be impossible with the UK after Brexit. Mr Johnson said his ""proper Brexit"" deal ""enables us to do proper all-singing, all-dancing free-trade deals"". This video can not be played Farage: Trump is a 'fan of Boris Johnson' ""It delivers exactly what we wanted, what I wanted, when I campaigned in 2016 to come out the European Union,"" Mr Johnson said. When asked about the criticism from Mr Trump, Mr Johnson said: ""I am always grateful for advice from wherever it comes and we have great relations as you know with the US and many many other countries. ""But on the technicalities of the deal anybody who looks at it can see that the UK has full control."" The prime minister is never short of a word or two, never short of a colourful phrase or a metaphor. When we sat down this afternoon there wasno suggestion of him being the Hulk,external, but Remain-tending MPs were accused of ""rope-a-doping"" the government, planning eventually to batter the prime minister and his Brexit deal into submission until he would have had to give up. But in Downing Street there is a serious awareness that trademark Johnson verbal gymnastics are no guarantee of success at the ballot box in six weeks' time, no guarantee at all. That's not just because there are even friends, like Donald Trump, and of course foes, like Jeremy Corbyn, whose words and actions will hamper his attempt to secure a majority to call his own. But also because this is a snap election, not a routine poll, and the public is hardly in a forgiving mood of our politicians right now. Read more from Laura Mr Johnson said he hoped the government could get Brexit ""over the line"" by the middle of January if he won a majority, claiming the current Parliament would never have passed his deal. He said he'd had ""no choice"" but to call a general election, saying: ""Nobody wants an election but we've got to do it now. ""This is a Parliament that is basically full of MPs who voted Remain. ""They voted Remain and they will continue to block Brexit if they're given the chance - we need a new mandate, we need to refresh our Parliament."" Mr Johnson said his government was determined to increase taxpayer funding of the NHS but said: ""Of course there are dentists and optometrists and so on who are providers to the NHS, of course, that's how it works,"" he said. ""But... I believe passionately in an NHS free at the point of use for everybody in this country."" Labour's Mr Ashworth said: ""Forced NHS privatisation has doubled under the Conservatives and Boris Johnson has refused to rule out expanding this further. ""You can't trust the Tories on the NHS. They will increase privatisation even further and do a deal with Donald Trump that will see as much as Â£500m more a week sent to US corporations.""

Health services in NI 'at risk of collapse',"The committee said the Department of Health must take ""immediate action to tackle acute issues facing the health service"" Health services in Northern Ireland risk ""deteriorating to the point of collapse"" without a long-term funding strategy to support transformation, a report by a Westminster committee has said. It said services are struggling to meet the needs of an ageing population. The report added that the services are ""lacking adequate financial support or strategic guidance"". The Department of Health said it would carefully consider the recommendations. The warning comes as the department spelled out the scale of the budgetary pressures it faces in a letter to Northern Ireland's political parties. Â£1bn 'needed to eradicate Northern Ireland waiting lists' Bengoa Review: Ambitious health care shake-up unveiled The Westminister committeereport,external, by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, said key services, ""in particular cancer, social care and mental health"", lack comprehensive strategies to guide their future direction. It added that the Department of Health ""must do more to demonstrate its commitment to developing long-term strategies for these services"". The committee said the department must also take immediate action to tackle ""acute issues facing the health service"". These, it said, include cancer waiting times, shortages in social care staffing and inadequate mental health funding. The report said decisions over health services in Northern Ireland are the responsibility of the health minister in the Northern Ireland Executive, but that if the Northern Ireland Assembly was not formed by the end of the year, the government will need to take action. In a letter to MLAs, the department spelled out how many millions are needed to train new doctors and nurses A government spokesperson said health and social care services in Northern Ireland were ""a devolved matter"". The spokesperson added that Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith had visited a number of health and social care facilities and ""fully understands the pressures that the sectors are facing"". ""That is why he is doing everything he can to get the Stormont institutions back up and running as soon as possible, in order that local politicians make decisions affecting everyone in Northern Ireland. ""The secretary of state will consider the recommendations contained in the report and respond in due course."" The letter, meanwhile, which the Department of Health sent to MLAs who lead on health in Northern Ireland's political parties, spells out the specific pressures under which it is operating. The issues include: Waiting Lists - the department estimates that about Â£100m a year would be required to tackle hospital backlogs; Pay parity - the department says that offering Northern Ireland staff parity with wages in Great Britain would add Â£103m to the bill; Employers' contributions to staff pensions - this is a UK-wide issue and could cost Â£144m; Ambulance service - an investment of up to Â£30m is needed for its new clinical response model; Medical training - up to Â£30m is needed to support graduate entry medical training places; Specialist drugs and therapies - including specific cancer therapies - could cost up to Â£26.8m; Nursing places - maintaining these could cost up to Â£42m in future years. Simon Hoare said the committee expected ""more regular updates"" on progress Northern Ireland Affairs Committee chair Simon Hoare said the health service in Northern Ireland was falling behind the rest of the UK. ""An approach to funding that simply keeps things ticking over, and an absence of over-arching strategy in key areas, has left services at breaking point and this situation must end as soon as possible,"" he said. ""We have called for the government to end the insecurity and set three year minimum budget allocations to give vital services the space to breathe and look ahead. ""We also expect more regular updates on the progress in developing strategies in key areas, particularly cancer services and mental health."" One of the key findings of the committee was that the ""transformation of Northern Ireland's health and social care services is long overdue"".

"Mali attack kills dozens of soldiersThe army calls the assault on a military post in the north-east a ""terrorist attack"".Africa","Friday's violence came a month after 38 soldiers died in an attack near the border with Burkina Faso Militants in eastern Mali have killed 49 soldiers in an attack on a military post in Indelimane in the Menaka region, the army has said. This makes it one of the deadliest assaults of the past decade. The Islamic State (IS) group said via its self-styled Amaq news outlet it was behind the attack. Mali has suffered violence since 2012, when Islamist militants took over the north. With the help of France, Mali's army has recaptured the territory. However, insecurity there continues and the violence has spread to other countries in the region. In a separate and unlinked incident on Saturday, a French soldier was killed in Liptako in the same area. Brigadier Ronan Pointeau died after his armoured vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb, the French government said in a statement. Brigadier is the equivalent of corporal. It was earlier reported that 54 soldiers had died in the attack on the military post, based on a statement by government spokesperson, Yaya Sangare. Why the Sahara is terror's new front line Reinforcements sent to the post found ""significant material damage"", Mr Sangare said. Thirty-eight soldiers died when two military camps were attacked near the border with Burkina Faso at the end of September. Mali - along with Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger and Mauritania - is part of an anti-insurgency force supported by France known as the G5 Sahel. The five-nation group blamed ""suspected members of Ansarul Islam"" for September's attack. Ansarul Islam, meaning Defenders of Islam, was created in 2016 by the radical and popular preacher Ibrahim Malam Dicko. He reportedly fought with Islamist militants in the north of Mali in 2012.

"Electric cars: Best and worst places to charge upLondon and Scotland are the best places to find charging points, while Yorkshire is the worst.Business","The government has published new league tables showing which regions of the UK have the most charging points for drivers of electric vehicles. The most per 100,000 people are in London, followed by Scotland, while Yorkshire is the worst by that measure. Outside London, Orkney and Milton Keynes have the most. But Barrow-in-Furness and Scilly each have none. The government is offering local authorities Â£5m in funding for new charging points. The government wants the UK to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Scottish Power estimates that in order to achieve this, the UK needs to have 25 million charging points for electric vehicles - the equivalent of installing 4,000 a day - and 23 million electric heat pumps to replace domestic gas boilers. And all at a cost of nearly Â£300bn. Scottish Power's chief executive, Keith Anderson, told the BBC's Today programme last month that people needed to see there was a network in place in order for them to change, for example, to cleaner modes of transport. Last month, the government announced that drivers of electric cars across the UK could soon be using special green number plates under new plans. The aim is to make it possible for local authorities to allow zero-emission vehicles to benefit from incentives such as cheaper parking. The government hopes it will boost electric car sales, helping it achieve its 2050 target of net zero emissions. But Friends of the Earth said that without better financial incentives and more charging points, little would change. Despite being on the rise, all-electric vehicles still represent only a fraction of total car sales and there are challenges to uptake, including a lack of charging points on roads and too few low-cost models. The government said a similar licence plate scheme, introduced on a trial basis in the Canadian province of Ontario, had led to an increase in electric vehicle registrations. Critics say it could foster resentment and a scrappage scheme for fuel-burning cars would be better. While the cars can be expensive compared to petrol ones, they are also challenging to make commercially from scratch. In October, Dyson, the technology company best known for its vacuum cleaners, scrapped a project to build electric cars. The firm, headed by British inventor Sir James Dyson, said its engineers had developed a ""fantastic electric car"", but that it would not hit the roads because it was not ""commercially viable"". In an email sent to all employees, Sir James said the company had unsuccessfully tried to find a buyer for the project. The division employed 500 UK workers.

German city declares a âNazi emergencyâThe politician behind the resolution says he wanted the city to take a stand against the far-right.,"The anti-Islam Pegida movement began in Dresden in 2014 A city in eastern Germany has declared a ""Nazi emergency"", saying it has a serious problem with the far-right. Dresden, the capital of Saxony, has long been viewed as a bastion of the far-right and is the birthplace of the anti-Islam Pegida movement. Councillors in the city - a contender for the 2025 European Capital of Culture - have now approved a resolution saying more needs to be done to tackle the issue. But opponents say it goes too far. ""'Nazinotstand' means - similar to the climate emergency - that we have a serious problem. The open democratic society is threatened,"" local councillor Max Aschenbach, who tabled the motion, told the BBC. Mr Aschenbach, from left-leaning satirical political party Die Partei, said he believed it was necessary to take action because politicians were not doing enough to ""position themselves clearly"" against the far-right. Who is in Germany's Pegida movement? German parties outraged as neo-Nazi elected mayor Germany's far-right AfD: Victim or victor? ""The request was an attempt to change that. I also wanted to know what kind of people I'm sitting with in the city council of Dresden,"" he said. The resolution acknowledges that ""right-wing extremist attitudes and actions... are occurring with increasing frequency"" and calls on the city to help victims of far-right violence, protect minorities and strengthen democracy. Mr Aschenbach said adopting the motion showed the city council's commitment to fostering ""a free, liberal, democratic society that protects minorities and resolutely opposes Nazis."" Mr Aschenbach's resolution was put to a vote by Dresden's city council on Wednesday night and approved by 39 votes to 29, according to local media reports. Germany's governing Christian Democrats (CDU) were among those to reject the resolution. ""From our point of view, this was primarily an intended provocation,"" Jan Donhauser, chairman of the CDU City Council Group, told the BBC. ""'State of emergency' means the collapse or a serious threat to public order. That is not given rudimentarily. Furthermore, the focus on 'right-wing extremism' does not do justice to what we need. We are the guardians of the liberal-democratic basic order and no violence, no matter from which extremist side it comes, is compatible with it,"" he said. Mr Donhauser added that the ""vast majority"" of Dresdeners were ""neither right-wing extremists nor anti-democratic"". Mr Aschenbach said the city was not obliged to take any action following the adoption of his resolution, but that ""theoretically, existing measures should be given a higher priority and future decisions should follow this."" While opposing the resolution, the CDU said it hopes to ""strengthen the institutions that are best suited to combating politically motivated violence."" Kai Arzheimer, a German politics professor who has written extensively on far-right extremism, said the resolution's main impact was symbolic, but that it could mean that more money would be allocated to programmes combating extremism in the future. ""I don't think that any other German city has declared a 'Nazi emergency'. Resolutions against right-wing extremism are not so uncommon, however,"" he said. Dresden has long been known for its links to the far right. In the early 1990s, neo-Nazi groups began staging rallies there to remember what they called ""the bombing Holocaust"", when the city was bombed by British and American forces in 1945, Mr Arzheimer said. These groups went on to become active in surrounding areas and in southern Saxony. The state of Saxony has also long been a stronghold of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) and later the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. In state elections in September,support for the AfD surged, up 17.8% from 2014 to finish on 27.5%. Dresden is also where the anti-Islam Pegida (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West) movement began in 2014, and where it continues to hold rallies. This video can not be played Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West (Pegida) have held weekly protests since October Pegida supporters say people need to ""wake up"" to the threat of Islamist extremists.

"Labour pledges 'zero carbon' homes by 2022New builds would have solar panels and super-efficient insulation, the party says.UK","The plans would involve installing ""super-efficient"" insulation in new homes Labour is promising to make all new-build homes ""zero carbon"" within three years, in an effort to curb housing shortages and tackle climate change. A Labour government would introduce ""tough"" standards for new builds which would see homes fitted with solar panels and not having gas boilers. The party says it would save Â£200 a year per house in energy bills. The Conservative Party described the plan as ""unrealistic"" and said it would slow house building. The proposals would mean the day-to-day running of the new homes would not add extra carbon to the atmosphere. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, on the campaign trail in Swindon on Saturday, said: ""There is no greater issue facing this world than the environmental disaster waiting to happen and the climate change that is happening very obviously all around us."" Central heating boilers 'threaten climate goals' Big lifestyle changes 'needed to cut emissions' UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 During a speech to supporters at Commonweal Sixth Form College, Mr Corbyn also responded to US President Donald Trump's recent remark thathe would be ""so bad"" as prime minister. Labour is hoping to take Swindon's two Conservative-held seats in next month's election He said Mr Trump was ""entitled to his choice"", adding: ""I'm prepared, as our Labour government, to meet anybody and put to them our views on peace, on justice, on human rights, on environmental sustainability, because our government will be a force for all of those things all over the world."" Mr Corbyn went on to say he would not back Nicola Sturgeon's call for a second referendum on Scottish independence. ""I think the much better option is a Labour government for the whole of the UK,"" he said. The speech also saw the Labour leader promise to end privatisation of the NHS, and lay out his plan to negotiate a new Brexit deal before offering the country a second referendum, which would include an option to stay in the EU. Reaching out to Leave and Remain voters, he said: ""Both of you need a Labour government that's going to bring people together."" Labour says their pledge to make all new-build homes 'zero carbon' by 2022 would be achieved through better efficiency standards and using low carbon and renewable energy sources. New homes would not be fitted with fossil fuel heating systems, such as gas boilers, as standard and would have ""super-efficient insulation"" and triple-glazed windows. The last Labour government introduced regulations to make all homes ""zero carbon"" by 2016, but it was scrapped by the Conservatives six months before it was due to come into force, Labour said. This video can not be played The eco-friendly council estate that won an architecture award Asked about the added cost of installing greener heating, Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey said it would be a ""relatively small"" sum compared to the total cost of new builds. ""It's totally do-able without big price increases,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. ""We really should be looking to house builders to absorb these costs as well because this is an industry, in recent years, that has made billions in profits and paid millions in bonuses to top executives,"" he said. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""As usual, Labour are setting unrealistic targets that would slow down house-building and put up house prices. ""Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are taking a practical, sensible approach to reducing emissions from homes. We are introducing a 'future homes standard' that will ensure new homes meet reductions in emissions by a third by 2020, and world-leading by 2025.""

Thousands invited to citizens' climate assembly,"The public are being asked for their views on how to tackle climate change Letters are being sent to 30,000 households across the UK inviting people to join a citizens' assembly on climate change. Once participants are selected, the assembly will meet next year, with the outcome of their discussions reported back to Parliament. The initiative, set up by cross party MPs, will look at what members of the public can do to reduce CO2. The UK government has committed to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Spain offers to host climate summit in Madrid Climate change 'making mountaineering riskier' Sea level rise to affect 'three times more people' Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee, one of six select committees who commissioned the climate assembly, said a clear roadmap was needed to achieve this goal. ""Finding solutions which are equitable and have public support will be crucial,"" she said. ""Parliament needs to work with the people and with government to address the challenge of climate change."" The invitees to Climate Assembly UK have been selected at random from across the UK. From those who respond, 110 people will be chosen as a representative sample of the population. They will meet over four weekends from late January in Birmingham, and will discuss topics ranging from transport to household energy use. A citizens' assembly has been a key demand of the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, whose protests caused widespread disruption this year. The group said they welcomed this as a first step, but warned that the assembly should be focussing on cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 not 2050. Spokesperson Linda Doyle said: ""Waiting 30 years to reach zero net carbon emissions is a death sentence to people around the world and in the UK - it gives us a higher chance of breaching irreversible tipping points as the climate breaks down and it only serves short term 'business as usual'."" Environmental group Friends of the Earth said citizens' assemblies could play an important part in policy-making. Dave Timms, head of political affairs at FOE, said: ""Tackling the climate emergency with the speed required will require radical changes to our economy, infrastructure and even to society so it's important that there is a consensus among citizens. ""Much of what needs to be done already commands widespread public support and it is politicians that just need to bloody-well get on with it now."" Citizens' assemblies have been used in a number of countries around the world. In Ireland, a panel of 99 people was established in 2016 to look at a range of political questions, including abortion. They recommended that the country should overturn its ban and suggested a referendum, which went on to support repeal.

Electric cars: Best and worst places to charge up,"The government has published new league tables showing which regions of the UK have the most charging points for drivers of electric vehicles. The most per 100,000 people are in London, followed by Scotland, while Yorkshire is the worst by that measure. Outside London, Orkney and Milton Keynes have the most. But Barrow-in-Furness and Scilly each have none. The government is offering local authorities Â£5m in funding for new charging points. The government wants the UK to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Scottish Power estimates that in order to achieve this, the UK needs to have 25 million charging points for electric vehicles - the equivalent of installing 4,000 a day - and 23 million electric heat pumps to replace domestic gas boilers. And all at a cost of nearly Â£300bn. Scottish Power's chief executive, Keith Anderson, told the BBC's Today programme last month that people needed to see there was a network in place in order for them to change, for example, to cleaner modes of transport. Last month, the government announced that drivers of electric cars across the UK could soon be using special green number plates under new plans. The aim is to make it possible for local authorities to allow zero-emission vehicles to benefit from incentives such as cheaper parking. The government hopes it will boost electric car sales, helping it achieve its 2050 target of net zero emissions. But Friends of the Earth said that without better financial incentives and more charging points, little would change. Despite being on the rise, all-electric vehicles still represent only a fraction of total car sales and there are challenges to uptake, including a lack of charging points on roads and too few low-cost models. The government said a similar licence plate scheme, introduced on a trial basis in the Canadian province of Ontario, had led to an increase in electric vehicle registrations. Critics say it could foster resentment and a scrappage scheme for fuel-burning cars would be better. While the cars can be expensive compared to petrol ones, they are also challenging to make commercially from scratch. In October, Dyson, the technology company best known for its vacuum cleaners, scrapped a project to build electric cars. The firm, headed by British inventor Sir James Dyson, said its engineers had developed a ""fantastic electric car"", but that it would not hit the roads because it was not ""commercially viable"". In an email sent to all employees, Sir James said the company had unsuccessfully tried to find a buyer for the project. The division employed 500 UK workers.

European snub fuels frustration in Balkans,"The message on the EU's office in North Macedonia reads ""EU for You"" but that is not the message Macedonians are hearing now It was the diplomatic equivalent of the EU offering a handshake and then thumbing its nose instead. North Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev was left grasping thin air as the prospect of EU accession talks was snatched away. France's Emmanuel Macron played the part of antagonist-in-chief. Mr Macron said ""Non"" when all the other EU leaders were in favour of giving the formal go-ahead to membership negotiations with North Macedonia. Neighbouring Albania was given the brush-off too. The EU's snub also sent a grim message across the Balkans - to would-be members Kosovo and Bosnia and even Serbia and Montenegro, which are both many years into membership negotiations. The French veto did not exactly leave North Macedonia's leader lying on the ground in a crumpled heap, but it did make a mockery of his assertion that changing the country's name would open the door to accession. For 27 years, Greece had rejected the name Macedonia because of its region of the same name. The dispute came to an end only in January after a hard-won agreement and a series of difficult votes. For young Macedonians especially the rejection comes as a blow, setting back the European aspirations of a new generation. Mr Macron and Mr Zaev during more optimistic times, at a meeting in May The government has already paid the price. It will not see out its full five-year term, but will head into early elections next April. N Macedonia calls snap poll after EU talks setback How they solved a 27-year name row Greece and N Macedonia bury hatchet with selfie ""No-one here believed we would become a member state tomorrow, but we were fully prepared for negotiations,"" says Ivana Tufegdzik, an MP in the governing coalition. ""So many European prime ministers and presidents said that the [name-change] agreement, referendum and constitutional changes would open the door to the EU. Even President Macron said that in a video to the Macedonian people."" ""The expectations were so high. And suddenly there was the wrong message."" Mr Zaev bet all his political capital on the name change putting North Macedonia on the road to EU membership. Now he faces a massive challenge, convincing voters that he is still the leader to drive the country forward. And the opposition are delighted to portray the situation as a failure for Mr Zaev and his Social Democrats. ""We said the government in Skopje was not doing enough to persuade the EU to open membership negotiations,"" says Stefan Andonovski, a foreign policy adviser to the leadership of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE party. ""The government has not been listening to the alarms coming from the EU that we really have problems on the inside. The fight against corruption has been stagnant - we have had many scandals. The only reforms have been on the name issue; not much has been done in other areas."" Some of these points are valid. Anti-corruption efforts have been shaken by the arrest of the country's leading special prosecutor. Katica Janeva is facing allegations of abuse of office and accepting bribes. And the EU's commissioner for enlargement, Johannes Hahn, had warned that Skopje's failure to reform the judiciary put EU membership talks at risk. Yet the opposition's comments should also be taken with a pinch of salt. The party officially remains committed to EU accession talks. But at the same time, it has a policy of reversing the country's name change. That would end the hard-won detente with neighbouring Greece and scupper any chance of membership negotiations. This poster in Skopje rejects the new name, insisting ""Our name is Macedonia"" Despite the latest knock-back, reactions in North Macedonia have been relatively low-key. There have been no large-scale protests or acts of violence. After almost three decades of diplomatic blockage, people have become hardened to disappointment. But young people in particular may take the view that their future lies elsewhere, exacerbating the population decline which is already a serious issue. ""It's devastating for people who hoped we would have quick changes,"" says Blazhen Mileski, who works with youth pressure group Reactor. ""We will see more direct action from young people to leave, go to the EU and live there. People don't have a clear idea of what EU wants from us. Young people will see their future outside the country, because they don't see an EU path."" This video can not be played European Council leader Donald Tusk lashes out at EU leaders: ""Personally I think it was a mistake."" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called the French veto ""an historic mistake"", warning that it would seriously compromise the EU's influence across the Western Balkans. There have already been consequences. The leader of the party that won the most votes in Kosovo's recent parliamentary election has suggested scrapping the European Integration Ministry. And Serbia could sign a free trade agreement with the Russia-dominated Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) without worrying too much about the implications. Ever the mischief-maker, Moscow has floated the possibility of inviting Albania and North Macedonia to join the EAEU as well - a suggestion immediately shot down by Mr Zaev. All of North Macedonia's political parties insist they remain focused on getting EU membership talks underway. And the confirmation of Nato membership, which should arrive within the next few months, will be a significant consolation. But EU accession negotiations were supposed to provide the structure to bring North Macedonia under the rule of law. And as long as Emmanuel Macron remains in charge in France, it is difficult to see how those talks can start.

Underground fire rises above city centre streetAn electrical fault caused the flames that emerged on a street in Birmingham in big flashes.Birmingham & Black CountryThe German city that declared a 'Nazi emergency'The politician behind the resolution says he wanted the city to take a stand against the far-right.,"This video can not be played Gasps as underground fire rises from city street Part of a street in Birmingham city centre was cordoned off after an underground fire reached above the surface in big flashes of flame. West Midlands Police said the flames seen on New Street shortly before 17:00 GMT were caused by an electrical fault below. West Midlands Fire Service said it had been liaising with power suppliers to deal with the problem. There were no reports of injuries, police said. Shoppers and workers who were about to make their way home shared images of the scene, where tram travel was disrupted. The fire service said it would tackle the blaze from within a service hatch, once the electrics were isolated by engineers. A Western Power Distribution spokesman said 103 properties had been affected by a power outage as a result of a fault with a junction box. He added that power had been restored to 60 properties by 19:00 GMT, and the remaining properties should have their power restored by 01:30 on Saturday.

The German city that declared a 'Nazi emergency'The politician behind the resolution says he wanted the city to take a stand against the far-right.,"The anti-Islam Pegida movement began in Dresden in 2014 A city in eastern Germany has declared a ""Nazi emergency"", saying it has a serious problem with the far-right. Dresden, the capital of Saxony, has long been viewed as a bastion of the far-right and is the birthplace of the anti-Islam Pegida movement. Councillors in the city - a contender for the 2025 European Capital of Culture - have now approved a resolution saying more needs to be done to tackle the issue. But opponents say it goes too far. ""'Nazinotstand' means - similar to the climate emergency - that we have a serious problem. The open democratic society is threatened,"" local councillor Max Aschenbach, who tabled the motion, told the BBC. Mr Aschenbach, from left-leaning satirical political party Die Partei, said he believed it was necessary to take action because politicians were not doing enough to ""position themselves clearly"" against the far-right. Who is in Germany's Pegida movement? German parties outraged as neo-Nazi elected mayor Germany's far-right AfD: Victim or victor? ""The request was an attempt to change that. I also wanted to know what kind of people I'm sitting with in the city council of Dresden,"" he said. The resolution acknowledges that ""right-wing extremist attitudes and actions... are occurring with increasing frequency"" and calls on the city to help victims of far-right violence, protect minorities and strengthen democracy. Mr Aschenbach said adopting the motion showed the city council's commitment to fostering ""a free, liberal, democratic society that protects minorities and resolutely opposes Nazis."" Mr Aschenbach's resolution was put to a vote by Dresden's city council on Wednesday night and approved by 39 votes to 29, according to local media reports. Germany's governing Christian Democrats (CDU) were among those to reject the resolution. ""From our point of view, this was primarily an intended provocation,"" Jan Donhauser, chairman of the CDU City Council Group, told the BBC. ""'State of emergency' means the collapse or a serious threat to public order. That is not given rudimentarily. Furthermore, the focus on 'right-wing extremism' does not do justice to what we need. We are the guardians of the liberal-democratic basic order and no violence, no matter from which extremist side it comes, is compatible with it,"" he said. Mr Donhauser added that the ""vast majority"" of Dresdeners were ""neither right-wing extremists nor anti-democratic"". Mr Aschenbach said the city was not obliged to take any action following the adoption of his resolution, but that ""theoretically, existing measures should be given a higher priority and future decisions should follow this."" While opposing the resolution, the CDU said it hopes to ""strengthen the institutions that are best suited to combating politically motivated violence."" Kai Arzheimer, a German politics professor who has written extensively on far-right extremism, said the resolution's main impact was symbolic, but that it could mean that more money would be allocated to programmes combating extremism in the future. ""I don't think that any other German city has declared a 'Nazi emergency'. Resolutions against right-wing extremism are not so uncommon, however,"" he said. Dresden has long been known for its links to the far right. In the early 1990s, neo-Nazi groups began staging rallies there to remember what they called ""the bombing Holocaust"", when the city was bombed by British and American forces in 1945, Mr Arzheimer said. These groups went on to become active in surrounding areas and in southern Saxony. The state of Saxony has also long been a stronghold of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) and later the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. In state elections in September,support for the AfD surged, up 17.8% from 2014 to finish on 27.5%. Dresden is also where the anti-Islam Pegida (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West) movement began in 2014, and where it continues to hold rallies. This video can not be played Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West (Pegida) have held weekly protests since October Pegida supporters say people need to ""wake up"" to the threat of Islamist extremists. They want Germany to curb immigration and accuse the authorities of failing to enforce existing laws. The movement has spurred large counter-rallies in the city. Who is in Germany's Pegida movement?

Bacteria dislodged by hospital clean-up work,"Work to clean up a hospital bacteria outbreak inadvertently led to more contamination, new documents reveal. Brain surgery was postponed at Edinburgh's Western General in March after a small number of patients contracted the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bug from showers and taps in a ward. A decontamination programme was ordered by NHS Lothian. But documents released by health watchdogs show this work is believed to have caused further problems. Surgeries cancelled after infection found Children's hospital delayed until autumn next year Health Protection Scotland (HPS) papers show a shower in the hospital's department of clinical neurosciences twice tested negative for the bacteria following the outbreak, and patients were allowed to keep using it. But later tests on the shower were positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa - a common bacteria that can be harmful to patients who are very vulnerable to infection - and it was taken out of service. HPS reports, released after a Freedom of Information request, show the ""current hypothesis is that remedial plumbing, extensive flushing and water pressure may have dislodged biofilm (a collection of microorganisms such as bacteria) within the water systems leading to the contamination in the recent samples"". NHS Lothian said it followed national testing guidelines and the dislodging of the biofilm did not lead to any further patient infections. It added that once the bug was identified, it was immediately taken out of use. What is Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection? The department of clinical neurosciences had been due to move into the new children's hospital in July but thatmove was postponed due to safety fearsabout the new complex and it is not expected to move there until spring next year. Tom Waterson, Scotland health committee chair at trade union Unison, said: ""The outbreak was a concern for patients and staff alike. ""They have been desperate to leave that facility because it is in dire need of modernisation and they were meant to have moved out of there months ago. ""My concern is that we now know there had been doubts about the move to the new building for a long time so why was there not more done on the maintenance of the neuroscience department."" The Scottish government has said it will provide about Â£6m in funding to help keep the existing Sick Kids hospital and neuroscience department up to scratch until the new facility is open next year. The department of clinical neurosciences is due to move into Edinburgh's new children's hospital next spring A total of 47 patients had elective procedures cancelled and rearranged as a result of the March outbreak. Further positive samples for the bug were identified in July and since then 18 samples (out of 2,926 taken) have tested positive for what the health board described as ""very low counts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa"". A spokeswoman for NHS Lothian said: ""The water sampling regime used is a national protocol for assessing Pseudomonas aeruginosa regardless of how the bacteria entered the water. ""As part of that protocol, outlets continue to be tested after remedial works have been carried out. ""On identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in shower water, the shower was immediately removed from patient use so that no patient exposure could occur."" It is not known what happened to the patients who contracted the bug in March as NHS Lothian said it was ""unable to discuss individual patients and their outcomes"".

England rugby fan: 'Mates dared me to go to Japan',"""Four or five pints down"" is how rugby fan, Rob Lewis, describes himself when his mates set him a challenge last Saturday morning. They were watching England's semi-final win over New Zealand in the World Cup when: ""They said 'you wouldn't go to Japan' and I'm like, 'yeah, I would.'"" So, Rob immediately booked a flight to Tokyo via Paris for Â£650. The lack of a hotel room or match tickets didn't stop him, neither did being on crutches after a recent knee operation. Some might call him impulsive, but Newsbeat wanted to know more about Rob's adventure, so we followed his journey. Rob starts scouring Twitter for tickets. ""I got an offer from someone who I believe is a legit seller and handed over Â£1,000 for two tickets,"" says Rob, 36, who's from Sunbury on Thames. Oh Rob, was that really such a good idea? He tells Newsbeat he is nervous, but that he has ""good faith in humanity."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"People found dead in lorry were all VietnameseEssex Police says officers are in ""direct contact"" with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK.Essex","Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong's families are concerned they may be among the victims All 39 people found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex were Vietnamese, police have said. The victims were found in a container on an industrial estate last week and were initially thought to be Chinese. But Essex Police said it was now in ""direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK"" and the Vietnamese government. A number of Vietnamese families have previously come forward fearing their loved ones are among the dead. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on the night of 22 October - the day before the 39 people were found dead - saying her ""trip to a foreign land has failed"". Post-mortem examinations are being carried out on the 31 men and eight women to establish the cause of death. Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said: ""At this time, we believe the victims are Vietnamese nationals, and we are in contact with the Vietnamese Government."" He said police were not in a position to identify any of the victims. The bodies were discovered in the lorry trailer in the early hours of 23 October The Vietnamese Embassy in London said it was ""deeply saddened"" and sent its ""heartfelt condolences"" to the families of the victims. ""Specific identities of the victims still need to be identified and confirmed by the relevant authorities of Vietnam and UK,"" it said. It said it would ""closely co-ordinate with the relevant authorities of Vietnam and UK to support the families of the Vietnamese victims, if any, to bring their loved ones home"". Extradition proceedings launched over lorry deaths Why are Vietnamese people trying to reach the UK? Lorry death agony builds for Vietnamese families The father of 30-year-old Le Van Ha, who comes from an agricultural part of Vietnam, previously told the BBC he was convinced his son was among the dead. VietHome, a popular Vietnamese community forum in the UK, said it had passed on the pictures of almost 20 people who have been reported missing to detectives. Earlier, police in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province said they had charged two unnamed people with ""organising or brokering illegal immigration"". Le Minh Tuan, pictured here, fears his son Le Van Ha was among the dead in Essex The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court on Monday charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dubin on a European Arrest Warrant. Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. On 21 December 2020, the Crown Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, found Eamonn Harrison, 24 of Newry, County Down, and Gheorghe Nica, 43 of Basildon, Essex, guilty of manslaughter and Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, admitted assisting unlawful immigration. All defendants were sentenced in January 2021.

Police in body plea to Margaret Fleming's killersEdward Cairney and Avril Jones are urged to reveal what they did with the body of the woman missing since 1999.,"Cairney and Jones spent 20 years pretending that Ms Fleming was still alive The couple jailed for the murder of Margaret Fleming have been urged to reveal what they did with her body. Police issued a direct appeal to Edward Cairney and Avril Jones on what would have been Margaret's 39th birthday. The vulnerable teenager was under their care in Inverkip, on the Clyde coast, when she vanished in 1999. But Jones continued to claim Â£182,000 in benefits until it finally emerged Margaret was missing in October 2016. The teenager who was forgotten for 17 years The day I interviewed Margaret's killers How do you solve a murder without a body? Cairney, 77, and Jones, 59, were ordered to serve a minimum of 14 years afterthey were convicted at the High Court in Glasgow earlier this year.

Margaret Fleming's body has never been found Det Supt Livingstone has lodged formal requests with Cairney and Jones' lawyers asking for information and has reiterated a previous offer for a face-to-face meeting. He added: ""Margaret was a very vulnerable young woman when she was abused, neglected, manipulated and murdered. It's only right that her family and friends get the opportunity to pay their final respects."" The senior officer also stressed the fact there has been convictions does not mean police would not act on any new information. Det Supt Livingstone said: "" It's very important that she is given the funeral she deserves and for her family to be able to pay their respects to her. ""I would say again to Eddie Cairney and Avril Jones - your lies have caught up with you, so now do the decent thing and let Margaret's family know what has happened to her."" Det Supt Paul Livingstone led the Margaret Fleming murder investigation Margaret had been living with the couple for about two years when she disappeared. During this time detectives said they subjected her to a ""living hell"". But despite a painstaking search of their dilapidated property and its garden and an exhaustive proof of life investigation no trace of her has ever been found. Testimony from Avril's brother, Richard Jones, was used to pinpoint the last independent sighting of the teenager on 17 December, 1999. Three weeks later, on 5 January, 2000, Avril told her mother, Florence Jones, Margaret had run off with a traveller. A major search of the Seacroft cottage in Inverkip, Inverkip was carried out by police Cairney and Jones, who had no previous convictions, then embarked on a cover up which involved bogus letters and erasing all trace of Margaret from their home. Police Scotland launched a missing persons' investigation after social work raised the alarm in October 2016. The couple were both convicted of murder but only Jones was found guilty of benefit fraud as the teenager's money was paid directly into her account. Despite no evidence to the contrary they maintained Margaret was still alive and often returned to visit them. Sentencing the pair the judge, Lord Matthews,told them,external: ""Only you two know the truth. Only you know where her remains are.""

There was extra excitement at Crewe and Nantwich Rugby Club as their former player Tom Curry was lining up for England. ""We are really excited and are hoping Tom has a great game,"" said coach John Farr earlier. ""He's had a great tournament so far."" Tom Curry has played every minute of England's World Cup campaign Mr Farr said there would be ""bacon butties and beer"" and forecast some ""sore heads on Sunday"". ""We are really, really proud that a player who has taken to the field in a Crewe and Nantwich shirt is gong to go out and hopefully lift the Webb Ellis trophy,"" he said. A crowded clubhouse was also expected at Manchester Rugby Club in Cheadle Hulme where England's Ben Spencer used to play.

Prince Harry met wheelchair rugby players in Tokyo before the World Cup final The town that gave its name to the game - Rugby in Warwickshire - was also gearing up for the World Cup. James Reeve, the landlord of the Merchant Inn, opened up early and said even Springbok supporters were welcome. ""I've got some good friends that are South Africans who live in Rugby so I'm really looking forward to that rivalry and banter we'll have,"" he said. Meanwhile in Birmingham, newlyweds Rosie and Ken Marshall were facing an early test of their marriage as they cheered for competing sides, having spent their honeymoon in Japan following the World Cup. ""Rosie and I will be happy for the other whatever the result - even if bragging rights will be decided for the next four years,"" said Mr Marshall, 37, originally from Johannesburg.

The German city that declared a 'Nazi emergency',"The anti-Islam Pegida movement began in Dresden in 2014 A city in eastern Germany has declared a ""Nazi emergency"", saying it has a serious problem with the far-right. Dresden, the capital of Saxony, has long been viewed as a bastion of the far-right and is the birthplace of the anti-Islam Pegida movement. Councillors in the city - a contender for the 2025 European Capital of Culture - have now approved a resolution saying more needs to be done to tackle the issue. But opponents say it goes too far. ""'Nazinotstand' means - similar to the climate emergency - that we have a serious problem. The open democratic society is threatened,"" local councillor Max Aschenbach, who tabled the motion, told the BBC. Mr Aschenbach, from left-leaning satirical political party Die Partei, said he believed it was necessary to take action because politicians were not doing enough to ""position themselves clearly"" against the far-right. Who is in Germany's Pegida movement? German parties outraged as neo-Nazi elected mayor Germany's far-right AfD: Victim or victor? ""The request was an attempt to change that. I also wanted to know what kind of people I'm sitting with in the city council of Dresden,"" he said. The resolution acknowledges that ""right-wing extremist attitudes and actions... are occurring with increasing frequency"" and calls on the city to help victims of far-right violence, protect minorities and strengthen democracy. Mr Aschenbach said adopting the motion showed the city council's commitment to fostering ""a free, liberal, democratic society that protects minorities and resolutely opposes Nazis."" Mr Aschenbach's resolution was put to a vote by Dresden's city council on Wednesday night and approved by 39 votes to 29, according to local media reports. Germany's governing Christian Democrats (CDU) were among those to reject the resolution. ""From our point of view, this was primarily an intended provocation,"" Jan Donhauser, chairman of the CDU City Council Group, told the BBC. ""'State of emergency' means the collapse or a serious threat to public order. That is not given rudimentarily. Furthermore, the focus on 'right-wing extremism' does not do justice to what we need. We are the guardians of the liberal-democratic basic order and no violence, no matter from which extremist side it comes, is compatible with it,"" he said. Mr Donhauser added that the ""vast majority"" of Dresdeners were ""neither right-wing extremists nor anti-democratic"". Mr Aschenbach said the city was not obliged to take any action following the adoption of his resolution, but that ""theoretically, existing measures should be given a higher priority and future decisions should follow this."" While opposing the resolution, the CDU said it hopes to ""strengthen the institutions that are best suited to combating politically motivated violence."" Kai Arzheimer, a German politics professor who has written extensively on far-right extremism, said the resolution's main impact was symbolic, but that it could mean that more money would be allocated to programmes combating extremism in the future. ""I don't think that any other German city has declared a 'Nazi emergency'. Resolutions against right-wing extremism are not so uncommon, however,"" he said. Dresden has long been known for its links to the far right. In the early 1990s, neo-Nazi groups began staging rallies there to remember what they called ""the bombing Holocaust"", when the city was bombed by British and American forces in 1945, Mr Arzheimer said. These groups went on to become active in surrounding areas and in southern Saxony. The state of Saxony has also long been a stronghold of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) and later the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. In state elections in September,support for the AfD surged, up 17.8% from 2014 to finish on 27.5%. Dresden is also where the anti-Islam Pegida (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West) movement began in 2014, and where it continues to hold rallies. This video can not be played Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West (Pegida) have held weekly protests since October Pegida supporters say people need to ""wake up"" to the threat of Islamist extremists. They want Germany to curb immigration and accuse the authorities of failing to enforce existing laws. The movement has spurred large counter-rallies in the city. Who is in Germany's Pegida movement?

Where are England's World Cup finalists from?,"England have seen off all-comers so far and have been training hard for the final against South Africa The hopes of a nation will be decided on Saturday as England take on South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final. But what is the background of the players in the so-far successful squad? Facing the Springboks in Yokohama is a group mostly born in the south but which includes players from five other nations. England's number eight, Billy Vunipola, and his brother, Mako, were born in New Zealand and Australia respectively. They first moved to the UK in 1998 when their father, Fe'ao, played for Pontypool in Wales. They later moved to England. Joe Cokanasiga was born in Fiji and moved to England when he was three, while his father served in the British Army. Other players with overseas birthplaces include Sam Underhill, who was born in Ohio in the USA, Willi Heinz, who is from New Zealand, and Manu Tuilagi, who was born in Samoa and came to England as a child to be with his older brothers who were Samoa internationals playing for club sides in the UK. Toqualify to play in the England squad,external, team members must have been born in or have a parent or grandparent who was born in the country. They would also qualify if they have lived in England for at least three consecutive years. Overall, 16 of the English-born team members were from either the South East, South West or London, with the remaining 10 from the East Midlands, North West or east of England. Yorkshire and the Humber, the West Midlands and the North East were the only unrepresented regions. John Williams, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Leicester, said the representation of players across the country was a result of the traditional geography of rugby union and rugby league. Whether they were born in London, Truro or Samoa, the England players have carried the nations' hopes through the tournament so far ""In the south, rugby was shaped by ex-public school boys who valued amateurism,"" he said. ""The north of England is where they have professional rugby league."" Before 1995, rugby union players were not allowed to be paid. Prof Williams said this was a throw-back to when union was considered a middle and upper class game, with players being affluent enough not to need an income from the sport. ""People in the north started to play rugby league and saw no reason why players shouldn't be paid,"" he added, saying this was influenced by the working class backgrounds of league players at the time. ""There are few union clubs in the north that have been able to establish themselves in the recent elite level of the game but clubs have continued to thrive in some of those original southern heartlands."" Owen Farrell, George Ford, Maro Itoje and Jack Singleton all attended the same school Although born in different areas, four of the team members, Owen Farrell, George Ford, Maro Itoje and Jack Singleton all attended the same school in Hertfordshire. St George's School, in Harpenden, is a comprehensive school for students aged 11 to 18. Current head of rugby, Neil Harris, said students would be ""incredibly proud"" of the players ""no matter what happens on Saturday"". ""The manner in which they've conducted themselves makes them exceptional role models for our current boys,"" he added. WATCH: Schools record Sweet Chariot England team unchanged for South Africa match How to win a World Cup Joe Cokanasiga on World Rugby 'breakthrough' shortlist Mr Harris said St George's plays rugby during two terms of the year while many independent schools only played it for one. But it was ""just one piece of the jigsaw"" that allowed Farrell, Ford, Itoje and Singleton to flourish, he added. ""We do Saturday fixtures from September through to Easter,"" he said. ""For a state school to play so many fixtures, it makes us unique"". Wishing the former students luck in the world cup final, Mr Harris said: ""We know they'll work exceptionally hard, they'll give everything."" The full England squad has a combined weight of 520 stone - about the weight of two adult male hippos The average (median) age of the full 32-man England squad is 27-and-a-half. Willi Heinz and Dan Cole are the joint oldest members, at 32, while Tom Curry and Joe Cokanasiga are the joint youngest, aged 21. The squad has an average of 36 caps per player, with Dan Cole boasting the most - with 94 appearances. Unsurprisingly, the team isn't small, with an average height of six feet and one inch (186 cm) and an average weight of about 16 stone (103 kg). Courtney Lawes is the tallest player, standing about five inches above the average at 6ft 6ins (200 cm), while Billy Vunipola brings nearly 20 stone (127 kg) to the field as the heaviest player.

England unchanged for final,"This video can not be played Rugby World Cup final: England will play without fear - Eddie Jones Rugby World Cup final: England v South Africa Venue:Yokohama International StadiumDate:Saturday, 2 NovemberKick-off:09:00 GMT Coverage:Live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. England head coach Eddie Jones says his team are ready to produce their finest hour after naming an unchanged team for Saturday's World Cup final against South Africa. Captain Owen Farrell, leading try-scorer Jonny May and prop Kyle Sinckler have all been passed fit after carrying knocks from the semi-final win over New Zealand. Farrell stays at inside centre with George Ford once again picked at fly-half, while scrum-half Ben Spencer is on the bench after flying out last weekend as emergency cover following an injury to Willi Heinz. Jones said: ""We know South Africa are going to come at us, and we're going to come at them even harder. ""I've got no doubt that they'll play better, but we'll play better - we will play with no fear. ""We're confident in the game we have and we're confident in the way we've prepared. ""We're ready to go. Hang on to your seats, because it's the last dip of the rollercoaster."" England produced what many critics described as the greatest performance in their history to see off three-time world champions New Zealand 19-7 last Saturday. SA wing Kolbe returns to face England 'George Ford has moved out of Owen Farrell's shadow' Wales v New Zealand: Owen Lane to start as one of nine changes Rugby Union Weekly at the World Cup The form shown by the 10-12 combination of Ford and Farrell and the outstanding displays of Sinckler, Maro Itoje, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have persuaded Jones - in his 50th game in charge of the side - to stick with the same XV for the first time all tournament, despite the direct, muscular threat posed by the Springboks. Jones has the highest winning percentage of any coach to take charge of England, and a second World Cup triumph, 16 years after Sir Clive Woodward's team took the first, would be the ultimate valediction for his four sometimes controversial years in charge. He said: ""That was always our aim, to be here on 2 November in the Yokohama Stadium. ""So we've achieved one goal, but we know what's at stake in the final, and we're well prepared. ""South Africa are a different proposition - they're much more physical, they come through you at the front door, whereas New Zealand it's the front door and back door. ""We have to make adjustments, but we're ready for the brutality of the game. ""Our players have had the will to prepare. They've pushed themselves through some tough physical tasks. ""They've worked hard to get the right tactical game and they've worked hard to build the bonds between them."" Despite the youth of 21-year-old Curry and 23-year-old Underhill in the back row, this is an experienced England side, with a total of 731 caps in the starting XV. Back-row pair Sam Underhill (14) and Tom Curry (18) have just 32 caps between them And on Thursday those players were in relaxed mood despite the biggest game of their lives being just 48 hours away. Jones invited his entire 31-man squad and the English media together for morning coffee before the players were given time with their families and parents to go out around Shinjuku for lunch. On Friday they will go through one last light training run at Yokohama Stadium before returning to their hotel in central Tokyo and a team meeting led by skipper Farrell. It will be Jones' own third World Cup final after his Wallabies side were beaten by England in 2003 and the Springbok team he was helping to advise saw off England in Paris four years later. He said: ""I'll be looking back at the lessons of 2003 and 2007, and even 2011. ""You can never take anything for granted. You have to go out there and take the game. ""You might be favourites, but you have to go out there and win the game, and that's our approach on Saturday. ""I'm anxious, nervous, excited. It's always a blend of the two emotions. I'm sure South Africa are sitting in their hotel thinking the same way.""

Why do fans sing slave song?,"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot was brought to a wider audience by the Fisk Jubilee Singers The Rugby Football Union is trying to find out how a song rooted in slavery became an anthem for rugby fans. Swing Low, Sweet Chariot is a spiritual - a type of song created by African people enslaved in the US. England's supporters were rumoured to have adopted the song when a group of schoolboys began singing it at Twickenham in 1988. But now, after four rugby club members claimed they started the trend, the RFU said it wanted to find out more. Dave Hales, from Market Bosworth Rugby Club,told BBC Radio Leicester: ""We were in the North Stand having a bit of a good time, a good day. We started trying to get a few songs going. Various ones didn't really catch on. ""All of a sudden I started singing Swing Low and the next thing you know the crowd round us was singing it, then the whole North Stand seemed to be singing it, and then the whole ground seemed to be singing it. ""The atmosphere was just absolutely brilliant really. Absolutely fantastic."" The song has been adopted as an anthem by English rugby fans An existing theory is that a group ofboys from Douai School in Berkshire started singing,externalthe song at the same match, when England were playing Ireland in the Five Nations Championship. The boys were alleged to have been serenading Chris Oti, a black player, making this theory more controversial because of the song's link with slavery. But the Market Bosworth Rugby Club members at Twickenham that day - Dave Hales, John Ward, Bruce Coleman and Paul Spencer - all maintain they started singing the song first. A more controversial theory is that a group of school boys serenaded black player Chris Oti with the song Mr Ward said: ""As far as we are concerned it started after, I believe, Rory Underwood scored the first try in the second half. ""It wasn't anything to do with Chris Oti particularly. ""People used to sing it in rugby club houses, but as far as we are concerned it had never been brought to Twickenham."" Some rugby fansclaim to have sung it as early as the 1960s,external, as part of a drinking game accompanied with an elaborate series of sexual hand gestures. The RFU said in a statement: ""It is understood that the emergence of the song in a rugby context has often been credited to a group of school boys from Douai Abbey, who attended the Five Nations match in 1988, but never officially confirmed. ""It is interesting that new information is coming to light with regard to the emergence of the song and we look forward to finding out more."" Since this story was written, the RFU have said the use of the song waslinked to a player's nickname. The song is thought to have been composed by a slave called Wallace Wallis - or Wallace together with his wife Minerva - in the mid-1800s. There areseveral theories about its meaning,external, including that it conveyed a coded message to slaves, instructing them to escape. However Horace Clarence Boyer, a prominent scholar in African-American music, believed the song is about death. Professor Boyer, who died in 2009, told a BBC documentary: ""This fits into that group of spirituals that say 'I would rather die than be here. Lord, just come and take me right now.' ""Instead they sing this, 'Swing low sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home.' Where's home? That's heaven. Or at least not here. ""That's so interesting because everybody sings that, they say 'Oh that's such a pretty melody' not knowing that was a song about death. ""It's a sad song. It's almost like a language of double entendres. It has one meaning for you and another meaning for somebody else."" Horace Clarence Boyer believed the song was about death The song was brought to a wider audience by the Fisk Jubilee Singers, who made the earliest known recording of it in 1909. The group was formed in 1871 to raise money for Fisk University, and toured the US and Europe singing spirituals including Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. The song has been covered countless times by artists including BB King, Sam Cooke, Etta James, Eric Clapton, Johnny Cash, The Staple Singers and Beyonce. A version called Swing Low (Run With The Ball) was recorded by ""Union featuring the England World Cup Squad"" for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Other versions have been recorded for subsequent Rugby World Cups, including by UB40 and Russell Watson. Delilah's hidden message?

First head-to-head TV election debate announcedBoris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will face each other in the ITV special.,"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are among the candidates competing to be prime minister The first head-to-head election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will take place on 19 November. It will be shown on ITV and hosted by news presenter Julie Etchingham. The channel said it also plans to hold a multi-party debate in the run-up to the 12 December poll. On Thursday, Labour leader Mr Corbyn challenged the PM to a one-on-one debate, while Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said she should take part in a three-headed encounter with the two leaders. Mr Corbyn welcomed ITV's announcement on Twitter,external, claiming Mr Johnson had ""accepted our challenge"" for the ""once in a generation election"". But pro-Remain parties are not happy, with the Lib Dems criticising the line-up as a ""cosy establishment stitch-up"" and the SNP saying it would be ""deeply misleading for viewers"". A really simple guide to the UK general election Who has selected the most women as candidates? Can the Queen vote, and other election questions After the main event, ITV said it would hold a live interview-based programme to allow other parties to comment on the debate. The Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Brexit Party, Scottish National Party and the Green Party will all be represented. In a later multi-party debate, the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, Brexit Party and Plaid Cymru will take part, represented by either their leader or ""another senior figure"". ITV said Northern Ireland and Wales would have their own debates specifically for the nations, while STV - which broadcasts to parts of Scotland - plans to hold its own debate with Scottish candidates. The SNP said it should be included in the principal debate since it could very well hold the balance of power in a Hung Parliament. ""This debate ignores the half of the population who voted remain and want to see the UK stay in the EU and the majority in Scotland who support independence,"" said the party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. ""UK politics has long stopped being a choice between two tired old parties."" And Lib Dem MP Chuka Umunna said the format was ""undemocratic and wrong"". Allow Twitter content?

European snub fuels frustration in BalkansThe refusal to open EU membership talks with North Macedonia sends a grim message to the Balkans.Europe,"The message on the EU's office in North Macedonia reads ""EU for You"" but that is not the message Macedonians are hearing now It was the diplomatic equivalent of the EU offering a handshake and then thumbing its nose instead. North Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev was left grasping thin air as the prospect of EU accession talks was snatched away. France's Emmanuel Macron played the part of antagonist-in-chief. Mr Macron said ""Non"" when all the other EU leaders were in favour of giving the formal go-ahead to membership negotiations with North Macedonia. Neighbouring Albania was given the brush-off too. The EU's snub also sent a grim message across the Balkans - to would-be members Kosovo and Bosnia and even Serbia and Montenegro, which are both many years into membership negotiations. The French veto did not exactly leave North Macedonia's leader lying on the ground in a crumpled heap, but it did make a mockery of his assertion that changing the country's name would open the door to accession. For 27 years, Greece had rejected the name Macedonia because of its region of the same name. The dispute came to an end only in January after a hard-won agreement and a series of difficult votes. For young Macedonians especially the rejection comes as a blow, setting back the European aspirations of a new generation. Mr Macron and Mr Zaev during more optimistic times, at a meeting in May The government has already paid the price. It will not see out its full five-year term, but will head into early elections next April. N Macedonia calls snap poll after EU talks setback How they solved a 27-year name row Greece and N Macedonia bury hatchet with selfie ""No-one here believed we would become a member state tomorrow, but we were fully prepared for negotiations,"" says Ivana Tufegdzik, an MP in the governing coalition. ""So many European prime ministers and presidents said that the [name-change] agreement, referendum and constitutional changes would open the door to the EU. Even President Macron said that in a video to the Macedonian people."" ""The expectations were so high. And suddenly there was the wrong message."" Mr Zaev bet all his political capital on the name change putting North Macedonia on the road to EU membership. Now he faces a massive challenge, convincing voters that he is still the leader to drive the country forward. And the opposition are delighted to portray the situation as a failure for Mr Zaev and his Social Democrats. ""We said the government in Skopje was not doing enough to persuade the EU to open membership negotiations,"" says Stefan Andonovski, a foreign policy adviser to the leadership of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE party. ""The government has not been listening to the alarms coming from the EU that we really have problems on the inside. The fight against corruption has been stagnant - we have had many scandals. The only reforms have been on the name issue; not much has been done in other areas."" Some of these points are valid. Anti-corruption efforts have been shaken by the arrest of the country's leading special prosecutor. Katica Janeva is facing allegations of abuse of office and accepting bribes. And the EU's commissioner for enlargement, Johannes Hahn, had warned that Skopje's failure to reform the judiciary put EU membership talks at risk. Yet the opposition's comments should also be taken with a pinch of salt. The party officially remains committed to EU accession talks. But at the same time, it has a policy of reversing the country's name change. That would end the hard-won detente with neighbouring Greece and scupper any chance of membership negotiations. This poster in Skopje rejects the new name, insisting ""Our name is Macedonia"" Despite the latest knock-back, reactions in North Macedonia have been relatively low-key. There have been no large-scale protests or acts of violence. After almost three decades of diplomatic blockage, people have become hardened to disappointment. But young people in particular may take the view that their future lies elsewhere, exacerbating the population decline which is already a serious issue. ""It's devastating for people who hoped we would have quick changes,"" says Blazhen Mileski, who works with youth pressure group Reactor. ""We will see more direct action from young people to leave, go to the EU and live there. People don't have a clear idea of what EU wants from us. Young people will see their future outside the country, because they don't see an EU path."" This video can not be played European Council leader Donald Tusk lashes out at EU leaders: ""Personally I think it was a mistake."" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called the French veto ""an historic mistake"", warning that it would seriously compromise the EU's influence across the Western Balkans. There have already been consequences. The leader of the party that won the most votes in Kosovo's recent parliamentary election has suggested scrapping the European Integration Ministry. And Serbia could sign a free trade agreement with the Russia-dominated Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) without worrying too much about the implications. Ever the mischief-maker, Moscow has floated the possibility of inviting Albania and North Macedonia to join the EAEU as well - a suggestion immediately shot down by Mr Zaev. All of North Macedonia's political parties insist they remain focused on getting EU membership talks underway. And the confirmation of Nato membership, which should arrive within the next few months, will be a significant consolation. But EU accession negotiations were supposed to provide the structure to bring North Macedonia under the rule of law. And as long as Emmanuel Macron remains in charge in France, it is difficult to see how those talks can start.

Facebook takes down 'political' advertising,"The government's MyTown campaign Facebook says it has taken down government advertising that was accused of targeting voters in marginal election constituencies. The social media firm said the ads ""were not correctly labelled"" and did not include the obligatory disclaimer. Each of the ads in the campaign,first reported by HuffPost UK,external, said the government was investing ""up to Â£25m"" in a named town. The government said it was always planned to end the promotion on Friday. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government maintains the advertisements were not ""pulled"" by Facebook. A spokesperson added: ""While the posts are still present on Facebook, they are no longer being promoted as the paid-for campaign has ended."" One Labour MP said it was an ""outrageous"" use of public money. The adverts were about ""social issues, elections or politics"", according to Facebook's Ad Library Facebook's Ad Library says,externalthe adverts were run without a disclaimer and were taken down. The ""MyTown"" campaign promoted the government's Â£3.6bn Towns Fund in several key general election battlegrounds, such as Northampton, Milton Keynes and Mansfield. Each of these contain a marginal constituency, one where there were fewer than 2,000 votes separating the top two candidates in the last general election or parliamentary by-election. Parliament has not yet been dissolved and the civil service has not yet entered the pre-election period, known as ""purdah"", where it is barred from making major announcements that might influence the outcome of the vote. But the ads went live on Tuesday, the same day Boris Johnson secured support for an early general election on 12 December. Government accused over 'political' Facebook ads Government pauses Â£100m Brexit ad campaign Facebook challenged over political ad policy Facebook said the taxpayer-funded ads ""were not correctly labelled"" as being about ""social issues, elections or politics"", in line with its self-enacted system to make social and political advertising more transparent. A spokesman said: ""Ads about social issues, elections or politics that appear on our platforms should include a disclaimer provided by advertisers."" It comes as Facebook comes underpressure over its policies on fact-checking political advertisingand as rival social media giantTwitter banned political advertsaltogether. Labour MP Ian Lucas wrote to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove objecting to the campaign, saying the targeted areas appeared to be selected for political reasons. ""It would be an insult to our intelligence to say that this isn't public money being used for political purposes. It clearly is,"" he told HuffPost UK, calling the campaign ""outrageous"". A government spokesman told the BBC that the posts were published before the election was announced. ""All towns selected were chosen according to the same selection methodology, including analysis of deprivation, exposure to Brexit, productivity, economy resilience and investment opportunities,"" he said.

Fracking 'years behind schedule',"Getting fracking up and running in England has been slower than expected, an official report has found. In 2016, the government forecast up to 20 wells would be fracked by mid-2020, but only three have been so far. ""Low public acceptance"" of the controversial oil and gas extraction technique is partly to blame, the National Audit Office (NAO) found. The UK has spent at least Â£32.7m supporting fracking since 2011, the government spending watchdog found. Industry trade body UK Onshore Oil and Gas said the industry was still in ""the early exploration stages"". ""It is not uncommon to see delays in the energy sector, as experienced in the development of the North Sea oilfields, onshore wind industry and new nuclear,"" said chief executive Ken Cronin. Is the future of fracking now in doubt? Fracking is the process of drilling down into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture, including sand and chemicals, is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. The report found fracking had placed financial pressures on local bodies, including local authorities and police forces, which had been brought in to manage protests and maintain security. Lancashire Constabulary reported that between 25 and 100 officers were directly involved in the policing of fracking sites every day between January 2017 and June 2019, at a cost of Â£11.8m. Overall, Lancashire Constabulary, North Yorkshire Police and Nottinghamshire Police spent over Â£13m in two-and-a-half years providing security at shale gas sites, the report found. There has been growing public disquiet about fracking. In 2013, 21% of government survey respondents were against shale oil and gas extraction. This rose to 40% of respondents in 2019, the NAO said. Local authorities told the NAO the scale of opposition to fracking planning permission was ""unprecedented"". ""Lancashire County Council reported receiving about 36,000 representations from the public in relation to two fracking applications,"" it said. People are concerned about risks to the environment and public health, earthquakes, and the adequacy of safety rules, the NAO said. The industry told the NAO that slow progress on fracking was partly due to ""stringent"" UK rules to protect against the risk of earthquakes, which were stricter than international ones. Operators need to halt fracking activity if there is a tremor greater than 0.5 on the Richter scale. In August, a tremor with a magnitude of 2.9 was recorded near the UK's only active shale gas site in Lancashire. Operations at energy firm Cuadrilla's Preston New Road site have been suspended since then. In 2013, there were heady promises that gas extracted from fracturing shale rock with water under high pressure could revolutionise the UK energy industry. A technology that had changed the US energy industry and geopolitics with it could provide a bonanza of benefits to the UK. As the gas from the North Sea dwindled, fracking would step in to make the UK less reliant on foreign imports that make up 60% of our gas supply. This home grown resource would see prices fall and security of supply rise. It would provide tens of billions of new investment and tens of thousand of jobs in areas that desperately needed it and all this could be done safely and environmentally responsibly. The NAO report is a hammer blow to those aspirations. It found no evidence that prices would be lowered, uncertainty as to whether it could viably produce gas in meaningful quantities, no plan for clean-up if a fracking firm were to go bust, serial breeches of agreed limits on earth tremors, strains on local authorities in fracking areas, and plummeting public support. Read more from Simon Jack on fracking here The Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said: ""The government has always said shale gas exploration can only proceed as long as it is safe and environmentally responsible."" ""The Oil and Gas Authority [regulator] will soon publish a finalised scientific assessment of recent industry data and we will set out our future approach as soon as we have considered the findings.""

Firm takes equipment off site,"Fylde's Tory MP Mark Menzies has demanded an end to fracking in the area after several tremors Fracking equipment is to be moved off a site in Lancashire where operations have been suspended due to earthquakes, an energy firm has confirmed. The process, which releases gas from shale rock,was suspendedat Cuadrilla's Preston New Road site after a 2.9-magnitude tremor in August. Cuadrilla said no fracking would take place before its permission to do so ends on 30 November. A review of seismic activity at the site is yet to be published. The Oil and Gas Authority halted fracking indefinitely at the site following the 26 August tremor pending the review. Cuadrilla has now said it was ""demobilising hydraulic fracturing equipment"" at the Little Plumpton site. Anti-fracking campaigners Friends of the Earth welcomed the announcement. ""With no more fracking taking place before planning permission expires, and Cuadrilla yet to apply for an extension, work at this site could soon be at an end."" A condition of Cuadrilla's current planning permission which relates to fracking and drilling expires in November, although the company is able to remain active at Preston New Road until 2023. Fylde's Conservative MP Mark Menziesdemanded an end to fracking in the areaafter the tremor, saying it was ""unsafe"". It was stronger than those thatforced Cuadrilla to suspend test fracking in 2011and came two days after a number of other smaller seismic events. Any tremor measuring 0.5 or above means fracking must be temporarily stopped while tests are carried out. In a statement, Cuadrilla's chief executive Francis Egan said that, ""in the next few weeks"", his company would start testing the flow of gas at a second well that had been partially fractured in August. He said he believed it would show it was a ""huge commercial opportunity"". ""Given the lower carbon footprint of UK shale gas compared to that of gas imported by ship from overseas, it clearly makes sense to look to develop this local resource rather than increasing reliance on imports,"" Mr Egan said. The Oil and Gas Authority said fracking remains suspended indefinitely while it concludes a review of the seismic activity. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique to extract gas and oil from the earth Liquid is pumped underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil within Applications have also been submitted by various firms in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and for a second site in Lancashire The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says shale gas ""has the potential to be a new domestic energy source"" Fracking firm apologises over earth tremors MP calls for fracking to cease after tremors Fracking halted by largest tremor at site Call for review of UK fracking regulations Fracking halted by largest tremor yet Largest tremor recorded near fracking site Second tremor in a day recorded at fracking site Cuadrilla The Oil and Gas Authority From Kyiv to The Conti â Ukrainian folk-punk pioneers to play gig in Preston Rail passengers in Lancashire face major service disruption this weekend as train managers strike Rail passengers in Lancashire face major service disruption this weekend as train managers strike English GCSE exams may be 'first of many' to move onscreen in 2025 - what will it mean for students?

Reserves 'less than estimated',"Cuardrilla have recently resumed fracking for shale gas in Lancashire Previous projections of the potential amount of shale gas under the UK may have been significantly overestimated, according to a new study. Instead of 50 years of gas at the current rate of consumption, thisnew research,externalsuggests there are just 5-7 years' supply. But the UK's fracking industry, which represents companies like Cuadrilla, dismissed the report. The said the sample size was too small to draw serious conclusions. What is fracking? Energy firm Cuadrilla resumes fracking Fracking boss calls government 'pathetic' Fracking tsar resigns over 'ridiculous' rules The recovery of shale gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking has been a slow moving and controversial affair in the UK over the past decade. Attempts by oil and gas companies to drill wells and extract gas have been held up by planning issues, concerns about earth tremors and public displays of disaffection over the issue. Through it all, the government and industry have maintained faith in the process. They argued that there was huge potential for fracked gas particularly in the Bowland shale, a geological formation that runs under Lancashire, Yorkshire, parts of the Midlands and into North Wales. Plans for test drilling have drawn public protests in a number of locations around the UK The optimistic view was based in part on a study published in 2013 by the British Geological Survey (BGS)which issued a very positive report,externalon the likely amount of gas in place under the Bowland. That study suggested that it wasone of the world's biggest reserves, containing some 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. ""To put that in context,"" wrote former Prime Minister David Cameron at the time, ""even if we extract just a tenth of that figure, that is still the equivalent of 51 years' gas supply."" But there were concerns expressed at the time that the estimate was on the high side. Now, scientists at the University of Nottingham and the BGS have developed a new method for analysing the gas content of shale, which they believe gives them a more accurate estimate of the overall potential. ""In terms of the total gas in place, the mean value from the 2013 study was 1,300 trillion feet of gas, we are struggling to get anywhere above 200 trillion feet,"" said Prof Colin Snape from the University of Nottingham, the lead author on the paper. ""The data we've got from the two shales we've looked at are very consistent - and gas companies Cuadrilla and Third Energy have just published two papers in the last year where they have taken core samples and measured the gas that's evolved and that data is very, very consistent with our own data."" According to the new study, the amount of gas in place, assuming an economic recovery rate of 10% would be a maximum of 20 trillion cubic feet, which would equate to around seven years' worth of gas at current UK rates of consumption. Other researchers were impressed with the new method developed by the researchers at Nottingham. ""The results bring bad news to those hoping that northern England is floating on a bed of cheap and abundant gas,"" said Prof Stuart Haszeldine, Professor of Geology and Carbon Storage, University of Edinburgh, who was not involved with the study. ""Abundant hydrocarbons may have been generated in the past, but have leaked away to the Earth's surface many millions of years ago.  Not only have all those hydrocarbon horses bolted, but there is no longer a secure stable door to retain very large quantities of present-day gas in these shales."" However, some of the leading experts at the BGS were cautious in their interpretation of the study, even though several of their own scientists were involved in the paper. ""Early indications published today suggest that it is possible there is less shale gas resource present than previously thought,"" said Prof Mike Stephenson, chief scientist for decarbonisation and resource management, at the BGS. ""However the study considered only a very small number of rock samples from only two locations."" ""BGS has continued to study resource estimation in shales over the past 16 years and further studies are still required to further refine estimates of shale gas resources."" Cuadrilla, the company which has recently resumed fracking a shale gas well in Lancashire, was blunt in its rejection of the new paper. Protestors have tried to shut down Cuadrilla's fracking operations in Lancashire ""Those involved in publishing this should be embarrassed,"" said Francis Egan, Cuadrilla chief executive. ""We hold more data and technical experience of the Bowland shale than anyone else in the UK yet not once did anyone from this research group or Nottingham University contact us for our view or input."" UKOOG, the body which represents the UK's onshore oil and gas industry, also rejected the implications of the study. ""To date we have made significant advancements in the understanding of the resource potential contained within UK shale, with very encouraging results seen at both Springs Road and Preston New Road which have demonstrated properties in line with world class, US shale plays,"" said Ken Cronin, chief executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas. ""What we know now is that we have a world class resource which has broadly supported the estimates originally published by the British Geological Survey. Indeed, in terms of potential gas flow indications, the results are at the upper end of our original forecasts."" ""The only way to provide accurate estimates of how much gas is likely to be produced is to drill, hydraulically fracture and test many wells,"" said Prof Quentin Fisher, from the University of Leeds, who was not involved with the study. ""Which is exactly the intention of companies holding shale gas licences in the UK."" Thestudy has been published,externalin the journal Nature Communications.

England fans gear up for World Cup final,"England fans arrived in Yokohama ahead of the final England fans are glued to television screens up and down the country as 15 men in white line up to face South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final. The game, which kicked off at 09:00 GMT, is being played in Japan but almost 6,000 miles away back home excitement reached fever pitch. England were last in the final 12 years ago and last won it 16 years ago. Fans are understandably excited at the prospect of captain Owen Farrell lifting the Webb Ellis Cup. The Queen hassent a letter of support,externalvia Prince Harry to England's head coach Eddie Jones calling for a ""memorable and successful"" final. Tens of thousands of Red Rose supporters have travelled to Japan with the hope of securing a ticket for the eagerly-anticipated clash. Millions more will were expected to watch back home, hoping Jones's side can emulate the 2003 vintage led by Sir Clive Woodward. These England fans in Japan dressed up as Beefeaters for the much-anticipated final A group of England fans wait for their train on the way to the Yokohama International Stadium As you would expect, a large number of rugby clubs were planning to show the match, which is taking place at the 72,000-capacity Yokohama International Stadium. There was extra excitement at Crewe and Nantwich Rugby Club as their former player Tom Curry was lining up for England. ""We are really excited and are hoping Tom has a great game,"" said coach John Farr earlier. ""He's had a great tournament so far."" Tom Curry has played every minute of England's World Cup campaign Mr Farr said there would be ""bacon butties and beer"" and forecast some ""sore heads on Sunday"". ""We are really, really proud that a player who has taken to the field in a Crewe and Nantwich shirt is gong to go out and hopefully lift the Webb Ellis trophy,"" he said. A crowded clubhouse was also expected at Manchester Rugby Club in Cheadle Hulme where England's Ben Spencer used to play. Bridgnorth Rugby Club in Shropshire was planning to show the game despite having its marquee wrecked and pitches submerged by flood water in recent days. Prince Harry met wheelchair rugby players in Tokyo before the World Cup final The town that gave its name to the game - Rugby in Warwickshire - was also gearing up for the World Cup. James Reeve, the landlord of the Merchant Inn, opened up early and said even Springbok supporters were welcome. ""I've got some good friends that are South Africans who live in Rugby so I'm really looking forward to that rivalry and banter we'll have,"" he said. Meanwhile in Birmingham, newlyweds Rosie and Ken Marshall were facing an early test of their marriage as they cheered for competing sides, having spent their honeymoon in Japan following the World Cup. ""Rosie and I will be happy for the other whatever the result - even if bragging rights will be decided for the next four years,"" said Mr Marshall, 37, originally from Johannesburg. ""It will be a great match and I just hope England win,"" said 31-year-old Mrs Marshall.

Mapping Englandâs squad,"England have seen off all-comers so far and have been training hard for the final against South Africa The hopes of a nation will be decided on Saturday as England take on South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final. But what is the background of the players in the so-far successful squad? Facing the Springboks in Yokohama is a group mostly born in the south but which includes players from five other nations. England's number eight, Billy Vunipola, and his brother, Mako, were born in New Zealand and Australia respectively. They first moved to the UK in 1998 when their father, Fe'ao, played for Pontypool in Wales. They later moved to England. Joe Cokanasiga was born in Fiji and moved to England when he was three, while his father served in the British Army. Other players with overseas birthplaces include Sam Underhill, who was born in Ohio in the USA, Willi Heinz, who is from New Zealand, and Manu Tuilagi, who was born in Samoa and came to England as a child to be with his older brothers who were Samoa internationals playing for club sides in the UK. Toqualify to play in the England squad,external, team members must have been born in or have a parent or grandparent who was born in the country. They would also qualify if they have lived in England for at least three consecutive years. Overall, 16 of the English-born team members were from either the South East, South West or London, with the remaining 10 from the East Midlands, North West or east of England. Yorkshire and the Humber, the West Midlands and the North East were the only unrepresented regions. John Williams, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Leicester, said the representation of players across the country was a result of the traditional geography of rugby union and rugby league. Whether they were born in London, Truro or Samoa, the England players have carried the nations' hopes through the tournament so far ""In the south, rugby was shaped by ex-public school boys who valued amateurism,"" he said. ""The north of England is where they have professional rugby league."" Before 1995, rugby union players were not allowed to be paid. Prof Williams said this was a throw-back to when union was considered a middle and upper class game, with players being affluent enough not to need an income from the sport. ""People in the north started to play rugby league and saw no reason why players shouldn't be paid,"" he added, saying this was influenced by the working class backgrounds of league players at the time. ""There are few union clubs in the north that have been able to establish themselves in the recent elite level of the game but clubs have continued to thrive in some of those original southern heartlands."" Owen Farrell, George Ford, Maro Itoje and Jack Singleton all attended the same school Although born in different areas, four of the team members, Owen Farrell, George Ford, Maro Itoje and Jack Singleton all attended the same school in Hertfordshire. St George's School, in Harpenden, is a comprehensive school for students aged 11 to 18. Current head of rugby, Neil Harris, said students would be ""incredibly proud"" of the players ""no matter what happens on Saturday"".

""For a state school to play so many fixtures, it makes us unique"".

England unchanged for World Cup final,"This video can not be played Rugby World Cup final: England will play without fear - Eddie Jones Rugby World Cup final: England v South Africa Venue:Yokohama International StadiumDate:Saturday, 2 NovemberKick-off:09:00 GMT Coverage:Live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. England head coach Eddie Jones says his team are ready to produce their finest hour after naming an unchanged team for Saturday's World Cup final against South Africa. Captain Owen Farrell, leading try-scorer Jonny May and prop Kyle Sinckler have all been passed fit after carrying knocks from the semi-final win over New Zealand. Farrell stays at inside centre with George Ford once again picked at fly-half, while scrum-half Ben Spencer is on the bench after flying out last weekend as emergency cover following an injury to Willi Heinz. Jones said: ""We know South Africa are going to come at us, and we're going to come at them even harder. ""I've got no doubt that they'll play better, but we'll play better - we will play with no fear. ""We're confident in the game we have and we're confident in the way we've prepared. ""We're ready to go. Hang on to your seats, because it's the last dip of the rollercoaster."" England produced what many critics described as the greatest performance in their history to see off three-time world champions New Zealand 19-7 last Saturday. SA wing Kolbe returns to face England 'George Ford has moved out of Owen Farrell's shadow' Wales v New Zealand: Owen Lane to start as one of nine changes Rugby Union Weekly at the World Cup The form shown by the 10-12 combination of Ford and Farrell and the outstanding displays of Sinckler, Maro Itoje, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have persuaded Jones - in his 50th game in charge of the side - to stick with the same XV for the first time all tournament, despite the direct, muscular threat posed by the Springboks. Jones has the highest winning percentage of any coach to take charge of England, and a second World Cup triumph, 16 years after Sir Clive Woodward's team took the first, would be the ultimate valediction for his four sometimes controversial years in charge. He said: ""That was always our aim, to be here on 2 November in the Yokohama Stadium. ""So we've achieved one goal, but we know what's at stake in the final, and we're well prepared. ""South Africa are a different proposition - they're much more physical, they come through you at the front door, whereas New Zealand it's the front door and back door. ""We have to make adjustments, but we're ready for the brutality of the game. ""Our players have had the will to prepare. They've pushed themselves through some tough physical tasks. ""They've worked hard to get the right tactical game and they've worked hard to build the bonds between them."" Despite the youth of 21-year-old Curry and 23-year-old Underhill in the back row, this is an experienced England side, with a total of 731 caps in the starting XV. Back-row pair Sam Underhill (14) and Tom Curry (18) have just 32 caps between them And on Thursday those players were in relaxed mood despite the biggest game of their lives being just 48 hours away. Jones invited his entire 31-man squad and the English media together for morning coffee before the players were given time with their families and parents to go out around Shinjuku for lunch. On Friday they will go through one last light training run at Yokohama Stadium before returning to their hotel in central Tokyo and a team meeting led by skipper Farrell. It will be Jones' own third World Cup final after his Wallabies side were beaten by England in 2003 and the Springbok team he was helping to advise saw off England in Paris four years later. He said: ""I'll be looking back at the lessons of 2003 and 2007, and even 2011. ""You can never take anything for granted. You have to go out there and take the game. ""You might be favourites, but you have to go out there and win the game, and that's our approach on Saturday. ""I'm anxious, nervous, excited. It's always a blend of the two emotions. I'm sure South Africa are sitting in their hotel thinking the same way.""

Why do rugby fans sing a slave song?,"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot was brought to a wider audience by the Fisk Jubilee Singers The Rugby Football Union is trying to find out how a song rooted in slavery became an anthem for rugby fans. Swing Low, Sweet Chariot is a spiritual - a type of song created by African people enslaved in the US. England's supporters were rumoured to have adopted the song when a group of schoolboys began singing it at Twickenham in 1988. But now, after four rugby club members claimed they started the trend, the RFU said it wanted to find out more. Dave Hales, from Market Bosworth Rugby Club,told BBC Radio Leicester: ""We were in the North Stand having a bit of a good time, a good day. We started trying to get a few songs going. Various ones didn't really catch on. ""All of a sudden I started singing Swing Low and the next thing you know the crowd round us was singing it, then the whole North Stand seemed to be singing it, and then the whole ground seemed to be singing it. ""The atmosphere was just absolutely brilliant really. Absolutely fantastic."" The song has been adopted as an anthem by English rugby fans An existing theory is that a group ofboys from Douai School in Berkshire started singing,externalthe song at the same match, when England were playing Ireland in the Five Nations Championship. The boys were alleged to have been serenading Chris Oti, a black player, making this theory more controversial because of the song's link with slavery. But the Market Bosworth Rugby Club members at Twickenham that day - Dave Hales, John Ward, Bruce Coleman and Paul Spencer - all maintain they started singing the song first. A more controversial theory is that a group of school boys serenaded black player Chris Oti with the song Mr Ward said: ""As far as we are concerned it started after, I believe, Rory Underwood scored the first try in the second half. ""It wasn't anything to do with Chris Oti particularly. ""People used to sing it in rugby club houses, but as far as we are concerned it had never been brought to Twickenham."" Some rugby fansclaim to have sung it as early as the 1960s,external, as part of a drinking game accompanied with an elaborate series of sexual hand gestures. The RFU said in a statement: ""It is understood that the emergence of the song in a rugby context has often been credited to a group of school boys from Douai Abbey, who attended the Five Nations match in 1988, but never officially confirmed. ""It is interesting that new information is coming to light with regard to the emergence of the song and we look forward to finding out more."" Since this story was written, the RFU have said the use of the song waslinked to a player's nickname. The song is thought to have been composed by a slave called Wallace Wallis - or Wallace together with his wife Minerva - in the mid-1800s. There areseveral theories about its meaning,external, including that it conveyed a coded message to slaves, instructing them to escape. However Horace Clarence Boyer, a prominent scholar in African-American music, believed the song is about death. Professor Boyer, who died in 2009, told a BBC documentary: ""This fits into that group of spirituals that say 'I would rather die than be here. Lord, just come and take me right now.' ""Instead they sing this, 'Swing low sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home.' Where's home? That's heaven. Or at least not here. ""That's so interesting because everybody sings that, they say 'Oh that's such a pretty melody' not knowing that was a song about death. ""It's a sad song. It's almost like a language of double entendres. It has one meaning for you and another meaning for somebody else."" Horace Clarence Boyer believed the song was about death The song was brought to a wider audience by the Fisk Jubilee Singers, who made the earliest known recording of it in 1909. The group was formed in 1871 to raise money for Fisk University, and toured the US and Europe singing spirituals including Swing Low, Sweet Chariot. The song has been covered countless times by artists including BB King, Sam Cooke, Etta James, Eric Clapton, Johnny Cash, The Staple Singers and Beyonce. A version called Swing Low (Run With The Ball) was recorded by ""Union featuring the England World Cup Squad"" for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Other versions have been recorded for subsequent Rugby World Cups, including by UB40 and Russell Watson. Delilah's hidden message?

"Thousands invited to citizens' climate assemblyParliament is sending 30,000 invitations to people to take part in a citizen's assembly on climate change.Science & Environment","The public are being asked for their views on how to tackle climate change Letters are being sent to 30,000 households across the UK inviting people to join a citizens' assembly on climate change. Once participants are selected, the assembly will meet next year, with the outcome of their discussions reported back to Parliament. The initiative, set up by cross party MPs, will look at what members of the public can do to reduce CO2. The UK government has committed to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Spain offers to host climate summit in Madrid Climate change 'making mountaineering riskier' Sea level rise to affect 'three times more people' Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee, one of six select committees who commissioned the climate assembly, said a clear roadmap was needed to achieve this goal. ""Finding solutions which are equitable and have public support will be crucial,"" she said. ""Parliament needs to work with the people and with government to address the challenge of climate change."" The invitees to Climate Assembly UK have been selected at random from across the UK. From those who respond, 110 people will be chosen as a representative sample of the population. They will meet over four weekends from late January in Birmingham, and will discuss topics ranging from transport to household energy use. A citizens' assembly has been a key demand of the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, whose protests caused widespread disruption this year. The group said they welcomed this as a first step, but warned that the assembly should be focussing on cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 not 2050. Spokesperson Linda Doyle said: ""Waiting 30 years to reach zero net carbon emissions is a death sentence to people around the world and in the UK - it gives us a higher chance of breaching irreversible tipping points as the climate breaks down and it only serves short term 'business as usual'."" Environmental group Friends of the Earth said citizens' assemblies could play an important part in policy-making. Dave Timms, head of political affairs at FOE, said: ""Tackling the climate emergency with the speed required will require radical changes to our economy, infrastructure and even to society so it's important that there is a consensus among citizens. ""Much of what needs to be done already commands widespread public support and it is politicians that just need to bloody-well get on with it now."" Citizens' assemblies have been used in a number of countries around the world. In Ireland, a panel of 99 people was established in 2016 to look at a range of political questions, including abortion. They recommended that the country should overturn its ban and suggested a referendum, which went on to support repeal. In Canada and the Netherlands, the approach has been used to discuss electoral reform. MPs plan citizens' assembly on climate Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work?

Kuwait moves on Instagram slave tradersAuthorities summon the owners of several social media accounts used to sell domestic workers.Technology,"Women were being sold on apps including Instagram Kuwaiti authorities say they have officially summoned the owners of several social media accounts used to sell domestic workers as slaves. A BBC News Arabic investigation found online slave markets on apps provided and made available by Google and Apple, including Facebook-owned Instagram. Women were offered for sale as workers via hashtags such as ""maids for transfer"" or ""maids for sale"". Authorities say those involved have been ordered to take down their ads. They have also been compelled to sign a legal commitment, promising no longer to participate in this activity. This video can not be played BBC News Arabicâs undercover investigation exposes the buying and selling of domestic workers in the Gulf Instagram said it had also taken action since it was contacted by the BBC. It said it had removed further content across Facebook and Instagram, and would prevent the creation of new accounts designed to be used for the online slave market. Many of the most widely used accounts for buying and selling domestic workers appear to have stopped their activity. Read the full investigation:Slave markets found on Instagram and other apps Dr Mubarak Al-Azimi, head of Kuwait's Public Authority for Manpower, said it was investigating the woman featured in the BBC report who sold a 16-year-old girl from Guinea - whom we are calling ""Fatou"" - via an app. A police officer who also featured in the report is under investigation by the authorities. He said arrests and compensation for the victims were possible outcomes of the action. Kimberley Motley, an American international lawyer who has taken on Fatou's case, said: ""I believe the app developers should definitely provide compensation for Fatou. As well as possibly Apple and Google. ""On Apple Store they proclaim that they are responsible for everything that's put on their store. And so our question is, what does that responsibility mean?"" Ms Motley also called for criminal charges against those involved in trafficking Fatou to Kuwait. Google and Apple said they were working with app developers to prevent illegal activity on their platforms. On Thursday, BBC News Arabic published its undercover investigation which found domestic workers were being illegally bought and sold online in a booming black market.

UK fracking halted after government pulls support,"Fracking at Cuadrilla Resources site in Lancashire in August caused a 2.9 magnitude earth tremor The government has called a halt to shale gas extraction - or fracking - in England amid fears about earthquakes. The indefinite suspension comes aftera report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA),externalsaid it was not possible to predict the probability or size of tremors caused by the practice. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said it may be temporary - imposed ""until and unless"" extraction is proved safe. Labour, Lib Dems and the Green Party  want a permanent ban. 'We have been guinea pigs for fracking' What is fracking and why is it controversial? Is the future of fracking now in doubt? Fracking firm in 'goodwill payments' after tremor Fracking was suspended at the end of August after activity by Cuadrilla Resources - the only company licensed to carry out the process - at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire caused a magnitude 2.9 earthquake. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said that, after the OGA concluded that further seismic activity could not be ruled out, ""further consents for fracking will not be granted"" unless the industry ""can reliably predict and control tremors"" linked to the process. However, it has stopped short of an outright ban. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme why that was, Mrs Leadsom said shale gas is a ""huge opportunity"" for the UK. ""We will follow the science and it is quite clear that we can't be certain. The science isn't accurate enough to be able to assess the fault lines, the geological studies have been shown to be inaccurate. So therefore, unless and until we can be absolutely certain, we are imposing a moratorium,"" she said. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyntweeted,externalthat the pause was an ""election stunt"" and that Labour would ban fracking permanently. Former Conservative energy minister Sam Gyimah, who is now a Liberal Democrat, said Mr Johnson's ""conversion to environmentalism"" was ""skin deep"". ""It's interesting that just as we approach an election he has decided he is against fracking."" Asked whether the UK should explore methods of delivering fracking safely, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said fossil fuels ""need to stay in the ground"" and that the government must make an ""absolute commitment"" to end it altogether. By Katie Prescott, BBC business correspondent Andrea Leadsom emphasises that this is not a ban - and the government is 'following the science'. However, scientists say it's hard to see a time with our current technology that fracking in the UK wouldn't cause earthquakes Professor Richard Davies from Newcastle University says: ""The UK is crisscrossed with faults and it's difficult to avoid them because the current imaging techniques used by the industry do not yet provide enough resolution to detect many of them."" The big question for the businesses working in this sector is whether they are happy to spend any more money in this regulatory environment. Do they think it's worth investing, in the hope that the ""science"" will one day find in their favour and the regulation could change? Or will they decide that two moratoriums in 10 years is just too many, and that fracking has no future in the UK. Friends of the Earth said legislation should be passed to make the fracking moratorium permanent. ""For nearly a decade local people across the country have fought a David and Goliath battle against this powerful industry,"" said chief executive Craig Bennett. Charity CPRE said it had long called for fracking to be stopped and said the move would help the UK meet its target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Anti-fracking campaigner Barbara Richardson, who has protested at Preston New Road, said she was ""cautiously optimistic"", adding that local people were ""worried"" about the impact of fracking. ""They want this to go away, they want some respite from this, they've been fighting this for five-and-a-half years,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Claire Stephenson from Frack Free Lancashire said campaigners were celebrating that the fracking industry in the UK is ""finished"", but added that protests will continue until an ""outright ban"" is in place. Susan Holliday, chair of Preston New Action Group said: ""We will only feel able to celebrate once Cuadrilla start work on decommissioning and the site is restored."" Fracking is a process in which liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil trapped within it. Assessment by the British Geological Survey in 2013 suggested there were enough resources in the Bowland Shale across northern England to potentially provide up to 50 years of current gas demand. Butresearch published in Augustestimated there were only five to seven years' supply. The UK's fracking industry, which has said the process could contribute significantly to future energy needs and create thousands of jobs, dismissed the report's findings. Fracking must be halted for 18 hours if it causes a tremor measuring 0.5 magnitude or above. The government announcement is the second time it has placed a moratorium on fracking. The first suspension, which lasted a year, was in November 2011 during the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. The fracking industry has faced fierce opposition from both communities and environmental groups. Local communities and environmental groups have protested against fracking Prime Minister Boris Johnson has in the past supported fracking,writing in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat the discovery of shale gas in the UK was ""glorious news for humanity"". A recent report by the National Audit Office found the UK had spent at least Â£32.7m supporting fracking since 2011. All fracking in Scotland has been suspended since 2013 andthe SNP recently confirmed a policy of ""no support"" for the extraction method. The Welsh Government has also opposed fracking for several years, with a ""moratorium"" in place since 2015, while there is a planning presumption against fracking in Northern Ireland.

The suspension in England will put pressure on Cuadrilla Resources which has so far invested Â£270m in the country's shale gas industry. Cuadrilla Resources has 30 full-time workers but also employs a number of contractors. A spokeswoman for Cuadrilla Resources declined to comment. The BBC understands Cuadrilla and other fracking companies were not told of the government's decision in advance.

Fracking firm takes equipment off site,"Fylde's Tory MP Mark Menzies has demanded an end to fracking in the area after several tremors Fracking equipment is to be moved off a site in Lancashire where operations have been suspended due to earthquakes, an energy firm has confirmed. The process, which releases gas from shale rock,was suspendedat Cuadrilla's Preston New Road site after a 2.9-magnitude tremor in August. Cuadrilla said no fracking would take place before its permission to do so ends on 30 November. A review of seismic activity at the site is yet to be published. The Oil and Gas Authority halted fracking indefinitely at the site following the 26 August tremor pending the review. Cuadrilla has now said it was ""demobilising hydraulic fracturing equipment"" at the Little Plumpton site. Anti-fracking campaigners Friends of the Earth welcomed the announcement. ""With no more fracking taking place before planning permission expires, and Cuadrilla yet to apply for an extension, work at this site could soon be at an end."" A condition of Cuadrilla's current planning permission which relates to fracking and drilling expires in November, although the company is able to remain active at Preston New Road until 2023. Fylde's Conservative MP Mark Menziesdemanded an end to fracking in the areaafter the tremor, saying it was ""unsafe"". It was stronger than those thatforced Cuadrilla to suspend test fracking in 2011and came two days after a number of other smaller seismic events. Any tremor measuring 0.5 or above means fracking must be temporarily stopped while tests are carried out. In a statement, Cuadrilla's chief executive Francis Egan said that, ""in the next few weeks"", his company would start testing the flow of gas at a second well that had been partially fractured in August. He said he believed it would show it was a ""huge commercial opportunity"". ""Given the lower carbon footprint of UK shale gas compared to that of gas imported by ship from overseas, it clearly makes sense to look to develop this local resource rather than increasing reliance on imports,"" Mr Egan said. The Oil and Gas Authority said fracking remains suspended indefinitely while it concludes a review of the seismic activity. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique to extract gas and oil from the earth Liquid is pumped underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil within Applications have also been submitted by various firms in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and for a second site in Lancashire The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says shale gas ""has the potential to be a new domestic energy source"" Fracking firm apologises over earth tremors MP calls for fracking to cease after tremors Fracking halted by largest tremor at site Call for review of UK fracking regulations Fracking halted by largest tremor yet Largest tremor recorded near fracking site Second tremor in a day recorded at fracking site Cuadrilla The Oil and Gas Authority From Kyiv to The Conti â Ukrainian folk-punk pioneers to play gig in Preston Rail passengers in Lancashire face major service disruption this weekend as train managers strike Rail passengers in Lancashire face major service disruption this weekend as train managers strike English GCSE exams may be 'first of many' to move onscreen in 2025 - what will it mean for students?

First head-to-head TV election debate announcedBoris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will face each other in the ITV special.Election 2019,"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are among the candidates competing to be prime minister The first head-to-head election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will take place on 19 November. It will be shown on ITV and hosted by news presenter Julie Etchingham. The channel said it also plans to hold a multi-party debate in the run-up to the 12 December poll. On Thursday, Labour leader Mr Corbyn challenged the PM to a one-on-one debate, while Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said she should take part in a three-headed encounter with the two leaders. Mr Corbyn welcomed ITV's announcement on Twitter,external, claiming Mr Johnson had ""accepted our challenge"" for the ""once in a generation election"". But pro-Remain parties are not happy, with the Lib Dems criticising the line-up as a ""cosy establishment stitch-up"" and the SNP saying it would be ""deeply misleading for viewers"". A really simple guide to the UK general election Who has selected the most women as candidates? Can the Queen vote, and other election questions After the main event, ITV said it would hold a live interview-based programme to allow other parties to comment on the debate. The Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Brexit Party, Scottish National Party and the Green Party will all be represented. In a later multi-party debate, the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, Brexit Party and Plaid Cymru will take part, represented by either their leader or ""another senior figure"". ITV said Northern Ireland and Wales would have their own debates specifically for the nations, while STV - which broadcasts to parts of Scotland - plans to hold its own debate with Scottish candidates. The SNP said it should be included in the principal debate since it could very well hold the balance of power in a Hung Parliament. ""This debate ignores the half of the population who voted remain and want to see the UK stay in the EU and the majority in Scotland who support independence,"" said the party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. ""UK politics has long stopped being a choice between two tired old parties."" And Lib Dem MP Chuka Umunna said the format was ""undemocratic and wrong"". Allow Twitter content?

The former Texas congressman tweeted:""Our campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively.,external ""In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee."" Mr O'Rourke, 47, ran for president in March after losing his 2018 bid to oust Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz. In that Senate race, he did better than any Democrat had in Texas for decades, running a campaign that invigorated the party nationwide and drew comparisons with former President Barack Obama. His passionate delivery along with his good looks and background as a skateboarder and a punk rocker endeared him to liberals across the country. Who will take on Trump in 2020? But Mr O'Rourke struggled to carry that energy into a White House race crowded with more than 20 Democratic candidates. On Friday he said his campaign did not have ""the means to move forward successfully"". Speaking in Des Moines, Iowa, Mr O'Rourke thanked his supporters, many of whom were clearly disappointed. ""How proud I am to be with you,"" he said. This video can not be played Who is Beto O'Rourke? Mr O'Rourke vowed to support the Democratic nominee who will challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 race for the White House. ""We're right in the middle of this fight,"" he said. Ina blog post announcing the end of his candidacy,external, he wrote: ""We confronted institutional, systemic racism and called out Donald Trump for his white supremacy and the violence that he's encouraged against communities that don't look like, pray like or love like the majority in this country."" Mr O'Rourke was highly critical of the president after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, in August, describing the bloodshed as a ""consequence"" of Mr Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. As the initial buzz over his campaign began to subside, Mr O'Rourke tried to reboot his candidacy. He began to focus on gun control, and vowed to remove assault-style weapons from private ownership, saying in one televised debate: ""Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s."" But he could not catch up with front-runners like former Vice-President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Mr O'Rourke also found himself leap-frogged by another young, charismatic candidate - 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana. In the latest opinion poll by New York Times/Siena College on Friday, Mr O'Rourke drew the support of just 1% of voters in the crucial early-voting state of Iowa. Mr O'Rourke struggled to carry the energy of his insurgent Senate campaign into a White House bid Mr O'Rourke had been urged by donors to drop out of the presidential race and run against Texas Senator John Cornyn, who is up for re-election next year. But the O'Rourke camp reiterated in a statement on Friday night that he did not plan on standing for the Senate again. Mr O'Rourke is not the only once-promising Democratic candidate who is struggling - California Senator Kamala Harris this week scaled back her campaign, firing some staffers and shuttering offices in another key, early voting state, New Hampshire. In just about 12 months, Beto O'Rourke went from Democratic rock star to political rock bottom. During his 2018 Senate race, the former Texas congressman was fundraising like a top-tier presidential candidate. Beloved by Democrats across the country for his youthful energy, his passionate stump speeches became viral sensations. His obvious political skills in his home state did not translate on to the national stage, however, where a lack of campaign organisation and an inability to stand out on a crowded debate stage cost him dearly. Mr O'Rourke's relatively thin CV, which wasn't a concern for Democrats when he was facing conservative stalwart Ted Cruz in Texas, was also a liability in a match-up against senators and a former vice-president with extensive experience and in-depth policy knowledge. Some presidential hopefuls can run unsuccessful campaigns and end up with an elevated stature among party faithful - with more political prospects than when they began. Mr O'Rourke, whose campaign started high and trended only downward, was not so fortunate. He may have a second act in national politics, but his 2019 effort will be an experience he will have to overcome, not build on. Mr O'Rourke represented Texas' 16th congressional district for three terms before running unsuccessfully last year for the US Senate. He travelled to all of Texas' 254 counties during his Senate campaign, documenting his journey on social media, and broke Senate fundraising records by amassing more than $80m. He lives with his wife, Amy Hoover Sanders and three children in El Paso. He has an estimated net worth of nearly $9m (Â£6.7m). His first name is actually Robert, but he is known by his nickname Beto - a common contraction of Roberto, which he says he picked up as a child in El Paso. Following his November Senate defeat, Mr O'Rourke drew criticism for embarking on a road trip across the south-western US, during which he documented his travels in a blog and admitted he was stuck in a ""funk"". Even supporters questioned why Mr O'Rourke was on the road, leaving his wife at home to look after their children, while other Democratic contenders were assembling staff and funding. As he launched his campaign, he posed on the cover of Vanity Fair, telling the magazine about the White House race: ""Man, I'm just born to be in it."" He later said he regretted that move because it reinforced a ""perception of privilege."" After Mr O'Rourke dropped out on Friday, President Trump, a Republican, mocked him in a tweet.
