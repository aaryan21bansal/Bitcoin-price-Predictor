The Labour Party has vowed to close the gender pay gap by 2030. The difference between men's and women's average pay would take another 60 years to close under a Conservative government, the party said. But the Conservative Party said that Labour was ""over-promising something it could not deliver"". The Tories said the pay gap was at a record low and that there had been ""huge progress since 2010"" in terms of the number of women in work. The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. Read our full story here. Young voters watch paid-for political Facebook adverts...

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor We knew this was going to be a strange election. It's been a strange few years. But while the parties are eagerly trying to stick to their familiar scripts - the Tories on Brexit, the Labour Party on public services, something far less recognisable is going on too in this campaign. It started with Ian Austin last week, the former Labour MP who urged voters to choose Boris Johnson instead. And it's fully breaking out on the other side too. David Gauke, who only resigned from the cabinet a few months ago,  has publicly urged voters to take a good look at the Liberal Democrats, saying that a Boris Johnson majority would be bad for the country. Read the latest blog from Laura here. Former Labour MP Kate Hoey says she will be voting for the DUP in the general election. The Brexit-backing ex-Vauxhall MP told LBC radio: ""I'm actually going to be voting in Northern Ireland and unfortunately the Labour Party is so anti-democratic in Northern Ireland that they allow people to join but they don't put up candidates. ""So I'll be voting for a pro-Union candidate in Northern Ireland."" Ms Hoey confirmed it will be a DUP candidate. Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas says she wishes Labour had joined the so-called Remain alliance of parties. It came after the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party formed an electoral pact by agreeing not to stand against each other in dozens of seat across England and Wales. The three parties all support another Brexit referendum and want the UK to remain in the EU. Ms Lucas told ITV's Peston programme: ""If Labour had been willing to enter into these negotiations then we could have certainly scaled-up the impact of what's going to happen"".

Toy sales slump as shops chase Christmas cheer,"Manufacturers and retailers hope interactive toys prove popular Caution among UK shoppers has led to a tough year so far for toy retailers, as parents search for deals and cut back on impulse buys. UK toy sales were down by 8% in the year so far, compared with the same period last year, leaving retailers dreaming of a bumper Christmas. But economic uncertainty and Brexit planning could lead to shortages of the most popular toys. Others may be sold off cheaper if sales fail to match retailers' expectations. Take a hard look at 'sexist toys' - Dutch education minister Toy Story: How Buzz Lightyear keeps making millions Sir Rod Stewart reveals his epic model railway city About 30% of annual spending on toys comes at Christmas, with Â£86 spent on the typical child up to the age of 11, according to analysts NPD. The industry is banking on festive sales turning around a poor year so far. The 8% drop in UK sales was worse than a 3% drop in international toy sales, said Frederique Tutt, global industry analyst for NPD. Sales last year were also flat, suggesting more than a seasonal downturn. She said this was driven by a lack of consumer confidence and High Street woes in general, rather than issues specific to the toy industry. Parents and grandparents have made fewer impulse buys outside of birthdays and Christmas, partly as they are less likely to be in stores. ""You do not get the same Willy Wonka-type excitement on the internet as children do in a toy shop,"" said Gary Grant, who chairs the committee which selects the2019 DreamToys list,externalof ""must-have"" toys. Blockbuster film releases had been earmarked as a saviour for the industry this year, owing to the sale of spin-off toy merchandise which account for 10% of the market. The two brands which have previously broken records for film-licensed products - Star Wars and Frozen - will see new films released before Christmas. But Mr Grant said the financial reality for many families was that buying a toy after watching a film would be a substitute for another toy purchase, not necessarily an additional purchase. In store sales accounted for 55% of the market, with 26% bought online and delivered, and 16% click and collect Nearly two-thirds (61%) of Christmas toy spending were presents chosen by the giver, rather than put on children's wishlists Toy spending at Christmas stands at Â£86 on average for each child up to the age of 11 Each receives an average of eight toys each Christmas Source: NPD Licensed products in general have accounted for 23% of toy sales so far this year, but Ms Tutt said this sector was no longer dominated by blockbuster film releases. Some of the hotly tipped toys this year have links to YouTube stars and are marketed on social media. The fragmentation of entertainment channels has made it difficult for the big film brands to repeat previous success - although some, such as Harry Potter - have had some joy. ""Children move on to the next thing very quickly, so there is a relatively short window of opportunity to make sales,"" she said. The extra planning required by the potential for the UK leaving the EU on 31 October led many manufacturers and retailers making early decisions on orders for the coming Christmas. That, according to Mr Grant, could mean a shortage of certain toys before Christmas which suddenly become popular. A cautious approach by manufacturers may add to this concern. There are already suggestions of shortages of the L.O.L Surprise! 2-in-1 Glamper However, there was also the chance that retailers could have over-ordered certain toys, leading to the potential for big discounts on those at some point before Christmas. That, he said, would impact the cash taken by retailers, in addition to the extra management time and cost during the year that was caused by Brexit planning. He predicted that a pick-up in the UK economy and consumer confidence would bring shoppers back to the High Street to spend money, but it was difficult to know when such an improvement would come.

Venice mayor blames record flood on climate change,"This video can not be played Parts of Venice have been left under water by record flooding Severe flooding in Venice that has left much of the Italian city under water is a direct result of climate change, the mayor says. The highest water levels in the region in more than 50 years would leave ""a permanent mark"", Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro tweeted. ""Now the government must listen,"" he added. ""These are the effects of climate change... the costs will be high."" The waters in Venice peaked at 1.87m (6ft), according to the tide monitoring centre. Only once since official records began in 1923 has the tide been higher, reaching 1.94m in 1966. The tourist sites hit by Venice's floods Images showed popular sites left completely flooded and people wading through the streets as Venice was hit by a storm. St Mark's Square - one of the lowest parts of the city - was one of the worst hit areas. St Mark's Basilica was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years, according to church records. Pierpaolo Campostrini, a member of St Mark's council, said four of those floods had now occurred within the past 20 years. The mayor said the famous landmark had suffered ""grave damage"". The crypt was completely flooded and there are fears of structural damage to the basilica's columns. The city of Venice is made up of more than 100 islands inside a lagoon off the north-east coast of Italy. Two people died on the island of Pellestrina, a thin strip of land that separates the lagoon from the Adriatic Sea. A man was electrocuted as he tried to start a pump in his home, and a second person was found dead elsewhere. Mr Brugnaro said the damage was ""huge"" and that he would declare a state of disaster, warning that a project to help prevent the Venetian lagoon suffering devastating floods ""must be finished soon"". ""The situation is dramatic. We ask the government to help us,"" he said on Twitter, adding that schools would remain closed until the water level subsides. He also urged local businesses to share photos and video footage of the devastation, which he said would be useful when requesting financial help from the government. People throughout the city waded through the flood waters. A number of businesses were affected. Chairs and tables were seen floating outside cafes and restaurants. In shops, workers tried to move their stock away from the water to prevent any further damage. One shopkeeper, who was not named, told Italy's public broadcaster Rai: ""The city is on its knees."" Three waterbuses sank, but tourists continued their sightseeing as best they could. One French couple told AFP news agency that they had ""effectively swum"" after some of the wooden platforms placed around the city in areas prone to flooding overturned. On Wednesday morning, a number of boats were seen stranded. A project to protect the city from flooding has been under way since 2003 but has been hit by soaring costs, scandals and delays. The so-called Mose project - a series of large barriers or floodgates that would be raised from the seabed to shut off the lagoon in the event of rising sea levels and winter storms - was successfully tested for the first time in 2013. Watch: Venice flood barriers pass first test The project has already cost billions of euros in investment. According to Italy's infrastructure ministry, the flood barriers will be handed over to the Venice city council at the end of 2021 following the ""final phase"" of testing. Italy was hit by heavy rainfall on Tuesday with further bad weather forecast in the coming days. Venice suffers flooding on a yearly basis. By BBC meteorologist Nikki Berry The recent flooding in Venice was caused by a combination of high spring tides and a meteorological storm surge driven by strong sirocco winds blowing north-eastwards across the Adriatic Sea. When these two events coincide, we get what is known as Acqua Alta (high water). This latest Acqua Alta occurrence in Venice is the second highest tide in recorded history. However, if we look at the top 10 tides, five have occurred in the past 20 years and the most recent was only last year. While we should try to avoid attributing a single event to climate change, the increased frequency of these exceptional tides is obviously a big concern. In our changing climate, sea levels are rising and a city such as Venice, which is also sinking, is particularly susceptible to such changes. The weather patterns that have caused the Adriatic storm surge have been driven by a strong meridional (waving) jet stream across the northern hemisphere and this has fed a conveyor belt of low pressure systems into the central Mediterranean. One of the possible effects of a changing climate is that the jet stream will be more frequently meridional and blocked weather patterns such as these will also become more frequent. If this happens, there is a greater likelihood that these events will combine with astronomical spring tides and hence increase the chance of flooding in Venice. Furthermore, the meridional jet stream can be linked back to stronger typhoons in the north-west Pacific resulting in more frequent cold outbreaks in North America and an unsettled Mediterranean is another one of the downstream effects.

"Israel-Gaza fighting continues for second dayAfter an overnight lull, militants fire more rockets towards Israel and Israeli aircraft hit Gaza.Middle East","A destroyed house in Khan Younis, where Israel said it had hit a Palestinian Islamic Jihad HQ Cross-border violence between Israel and militants in Gaza is continuing after an Israeli air strike killed a Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander. After an overnight lull, rocket fire towards Israel resumed and Israeli aircraft conducted retaliatory strikes on Wednesday. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 32 Palestinians, including children, have been killed by Israeli fire. In Israel, 63 people have been treated for injuries and stress symptoms. Life in the Gaza Strip Is peace between Israel and Palestinians out of reach? Late on Wednesday, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) offered terms for a ceasefire, which included an end to Israel's targeted killings of militants and Gaza border protesters and well as steps to ease the blockade of the Palestinian enclave. Israel has so far made no public comments on the truce offer. After a six-hour pause, PIJ militants resumed firing rockets at around 06:30 (04:30 GMT) on Wednesday, triggering air-raid sirens in southern and central Israel. Most of the rockets fired by Palestinian militants have been intercepted by Israeli air defences At least 360 rockets have been fired into Israel from Gaza since Tuesday, the Israeli army says. It adds that 90% of the missiles were intercepted. An elderly woman was slightly wounded by broken glass after a rocket hit a house in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, Israeli media reported. Another rocket hit a factory in the southern town of Sderot. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had bombed more PIJ targets in Gaza on Wednesday in response, including a military headquarters in Khan Younis and a factory manufacturing warheads for long-range rockets in the south of the strip. The IDF said ""20 terrorists"" were killed, most of them from Islamic Jihad. The health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas militants, said 32 people had been killed in Israeli strikes, at least a third of them civilians. It said six Palestinians from a single family were killed in a strike in the early hours of Thursday morning at their home in Deir al-Balah town, central Gaza Strip. It was the deadliest incident reported since the beginning of the current fighting. The Israeli military has not yet commented on the incident. The rocket fire triggered air-raid sirens in southern and central Israel PIJ said the dead included members of its military wing, the al-Quds Brigades. Khaled Faraj, a field commander, was killed in a strike in central Gaza. UN Middle East peace envoy Nickolay Mladenov warned that the continuing escalation was ""very dangerous"". ""The indiscriminate launching of rockets and mortars against population centres is absolutely unacceptable and must stop immediately,"" he said. ""There can be no justification for any attacks against civilians."" In a statement,Save the Children charity said it was ""deeply concerned by the recently escalated hostilities"",,externalcalling for an immediate ceasefire. ""For the second day, hundreds of thousands of children are impacted by school closures  across Gaza and southern Israel, with parents terrified of the impact of further retaliation. ""Our teams in Gaza have been unable to go to work and our programmes have been suspended,"" the charity said. A pre-dawn Israeli air strike on a residential building in eastern Gaza City killed Baha Abu al-Ata, a senior PIJ military commander, and his wife. At about the same time, the home of another leader of the Iran-backed group was struck by an Israeli missile in Damascus, killing two people, Syrian state media said. Israel did not comment on the incident. This video can not be played Gaza militants retaliated with rocket fire - then Israel responded with further air strikes Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described Abu al-Ata as an ""arch-terrorist"" and a ""ticking bomb"" who posed an imminent threat to the country. Abu al-Ata was thought to be behind recent rocket fire from Gaza, including an attack 10 days ago on Sderot, and to have acted increasingly outside of the control of the dominant militant faction Hamas. Militants in Gaza said Israel had crossed a ""red line"" and fired more than 200 rockets in response. About 90% of the rockets were intercepted by Iron Dome air defence systems, the IDF said, but one exploded on a main road close to passing cars, and elsewhere two people were lightly injured by shrapnel. An eight-year-old girl also suffered a heart attack in a bomb shelter and remains in a serious condition. The IDF said it carried out air strikes in Gaza targeting PIJ rocket-launching units and infrastructure. Gaza's health ministry said eight people were killed, in addition to Abu al-Ata and his wife. PIJ spokesman Musab al-Buraim told the Hamas-linked Shehab news agency that it was not ""appropriate"" to discuss Egyptian efforts to end the flare-up when the group was still retaliating for Abu al-Ata's death. Palestinian Islamic Jihad has vowed to avenge the death of Baha Abu al-Ata ""When we complete the response, it is possible to discuss calm,"" he said. At the start of a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu warned PIJ that if it did not halt the rocket fire Israel would continue to hit Gaza. ""They have but one choice: either stop these attacks or absorb more and more blows,"" he said. Earlier, IDF spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman told Israeli media that additional Iron Dome batteries had been deployed to central Israel as a precaution, and that commando units had been sent to communities near the Gaza border to defend them in case of infiltration attacks by militants. Israel's military said it had moved reinforcements to communities near the Gaza border There has been no sign yet that Hamas, which controls Gaza, intends to join the fight. If it does, the conflict would escalate sharply, says the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Jerusalem. In order to prevent that, Israeli officials have signalled they are targeting only PIJ, and not Hamas. Gen Zilberman said the IDF was ""walking on a tight-rope"". Our correspondent says it is the first time that Israeli officials are drawing a distinction between the two groups during a cross border flare-up - normally they hold Hamas responsible for any violence from Gaza. The IDF said on Tuesday that Baha Abu al-Ata had undermined recent efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

Corbyn rows back on indyref2 timing comments,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: 'Tory austerity impoverished millions' Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has rowed back on comments that he would not back a Scottish independence referendum in the ""first term"" of a new government. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP will not help Mr Corbyn into power unless he accepts the ""principle"" of a second referendum. Mr Corbyn initially told reporters that this would not happen in the first five-year term of a Labour government. He later clarified that it would not be a priority in the ""early years"". â¬Mr Corbyn was speaking in Glasgow at the beginning of a two-day campaign visit to Scotland, which will conclude with a rally in Edinburgh on Thursday. Labour has previously said it would not back an independence referendum in 2020, but could change its position if the SNP wins the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021. The latest from the general election trail Sturgeon lists SNP's conditions for backing Labour Mr Corbyn told journalists in Glasgow that there would be ""no referendum in the first term of a Labour government, because I think we need to concentrate completely on investment in Scotland"". This appeared to go further than the party's previous comments on the prospect of indyref2 if it wins power. But a few hours later, Mr Corbyn reverted back to Labour's previous position by saying that he would ""not countenance an independence referendum in the early years of a Labour government because our priorities will be elsewhere."" Jeremy Corbyn was greeted in Glasgow by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard Pressed further on whether he would grant a vote if the SNP won the Holyrood election, Mr Corbyn replied: ""I'm not in favour of it at all because I think the priorities for Scotland are ending inequality, poverty and injustice across Scotland and independence will bring with it an economic problem for Scotland."" He also told BBC Scotland editor Brian Taylor that: ""In the early years of a Labour government I want to concentrate totally on investment all across the UK, including the Â£70bn I want to invest in Scotland."" A Labour source said the party would absolutely rule out a poll in 2020, and repeated Mr Corbyn's claim that the party would win the 2021 Scottish election. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has claimed that an ""alliance"" between Labour and the SNP if there is a hung parliament would ""ruin 2020"" with two referendums - one on independence and another on the EU. Nicola Sturgeon has said Mr Corbyn must accept the ""principle"" of a new independence poll to win SNP backing Ms Sturgeon has insisted that Mr Corbyn should not ""pick up the phone"" to ask for the support of SNP MPs unless he is ready to accept the ""principle"" of a second independence referendum, as well as ending austerity and offering further powers to Holyrood. Responding to Mr Corbyn's comments, she said: ""âªI won't help him in power, to get into power, to stay in power if he doesn't accept the principle that whether there is a referendum in Scotland and what the timescale of that referendum should be should be determined by the people of Scotland."" She called it a ""basic issue of democracy"" but claimed it was ""highly unlikely"" Labour would give up a chance at being in government by rejecting an independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon added: ""The reason that I think Jeremy Corbyn keeps getting into a mess on this question is that he knows that it is not democratically acceptable or democratically sustainable to block the right of the Scottish people to choose their future."" When Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader, the party hoped he'd make the SNP look like moderate centrists and he would win back left wing voters to the red corner. But that project has had only limited success. Most of their voters have been lost to the SNP. And many of those who still vote Labour in Westminster elections are sympathetic to the idea of Scottish independence - or at least to having another referendum to allow Scotland to decide. So you'd think the Labour Party's flirtation with the idea of allowing a second vote on independence would be welcome. But instead it appears to have thrown confusion into the debate. While the SNP are ferociously in favour of independence, and the Tories (and Lib Dems) implacably opposed, Labour seem lost in the middle. Squeezed out of the biggest debate in Scotland. Read more from Sarah here As he arrived for the Glasgow campaign,Mr Corbyn was heckled by a Church of Scotland minister who branded him a ""terrorist sympathiser"". As Mr Corbyn was telling reporters about a scarf given to him by a charity group, Richard Cameron - the minister at the local Scotstoun Parish Church - shouted that he thought the Labour leader would be wearing an ""Islamic jihad scarf"". He added: ""Who's going to be the first terrorist invited to the House of Commons when you're prime minister?"" A spokeswoman for the Church of Scotland rebuked Mr Cameron, saying: ""Whilst we may occasionally robustly challenge policy issues with which we disagree, we always intend to do that in a way that is polite and measured and allows for reasoned debate."" Mr Johnson will say he wants to avoid ""more political self-obsession"" The Conservatives and the Lib Dems have both positioned themselves in opposition to a second independence referendum. Speaking at an electric vehicle manufacturer in the West Midlands, Boris Johnson said everyone in the UK faces ""a historic choice"" on 12 December. He said: ""At this election, the country can either move forwards with policies that will deliver years of growth and prosperity, or it can disappear into an intellectual cul-de-sac of far-left Corbynism. ""We can honour the wishes of the people, or else we can waste more time, at the cost of a billion pounds per month, and have two more referendums, one on Scotland and one on the EU - an expense of spirit and a waste of shame, more political self-obsession."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said his party ""will never support another independence referendum"". Speaking at a nursery in Dunfermline while promoting his party's childcare policy, he said: ""It's really important we move on, we learn the lessons from Brexit rather than trying to repeat them with independence. ""Let's try to tackle things like childcare expansion, let's tackle the climate emergency, deal with mental health service problems that we've got in this country. We've had enough of the division and damage over the constitution.""

Royal Mail wins bid to halt Christmas post strikes,"Royal Mail has won its legal battle to prevent a postal strike after the High Court backed its application for an injunction. The decision is a setback for union plans to stage strikes in the run-up to the general election and Christmas. Last month, 100,000 Royal Mail staff were balloted and voted to take action over job security and terms. But Royal Mail argued that the ballot had ""potential irregularities"" and was null and void. The Communications Workers Union (CWU) said its members were ""extremely angry and bitterly disappointed"". It also accused Royal Mail of a ""cowardly and vicious attack on its own workforce"" and said it intended to appeal. Royal Mail workers vote for strike action Royal Mail fails to halt record Â£50m Ofcom fine Shane O'Riordain, director of corporate affairs at Royal Mail, said it had not taken the decision to go to the High Court lightly. ""We sought to reach resolution outside the courts. We asked CWU to confirm it would refrain from taking industrial action, based on clear evidence of planned and orchestrated breaches by CWU officials of their legal obligations."" Members of the CWUvoted by 97% in favour of a nationwide strike, saying the company had failed to adhere to an employment deal agreed last year. Royal Mail denied this and said it had evidence of CWU members coming under pressure to vote ""yes"" in the ballot. This included, the company said, union members ""being encouraged to open their ballot papers on site, mark them as 'yes', with their colleagues present and filming or photographing them doing so, before posting their ballots together at their workplace postboxes"". Royal Mail said this amounted to a ""de facto workplace ballot"", contrary to rules on industrial action, to maximise the turnout and the ""yes"" vote. The CWU thought the ballot result couldn't have been clearer - a 97% vote in favour of strike action on a turnout of 76%. Barring the result of any appeal, the CWU will have to go back to the drawing board and re-ballot its 110,000 members. It's not a quick process and there's a strict code of practice to follow which takes at least a month. Realistically, it seems there's little chance of strike action before the new year, meaning postal workers have lost their moment of maximum leverage. A Christmas strike plus a threat to postal votes during the election would have been very damaging for the Royal Mail. It'll now be breathing a temporary sigh of relief. But the dispute, which covers a wide range of issues, is far from over. Royal Mail's procedures state that employees cannot open their mail at delivery offices without the prior authorisation of their manager. But CWU lawyers argued there was no evidence of interference with the ballot and that ""legitimate partisan campaigning"" by the union in favour of a ""yes"" vote did not violate the rules. In the High Court, Mr Justice Swift said in his judgement: ""This was an interference that was accurately described as improper. Strike ballots should be postal ballots. Each voter should receive a voting paper at home. ""What CWU did was a form of subversion of the ballot process. It was an interference with voting."" If the action had gone ahead, it would have been Royal Mail's first national postal strike in a decade. In the 2017-18 financial year, Royal Mail delivered about 14.4 billion letters and 1.2 billion parcels.

Secrets of the largest ape that ever lived,"Little is known about the ape as only a few fossils are known, including this jawbone A fossilised tooth left behind by the largest ape that ever lived is shedding new light on the evolution of apes. Gigantopithecus blackiwas thought to stand nearly three metres tall and tip the scales at 600kg. In an astonishing advance, scientists have obtained molecular evidence from a two-million-year-old fossil molar tooth found in a Chinese cave. The mystery ape is a distant relative of orangutans, sharing a common ancestor around 12 million years ago. ""It would have been a distant cousin (of orangutans), in the sense that its closest living relatives are orangutans, compared to other living great apes such as gorillas or chimpanzees or us,"" said Dr Frido Welker, from the University of Copenhagen. Artist reconstruction of the ape The research, reported inNature, is based on comparing the ancient protein sequence of the tooth of the extinct ape, believed to be a female, with apes alive today. 'Astonishing' fossil ape discovery revealed Mystery ape found in ancient tomb. Obtaining skeletal protein from a two-million-year-old fossil is rare if not unprecedented, raising hopes of being able to look even further back in time at other ancient ancestors, including humans, who lived in warmer regions. There is a much poorer chance of being able to find ancient DNA or proteins in tropical climates, where samples tend to degrade quicker. ""This study suggests that ancient proteins might be a suitable molecule surviving across most of recent human evolution even for areas like Africa or Asia and we could thereby in the future study our own evolution as a species over a very long time span,"" Dr Welker told BBC News. Gigantopithecus blackiwas first identified in 1935 based on a single tooth sample. The ape is thought to have lived in Southeast Asia from two million years ago to 300,000 years ago. Many teeth and four partial jawbones have been identified but the animal's relationship to other great ape species has been hard to decipher. The ape reached massive proportions, exceeding that of living gorillas, based on analysis of the few bones that have been found. It is thought to have gone extinct when the environment changed from forest to savannah.

Hidden rape conviction target revealed,"Rape prosecutors in England and Wales were given a conviction rate target which was never made public. BBC Newsnight has had access to a Law Society Gazette investigation, which found that from 2016 prosecutors were judged against a 60% target of cases ending in conviction. This may have caused prosecutors to drop weaker cases, campaigners say. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the target was used for ""benchmarking"" - and has been dropped. The CPS decides whether cases investigated by the police go to trial. Rape convictions in England and Wales are at theirlowest level since 2008,external, despite record levels of allegations. According to guidance set down in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, decisions should be based on two things: whether it's in the public interest, and if the case has more than a 50% chance of a conviction. Why are rape prosecutions falling? Rape accuser 'devastated' at case being dropped 'Why did the CPS drop my rape case?' But from 2016, rape prosecutors were also asked to consider a conviction rate target called a ""level of ambition"" of 60%. One way to achieve improved conviction rates is by prosecuting only the strongest cases. If 10 rape cases are prosecuted and five of them result in convictions, the conviction rate is 50%. But if only the strongest three cases are prosecuted and all three result in convictions, the conviction rate goes up to 100% - but fewer rapists have been brought to justice. The 60% rape conviction rate target was never made public by the CPS, but was discovered by the Law Society Gazette after a trawl through CPS inspection reports. In one such report, inspectors criticised the Cheshire-Merseyside regional CPS for missing the target in 2017. Their conviction rate was 57.3%, down from 65.4% the previous year, but their actual number of rape convictions had gone up from 100 to 138 in the same period. The following year, the same team introduced a  ""more stringent triage process for police files"" on rape. Their number of convictions dropped to 81 - the lowest for years - but by prosecuting fewer cases they actually exceeded the CPS target. Their conviction rate was 68%. Newsnight has also spoken to a source who attended a training session for specialist rape prosecutors in 2017. The source said senior CPS lawyers told prosecutors that the CPS would like to see conviction rates of 61% or 62% for rape cases. Harriet Wistrich from the Centre for Women's Justice said the use of conviction targets was ""extremely worrying"" A coalition of women's organisations, represented by the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ), has launched a legal case against the service for what it says is an unlawful change in approach by the CPS. Lawyer Harriet Wistrich, founder of the CWJ, told Newsnight: ""What a change in the conviction rate would suggest is if they're being targeted to improve their convictions, the easiest way to do that is to take weaker cases out of the system. ""If those that rape are not being held to account, they will feel they can continue doing so with impunity."" In response to the investigation, the CPS said it had stopped using ""conviction levels of ambition"" in April 2018. ""We acknowledged they were not an appropriate tool to measure our success in bringing the right cases to court,"" a spokesman said. The CPS has repeatedly denied any change in policy on rape that might account for the collapse in prosecutions. ""We are clear that all our cases should be assessed on whether there is a realistic prospect of conviction based on individual merit - no other reason,"" the spokesman added. Conviction rate targets were not only applied to rape. A 75% target was applied to domestic violence cases, while the target for hate crime cases was an 85% level of conviction. An 85% conviction rate target was also applied to all magistrate court cases, with those in the Crown Court subject to a slightly lower level, 81.5%. A CPS spokesman said: ""While it is important that we track trends, and constantly strive to improve performance, no individual charging decision is influenced by any factor other than the merits of the case.""

Rapper Kodak Black jailed for nearly four years,"US rapper Kodak Black has been sentenced to 46 months in prison after pleading guilty to weapons charges. The 22-year-old, who had a US number one album last December, admitted falsifying information on background forms to buy four guns. He was arrestedbefore his set at Miami's Rolling Loud festival in May. One of the guns he bought was used in an attempted shooting in March. Prosecutors said ""a rival rap artist was the intended target"". However, he has not been charged in relation to that shooting. Real name Bill K Kapri, the hip-hop star faced a maximum of 10 years in prison, and prosecutors had pushed for a sentence of eight years. The court heard he was alleged to have beaten up a prison guard while awaiting sentencing. US District Judge Federico Moreno acknowledged that Black had made anonymous donations to charity in the past. Black's lawyer Bradford Cohen told BBC News: ""After the court was apprised of all the facts and circumstances of this case and the good charitable work that Bill has done over the years, the court rejected the government's request of 96 months and sentenced Bill to 46 months."" The MC has had a number of legal charges and spells in prison in recent years, and is known for his violent lyrics. His debut studio album Painting Pictures went to number three in the US in 2017. The follow-up went to number two, and a third album, Dying to Live, reached number one last December. Two hit singles - Zeze and Tunnel Vision - have reached the Billboard top 10.

Sexting ex-MP's estranged wife is Tory candidate,"This video can not be played Kate Griffiths was selected as the Tory candidate for Burton The estranged wife of a former Tory MP who sent thousands of sexual messages to two women has been selected as the candidate for his seat. Andrew Griffiths, 49, who is standing down from frontline politics, has said he is backing his wife, Kate. She was selected as the Tory candidate for Burton on Thursday. However, Mrs Griffiths said she was divorcing her husband, and had not sought, and does not accept, his offer of political support. Mr Griffiths resigned as small business ministerin July after a newspaper reported he sent the women more than 2,000 messages in 21 days, weeks after the birth of his first child. He wascleared of wrongdoingby the parliamentary standards watchdog, which said it found no evidence he sent the messages while engaged in parliamentary activities. A Conservative party investigationfound he may have breached the Conservatives' code of conductbut said ""given his state of mental health both now and at the time"" further action would be inappropriate. In a statement, Mrs Griffiths said the last 18 months had been the ""most difficult"" of her life but she had found a ""strength and resilience I didn't know I had"". Andrew Griffiths said he ""cared passionately"" about the Tory party and the constituency Mrs Griffiths said she left Mr Griffiths ""on the day that he told me about the behaviour that was published in the press"" and their divorce is being finalised. ""I am not able to say more about this now as legal proceedings are ongoing but I want to make it clear that I have not sought, nor do I accept Andrew's offer of political support,"" she said. She said, if elected, she wanted to be an advocate for abuse survivors. Announcing his decision not to stand, Mr Griffiths, who became the MP in May 2010, said he still ""cared passionately"" about the constituency. ""I'm invested in this place, I have put my whole life into it and I also love the Conservative party,"" he said. Latest news from the West Midlands Other candidates confirmed to be standing for the seat so far are: Louise Walker for Labour, Adam Wain for the Liberal Democrats Kate Copeland for the Green Party Dale Prime has confirmed he is no longer standing for the Brexit Party afterleader Nigel Farage said it would not stand in Tory seats.

One-off Friends TV reunion on the cards,"All six Friends actors are in talks for a one-off unscripted reunion show, according to reports in the US. The Hollywood Reporter,externalandVariety,externalclaim the special programme would be shown on new streaming site HBO Max. However it would apparently not involve fully reviving the hit sitcom, which ran from 1994-2004. HBO Max secured the US rights to all 10 seasons of Friends for $425m (Â£340m) for its service, which is due to launch in April 2020. Is the time finally right for a Friends reboot? Born after Friends began - and now big fans The show will move from Netflix, where it has found anew lease of life with younger audiences, being the second most-watched show in 2018 - according to Nielsen data. Jennifer Aniston, who played Rachel on the show,recently joined Instagramand attracted almost five million followers in 12 hours after posting a selfie alongside co-stars Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. She later cryptically told US talk show host Ellen DeGeneres they were ""working on something"". She said: ""We would love for there to be something, but we don't know what that something is. So we're just trying.""

Donald Tusk: Don't give up on stopping Brexit,"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: ""I could have been fired for saying this"" Outgoing European Council President Donald Tusk has urged British voters not to ""give up"" on stopping Brexit. As campaigning ramps up ahead of next month's general election, he warned that leaving the EU would leave the UK a ""second-rate player"". In a speech, he also said Brexit would likely mark the ""real end of the British Empire"". He is due to step down from his role next month, having held the post for five years. Mr Tusk's intervention comes as Conservative leader Boris Johnson said the UK Parliament was ""paralysed"" and had refused ""time and again to honour the mandate of the people and to deliver Brexit"". Former head of the UK diplomatic service Sir Simon Fraser said he believed Mr Tusk was a friend of the UK but argued making the comments was ""not the right thing to do"". ""I think the principle that politicians don't comment on the electoral affairs of other countries is a wise principle,"" he added. Brexit's fate in British hands, says Tusk PM vows to close 'opportunity gap' after Brexit Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Meanwhile, the UK has continued to refuse to put forward a candidate for the next European Commission, which is due to take office next month if approved by MEPs. The BBC understands the UK's EU ambassador has written to the Commission saying that a candidate will not be put forward due to the election. In the letter, Sir Tim Barrow is understood to say pre-election rules prevented ministers from putting forward nominees for jobs at EU institutions until after polling day. However, he is understood to have insisted the UK does not want to stop the Commission being formed as soon as possible. Mr Johnson is hoping to win a majority in 12 December's election so that he can take the UK out of the EU on 31 January with the deal he negotiated with Brussels. But Labour is promising to renegotiate that deal and put it to a referendum, with the option of remaining in the EU, if it wins the election - and smaller opposition parties are campaigning to Remain. Speaking at the College of Europe in Bruges, Mr Tusk said: ""Brexit may happen at the beginning of next year. ""I did everything in my power to avoid the confrontational no-deal scenario and extend the time for reflection and a possible British change of heart"". ""The UK election takes place in one month. Can things still be turned around? ""The only words that come to my mind today are simply: Don't give up. ""In this match, we had added time, we are already in extra time, perhaps it will even go to penalties?"" Donald Tusk's term of office ends in a few weeks' time. Which means he's prepared to brave accusations that he's interfering in the general election. And that he feels free to challenge the sense developing among the rest of the EU, that it would be better if the UK left as soon as possible. Speaking at the College of Europe in Bruges tonight, he quoted the philosopher Hannah Arendt to encourage those campaigning for Britain to remain. His message was simply not to give up. The EU has accepted an extension to the Brexit deadline, meaning the UK is now due to leave at the end of January 2020. Mr Tusk has repeatedly hinted he would like to see the UK stay in the bloc - but his comments, in the midst of an election campaign - are likely to be controversial. He acknowledged this in his speech, adding his remarks were ""something I wouldn't have dared to say a few months ago, as I could be fired for being too frank"". He added that a ""longing for the Empire"" could be heard in the voices of Brexiteers who strive to make the UK ""global again"" through leaving the EU. ""But the reality is exactly the opposite. Only as part of a united Europe can the UK play a global role,"" he added. ""One of my English friends is probably right when he says with melancholy that Brexit is the real end of the British Empire."" Mr Tusk is due to stand down from his role on 1 December, when he will be replaced by former Belgian PM Charles Michel.

Labour pledges to close gender pay gap by 2030,"The Labour Party has vowed to close the gender pay gap by 2030 if it wins the election. The difference between men's and women's average pay would take another 60 years to close under a Conservative government, the party said. But the Conservative Party said that Labour was ""over-promising"". The Tories said the pay gap was at a record low and that there had been ""huge progress since 2010"" in terms of the number of women in work. The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. The Fawcett Society said it would take until almost 2080 for the gender pay gap to close at the current rate. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) puts that at about 35 years. General election 2019: Labour promises year of maternity pay Millennial men demand better parental leave As well as the new 2030 pay gap target, Labour also restated some policies that will become manifesto commitments. These included introducing a ""real living wage"" of Â£10 per hour and creating a Worker's Protection Agency with HMRC with powers to fine organisations that fail to report gender pay. Labour said the new agency would check firms with more than 250 employees were meeting gender equality criteria on recruitment, career progression, pay and work-life balance. Those that did would become certified. Labour would then lower that threshold by the end of 2020 to workplaces with 50 employees. It will also extend maternity pay from nine to 12 months and introduce free childcare for two to four-year-olds. Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, said: ""Labour's real living wage, robust gender pay auditing - including fining organisations that fail to take action - will help us deliver real change and meet this ambitious target."" But Liz Truss, who was the Conservative Women and Equalities Minister, said: ""Yet again (Jeremy) Corbyn's Labour are overpromising something they cannot deliver. She said Mr Corbyn's focus would not be on opportunities for women. The Tories said the pay gap was ""at a record low"" having fallen from 27.5% in 1997 to 17.3% in 2019 for all employees. The party added that female employment was at 71.8% according to the latest figures, close to a record high, and that it had launched a ""roadmap for gender equality"". Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said firms shared the Labour Party's goal but: ""Creating inclusive workplaces where everyone can thrive is the only way to tackle gender inequality at work."" He said the gender pay gap was caused by a wide range of factors - such as the availability of childcare, career progression and improved careers advice - which required business and government to work in partnership to bring change. But he said that Labour's gender equality certification plan would add ""bureaucracy"" for businesses. The causes of the gap aren't simple. Women are far more likely than men to take substantial parental leave, which can hamper career progression. Studies have shown that the more kids you have, the less likely you are as a woman to enjoy the same pay as men of the same age; and affordability of childcare is crucial to woman returning to work. But closing the gender pay gap is a knotty problem. The CBI, for example, says it shares the Labour Party's ambition to close the gender pay gap as quickly as possible. But it doubts whether a system of fines and government certification will do the job. All of the measures Labour laid out to achieve it have already been announced; no new money is being promised.

PCs charged over footballer's death named,"Dalian Atkinson played for Aston Villa, Ipswich Town and Sheffield Wednesday A court order protecting the identity of two police officers charged in connection with the death of Dalian Atkinson has been lifted by a judge. The ex-Aston Villa striker, 48, died after he was restrained by police and Tasered at his father's house in Telford, Shropshire, in 2016. West Mercia Police constable Benjamin Monk is charged with murder. A second officer, Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, is charged with assault causing actual bodily harm. Judge Simon Drew QC, sitting at Birmingham Crown Court, overturned the Contempt of Court Act order, allowing the naming of the officers after submissions by media organisations. Police constables Benjamin Monk and Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith arriving at Birmingham Crown Court earlier Both officers were present at the hearing, at which their lawyers agreed that anonymity could not be justified, instead arguing that their home addresses should not be revealed in media reports. The officers had been granted the interim order banning publication of their names last week after it was argued there were risks to their safety. Lawyers acting for six media organisations argued that the anonymity orders were an ""unjustified"" and represented a serious interference with common law open justice principles. Latest news from the West Midlands An alternative charge of an unlawful act manslaughter has been put forward by the CPS for PC Monk. PC Bettley-Smith has indicated that she will plead not guilty. The 29-year-old officer and her 41-year-old colleague are both from Shropshire, but a court order prevents the media from reporting their home addresses. Mr Atkinson, who also played for Ipswich and Sheffield Wednesday, was detained outside an address in Trench, Telford at about 01:30 on 15 August 2016. He was taken by ambulance to the Princess Royal Hospital, where he died. Both defendants are next expected to appear in court on 9 December for a plea and trial preparation hearing.

PM vows to close 'opportunity gap' after Brexit,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our ambition is unlock the whole nation's potential"" Delivering Brexit would help the UK close the ""opportunity gap between rich and poor"", Boris Johnson has said. In his first big speech of the election campaign, he promised to boost regional industry and drive a ""clean energy revolution"" after the UK leaves the EU. He said a future Tory government would double investment in high-tech research and development to Â£18bn. But earlier former Tory David Gauke said Mr Johnson's plan will lead to a ""bad outcome for the country"". And Labour said Mr Johnson's Brexit deal was flawed and another referendum was needed. In other election developments: Boris Johnson is heckled on a visit to flood-hit Stainforthto see the emergency response Jeremy Corbyn rows back on comments that he would not back a Scottish independence referendumin the ""first term"" of a new government Labour ispromising to outspend the Conservatives on the NHSin England The Lib Dems ruleout any electoral pacts with Labour after two of its candidates stand down Former Tory rebelDavid Gauke, who is standing as an independent candidate, says an outright Tory would be a ""bad outcome"" for the UK The SNP is to take legal actionover its exclusion from the ITV head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn The Green Party says it would appointa Carbon Chancellorto oversee its Green New Deal and policy Speaking during a visit to an electric taxi manufacturer near Coventry, the PM set out his vision for post-Brexit Britain, saying his goal was to unite the country and ""level up"" economic performance by boosting the regions. He said the UK must be at the heart of the world's ""green revolution"", harnessing the power of science, innovation and technology to tackle climate change and create high-skilled, high wage jobs. A Tory victory on 12 December would see the UK leave the EU in January, he said, and that would be good for the country's ""politics, economy and psychological health"" after months of paralysis. ""We must get Brexit done because we are democrats,"" he said, saying while Leave voters wanted the result of the 2016 referendum result to be respected, Remain voters also accepted the ""wrangling had to end"". What does 'Get Brexit done,' mean? Will delaying Brexit cost Â£1bn a month? Donald Tusk: Don't give up on stopping Brexit But he departed from excerpts of the speech briefed to the media on Tuesday, leaving out references to Brexit ""groundhoggery"" and claims that calls for another Brexit referendum and a further vote on Scottish independence were a form of ""onanism"", or masturbation. Asked about this at a press conference after the speech, he blamed it on a ""stray draft"" of the speech released to the media. The Tory leader said the UK's economic fundamentals were sound, but he compared the country to a ""cup-winning horse trying to run on three legs"" with huge untapped potential and often ""vastly different"" educational outcomes. ""If every child had the same start and the same encouragement, think of the all untapped talent in this country,"" he said. ""Yet the solution to that inequality is within our grasp... not just to close the opportunity gap between rich and poor but also between the regions of this country."" He promised to make the ""small improvements in life that people are craving"" by addressing transport bottlenecks, improving rural bus services and broadband connections. He also said British apprentices must be employed on all ""big new public sector"" contracts after Brexit. Mr Johnson said the UK must be at the heart of the world's ""green revolution"" To demonstrate his party's support for enterprise, he said a future Tory government would double funding for research and development to Â£18bn in the next Parliament, which would amount to the ""biggest ever increase in support for R&D"". ""We proudly back businesses across this country because they are creating the wealth that actually pays for the NHS and everything else."" A Labour victory, he claimed, would lead to a ""Technicolor coalition"" with the SNP, prolonging the uncertainty for business over Brexit and the future of the UK. The PM is facing claims from a former cabinet colleague that his electionwould lead to a ""very hard Brexit""after Mr Gauke attacked the policy of the Conservatives to not extend the implementation period for Brexit past December 2020. Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Labour has clear and simple Brexit plan - Corbyn The Tories plan to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Union during that time, but have pledged to leave without one if no deal is reached by the deadline. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage cited the pledge as one of the reasons for his decision not to stand candidates in the 317 seats won by the Tories at the last general election, in 2017. This video can not be played David Gauke says a Conservative majority will move the UK towards ""a very hard Brexit"" Mr Gauke said ""one simply cannot renegotiate a trade deal in that time period"", and leaving without a deal would be ""disastrous for the prosperity of our countryâ¦ [making] whole sectors unviable"". But Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, said his former colleague was ""wrong"". Tories in fresh attack on Labour spending plans Flooding an absolute tragedy, says PM 'Stop Brexit' megaphone man to stand for Lib Dems He defended the progress the prime minister has made on Brexit, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""People throughout the summer said that Boris Johnson would not be able to secure a deal with the EU. ""The withdrawal agreement will never be reopened, they said. The backstop is unviable, you won't get it changed. ""They are people who have been left with oeuf on their faces because he succeeded in securing that deal in defiance of the sceptics and the cynics, and we can secure a free trade agreement by the end of 2020."" MPs backed Mr Johnson's Brexit deal in principle before Parliament was dissolved. But they refused to endorse his timetable to rush it through in days, meaning the PM had to abandon his ""do or die"" pledge to take the UK out by the 31 October deadline.

New claim made as impeachment inquiry goes public,"This video can not be played Key moments from Trump impeachment hearing President Donald Trump directly asked about a Ukrainian investigation into his Democratic rival Joe Biden, a top US diplomat has unveiled. Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, told an impeachment inquiry that a member of his staff was told Mr Trump was keen to push for the probe. Mr Trump says he does not recall making the remark. He denies any wrongdoing. Mr Biden hopes to run against Mr Trump next year. It is illegal to ask foreign entities for help to win an election. He is accused of withholding US military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's new president to publicly announce a corruption inquiry into Mr Biden. Mr Trump has called the inquiry a ""witch-hunt"". During a detailed opening statement, Mr Taylor said a member of his staff had overheard a telephone call in which the president inquired about ""the investigations"" into Mr Biden. The call was with Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, who reportedly told the president over the phone from a restaurant in Kyiv that ""the Ukrainians were ready to move forward"". After the call, the staff member ""asked ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine"", Mr Taylor said. Mr Taylor said: ""Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden."" Meanwhile observers and former officials have drawn attention to the security implications of making the call from a restaurant, potentially exposing the conversation to eavesdropping by Russian intelligence. When asked about Mr Sondland earlier this month, the president had said: ""I hardly know the gentleman."" This video can not be played President Trump: ""The witch-hunt? I hear it's a joke... I haven't watched for one minute"" Responding to queries from reporters after the hearing, Mr Trump said: ""I know nothing about that, first time I've heard it."" He said he recalled Mr Sondland's testimony, in which the diplomat said he spoke to the president ""for a brief moment"" and Mr Trump had ""said no quid pro quo under any circumstances"". He did not recall the phone call Mr Taylor described, ""not even a little bit"", and ""in any event it's more second hand information"", he said. How an overheard phone call could damage Trump A timeline of the Trump-Ukraine story Who's who in Trump-Ukraine story? The impeachment inquiry has been going on for more than a month - but all previous hearings were private, with reports based on leaks and sources speaking to the media. Wednesday's public hearings were the first time the public heard from witnesses directly and a chance for Democrats and Republicans to win over voters. This has the potential to be a major twist. Although there have been reports of Mr Sondland's direct line to the president, there has yet to be evidence tying Mr Trump directly to the alleged quid pro quo. The phone call Mr Taylor described could change all that. In the middle of Wednesday's hearing, the House Intelligence Committee announced a new witness scheduled to give a closed-door deposition on Friday, an aide named David Holmes - reportedly the aide Mr Taylor mentioned. Next week, Mr Sondland himself is scheduled to testify during public hearings. If either of these two men supports Mr Taylor's account, it could undercut the president's defenders who have suggested that Mr Trump was not closely involved in the activities of the ""unofficial"" channel of Ukraine policy, as Mr Taylor called it, which was pressuring Ukraine to open up investigations into the Bidens. Democrats have reason to be pleased, while the president's team has a new set of headaches. Read more from Anthony Wednesday's hearing began with testimony from George Kent, a top US diplomat charged with overseeing European affairs. He told the committee that President Trump's private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, ran a ""campaign to smear"" the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, before she was recalled from her post. Meanwhile, much of Mr Taylor's other testimony repeated evidence he gave to private Congressional impeachment hearings, but he added new detail to the accounts in the public domain. The career diplomat, who has served under Republican and Democratic presidents, reiterated his understanding that the Trump administration threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless the Ukrainian president agreed to publicly announce an investigation into Mr Biden. He testified that he told Mr Sondland and Kurt Volker, previously the US special envoy to Ukraine, that it would be ""crazy"" to withhold security assistance for the sake of domestic politics. This video can not be played A Democrat and a Republican react to the first public impeachment hearing Adam Schiff, the Democratic Chairman of the Intelligence Committee overseeing the impeachment inquiry, said the purpose of the inquiry was to establish whether Mr Trump ""abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections"". ""If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?"" he added. The senior Republican on the Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, who is a staunch ally of the president, denounced the inquiry as ""a televised theatrical performance staged by the Democrats"". Republicans have been demanding the anonymous whistleblower, who filed a report that eventually triggered the impeachment proceedings, be compelled to give closed-door testimony to the committee. However, Mr Schiff said he would ""do everything necessary to protect the whistleblower's identity"". Mr Trump said he was ""too busy to watch"" the impeachment hearing, although he also tweeted and retweeted several posts about the inquiry on Wednesday. ""I want to find out who's the whistleblower,"" he told reporters after the hearing. SIMPLE GUIDE:A basic take on what's going on GO DEEPER:Here's a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story WHAT'S IMPEACHMENT?A political process to remove a president VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Hear from residents of a Virginia town ON THE DOORSTEP:A Democrat sells impeachment to voters The US House of Representatives is trying to establish whether Mr Trump abused the power of his office for personal gain. In a phone call in July, the Republican president asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic White House contender Joe Biden. His son, Hunter Biden, worked for a Ukrainian gas firm while his father was US vice-president. The US congressional inquiry has already heard that Mr Trump dangled nearly $400m (Â£327m) in military aid and a White House invitation in order to prod Ukraine's leader to announce a corruption inquiry that might have caused political embarrassment to Mr Biden. It is illegal to ask foreign entities for help in winning a US election. Mr Trump has denied the allegations and branded the impeachment hearings a ""phony showtrial"". Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If, following the hearings, the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.

Labour vows to outspend Tories on the NHS,"Labour is promising to spend more on the NHS in England than the Tories if it wins the general election. The NHS budget would rise to Â£155bn by 2023-24 - Â£6bn more than the government promised the front-line budget would reach by that stage when it set out its five-year plan last year. Labour said the money would cut waiting times and boost mental health services. But the Tories said Labour's plan for a shorter working week would eat into the funding due to the need for more staff. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the working hours policy,announced at Labour's annual conferencein September, would ""cripple our economy and cost the NHS billions every year"". But Labour said a 32-hour working-week would be phased in over 10 years so would not have the impact on NHS budgets claimed by the Tories, and it would also be offset by gains in productivity. Announcing his party's flagship election policy at the Royal Society of Medicine, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said after a ""decade of underfunding and cuts"" waiting lists had risen to ""record levels"". ""Only Labour has a plan to rescue the NHS,"" he added. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Labour's policy of taxing the ""richest in society"" and reversing cuts to corporation tax would release money to spend on healthcare. Lib Dem health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said: ""Labour's announcement completely misses the point. ""They are ignoring the fact that Brexit is the biggest threat to the NHS."" LIVE: Latest from the election campaign trail 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS Does UK lag other rich nations on health and care? Labour's proposals were welcomed by NHS leaders. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, said the pledge represented a ""significant extra investment"" on top of what has been set by the government. ""If used wisely, it would help to transform services and retain front-line staff."" This video can not be played Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says Tory claims are ""ridiculous"" During the summer of 2018, the Theresa May government announced a five-year funding settlement for the front line of the NHS in England. It also meant more money for other parts of the UK - under a system known as the Barnett Formula the devolved nations get the same percentage increases in areas like health - although it is up to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to decide where that is spent. In England it means the budget for NHS England will be Â£20bn more in 2023-24 than it was in 2018-19 once inflation is taken into account - a rise of 3.4% a year on average during the period. Labour has promised to top this up by Â£6bn by 2023-24 - an annual rise of 3.9% on average over the coming years. But this front-line budget - Â£121bn this year - does not cover the entirety of health spending. Another Â£18bn is being spent on other areas, including training staff, building projects and public health schemes like stop-smoking services. Read more of the BBC's Election 2019 coverage here: Johnson promises to end Brexit 'groundhoggery' Ex-Tory rebel Gauke to stand as independent Tories suspend members over Islamophobia claims Lib Dem stands down to avoid Remain vote split Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Labour has promised to increase these too. The most significant rise will be in the capital budget - for buildings, equipment and infrastructure. This year Â£7bn is being spent in this area after Boris Johnson increased the budget by Â£1bn shortly after he became prime minister. Labour says by 2023-24 the budget will top Â£10bn a year - a sum health academics have argued is needed to deal with the backlog in repairs and bring spending in line with other wealthy nations. The Tories have yet to set the budgets for these areas all the way through to 2023-24, although they have said investing in buildings and infrastructure is a priority. In terms of the front-line budget, Labour says the extra Â£26bn in real terms by 2023-4 they will be investing will help reduce waiting times in A&E and for routine operations such as knee and hip replacements - both targets for how long patients should wait have been missed for the last few years. They are also prioritising mental health, promising to fund more counselling services for schools, community mental health hubs and crisis teams. The wider increases in the overall health budget will help fund the return of the bursary for nurses and midwives to fund their time spent studying at university - the government scrapped these in 2017 - while they will also benefit from the Labour policy of scrapping tuition fees. Labour believes this will help address the shortage of nurses in the NHS. The party also wants to increase the number of GP training places from 3,500 a year to 5,000. Free prescriptions and hospital car parking will also be introduced. What is quite remarkable is just how similar the Tories and Labour are in terms of many of the areas they are focusing on. Both are looking to increase the budget by more than it has been in recent years - albeit Labour are promising 4% more by 2023-24 for the front line. Setting aside free prescriptions and car parking, which are not Tory policies, both parties are prioritising training extra staff and investing in new buildings and equipment Last week the Tories too pledged extra training places for GPs, saying they wanted to recruit an extra 6,000 GPs. The prime minister has also promised there will be 40 major hospital building projects in the next decade - although only six have been given a guarantee of funding so far. The Liberal Democrats are yet to give much detail about their policies - although they have promised a penny on income tax will be introduced, which will raise extra money for mental health, public health and social care.

A simple guide to what's happening,"This video can not be played A beginner's guide to impeachment and Trump US President Donald Trump has been impeached and now faces the next stage of a process that could, with enough support in Congress, see him removed from office. It all centres on whether or not he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election in 2020. Mr Trump became only the third president in US history to be impeached after two votes in the Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives - but more on what that means below. President Trump, who is a Republican, strongly denies any wrongdoing. President Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine to dig up damaging information on one of his main Democratic challengers for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter. Hunter worked for a Ukrainian company when Joe Biden was US vice-president. The president is accused of dangling two things as bargaining chips to Ukraine - withholding $400m of military aid to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress, and a White House meeting for Ukraine's president. This, Democrats say, amounts to an abuse of presidential power, using the office for personal political gain and to the detriment of national security. Ukraine was using that money in its ongoing conflict with Russia. Mr Trump is also accused of obstructing Congress by refusing to co-operate with the congressional inquiry. A formal complaint from a whistleblower - an unnamed intelligence official who wrote a letter expressing concern about Mr Trump's 25 July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky - kicked off the impeachment process in early September. A rough transcript of the call,externalrevealed that Mr Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate discredited allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of millions of dollars in US military aid to Ukraine.A senior official later testifiedthat the president made clear the release of the aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated, but the White House denies this. In a series of public hearings, a procession of US officials have testified that there was a White House shadow foreign policy led by the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Its aim was to get Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens and declare as much publicly. Mr Trump denies using US military aid as a bargaining chip with Mr Zelensky and has repeatedly insisted his call with Ukraine's leader was ""perfect"". He has called the impeachment inquiry a ""witch hunt"" by Democrats and elements of the media. He also says it was appropriate to ask Ukraine to investigate ""corruption"", referring to the energy firm where Hunter Biden worked. The Republican defence comes in three parts: - Ukraine's president said he felt no pressure - The Ukrainians were unaware the aid was held back - US military aid was eventually released To impeach, in this context, means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial. The US constitution states a president ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours"". It's important to note this is a political process, rather than a criminal one. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? It happens in two stages. The first stage is done now - two articles of impeachment (charges) were brought to the House of Representatives and passed in a vote along party lines. Next the process heads to the Senate where a trial will be held in January. But here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history. The Senate is currently controlled by the Republican Party so conviction is considered unlikely in Trump's case. Bill Clinton found himself impeached on the grounds of perjury and obstruction of justice after he lied about the nature of his affair with Monica Lewinsky and then allegedly asked her to lie about it as well. But when the trial reached the Senate in 1999, the vote for a conviction failed to get close to the two-thirds backing required. Bill and Hillary Clinton with US House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt after Mr Clinton was impeached The only other president impeached was Andrew Johnson in 1868. He was accused of, among other things, dismissing his secretary of war against the will of Congress. Mr Johnson had a narrow escape - the two-thirds majority in the Senate was missed by just one vote. President Andrew Johnson narrowly survived his impeachment trial Richard Nixon, the 37th US president, resigned in 1974 before he could be impeached over the Watergate scandal. The line of succession for the US government, as established by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, would mean Vice-President Mike Pence moving into the Oval Office.

SNP to take legal action over ITV election debate,"This video can not be played General election 2019: SNP to take legal action over ITV election debate The SNP is to take legal action against  ITV over its exclusion from the broadcaster's general election debate. ITV plans to show a head-to-head debate between Conservative leader Boris Johnson and his Labour counterpart Jeremy Corbyn next week. But SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""fundamentally unfair"" to not include her party, which is the third-largest in the UK. The Lib Dems have alreadylaunched a legal challenge to ITV's plan. Ms Sturgeon said the decision to only invite Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn to take part in the televised debate on 19 November ""fails to recognise that the UK is no longer a two party state"". Latest from the election campaign trail She added: ""The SNP is the third party in terms of Commons representation in the last Parliament, we are the governing party of Scotland and we are one of the biggest political parties in the whole of the UK in terms of membership.

""To exclude the SNP would be a fundamental breach of broadcasters' obligations to fully and properly represent and reflect the views of the whole UK."" Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson will be the only two politicians to take part in next week's primetime ITV debate Ms Sturgeon said her party would be launching a fundraiser to support the costs of the legal challenge, which she wants to be heard on Monday alongside the one from the Liberal Democrats. But she said that, unlike the Lib Dems, the SNP would be ""arguing not just for the SNP but for other parties to have a place in this debate as well, just as was the case in the ITV leaders' debate of 2015"". When ITV announced its plans, the channel said it would hold a live interview-based programme alongside the leaders' head-to-head to allow other parties to comment. It also said it would host another multi-party debate ahead of the election on 12 December. The BBC will host a live head-to-head debate between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn in Southampton on 6 December, and will also broadcast a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. And BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

"New claim made as impeachment inquiry goes publicDonald Trump was overheard asking about ""investigations"" into Joe Biden, a top US diplomat says.US & Canada","This video can not be played Key moments from Trump impeachment hearing President Donald Trump directly asked about a Ukrainian investigation into his Democratic rival Joe Biden, a top US diplomat has unveiled. Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, told an impeachment inquiry that a member of his staff was told Mr Trump was keen to push for the probe. Mr Trump says he does not recall making the remark. He denies any wrongdoing. Mr Biden hopes to run against Mr Trump next year. It is illegal to ask foreign entities for help to win an election. He is accused of withholding US military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's new president to publicly announce a corruption inquiry into Mr Biden. Mr Trump has called the inquiry a ""witch-hunt"". During a detailed opening statement, Mr Taylor said a member of his staff had overheard a telephone call in which the president inquired about ""the investigations"" into Mr Biden. The call was with Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, who reportedly told the president over the phone from a restaurant in Kyiv that ""the Ukrainians were ready to move forward"". After the call, the staff member ""asked ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine"", Mr Taylor said. Mr Taylor said: ""Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden."" Meanwhile observers and former officials have drawn attention to the security implications of making the call from a restaurant, potentially exposing the conversation to eavesdropping by Russian intelligence. When asked about Mr Sondland earlier this month, the president had said: ""I hardly know the gentleman."" This video can not be played President Trump: ""The witch-hunt? I hear it's a joke... I haven't watched for one minute"" Responding to queries from reporters after the hearing, Mr Trump said: ""I know nothing about that, first time I've heard it."" He said he recalled Mr Sondland's testimony, in which the diplomat said he spoke to the president ""for a brief moment"" and Mr Trump had ""said no quid pro quo under any circumstances"". He did not recall the phone call Mr Taylor described, ""not even a little bit"", and ""in any event it's more second hand information"", he said. How an overheard phone call could damage Trump A timeline of the Trump-Ukraine story Who's who in Trump-Ukraine story? The impeachment inquiry has been going on for more than a month - but all previous hearings were private, with reports based on leaks and sources speaking to the media. Wednesday's public hearings were the first time the public heard from witnesses directly and a chance for Democrats and Republicans to win over voters. This has the potential to be a major twist. Although there have been reports of Mr Sondland's direct line to the president, there has yet to be evidence tying Mr Trump directly to the alleged quid pro quo. The phone call Mr Taylor described could change all that. In the middle of Wednesday's hearing, the House Intelligence Committee announced a new witness scheduled to give a closed-door deposition on Friday, an aide named David Holmes - reportedly the aide Mr Taylor mentioned. Next week, Mr Sondland himself is scheduled to testify during public hearings. If either of these two men supports Mr Taylor's account, it could undercut the president's defenders who have suggested that Mr Trump was not closely involved in the activities of the ""unofficial"" channel of Ukraine policy, as Mr Taylor called it, which was pressuring Ukraine to open up investigations into the Bidens. Democrats have reason to be pleased, while the president's team has a new set of headaches.

He told the committee that President Trump's private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, ran a ""campaign to smear"" the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, before she was recalled from her post. Meanwhile, much of Mr Taylor's other testimony repeated evidence he gave to private Congressional impeachment hearings, but he added new detail to the accounts in the public domain. The career diplomat, who has served under Republican and Democratic presidents, reiterated his understanding that the Trump administration threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless the Ukrainian president agreed to publicly announce an investigation into Mr Biden. He testified that he told Mr Sondland and Kurt Volker, previously the US special envoy to Ukraine, that it would be ""crazy"" to withhold security assistance for the sake of domestic politics.

""If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?"" he added. The senior Republican on the Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, who is a staunch ally of the president, denounced the inquiry as ""a televised theatrical performance staged by the Democrats"". Republicans have been demanding the anonymous whistleblower, who filed a report that eventually triggered the impeachment proceedings, be compelled to give closed-door testimony to the committee. However, Mr Schiff said he would ""do everything necessary to protect the whistleblower's identity"".

What can we read into the polls?,"An old hand once offered me a wise piece of advice: if an opinion poll generates a strong headline it will probably turn out to be wrong. So it is sensible to treat the polls with caution. At this stage of the 2017 general election, the world was debating whether Theresa May's majority would be above or below 100. But opinion polls can provide a helpful snapshot of the electorate's thinking at the moment they are conducted. With four weeks to go until election day, there appear to be two clear strands in the current polls. First, Boris Johnson is ahead, in part because the Leave vote is rallying behind the Conservatives. The second theme is that the Remain vote is splintering. That explains, in part, why Labour is so far behind the Tories and why the Liberal Democrats are continuing to enjoy a revival. LIVE: Election campaign latest General election 2019: A really simple guide General election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? At this point a second rule of opinion poll reporting applies. Political parties will loftily claim they have better things to worry about than opinion polls, all the while spending a fortune on ""private"" polls and poring over every detail of published polls. Downing Street believes the only way Boris Johnson can deliver his Brexit deal and the subsequent future EU trade negotiations is by securing a credible parliamentary majority - 330 seats is effectively the minimum. The Remain side - many Labour candidates and the Lib Dems as a whole - think Boris Johnson is highly likely to win the largest number of seats at the election. And so their most realistic ambition is to deny him a parliamentary majority. The way to do that is to play the classic underdog card of saying: put a check on the frontrunner. The argument will have to be phrased carefully because of course, everyone insists they are on course for victory. But expect an argument along these lines: with a majority Boris Johnson can do what he likes on Brexit, so rein him in. This is where the former Conservative Lord Chancellor David Gauke enters the picture. One of Gauke's principal arguments for running as an independent in South West Hertfordshire - where he has been the MP since 2005 - is the fear that an unrestricted Boris Johnson government would threaten a no-deal Brexit through refusing to extendthe transition periodbeyond December 2020. The transition, dubbed the ""membership minus votes"" period, when the UK has all the benefits and obligations of EU membership without a say on the rules, is due to run out at the end of December next year. It can, in theory, be extended by one or two years. Gauke - who lost the whip in September for voting toblock a no-deal Brexit- agreed to vote for Johnson's new Brexit deal in October after being given a specific undertaking in the Commons by Robert Buckland. Buckland, his successor as Lord Chancellor, said MPs would be able to vote before 1 July on whether to extend the trade talks by one or two years. Talks are due to take place during the transition period that will kick in after the UK leaves the EU on 31 January. General election 2019: Tory majority 'bad outcome for country', says Gauke What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Brexit: What is in Boris Johnson's new deal with the EU? However if the prime minister wins a majority, the Buckland commitment will probably die. While Brexiteer cabinet ministers are delighted, more pro-European cabinet ministers are disappointed. If Johnson fails to secure a majority, the Buckland commitment could return to life. It may be the price the prime minister has to pay to stay in office. David Gauke may provide the Remain side with a rallying cry on the threat of a new no-deal Brexit. But the pro-Europeans are divided, as the Liberal Democrats demonstrated when they pledged to stand against Gauke. Boris Johnson, by contrast, is rapidly becoming the unofficial leader of the Leave side, even as The Brexit Party's Nigel Farageditched plans to take on the Toriesin more than 300 seats. And a united political force will always have an easier job in imposing its will. You can watchNewsnighton BBC Two at 22:30 on weekdays.

Flood-hit villagers 'could be homeless for weeks',"This video can not be played The BBC's David Shukman views the scale of the flooding in the Doncaster area from a helicopter Some residents in a flood-stricken village could be out of their homes for up to three weeks as efforts continue to make the area safe. Doncaster Council said 1,900 people had been taken to safety, with the village of Fishlake being one of the worst hit. About 200 Army workers are in South Yorkshire supporting the flood effort. The prime minister visited flood-hit Stainforth to see the emergency response. But some onlookers shouted at him to say ""you took your time"". One resident told Boris Johnson: ""I'm not very happy about talking to you so, if you don't mind, I'll just mope on with what I'm doing."" Mr Johnson said he understood the strength of feeling as ""you cannot underestimate the anguish that a flood causes"". Doncaster flooding: Latest updates Shelley Beniston, who is organising supply runs in Fishlake, told Mr Johnson there had not been enough help from authorities. When the prime minister asked if there was anything he could do to help, she replied: ""I think it's more or less all coming in now, a little bit too late though."" The PM said the government was ""plainly going to have to do more"" to equip places with flood defences. Speaking in Warwickshire on Wednesday evening Mr Johnson added: ""We as a country need to be investing in the long term in flood defences. ""We have already put Â£2.6bn in as a government and we've ensured that places that are particularly vulnerable get more per capita. ""That's why I stress importance of investment in infrastructure"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson got a frosty reception from some residents in South Yorkshire Doncaster Council said every effort was being made to increase pumping so people could return home sooner but more widespread rain is forecast, withwarnings in place for large parts of the country. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: ""Obviously the prospect of any more rainfall is troubling for people in areas where catchments are already full. ""Taking on more rainfall is only going to add to the problems that are already there."" South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said it was monitoring the weather ""closely"" and had ""resources on the ground and on standby if needed"". Assistant chief fire officer Steve Helps advised residents to ""watch the news, monitor the weather forecast and of course to take direction from the police, the emergency services or local authorities"". Contingency plans include additional high volume pumps and boats. Electricity supplier Northern Powergrid said it had brought in additional staff and resources in case of problems. It said it was putting in flood barriers around two electricity substations which power around 15,000 homes and businesses in the Doncaster area. Personnel from the Light Dragoons have laid sandbags in Stainforth, near Doncaster, in a bid to shore up the village's bridge. About 500 homes have been flooded in Doncaster with 1,200 properties evacuated in areas hit by the floods. Hundreds of people in Fishlake have fled their homes after the village was submerged and the fire service has been working to rescue people. The council said the village was not safe and that ""a return to properties is discouraged in the strongest possible terms"". Roads into Fishlake remain closed and the Environment Agency said people should not attempt to enter the area. Soldiers have been helping move sandbags in areas affected by the flooding Doncaster Council said the Environment Agency, along with emergency services, were working hard to make the area safe but ""the latest estimates suggest a safe return could be up to three weeks away for some residents"". Scott Godfrey, landlord of the Hare and Hounds, has been using the pub as a refuge, giving affected residents accommodation and hot food as well as delivering meals to people stranded in their homes. He said they had been let down by the council ""big style"" because it had rowed back on its promise of helping with provisions to send out to villagers. ""We had 45 residents that were stranded who wanted meals. Luckily everyone pulled together and we managed to get some hot meals out,"" he said. The authority said it would now be offering humanitarian aid to those who have remained in Fishlake but added this should not be attempted by residents. Meanwhile, the neighbouring village of Stainforth has been coming to the aid of those evacuated from their homes. Soldiers from Light Dragoons receive a briefing from Doncaster Council On Tuesday, Mr Johnson announced more support for communities affected by flooding following a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. It came amid criticism from Labour and the Liberal Democrats who said he should declare a ""national emergency"". What's life like in a flooded village? What constitutes a 'national emergency'? Have flood and fire services been cut? Mr Johnson said authorities were working ""flat out"" and a request had been made for ""a little bit more help"" from the military in getting sandbags and other defences to some of the affected areas. Jon Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said Mr Johnson's proposals were ""too little too late"". ""You can't trust Boris Johnson to look out for the North or the Midlands or protect our communities from flooding,"" he said. Other measures announced on Tuesday were: Funding for local councils where households and businesses have been affected - equivalent to Â£500 per eligible household Up to Â£2,500 for small and medium-sized businesses which have suffered severe impacts not covered by insurance Flooding wiped out the stock of Re-Read, a social enterprise that gives free books to children Referring to the response for people affected by the flooding, Mr Johnson added: ""I know there will be people who feel that that isn't good enough. ""I know there will be people who are worrying about the damage to their homes, who will be worried about the insurance situation, worried about the losses they face. ""All I want to say to those people is that there are schemes to cover those losses."" Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Miliband spoke to affected residents in the Bentley suburb of Doncaster Many homeowners in South Yorkshire are keeping sandbags at their homes in case the floods return The five severe flood warnings along the River Don in South Yorkshire have been removed, but20 flood warnings,external- meaning ""flooding is expected"" - remain in place. Last week extensive downpours meant several areas were struck by a month's worth of rain in a single day. Baby Indie was born to Dan Greenslade and Jade Croft on Friday A couple who became new parents on Friday and hours later were told their home in Fishlake was underwater, have described the support they have received from local people as ""invaluable"". ""Thank God for the people of Stainforth, and other people around for the support that they've shown,"" said Dan Greenslade. Meanwhile, a Doncaster salon offered free ""pamper"" sessions for local children affected by flooding, and dozens of swans were rescued from oil from an upturned barge in Rotherham and cars which had been trapped in flood water. Churches and community centres have collected toiletries, clothes, cleaning products and food for the hundreds of people displaced from their homes. Is there such a thing as a 'national emergency'?

Worst of Australia's fire season 'still ahead',"A kookaburra on a burnt tree in a fire-ravaged region of New South Wales Australian authorities have warned that massive bushfires raging in two states will continue to pose a threat, despite ""catastrophic"" conditions easing. About 150 fires are still burning in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland, feeding off tinder-dry conditions. Fifty houses were destroyed or damaged in NSW on Tuesday but no lives were lost, officials said. At one point, fires broke out in suburbs of Sydney. On Wednesday, blazes caused fresh emergencies in Queensland. ""The conditions are of concern to us,"" Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters. 'I'm not going to stop,' says pregnant firefighter Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? Firefighters who saved house leave milk 'apology' The threat in NSW has been downgraded from catastrophic - the highest level - but officials urged residents to remain vigilant. ""We've got the worst of the summer - the worst of the season - still ahead of us as we head into summer,"" said NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. Australia's government has often avoided questions on whether climate change could have contributed to the fires, in a response that has drawn criticism. More than 70 bushfires are burning in the state amid forecasts of high temperatures, volatile winds and dry lightning. Residents in Noosa North Shore, on the popular Sunshine Coast, were among those to be issued emergency warnings on Wednesday. A water-bombing helicopter crashed while fighting a fire at Pechey, west of Brisbane, but the pilot survived with only minor injuries. This video can not be played Matt Taylor looks at the causes behind Australia's bushfires Officials warned that no significant rain was expected, putting continuing strain on firefighters. Mr Fitzsimmons said it was a relief that no-one had died on Tuesday given ""the enormity of these fire grounds"". About 1.1 million hectares have been scorched in NSW since September. The worst fires dot NSW from its northern border to a national park north of Sydney. Though perimeters constantly shift, most are in populated coastal zones or further inland. Since Friday, three people have died and up to 200 homes have been razed. Flame retardant had to be dropped in Sydney's northern suburbs as some bushfires approached within 15km (nine miles) of the city centre. A firefighting plane dropped pink fire retardant in the area between Macquarie University and the Sydney Adventist Hospital in the South Turramurra suburb. One resident who evacuated, Diksha Anand, told the BBC she had feared losing her house.

Mr Fitzsimmons said: ""We've really got a long way to go. You can guarantee we're not going to be able to get around all of these fires before the next wave of bad weather. ""Unfortunately there's no meaningful reprieve. There's no rainfall in this change and we're going to continue to have warm dry conditions dominating in the days and weeks ahead."" Police are investigating reports that several fires may have been started deliberately.  .the highest point on Australia's six-point fire danger scale .results from high temperatures, strong winds and dry ground .fires starting under these conditions will threaten lives .homes cannot be defended from catastrophic fires .the only survival advice is to leave at risk areas early Mr Fitzsimmons said 3,000 firefighters were on the front lines, boosted by crews from other states and New Zealand, as well as the Australian Defence Force. Latest images of fires raging in New South Wales Early Australian bushfires 'an omen for summer' Final WRC round cancelled due to fires Scientists and experts warn that Australia's fire season has grown longer and more intense due to climate change. Officials have confirmed that 2018 and 2017 were Australia's third and fourth-hottest years on record respectively, and last yearthe nation experienced its warmest summer on record. The Bureau of Meteorology'sState of the Climate 2018 report said climate change had led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland raised the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' Even if global temperatures are contained to a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels - a limit set out in the landmark Paris accord, agreed by 188 nations in 2015 -scientists believe the country is facing a dangerous new normal. Last year,a UN report said Australia was falling short in efforts to cut its CO2 emissions. The fires have led to disagreements between politicians over whether climate change is to blame. Former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce suggested that climate activists were partly responsible for the fires by calling for the reduction of so-called back burns, fires purposefully started to clear dry undergrowth. Independent lawmaker Zali Steggall called Mr Joyce's remarks ""unbecoming of our parliament"". ""What we want is a consensus moving forward on how to come up with a plan that adapts Australia to a warming climate,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has declined to comment on climate change while the fires rage. Have you been affected by the bushfires?

Cirque du Soleil founder held for growing cannabis,"Mr LalibertÃ©'s company says he grows cannabis for medical and ""strictly personal"" use The co-founder of global circus company Cirque du Soleil has been detained for growing cannabis on his private island in the South Pacific.

"Royal Mail wins bid to halt Christmas post strikesThe postal union says a decision by the High Court to block industrial action is an ""utter outrage"".BusinessComments","Royal Mail has won its legal battle to prevent a postal strike after the High Court backed its application for an injunction. The decision is a setback for union plans to stage strikes in the run-up to the general election and Christmas. Last month, 100,000 Royal Mail staff were balloted and voted to take action over job security and terms. But Royal Mail argued that the ballot had ""potential irregularities"" and was null and void. The Communications Workers Union (CWU) said its members were ""extremely angry and bitterly disappointed"". It also accused Royal Mail of a ""cowardly and vicious attack on its own workforce"" and said it intended to appeal. Royal Mail workers vote for strike action Royal Mail fails to halt record Â£50m Ofcom fine Shane O'Riordain, director of corporate affairs at Royal Mail, said it had not taken the decision to go to the High Court lightly. ""We sought to reach resolution outside the courts. We asked CWU to confirm it would refrain from taking industrial action, based on clear evidence of planned and orchestrated breaches by CWU officials of their legal obligations."" Members of the CWUvoted by 97% in favour of a nationwide strike, saying the company had failed to adhere to an employment deal agreed last year. Royal Mail denied this and said it had evidence of CWU members coming under pressure to vote ""yes"" in the ballot. This included, the company said, union members ""being encouraged to open their ballot papers on site, mark them as 'yes', with their colleagues present and filming or photographing them doing so, before posting their ballots together at their workplace postboxes"". Royal Mail said this amounted to a ""de facto workplace ballot"", contrary to rules on industrial action, to maximise the turnout and the ""yes"" vote. The CWU thought the ballot result couldn't have been clearer - a 97% vote in favour of strike action on a turnout of 76%. Barring the result of any appeal, the CWU will have to go back to the drawing board and re-ballot its 110,000 members. It's not a quick process and there's a strict code of practice to follow which takes at least a month. Realistically, it seems there's little chance of strike action before the new year, meaning postal workers have lost their moment of maximum leverage. A Christmas strike plus a threat to postal votes during the election would have been very damaging for the Royal Mail. It'll now be breathing a temporary sigh of relief. But the dispute, which covers a wide range of issues, is far from over. Royal Mail's procedures state that employees cannot open their mail at delivery offices without the prior authorisation of their manager. But CWU lawyers argued there was no evidence of interference with the ballot and that ""legitimate partisan campaigning"" by the union in favour of a ""yes"" vote did not violate the rules. In the High Court, Mr Justice Swift said in his judgement: ""This was an interference that was accurately described as improper. Strike ballots should be postal ballots. Each voter should receive a voting paper at home. ""What CWU did was a form of subversion of the ballot process. It was an interference with voting."" If the action had gone ahead, it would have been Royal Mail's first national postal strike in a decade. In the 2017-18 financial year, Royal Mail delivered about 14.4 billion letters and 1.2 billion parcels.

LiveElection campaign latest,"Today marks one month until election day Labour strongly criticises Boris Johnson's response to flooding in northern England PM holds emergency Cobra meeting on the situation and announces funds so local councils can help affected homes and businesses Lib Dems pledge more funds to prevent flooding in the future if they gain power Politicians from all parties pay tribute to former Labour minister Frank Dobson, following his death aged 79 BBC News is broadcasting from Bishop Auckland in County Durham, a Leave-voting, Labour-held marginal seat Labour says it has suffered a ""sophisticated and large-scale cyber attack on its digital systems"" Policy-wise, Labour sets out a Â£3bn strategy for adult retraining in England The Conservatives continue to attack Jeremy Corbyn's spending plans Nigel Farage says Tories should make way for Brexit Party candidates in seats they cannot hope to win Kate Whannel and Francesca Gillett We're now finishing our live election coverage for today. Thanks for following, and we'll be back tomorrow as the campaigning continues. To read our main story from today,click here. What happened today? Here are the main moments from today: Former Justice Secretary David Gauke has confirmed he will be standing
as an independent candidate at the general election. Mr Gauke, who became the MP for South West Hertfordshire in 2005, had the Tory whip removed after hevoted against Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. He announced he would stand as an independent at the
Political Studies Association awards ceremony tonight. Not all of tomorrow's papers lead with an election story. Among those that do is the Express: The Conservative Party has
suspended party members named in new allegations of Islamophobic social media
posts, allegedly made by 25 current and former Conservative councillors. The Guardian says it has seen a so-called ""dossier"" compiled by an anonymous Twitter user who says they campaign against racism. The dossier contains alleged details of Islamophobia and racist social media content
posted, shared or endorsed by 25 sitting and former Conservative councillors. Not all the names provided are understood to be party members. A Conservative Party
spokesperson said: âAll those found to be party members have been suspended immediately, pending investigation. ""The swift
action we take on not just anti-Muslim discrimination, but discrimination of
any kind, is testament to the seriousness with which we take such issues. âThe Conservative Party
will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. ""Thatâs why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make
sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to
stamp them out as and when they occur.â The Lib Dem candidate in Canterbury, Kent, has decided to pull out of the race, saying he does not want to divide the Remain vote. Tim Walker says the Lib Dems had tried to agree a pact with Labour over the seat, but the talks failed so he made the decision to go himself. But it may not achieve much - as the Lib Dems say they will be selecting a new candidate to contest the seat. Read more here. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has spoken during a general election campaign event at Johnstone Town Hall in Renfrewshire. She says Scotland ""stands right now at a crossroads"", and the country ""will have our future imposed on us by the likes of Boris Johnson"" if it does not make its voice heard.

Homes surrounded by water in Fishlake, Doncaster Earlier,the government announcedmeasures to help flood-hit areas in England, following a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. Boris Johnson promised funding for local councils where households and businesses have been affected - equivalent to Â£500 per eligible household - and up to Â£2,500 for small and medium-sized businesses which have suffered severe impacts not covered by insurance. Labour has responded to the flood announcements, saying: ""âToo little, too lateâ isnât even the half of it. ""You canât trust Boris Johnson to look out for the North or the Midlands or protect our communities from flooding,"" said Labour's Jon Trickett. âBut Labour will provide an extra Â£5.6bn in flood defence funding, to level up flood defences over 10 years. âEvery home ruined and every business destroyed demands we act now.â And if you want to read more,here is our Reality Check on whether flood and fire services have been cut. BBC News' digital elections reporter, Joe Tidy, explains more about the cyber attacks which the Labour Party said it has suffered in the past two days. The attacks were DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) which is when ""effectively lots of computers are commandeered to flood a server or a network with too much information, so too many requests, and then that website or server falls over"". ""I always think about buying tickets for Glastonbury,"" he says. ""So many people flood the website at the same time, the website falls over."" He says it's ""very hard to pinpoint exactly who and why they would do this"". But, for ""every pound that is taken away from campaigning to be spent on security is money that could be spent on getting the message out there and getting to voters"", he adds. The estranged wife of former Burton MP Andrew Griffiths has been selected as the Conservative candidate to contest the seat at the general election. Mr Griffiths resigned as a minister last July after a newspaper published sexual messages that he had sent to two barmaids. The parliamentary standards watchdogcleared him of wrongdoing,saying it found no evidence he sent them while he would have been engaged in parliamentary activities. Earlier, Mr Griffiths confirmed he was withdrawing from the selection process after a tied vote last night - and his wife, Kate, would seek selection instead. She'll be defending a majority of more than 10,000. The prime minister leaves the teabag in. That was one revelation that came to light in an election broadcast posted on his Twitter account. The other was that Boris Johnson's favourite band was ""either The Clash or The Rolling Stones"". ""Mainly I listen to the Rolling Stones nowadays, so you can make of that what you will,"" he tells the camera. Richard MossPolitical Editor, BBC Look North If you talk to Labour candidates in seats like Bishop Auckland, they say they are facing two problems. One is Brexit, the other is Jeremy Corbyn. Although the voters on the doorstep like some of Labour's policies, they have personal animosity towards Mr Corbyn. The Tories face challenges too - they thought they were going to make gains in 2017, but they didn't. They underestimated the Labour electoral machine and the history that is here. Their other problem is the Brexit party, which is still standing in seats like this one and could take votes from the Conservatives. The links with Labour are strained here, but are they broken? Conservatives won't take that for granted until the votes are counted. Piers Morgan with his Good Morning Britain co-host Susanna Reid TV presenter Piers Morgan has long been a critic of the so-called ""snowflake"" generation - the derogatory term used to describe younger people by those who view them as more easily-offended or less resilient than older people. But speaking at the annual ITV Palooza event in London tonight, he said he believes the rise of leaders like Boris Johnson and Donald Trump ""is a complete reaction to this PC culture we're now being subjected to"". ""I represent the silent majority who are sick and tired of snowflake central and the PC culture that is now enveloping every part of our lives,"" he said. ""When you spend all your time telling people how to live their lives, the Brits that I know eventually go 'enough'.""  Earlier, it was announced that Steve Bray - the man known for standing in Westminster and shouting ""stop Brexit"" -will stand in the general election. Mr Bray, 50, will contest the Welsh Labour-held constituency of Cynon Valley for the Lib Dems. Mr Bray - who has voted for Labour, the Lib Dems and once for the Tories in previous elections - says his decision to stand for the Lib Dems came after leader Jo Swinson pledged to stop Brexit. Admitting he faces a challenge, he says: ""Its a Labour stronghold. I hope to boost the [Lib Dem] vote in the area. ""As much as I hate to say it, another referendum would just leave divisions. ""If that's what it takes, so be it, but I would rather they put a stop to it at Parliament and they revoke Article 50."" BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis joins the team at Brexitcast HQ to talk about an unexpected cameo in the election campaign from former US secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Listen totoday's episode here.  Politicians have taken time out of the campaign trail today to pay tribute to former Labour minister Frank Dobson whohas died aged 79. Mr Dobson was a popular figure in the party and served as health secretary under Tony Blair. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called him a ""funny, very kind man"" while Ed Miliband described him as a ""profoundly decent person"". Allow Twitter content?

Grace Millane, of Wickford, Essex, died on the night before her 22nd birthday while travelling in New Zealand. The suspect, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies murder. He had been on a date with Ms Millane the day before he left his Auckland hotel with two suitcases. Prosecutors claim Ms Millane was in one of them.

'Startled pig' hinders water pipe repairs,"The valve to cut the water was in a field which Pickle the pig called home A ""startled pig"" confronted engineers as they repaired a burst water main in London, before it was coaxed away with a bag of crisps. The pipe burst in Lamberts Road, Surbiton, damaging nearby railway equipment, which caused train delays. Thames Water said the valve to cut the water was in a field occupied by a pet pig called Pickle and engineers were concerned about disturbing it. It is not known what flavour crisps were used to entice the pig away. The water main burst beside the railway track in Surbiton, south-west London Damage caused by the flooding of tracks and signalling equipment meant limited trains were able to run along the line. Network Rail said engineers had inspected the railway embankment and all tracks have been reopened. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Johnson promising to end Brexit 'groundhoggery',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our ambition is unlock the whole nation's potential"" Delivering Brexit would help the UK close the ""opportunity gap between rich and poor"", Boris Johnson has said. In his first big speech of the election campaign, he promised to boost regional industry and drive a ""clean energy revolution"" after the UK leaves the EU. He said a future Tory government would double investment in high-tech research and development to Â£18bn. But earlier former Tory David Gauke said Mr Johnson's plan will lead to a ""bad outcome for the country"". And Labour said Mr Johnson's Brexit deal was flawed and another referendum was needed.

He said the UK must be at the heart of the world's ""green revolution"", harnessing the power of science, innovation and technology to tackle climate change and create high-skilled, high wage jobs. A Tory victory on 12 December would see the UK leave the EU in January, he said, and that would be good for the country's ""politics, economy and psychological health"" after months of paralysis. ""We must get Brexit done because we are democrats,"" he said, saying while Leave voters wanted the result of the 2016 referendum result to be respected, Remain voters also accepted the ""wrangling had to end"". What does 'Get Brexit done,' mean? Will delaying Brexit cost Â£1bn a month? Donald Tusk: Don't give up on stopping Brexit But he departed from excerpts of the speech briefed to the media on Tuesday, leaving out references to Brexit ""groundhoggery"" and claims that calls for another Brexit referendum and a further vote on Scottish independence were a form of ""onanism"", or masturbation. Asked about this at a press conference after the speech, he blamed it on a ""stray draft"" of the speech released to the media. The Tory leader said the UK's economic fundamentals were sound, but he compared the country to a ""cup-winning horse trying to run on three legs"" with huge untapped potential and often ""vastly different"" educational outcomes. ""If every child had the same start and the same encouragement, think of the all untapped talent in this country,"" he said. ""Yet the solution to that inequality is within our grasp... not just to close the opportunity gap between rich and poor but also between the regions of this country."" He promised to make the ""small improvements in life that people are craving"" by addressing transport bottlenecks, improving rural bus services and broadband connections. He also said British apprentices must be employed on all ""big new public sector"" contracts after Brexit. Mr Johnson said the UK must be at the heart of the world's ""green revolution"" To demonstrate his party's support for enterprise, he said a future Tory government would double funding for research and development to Â£18bn in the next Parliament, which would amount to the ""biggest ever increase in support for R&D"". ""We proudly back businesses across this country because they are creating the wealth that actually pays for the NHS and everything else."" A Labour victory, he claimed, would lead to a ""Technicolor coalition"" with the SNP, prolonging the uncertainty for business over Brexit and the future of the UK. The PM is facing claims from a former cabinet colleague that his electionwould lead to a ""very hard Brexit""after Mr Gauke attacked the policy of the Conservatives to not extend the implementation period for Brexit past December 2020. Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Labour has clear and simple Brexit plan - Corbyn The Tories plan to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Union during that time, but have pledged to leave without one if no deal is reached by the deadline. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage cited the pledge as one of the reasons for his decision not to stand candidates in the 317 seats won by the Tories at the last general election, in 2017. This video can not be played David Gauke says a Conservative majority will move the UK towards ""a very hard Brexit"" Mr Gauke said ""one simply cannot renegotiate a trade deal in that time period"", and leaving without a deal would be ""disastrous for the prosperity of our countryâ¦ [making] whole sectors unviable"". But Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, said his former colleague was ""wrong"". Tories in fresh attack on Labour spending plans Flooding an absolute tragedy, says PM 'Stop Brexit' megaphone man to stand for Lib Dems He defended the progress the prime minister has made on Brexit, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""People throughout the summer said that Boris Johnson would not be able to secure a deal with the EU. ""The withdrawal agreement will never be reopened, they said. The backstop is unviable, you won't get it changed. ""They are people who have been left with oeuf on their faces because he succeeded in securing that deal in defiance of the sceptics and the cynics, and we can secure a free trade agreement by the end of 2020."" MPs backed Mr Johnson's Brexit deal in principle before Parliament was dissolved. But they refused to endorse his timetable to rush it through in days, meaning the PM had to abandon his ""do or die"" pledge to take the UK out by the 31 October deadline.

The Labour Party has vowed to close the gender pay gap by 2030. The difference between men's and women's average pay would take another 60 years to close under a Conservative government, the party said. But the Conservative Party said that Labour was ""over-promising something it could not deliver"". The Tories said the pay gap was at a record low and that there had been ""huge progress since 2010"" in terms of the number of women in work. The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. Read our full story here. Young voters watch paid-for political Facebook adverts...

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor We knew this was going to be a strange election. It's been a strange few years. But while the parties are eagerly trying to stick to their familiar scripts - the Tories on Brexit, the Labour Party on public services, something far less recognisable is going on too in this campaign. It started with Ian Austin last week, the former Labour MP who urged voters to choose Boris Johnson instead. And it's fully breaking out on the other side too. David Gauke, who only resigned from the cabinet a few months ago,  has publicly urged voters to take a good look at the Liberal Democrats, saying that a Boris Johnson majority would be bad for the country. Read the latest blog from Laura here. Former Labour MP Kate Hoey says she will be voting for the DUP in the general election. The Brexit-backing ex-Vauxhall MP told LBC radio: ""I'm actually going to be voting in Northern Ireland and unfortunately the Labour Party is so anti-democratic in Northern Ireland that they allow people to join but they don't put up candidates. ""So I'll be voting for a pro-Union candidate in Northern Ireland."" Ms Hoey confirmed it will be a DUP candidate. Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas says she wishes Labour had joined the so-called Remain alliance of parties. It came after the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party formed an electoral pact by agreeing not to stand against each other in dozens of seat across England and Wales. The three parties all support another Brexit referendum and want the UK to remain in the EU. Ms Lucas told ITV's Peston programme: ""If Labour had been willing to enter into these negotiations then we could have certainly scaled-up the impact of what's going to happen"".

"City watchdog slams own staff's 'shameful' habitsThe Financial Conduct Authority is ""appalled"" at the insanitary conduct of its own workers.","It looks nicer on the outside than on the inside, apparently City of London regulators tasked with mucking out the financial stables have been making a ""shameful"" mess of their own, it has emerged. Financial Conduct Authority staff have been upbraided for leaving their HQ in an ""unacceptable"" state. Chief operating officer Georgina Philippou complained of ""bad behaviour"" including ""colleagues defecating on the floor in toilet cubicles"". Catering and security teams had been verbally abused, she said. Ms Philippou made the complaints in a letter to the 4,000 employees at the FCA's Stratford headquarters that was posted on the authority's intranet. She said she was ""ashamed"" at the behaviour of a ""minority of colleagues"". As first reported by the Evening Standard newspaper,external, she outlined a series of incidents, including: Overflowing waste bins Cutlery and crockery left in kitchen areas People urinating on the floor in the men's toilets Alcohol bottles left in sanitary bins Plants and charge cables stolen from desks. Ms Philippou said: ""You may have heard about some of these behaviours already and I'm sure others will come as a shock. ""This kind of behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated here."" The FCA has been responsible for regulating the conduct of the UK's financial firms and markets since 2013. It moved from Canary Wharf to its current home in July last year. An FCA spokesperson said: ""There has been a small number of incidents of bad behaviour towards our colleagues and building. ""We have a duty as an employer to highlight this sort of poor behaviour and our senior management are very clear it is simply unacceptable. ""We value all of our staff and it is only right that we call out poor behaviour when we see it. Judging from the feedback we have received on the article, our staff agree."" KPMG has also had to warn staff about their behaviour Bosses at audit giant KPMG were also forced to warn staff about their conduct at work in 2018. An email to workers at its Reading office seen by the BBC warned: ""We have had some incidents recently where the first floor accessible toilet sink is being used as a toilet, not for urinating. ""This is not the behaviour we expect from KPMG staff."" A KPMG spokesperson told the BBC: ""This was an isolated incident which occurred in one of our offices well over a year ago and was clearly totally unacceptable. ""Where there is behaviour that falls short of the standards we expect we are quick to call it out, as we have done here."" Do your work colleagues have any unsanitary habits?

Venice mayor blames record flood on climate changeA state of disaster is declared as the Italian city is hit with a high tide of more than 1.87m.Europe,"This video can not be played Parts of Venice have been left under water by record flooding Severe flooding in Venice that has left much of the Italian city under water is a direct result of climate change, the mayor says. The highest water levels in the region in more than 50 years would leave ""a permanent mark"", Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro tweeted. ""Now the government must listen,"" he added. ""These are the effects of climate change... the costs will be high."" The waters in Venice peaked at 1.87m (6ft), according to the tide monitoring centre. Only once since official records began in 1923 has the tide been higher, reaching 1.94m in 1966. The tourist sites hit by Venice's floods Images showed popular sites left completely flooded and people wading through the streets as Venice was hit by a storm. St Mark's Square - one of the lowest parts of the city - was one of the worst hit areas. St Mark's Basilica was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years, according to church records. Pierpaolo Campostrini, a member of St Mark's council, said four of those floods had now occurred within the past 20 years. The mayor said the famous landmark had suffered ""grave damage"". The crypt was completely flooded and there are fears of structural damage to the basilica's columns. The city of Venice is made up of more than 100 islands inside a lagoon off the north-east coast of Italy. Two people died on the island of Pellestrina, a thin strip of land that separates the lagoon from the Adriatic Sea. A man was electrocuted as he tried to start a pump in his home, and a second person was found dead elsewhere. Mr Brugnaro said the damage was ""huge"" and that he would declare a state of disaster, warning that a project to help prevent the Venetian lagoon suffering devastating floods ""must be finished soon"". ""The situation is dramatic. We ask the government to help us,"" he said on Twitter, adding that schools would remain closed until the water level subsides. He also urged local businesses to share photos and video footage of the devastation, which he said would be useful when requesting financial help from the government. People throughout the city waded through the flood waters. A number of businesses were affected. Chairs and tables were seen floating outside cafes and restaurants. In shops, workers tried to move their stock away from the water to prevent any further damage. One shopkeeper, who was not named, told Italy's public broadcaster Rai: ""The city is on its knees."" Three waterbuses sank, but tourists continued their sightseeing as best they could. One French couple told AFP news agency that they had ""effectively swum"" after some of the wooden platforms placed around the city in areas prone to flooding overturned. On Wednesday morning, a number of boats were seen stranded. A project to protect the city from flooding has been under way since 2003 but has been hit by soaring costs, scandals and delays. The so-called Mose project - a series of large barriers or floodgates that would be raised from the seabed to shut off the lagoon in the event of rising sea levels and winter storms - was successfully tested for the first time in 2013. Watch: Venice flood barriers pass first test The project has already cost billions of euros in investment. According to Italy's infrastructure ministry, the flood barriers will be handed over to the Venice city council at the end of 2021 following the ""final phase"" of testing. Italy was hit by heavy rainfall on Tuesday with further bad weather forecast in the coming days. Venice suffers flooding on a yearly basis. By BBC meteorologist Nikki Berry The recent flooding in Venice was caused by a combination of high spring tides and a meteorological storm surge driven by strong sirocco winds blowing north-eastwards across the Adriatic Sea. When these two events coincide, we get what is known as Acqua Alta (high water). This latest Acqua Alta occurrence in Venice is the second highest tide in recorded history. However, if we look at the top 10 tides, five have occurred in the past 20 years and the most recent was only last year. While we should try to avoid attributing a single event to climate change, the increased frequency of these exceptional tides is obviously a big concern. In our changing climate, sea levels are rising and a city such as Venice, which is also sinking, is particularly susceptible to such changes. The weather patterns that have caused the Adriatic storm surge have been driven by a strong meridional (waving) jet stream across the northern hemisphere and this has fed a conveyor belt of low pressure systems into the central Mediterranean. One of the possible effects of a changing climate is that the jet stream will be more frequently meridional and blocked weather patterns such as these will also become more frequent. If this happens, there is a greater likelihood that these events will combine with astronomical spring tides and hence increase the chance of flooding in Venice. Furthermore, the meridional jet stream can be linked back to stronger typhoons in the north-west Pacific resulting in more frequent cold outbreaks in North America and an unsettled Mediterranean is another one of the downstream effects.

Venice mayor blames record flood on climate changeA state of disaster is declared as the Italian city is hit with a high tide of more than 1.87m.,"This video can not be played Parts of Venice have been left under water by record flooding Severe flooding in Venice that has left much of the Italian city under water is a direct result of climate change, the mayor says. The highest water levels in the region in more than 50 years would leave ""a permanent mark"", Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro tweeted. ""Now the government must listen,"" he added. ""These are the effects of climate change... the costs will be high."" The waters in Venice peaked at 1.87m (6ft), according to the tide monitoring centre. Only once since official records began in 1923 has the tide been higher, reaching 1.94m in 1966. The tourist sites hit by Venice's floods Images showed popular sites left completely flooded and people wading through the streets as Venice was hit by a storm. St Mark's Square - one of the lowest parts of the city - was one of the worst hit areas. St Mark's Basilica was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years, according to church records. Pierpaolo Campostrini, a member of St Mark's council, said four of those floods had now occurred within the past 20 years. The mayor said the famous landmark had suffered ""grave damage"". The crypt was completely flooded and there are fears of structural damage to the basilica's columns.

"'Startled pig' hinders water pipe repairsThe animal, which confronted engineers in Surbiton, was finally led away with ""a packet of crisps"".","The valve to cut the water was in a field which Pickle the pig called home A ""startled pig"" confronted engineers as they repaired a burst water main in London, before it was coaxed away with a bag of crisps. The pipe burst in Lamberts Road, Surbiton, damaging nearby railway equipment, which caused train delays. Thames Water said the valve to cut the water was in a field occupied by a pet pig called Pickle and engineers were concerned about disturbing it. It is not known what flavour crisps were used to entice the pig away. The water main burst beside the railway track in Surbiton, south-west London Damage caused by the flooding of tracks and signalling equipment meant limited trains were able to run along the line.

"Toy sales slump as shops chase Christmas cheerParents have cut back on impulse buys and face the threat of shortages of festive favourites, analysts say.BusinessComments","Manufacturers and retailers hope interactive toys prove popular Caution among UK shoppers has led to a tough year so far for toy retailers, as parents search for deals and cut back on impulse buys. UK toy sales were down by 8% in the year so far, compared with the same period last year, leaving retailers dreaming of a bumper Christmas. But economic uncertainty and Brexit planning could lead to shortages of the most popular toys. Others may be sold off cheaper if sales fail to match retailers' expectations. Take a hard look at 'sexist toys' - Dutch education minister Toy Story: How Buzz Lightyear keeps making millions Sir Rod Stewart reveals his epic model railway city About 30% of annual spending on toys comes at Christmas, with Â£86 spent on the typical child up to the age of 11, according to analysts NPD. The industry is banking on festive sales turning around a poor year so far. The 8% drop in UK sales was worse than a 3% drop in international toy sales, said Frederique Tutt, global industry analyst for NPD. Sales last year were also flat, suggesting more than a seasonal downturn. She said this was driven by a lack of consumer confidence and High Street woes in general, rather than issues specific to the toy industry. Parents and grandparents have made fewer impulse buys outside of birthdays and Christmas, partly as they are less likely to be in stores. ""You do not get the same Willy Wonka-type excitement on the internet as children do in a toy shop,"" said Gary Grant, who chairs the committee which selects the2019 DreamToys list,externalof ""must-have"" toys. Blockbuster film releases had been earmarked as a saviour for the industry this year, owing to the sale of spin-off toy merchandise which account for 10% of the market. The two brands which have previously broken records for film-licensed products - Star Wars and Frozen - will see new films released before Christmas. But Mr Grant said the financial reality for many families was that buying a toy after watching a film would be a substitute for another toy purchase, not necessarily an additional purchase. In store sales accounted for 55% of the market, with 26% bought online and delivered, and 16% click and collect Nearly two-thirds (61%) of Christmas toy spending were presents chosen by the giver, rather than put on children's wishlists Toy spending at Christmas stands at Â£86 on average for each child up to the age of 11 Each receives an average of eight toys each Christmas Source: NPD Licensed products in general have accounted for 23% of toy sales so far this year, but Ms Tutt said this sector was no longer dominated by blockbuster film releases. Some of the hotly tipped toys this year have links to YouTube stars and are marketed on social media. The fragmentation of entertainment channels has made it difficult for the big film brands to repeat previous success - although some, such as Harry Potter - have had some joy. ""Children move on to the next thing very quickly, so there is a relatively short window of opportunity to make sales,"" she said. The extra planning required by the potential for the UK leaving the EU on 31 October led many manufacturers and retailers making early decisions on orders for the coming Christmas. That, according to Mr Grant, could mean a shortage of certain toys before Christmas which suddenly become popular. A cautious approach by manufacturers may add to this concern. There are already suggestions of shortages of the L.O.L Surprise! 2-in-1 Glamper However, there was also the chance that retailers could have over-ordered certain toys, leading to the potential for big discounts on those at some point before Christmas. That, he said, would impact the cash taken by retailers, in addition to the extra management time and cost during the year that was caused by Brexit planning. He predicted that a pick-up in the UK economy and consumer confidence would bring shoppers back to the High Street to spend money, but it was difficult to know when such an improvement would come.

"'Berlin rocks,' says Elon Musk as he picks factoryThe Tesla boss tells AutoExpress Brexit uncertainty made the UK ""too risky"" for his first European factory.BusinessComments","This video can not be played Are electric cars as 'green' as you think? Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has said Berlin will be the site of its first major European factory as the carmaker's expansion plans power ahead. ""Berlin rocks,"" Mr Musk said, adding Tesla would build an engineering and design centre in the German capital. Tesla previously said it aimed to start production in Europe in 2021. The moves come as the firm, which has also invested heavily in a Chinese factory, faces intensifying competition in the electric vehicle industry. Mr Musk made the announcement at an awards ceremony in Germany on Tuesday. The company already has an assembly site in the Netherlands, but the plans for Germany are on a far larger scale. ""Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding and that's part of the reason we are locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany,"" he said. Mr Musk also cited risks surrounding the UK's exit from the EU for his decision,according to AutoExpress,external. ""Brexit [uncertainty] made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK,"" he told the trade magazine. Mr Musk said the facility would be located near the new Berlin airport and later gave more details on what the factory would produce on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

The focus on Germany comes amid rising appetite for electric cars in Europe. Over the coming years, the biggest electric car production plants will be in Germany, France, Spain and Italy,industry analysis shows. Some 16 large-scale lithium-ion battery cell plants are confirmed or due to begin operations in Europe by 2023. Elon Musk has long been pondering where to put his European facility known as a ""gigafactory"". Mr Musk's announcement on Tuesday night came ahead of the Prime Minister giving a televised election speech from an electric car factory. It has long been an aim of government policy to attract such a gigafactory to the UK, but international investors are yet to bite. The disruption of a possible no-deal Brexit has weighed down industry investment. But even the current deal proposed by the government would involve checks for customs and the origin of parts, that are difficult for the car industry and electric car industry in particular. While Mr Musk in 2014 expressed a long term desire to open a UK factory, that wasn't expected this soon. However, industry sources had been more hopeful that Mr Musk would choose the UK for his research and development facility in the UK. That too will be situated in Germany. Tesla's European plan comes as the carmaker also moves ahead with a $2bn (Â£1.6bn) factory in Shanghai. The firm is looking to ramp up production in China, the world's biggest car market, where sales have been hurt by tariffs triggered by the US-China trade war. Tesla gets the go-ahead to build cars in China Tesla starts work on huge new China plant Musk expects 'robotaxis' to start in US next year The Shanghai facility will produce Model 3 and Model Y cars. The automaker reportedly showed off its new China-made vehicles to local media this week. Tesla's Shanghai factory under construction Still, Tesla has struggled with years of losses, fuelling investor doubts and casting a shadow over its shares in recent years. The firm has yet to turn an annual profit, although it recorded positive results in the final two quarters of 2018. Last year, Tesla took aggressive steps to slash expenses, cutting thousands of jobs and reining in other spending.

"Breaking|Breaking newsSNP to take legal action over ITV election debateNicola Sturgeon says it is ""fundamentally unfair"" that the debate will only feature Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.Scotland politics","This video can not be played General election 2019: SNP to take legal action over ITV election debate The SNP is to take legal action against  ITV over its exclusion from the broadcaster's general election debate. ITV plans to show a head-to-head debate between Conservative leader Boris Johnson and his Labour counterpart Jeremy Corbyn next week. But SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""fundamentally unfair"" to not include her party, which is the third-largest in the UK. The Lib Dems have alreadylaunched a legal challenge to ITV's plan. Ms Sturgeon said the decision to only invite Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn to take part in the televised debate on 19 November ""fails to recognise that the UK is no longer a two party state"". Latest from the election campaign trail She added: ""The SNP is the third party in terms of Commons representation in the last Parliament, we are the governing party of Scotland and we are one of the biggest political parties in the whole of the UK in terms of membership. ""It is also entirely possible that we will hold the balance of power in the House of Commons after this election - making it all the more important that our perspective is heard and indeed scrutinised. ""To exclude the SNP would be a fundamental breach of broadcasters' obligations to fully and properly represent and reflect the views of the whole UK."" Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson will be the only two politicians to take part in next week's primetime ITV debate Ms Sturgeon said her party would be launching a fundraiser to support the costs of the legal challenge, which she wants to be heard on Monday alongside the one from the Liberal Democrats. But she said that, unlike the Lib Dems, the SNP would be ""arguing not just for the SNP but for other parties to have a place in this debate as well, just as was the case in the ITV leaders' debate of 2015"". When ITV announced its plans, the channel said it would hold a live interview-based programme alongside the leaders' head-to-head to allow other parties to comment. It also said it would host another multi-party debate ahead of the election on 12 December. The BBC will host a live head-to-head debate between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn in Southampton on 6 December, and will also broadcast a seven-way podium debate between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. And BBC Scotland will stage a televised debate between the SNP, Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats on 10 December, although the Scottish Greens have criticised the decision not to include them.

Does UK lag behind other rich nations on health and care?,"The UK has fewer doctors and nurses and poorer access to elderly long-term care than other rich nations, a study shows. The OECD review also warned that many Brits were living unhealthy lives with high rates of drinking and obesity. But it praised the ""strong access"" to health care delivered by the NHS, saying there were low levels of inequality compared to other countries. Spending at 9.8% of GDP - a measure of the size of the economy - was above the 8.8% average for the 36 nations. The review - carried out every two years - looks at the performance and characteristics of the wealthiest nations across all continents. The review looked at the number of doctors and nurses per 1,000 people. The UK has 2.8 doctors and 7.8 nurses per 1,000 people. That compares with OECD averages of 3.5 and 8.8 respectively. The findings chime with warnings from unions and NHS bosses about high vacancy rates in the NHS. Although the OECD review acknowledged that the number of doctors was on the rise. The government is in the process of expanding training places. The health service tends to fare well in terms of efficiency in these sort of international comparisons. And this OECD report is no different. It says the NHS provides very good access to health care for just above average levels of spending. The outcomes, on the whole, are pretty good - or at least in line with the average. Treatment and survival for things like heart attacks and breast cancer are good. Meanwhile, relatively few people live with diabetes. The OECD review reserved its strongest commentary for what it calls long-term care. In the UK this is largely delivered by the social care system run by councils. It is means-tested and heavily rationed so only the poorest and neediest get help from the state. It said British people generally had high levels of poor health after 65 - only 50% of women and 60% of men are free from disability after this point. The OECD review said good-quality long-term care was particularly important for improving the quality of life for older populations. But while access to health care was good, it was a different picture for long-term care, which includes help with daily tasks such as washing and dressing. Spending on such care was below average, while informal carers shared a heavy burden, with nearly one in five people aged over 50 acting as informal carers, the fourth highest among the 18 countries for which there was comparable data. In England, there have been years of talks and arguments over how to reform the social care system. Following the 2017 election the government promised to bring forward plans. But they were delayed on numerous occasions before the latest election was called. Smoking rates are pretty low, but when it comes to the way we live our lives, that is about all the good news. Adults consume higher rates of alcohol compared with other nations and nearly two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese. Both were higher than the OECD average. Drug abuse, particularly heroin, was a ""concern"", the OECD said, with its researchers noting there had been an increase in opioid-related deaths.

Royal Mail fails to halt record Â£50m Ofcom fine,"Royal Mail has failed to have a record Â£50m fine from Ofcom overturned. The fine, announced in August 2018, related to its actions in 2014 when Whistl, then known as TNT, was trying to become its first competitor in wholesale mail delivery. Ofcom's investigation followed a complaint by Whistl that Royal Mail had abused its dominant market position. Royal Mail challenged the fine, but on Tuesday, the Competition Appeal Tribunal dismissed its application. An Ofcom spokesperson said: ""We found that Royal Mail pursued a deliberate strategy of pricing discrimination against Whistl, which was its only major competitor for delivering business mail. ""Royal Mail had a special responsibility to ensure its behaviour was not anti-competitive. Royal Mail fined record Â£50m by Ofcom Royal Mail tries to stop Christmas postal strike ""We hope that our fine, which has been upheld in full by the Tribunal, will ensure that Royal Mail and other powerful companies take their legal duties very seriously."" Ofcom's investigation had found that Royal Mail price rises in 2014 meant any wholesale customers, such as Whistl, which wanted to compete with it would have to pay higher prices in the remaining areas where it used Royal Mail for delivery. Whistl said it was pleased that the Ofcom ruling had been upheld. ""Royal Mail's actions had a hugely negative impact on investment in, and the competitive health of, the UK postal sector,""  Whistl said. Whistl said it was now looking at its options to decide whether to seek damages. Royal Mail said it was disappointed by the tribunal's decision. ""We are considering all legal options, including whether to seek permission to appeal and to request that payment of the penalty, which would otherwise become payable, be stayed pending any appeal. ""We will provide an update once we have completed our legal review,"" it said. It had argued that it raised prices to protect the Universal Service, which means post is charged at the same rate, regardless of where it is sent across the UK. Unlike its competitors, it is required to continue providing such pricing. The CAT decision was announced as Royal Mail was asking the High Court to stop a postal strike, claiming that the ballot of workers had ""potential irregularities"". A strike threatens to disrupt postal voting in the run-up to the general election, as well as Christmas post. Royal Mail says the the strike ballot ""was unlawful and, therefore, null and void"", but the Communications Workers Union ""refutes"" Royal Mail's claim.

The Labour Party has vowed to close the gender pay gap by 2030. The difference between men's and women's average pay would take another 60 years to close under a Conservative government, the party said. But the Conservative Party said that Labour was ""over-promising something it could not deliver"". The Tories said the pay gap was at a record low and that there had been ""huge progress since 2010"" in terms of the number of women in work. The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. Read our full story here. Young voters watch paid-for political Facebook adverts...

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor We knew this was going to be a strange election. It's been a strange few years. But while the parties are eagerly trying to stick to their familiar scripts - the Tories on Brexit, the Labour Party on public services, something far less recognisable is going on too in this campaign. It started with Ian Austin last week, the former Labour MP who urged voters to choose Boris Johnson instead. And it's fully breaking out on the other side too. David Gauke, who only resigned from the cabinet a few months ago,  has publicly urged voters to take a good look at the Liberal Democrats, saying that a Boris Johnson majority would be bad for the country. Read the latest blog from Laura here. Former Labour MP Kate Hoey says she will be voting for the DUP in the general election. The Brexit-backing ex-Vauxhall MP told LBC radio: ""I'm actually going to be voting in Northern Ireland and unfortunately the Labour Party is so anti-democratic in Northern Ireland that they allow people to join but they don't put up candidates. ""So I'll be voting for a pro-Union candidate in Northern Ireland."" Ms Hoey confirmed it will be a DUP candidate. Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas says she wishes Labour had joined the so-called Remain alliance of parties. It came after the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party formed an electoral pact by agreeing not to stand against each other in dozens of seat across England and Wales. The three parties all support another Brexit referendum and want the UK to remain in the EU. Ms Lucas told ITV's Peston programme: ""If Labour had been willing to enter into these negotiations then we could have certainly scaled-up the impact of what's going to happen"".

City watchdog slams own staff's 'shameful' habits,"It looks nicer on the outside than on the inside, apparently City of London regulators tasked with mucking out the financial stables have been making a ""shameful"" mess of their own, it has emerged. Financial Conduct Authority staff have been upbraided for leaving their HQ in an ""unacceptable"" state. Chief operating officer Georgina Philippou complained of ""bad behaviour"" including ""colleagues defecating on the floor in toilet cubicles"". Catering and security teams had been verbally abused, she said. Ms Philippou made the complaints in a letter to the 4,000 employees at the FCA's Stratford headquarters that was posted on the authority's intranet. She said she was ""ashamed"" at the behaviour of a ""minority of colleagues"". As first reported by the Evening Standard newspaper,external, she outlined a series of incidents, including: Overflowing waste bins Cutlery and crockery left in kitchen areas People urinating on the floor in the men's toilets Alcohol bottles left in sanitary bins Plants and charge cables stolen from desks. Ms Philippou said: ""You may have heard about some of these behaviours already and I'm sure others will come as a shock. ""This kind of behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated here."" The FCA has been responsible for regulating the conduct of the UK's financial firms and markets since 2013. It moved from Canary Wharf to its current home in July last year. An FCA spokesperson said: ""There has been a small number of incidents of bad behaviour towards our colleagues and building. ""We have a duty as an employer to highlight this sort of poor behaviour and our senior management are very clear it is simply unacceptable. ""We value all of our staff and it is only right that we call out poor behaviour when we see it. Judging from the feedback we have received on the article, our staff agree."" KPMG has also had to warn staff about their behaviour Bosses at audit giant KPMG were also forced to warn staff about their conduct at work in 2018. An email to workers at its Reading office seen by the BBC warned: ""We have had some incidents recently where the first floor accessible toilet sink is being used as a toilet, not for urinating. ""This is not the behaviour we expect from KPMG staff."" A KPMG spokesperson told the BBC: ""This was an isolated incident which occurred in one of our offices well over a year ago and was clearly totally unacceptable. ""Where there is behaviour that falls short of the standards we expect we are quick to call it out, as we have done here."" Do your work colleagues have any unsanitary habits?

"Rylan raises Â£928,000 with 24-hour karaoke feat","This video can not be played Rylan's karaoke challenge: The best bits Rylan Clark-Neal has now raised more than Â£1 million for Children In Need by singing non-stop karaoke for 24 hours. The presenter belted out 231 songs, assisted by more than 90 celebrity guests, including Rick Astley, Nicole Scherzinger and Craig David. He ate spoonfuls of honey every hour to keep his vocal cords coated - along with the occasional Pudsey donut. ""I am in such a state,"" Clark-Neal told Radio 2's Zoe Ball as he approached the end of the challenge on Wednesday. ""It doesn't feel real. None of it feels real."" 10 reasons Ka-RY-oke was so memorable The crooning marathon was broadcast live on BBC Radio 2 and the BBC red button. In the last half hour of his challenge the star raised more than Â£200,000 - with the tally reaching Â£845,239 by the time he finished at 09:15 GMT. ""That's unbelievable, thank you so much,"" said the star. Donations continued to flood in after Rylan took a well-deserved rest, taking the tally past the Â£1 million mark by Thursday morning. ""That sore throat today is totally worth it, @Rylan!"" tweeted Radio 2. ""We are so incredibly proud to announce that we've hit ONE MILLION POUNDS (Â£1,027,776 to be precise!)"" The final grand total will be revealed during Friday night's Children In Need broadcast on BBC One. Rylan's challenge saw him duet with Dermot O'Leary on You Don't Bring Me Flowers, rap with Trevor Nelson and DJ Spoony on a version of Rapper's Delight, and dance with Strictly contestants Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard. Rylan said he was inspired to keep singing by the memories of a recent visit to a Children In Need-funded youth club.

""It was amazing and, do you know what, I didn't actually think about this when I signed up to do this,"" said the Strictly: It Takes Two presenter. ""I didn't really think that I would need that, but actually visiting the project and meeting all the kids and volunteers and speaking to them and understanding how much this money impacts their lives, when I am sort of dying at four o'clock in the morning trying to garble together a song I know what I'm doing it for now.""

On Facebook, she announced: ""So happy to say that I'll hopefully make it to COP25 in Madrid."" She refuses to travel by air because of its environmental impact.

Breaking|Breaking newsChristmas postal strikes blockedRoyal Mail wins court action to block planned postal strikes in run-up to ChristmasBusiness,"Royal Mail has won its legal battle to prevent a postal strike after the High Court backed its application for an injunction. The decision is a setback for union plans to stage strikes in the run-up to the general election and Christmas. Last month, 100,000 Royal Mail staff were balloted and voted to take action over job security and terms. But Royal Mail argued that the ballot had ""potential irregularities"" and was null and void. The Communications Workers Union (CWU) said its members were ""extremely angry and bitterly disappointed"". It also accused Royal Mail of a ""cowardly and vicious attack on its own workforce"" and said it intended to appeal. Royal Mail workers vote for strike action Royal Mail fails to halt record Â£50m Ofcom fine Shane O'Riordain, director of corporate affairs at Royal Mail, said it had not taken the decision to go to the High Court lightly. ""We sought to reach resolution outside the courts. We asked CWU to confirm it would refrain from taking industrial action, based on clear evidence of planned and orchestrated breaches by CWU officials of their legal obligations."" Members of the CWUvoted by 97% in favour of a nationwide strike, saying the company had failed to adhere to an employment deal agreed last year. Royal Mail denied this and said it had evidence of CWU members coming under pressure to vote ""yes"" in the ballot. This included, the company said, union members ""being encouraged to open their ballot papers on site, mark them as 'yes', with their colleagues present and filming or photographing them doing so, before posting their ballots together at their workplace postboxes"". Royal Mail said this amounted to a ""de facto workplace ballot"", contrary to rules on industrial action, to maximise the turnout and the ""yes"" vote. The CWU thought the ballot result couldn't have been clearer - a 97% vote in favour of strike action on a turnout of 76%. Barring the result of any appeal, the CWU will have to go back to the drawing board and re-ballot its 110,000 members. It's not a quick process and there's a strict code of practice to follow which takes at least a month. Realistically, it seems there's little chance of strike action before the new year, meaning postal workers have lost their moment of maximum leverage. A Christmas strike plus a threat to postal votes during the election would have been very damaging for the Royal Mail. It'll now be breathing a temporary sigh of relief. But the dispute, which covers a wide range of issues, is far from over. Royal Mail's procedures state that employees cannot open their mail at delivery offices without the prior authorisation of their manager. But CWU lawyers argued there was no evidence of interference with the ballot and that ""legitimate partisan campaigning"" by the union in favour of a ""yes"" vote did not violate the rules. In the High Court, Mr Justice Swift said in his judgement: ""This was an interference that was accurately described as improper. Strike ballots should be postal ballots. Each voter should receive a voting paper at home. ""What CWU did was a form of subversion of the ballot process. It was an interference with voting."" If the action had gone ahead, it would have been Royal Mail's first national postal strike in a decade. In the 2017-18 financial year, Royal Mail delivered about 14.4 billion letters and 1.2 billion parcels.

'Berlin rocks' says Elon Musk as he picks factory,"This video can not be played Are electric cars as 'green' as you think? Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has said Berlin will be the site of its first major European factory as the carmaker's expansion plans power ahead. ""Berlin rocks,"" Mr Musk said, adding Tesla would build an engineering and design centre in the German capital. Tesla previously said it aimed to start production in Europe in 2021. The moves come as the firm, which has also invested heavily in a Chinese factory, faces intensifying competition in the electric vehicle industry. Mr Musk made the announcement at an awards ceremony in Germany on Tuesday. The company already has an assembly site in the Netherlands, but the plans for Germany are on a far larger scale. ""Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding and that's part of the reason we are locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany,"" he said. Mr Musk also cited risks surrounding the UK's exit from the EU for his decision,according to AutoExpress,external. ""Brexit [uncertainty] made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK,"" he told the trade magazine. Mr Musk said the facility would be located near the new Berlin airport and later gave more details on what the factory would produce on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

The focus on Germany comes amid rising appetite for electric cars in Europe. Over the coming years, the biggest electric car production plants will be in Germany, France, Spain and Italy,industry analysis shows. Some 16 large-scale lithium-ion battery cell plants are confirmed or due to begin operations in Europe by 2023. Elon Musk has long been pondering where to put his European facility known as a ""gigafactory"". Mr Musk's announcement on Tuesday night came ahead of the Prime Minister giving a televised election speech from an electric car factory. It has long been an aim of government policy to attract such a gigafactory to the UK, but international investors are yet to bite. The disruption of a possible no-deal Brexit has weighed down industry investment.

Gauke: Tory majority 'bad outcome for country',"This video can not be played Former minister David Gauke: ""A Conservative majority... will take us in the direction of a very hard Brexit"" Former justice secretary David Gauke says a Conservative majority at the upcoming election would be a ""bad outcome for the country"". Mr Gauke - who confirmed he will run as an independent in 12 December poll - was among the MPs expelled from the Tories by Boris Johnson after he voted against a no-deal Brexit. He said a majority led by Mr Johnson would mean a ""very hard Brexit"". But Tory Minister Michael Gove said his former colleague was ""precisely wrong"". Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast the Conservatives were pursuing ""a good Brexit deal which works for whole UK [and] which will enable us to have a relationship with the EU based on free trade and friendly co-operation."" Responding to Mr Gauke's comments, Mr Johnson said: ""We are fighting for every vote we can get. I regret we haven't got his support, but we will do our best in the campaign ahead."" Mr Gauke confirmed his decision to stand in South West Hertfordshire - where he has been the MP since 2005 - at a political awards ceremony on Tuesday. But he has urged voters in some constituencies to vote for the Liberal Democrats LIVE: Election campaign latest Tories choose candidate to take place of Gauke Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Gauke attacked the policy of the Conservatives to not extend the implementation period for Brexit past December 2020. During these months, the UK would stick to the EU rules on issues such as freedom of movement. The Tories plan to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Union during that time, but have pledged to leave without one if no deal is reached by the deadline. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage cited the pledge as one of the reasons for hisdecision not to stand candidates in the 317 seats won by the Toriesat the last general election, in 2017. This video can not be played Tory Minister Michael Gove says the UK ""can secure a free trade deal by the end of 2020"" Mr Gauke said ""one simply cannot renegotiate a trade deal in that time period"", and leaving without a deal would be ""disastrous for the prosperity of our countryâ¦ [making] whole sectors unviable"". But he said Mr Johnson was so ""boxed in"" to the plan that he couldn't change his mind even if he wanted to - and he showed no sign of that. ""He would have letters flooding in to the chairman of the 1922 committee [trying to oust him] and Nigel Farage would be out making a lot of noise,"" said Mr Gauke. ""I don't think that either the parliamentary party or the wider Conservative membership would allow him to do that. He is boxed in unless Parliament is in a position to force him to extend.""

Mr Gauke said his comments were not a personal attack on Mr Johnson, although he said the PM ""lacks qualities some would ideally want in prime minister"". But he urged voters to support ""the centre ground"" in the election so they could stop a hard Brexit, even lending their support to the Liberal Democrats if needs be. ""I have to say I am impressed by [Lib Dem leader] Jo Swinson and if I was living in a lot of constituencies I would lend my vote,"" he told Today. Mr Gauke now backs a confirmatory referendum on Mr Johnson's deal versus Remain. ""I have reluctantly come to that view,"" he said. ""I thought the best outcome for our country was for us to unite behind some kind of soft Brexit [but] that option isn't there any more. The country is too polarised and there isn't the support for it. ""[Mr Johnson's plan] is a harder Brexit than what was promised to the British people in 2016. ""Because the consequences of the Johnson deal are so significant, we do need to check back in with the people, and it is perfectly possible to get a parliamentary majority for that after the election."" Just four months ago David Gauke was a cabinet minister and regarded as one of the safest pair of hands in the Tory Party. He is now urging voters to stop Boris Johnson from winning a majority. His decision to stand as an independent candidate is prompted by his fear that Mr Johnson is ""boxed in"" to a no-deal Brexit by his refusal to consider any extension of the transition period beyond December 2020. An impossible timetable, Mr Gauke believes, in which to secure a trade deal - and a view shared by many hard line Brexiteers. Mr Gauke is one of only a small band of former Tory rebels who've chosen to fight on, rather than to quit politics altogether. But Lib Dem sources said they were unlikely to stand aside in his Hertfordshire seat. Meanwhile, Downing Street has shrugged off his decision and later Mr Johnson will repeat his Brexit message - that his deal is the only way to get Britain out of the rut and end the ""groundhoggery"". Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr Gove, said his former colleague was ""a good friend, but I think on this issue he's got it precisely wrong"". He told Breakfast: ""The only way that we can Brexit done is by making sure we do have a functioning majority government. ""We're going to get a good deal with the EU and we're going to get it by the end of 2020."" Mr Gove added: ""One of the problems that we've had is that Parliament has engaged in endless dither and delay on this, and that's because we haven't had a strong majority."" Earlier, Gagan Mohindra was chosen as the Conservative candidate for Mr Gauke's constituency. Mr Mohindra is a member of Essex County Council and Epping Forest District Council. Some parties are yet to choose their candidates for South West Hertfordshire, but Tom Pashby has been selected for the Green Party and Sally Symington will represent the Liberal Democrats. Mr Gauke is not the first politician to call on the public to back a rival party in the December election. On Monday, his fellow former Tory MP Nick Boleslaunched a scathing attack on both Mr Johnson and Mr Corbynin the Evening Standard, and said people should vote Lib Dem. This came after two former Labour MPs - Ian Austin and John Woodcock - saidthe electorate should back Mr Johnsonas Mr Corbyn was ""completely unfit"" to be PM.

"'Berlin rocks,' says Elon Musk as he picks factory","This video can not be played Are electric cars as 'green' as you think? Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has said Berlin will be the site of its first major European factory as the carmaker's expansion plans power ahead. ""Berlin rocks,"" Mr Musk said, adding Tesla would build an engineering and design centre in the German capital. Tesla previously said it aimed to start production in Europe in 2021. The moves come as the firm, which has also invested heavily in a Chinese factory, faces intensifying competition in the electric vehicle industry. Mr Musk made the announcement at an awards ceremony in Germany on Tuesday. The company already has an assembly site in the Netherlands, but the plans for Germany are on a far larger scale. ""Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding and that's part of the reason we are locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany,"" he said. Mr Musk also cited risks surrounding the UK's exit from the EU for his decision,according to AutoExpress,external. ""Brexit [uncertainty] made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK,"" he told the trade magazine. Mr Musk said the facility would be located near the new Berlin airport and later gave more details on what the factory would produce on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

The focus on Germany comes amid rising appetite for electric cars in Europe. Over the coming years, the biggest electric car production plants will be in Germany, France, Spain and Italy,industry analysis shows. Some 16 large-scale lithium-ion battery cell plants are confirmed or due to begin operations in Europe by 2023. Elon Musk has long been pondering where to put his European facility known as a ""gigafactory"". Mr Musk's announcement on Tuesday night came ahead of the Prime Minister giving a televised election speech from an electric car factory. It has long been an aim of government policy to attract such a gigafactory to the UK, but international investors are yet to bite. The disruption of a possible no-deal Brexit has weighed down industry investment. But even the current deal proposed by the government would involve checks for customs and the origin of parts, that are difficult for the car industry and electric car industry in particular.

Former Labour MP backs Tories ahead of election,"Mr Harris served as a junior minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown A former Labour minister has urged voters to back the Conservatives in the general election to keep ""extremist"" Jeremy Corbyn out of power. Tom Harris claimed that Mr Corbyn had ""instinctively sided with our country's enemies"" over the years. And he said the prospect of the Labour leader becoming prime minister ""chilled him to the bone"". Mr Harris was the Labour MP for Glasgow South between 2001 and 2015, and is a long-standing critic of Mr Corbyn. The former junior transport minister, who led the Vote Leave campaign in Scotland ahead of the EU referendum, made his plea to voters inan article in the Scottish Daily Mail,external. The piece was published in Wednesday's edition as Mr Corbyn prepared to make a two-day visit to Scotland ahead of the election on 12 December. The latest from the election campaign Corbyn pledges 'massive' Scottish investment Will there be electoral pacts in Scotland? Ahead of the trip, the Labour leader said the election would be ""a once-in-generation chance to transform Scotland and the whole UK"". Mr Corbyn also pledged to deliver ""massive investment"" in Scotland if he becomes prime minister, adding: ""When Labour wins, Scotland wins."" But Mr Harris, who left Labour last year, told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programmethat Mr Corbyn represented a strain of left-wing politics that was ""complete anathema"" to the traditional Labour party. Mr Corbyn visited flood victims in Doncaster on Tuesday He added: ""He is not somebody who can be trusted with the security of the nation. He is a man who has instinctively sided with our country's enemies over the years that he has been an MP. ""The idea of him becoming prime minister just chills me to the bone and the only way of stopping Corbyn becoming PM is to vote to vote for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. It is a very simple, logical conclusion."" He claimed that the security services in countries such as the US and Australia viewed Mr Corbyn with ""great concern"" because they ""just don't feel that this is a man who can be trusted with the fundamental responsibility of protecting the country"". And he accused Mr Corbyn of being ready to ""betray"" the Scottish people and the Scottish Labour Party by allowing a second referendum on independence. Last week, Mr Harris backed former Labour MP Ian Austin's public desertion of the party, telling the Daily Mail: ""Like Ian, I will be far happier with a Boris Johnson government."" Elsewhere on the election campaign trail, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK faces ""a historic choice"" on 12 December as ""the country can either move forwards with policies that will deliver years of growth and prosperity, or it can disappear into an intellectual cul-de-sac of far-left Corbynism."" The SNP insisted it was the only party that could beat the Conservatives in Scotland and ""lock Boris Johnson out of Downing Street"". The Scottish Liberal Democrats will focus their day's campaigning on a pledge to invest in nurseries and provide free care for children from nine months old.

Corbyn pledges 'massive' Scottish investment,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: 'Tory austerity impoverished millions' Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has rowed back on comments that he would not back a Scottish independence referendum in the ""first term"" of a new government. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP will not help Mr Corbyn into power unless he accepts the ""principle"" of a second referendum. Mr Corbyn initially told reporters that this would not happen in the first five-year term of a Labour government. He later clarified that it would not be a priority in the ""early years"". â¬Mr Corbyn was speaking in Glasgow at the beginning of a two-day campaign visit to Scotland, which will conclude with a rally in Edinburgh on Thursday. Labour has previously said it would not back an independence referendum in 2020, but could change its position if the SNP wins the next Scottish Parliament election in 2021. The latest from the general election trail Sturgeon lists SNP's conditions for backing Labour Mr Corbyn told journalists in Glasgow that there would be ""no referendum in the first term of a Labour government, because I think we need to concentrate completely on investment in Scotland"". This appeared to go further than the party's previous comments on the prospect of indyref2 if it wins power. But a few hours later, Mr Corbyn reverted back to Labour's previous position by saying that he would ""not countenance an independence referendum in the early years of a Labour government because our priorities will be elsewhere."" Jeremy Corbyn was greeted in Glasgow by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard Pressed further on whether he would grant a vote if the SNP won the Holyrood election, Mr Corbyn replied: ""I'm not in favour of it at all because I think the priorities for Scotland are ending inequality, poverty and injustice across Scotland and independence will bring with it an economic problem for Scotland."" He also told BBC Scotland editor Brian Taylor that: ""In the early years of a Labour government I want to concentrate totally on investment all across the UK, including the Â£70bn I want to invest in Scotland."" A Labour source said the party would absolutely rule out a poll in 2020, and repeated Mr Corbyn's claim that the party would win the 2021 Scottish election. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has claimed that an ""alliance"" between Labour and the SNP if there is a hung parliament would ""ruin 2020"" with two referendums - one on independence and another on the EU. Nicola Sturgeon has said Mr Corbyn must accept the ""principle"" of a new independence poll to win SNP backing Ms Sturgeon has insisted that Mr Corbyn should not ""pick up the phone"" to ask for the support of SNP MPs unless he is ready to accept the ""principle"" of a second independence referendum, as well as ending austerity and offering further powers to Holyrood. Responding to Mr Corbyn's comments, she said: ""âªI won't help him in power, to get into power, to stay in power if he doesn't accept the principle that whether there is a referendum in Scotland and what the timescale of that referendum should be should be determined by the people of Scotland."" She called it a ""basic issue of democracy"" but claimed it was ""highly unlikely"" Labour would give up a chance at being in government by rejecting an independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon added: ""The reason that I think Jeremy Corbyn keeps getting into a mess on this question is that he knows that it is not democratically acceptable or democratically sustainable to block the right of the Scottish people to choose their future."" When Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader, the party hoped he'd make the SNP look like moderate centrists and he would win back left wing voters to the red corner. But that project has had only limited success. Most of their voters have been lost to the SNP. And many of those who still vote Labour in Westminster elections are sympathetic to the idea of Scottish independence - or at least to having another referendum to allow Scotland to decide. So you'd think the Labour Party's flirtation with the idea of allowing a second vote on independence would be welcome. But instead it appears to have thrown confusion into the debate. While the SNP are ferociously in favour of independence, and the Tories (and Lib Dems) implacably opposed, Labour seem lost in the middle. Squeezed out of the biggest debate in Scotland. Read more from Sarah here As he arrived for the Glasgow campaign,Mr Corbyn was heckled by a Church of Scotland minister who branded him a ""terrorist sympathiser"". As Mr Corbyn was telling reporters about a scarf given to him by a charity group, Richard Cameron - the minister at the local Scotstoun Parish Church - shouted that he thought the Labour leader would be wearing an ""Islamic jihad scarf"". He added: ""Who's going to be the first terrorist invited to the House of Commons when you're prime minister?"" A spokeswoman for the Church of Scotland rebuked Mr Cameron, saying: ""Whilst we may occasionally robustly challenge policy issues with which we disagree, we always intend to do that in a way that is polite and measured and allows for reasoned debate."" Mr Johnson will say he wants to avoid ""more political self-obsession"" The Conservatives and the Lib Dems have both positioned themselves in opposition to a second independence referendum. Speaking at an electric vehicle manufacturer in the West Midlands, Boris Johnson said everyone in the UK faces ""a historic choice"" on 12 December. He said: ""At this election, the country can either move forwards with policies that will deliver years of growth and prosperity, or it can disappear into an intellectual cul-de-sac of far-left Corbynism. ""We can honour the wishes of the people, or else we can waste more time, at the cost of a billion pounds per month, and have two more referendums, one on Scotland and one on the EU - an expense of spirit and a waste of shame, more political self-obsession."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said his party ""will never support another independence referendum"". Speaking at a nursery in Dunfermline while promoting his party's childcare policy, he said: ""It's really important we move on, we learn the lessons from Brexit rather than trying to repeat them with independence. ""Let's try to tackle things like childcare expansion, let's tackle the climate emergency, deal with mental health service problems that we've got in this country. We've had enough of the division and damage over the constitution.""

"Former Labour MP backs Tories ahead of electionTom Harris, a former junior minister under Tony Blair, urges voters to back the Conservatives to keep Jeremy Corbyn out of power.Scotland politics","Mr Harris served as a junior minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown A former Labour minister has urged voters to back the Conservatives in the general election to keep ""extremist"" Jeremy Corbyn out of power. Tom Harris claimed that Mr Corbyn had ""instinctively sided with our country's enemies"" over the years. And he said the prospect of the Labour leader becoming prime minister ""chilled him to the bone"". Mr Harris was the Labour MP for Glasgow South between 2001 and 2015, and is a long-standing critic of Mr Corbyn. The former junior transport minister, who led the Vote Leave campaign in Scotland ahead of the EU referendum, made his plea to voters inan article in the Scottish Daily Mail,external. The piece was published in Wednesday's edition as Mr Corbyn prepared to make a two-day visit to Scotland ahead of the election on 12 December. The latest from the election campaign Corbyn pledges 'massive' Scottish investment Will there be electoral pacts in Scotland? Ahead of the trip, the Labour leader said the election would be ""a once-in-generation chance to transform Scotland and the whole UK"". Mr Corbyn also pledged to deliver ""massive investment"" in Scotland if he becomes prime minister, adding: ""When Labour wins, Scotland wins."" But Mr Harris, who left Labour last year, told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programmethat Mr Corbyn represented a strain of left-wing politics that was ""complete anathema"" to the traditional Labour party. Mr Corbyn visited flood victims in Doncaster on Tuesday He added: ""He is not somebody who can be trusted with the security of the nation. He is a man who has instinctively sided with our country's enemies over the years that he has been an MP. ""The idea of him becoming prime minister just chills me to the bone and the only way of stopping Corbyn becoming PM is to vote to vote for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. It is a very simple, logical conclusion."" He claimed that the security services in countries such as the US and Australia viewed Mr Corbyn with ""great concern"" because they ""just don't feel that this is a man who can be trusted with the fundamental responsibility of protecting the country"". And he accused Mr Corbyn of being ready to ""betray"" the Scottish people and the Scottish Labour Party by allowing a second referendum on independence. Last week, Mr Harris backed former Labour MP Ian Austin's public desertion of the party, telling the Daily Mail: ""Like Ian, I will be far happier with a Boris Johnson government."" Elsewhere on the election campaign trail, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK faces ""a historic choice"" on 12 December as ""the country can either move forwards with policies that will deliver years of growth and prosperity, or it can disappear into an intellectual cul-de-sac of far-left Corbynism."" The SNP insisted it was the only party that could beat the Conservatives in Scotland and ""lock Boris Johnson out of Downing Street"". The Scottish Liberal Democrats will focus their day's campaigning on a pledge to invest in nurseries and provide free care for children from nine months old.

Venice mayor blames record floods on climate change,"This video can not be played Parts of Venice have been left under water by record flooding Severe flooding in Venice that has left much of the Italian city under water is a direct result of climate change, the mayor says. The highest water levels in the region in more than 50 years would leave ""a permanent mark"", Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro tweeted. ""Now the government must listen,"" he added. ""These are the effects of climate change... the costs will be high."" The waters in Venice peaked at 1.87m (6ft), according to the tide monitoring centre. Only once since official records began in 1923 has the tide been higher, reaching 1.94m in 1966. The tourist sites hit by Venice's floods Images showed popular sites left completely flooded and people wading through the streets as Venice was hit by a storm. St Mark's Square - one of the lowest parts of the city - was one of the worst hit areas. St Mark's Basilica was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years, according to church records. Pierpaolo Campostrini, a member of St Mark's council, said four of those floods had now occurred within the past 20 years. The mayor said the famous landmark had suffered ""grave damage"". The crypt was completely flooded and there are fears of structural damage to the basilica's columns. The city of Venice is made up of more than 100 islands inside a lagoon off the north-east coast of Italy. Two people died on the island of Pellestrina, a thin strip of land that separates the lagoon from the Adriatic Sea. A man was electrocuted as he tried to start a pump in his home, and a second person was found dead elsewhere. Mr Brugnaro said the damage was ""huge"" and that he would declare a state of disaster, warning that a project to help prevent the Venetian lagoon suffering devastating floods ""must be finished soon"". ""The situation is dramatic. We ask the government to help us,"" he said on Twitter, adding that schools would remain closed until the water level subsides. He also urged local businesses to share photos and video footage of the devastation, which he said would be useful when requesting financial help from the government. People throughout the city waded through the flood waters. A number of businesses were affected. Chairs and tables were seen floating outside cafes and restaurants. In shops, workers tried to move their stock away from the water to prevent any further damage. One shopkeeper, who was not named, told Italy's public broadcaster Rai: ""The city is on its knees."" Three waterbuses sank, but tourists continued their sightseeing as best they could. One French couple told AFP news agency that they had ""effectively swum"" after some of the wooden platforms placed around the city in areas prone to flooding overturned. On Wednesday morning, a number of boats were seen stranded. A project to protect the city from flooding has been under way since 2003 but has been hit by soaring costs, scandals and delays. The so-called Mose project - a series of large barriers or floodgates that would be raised from the seabed to shut off the lagoon in the event of rising sea levels and winter storms - was successfully tested for the first time in 2013. Watch: Venice flood barriers pass first test The project has already cost billions of euros in investment. According to Italy's infrastructure ministry, the flood barriers will be handed over to the Venice city council at the end of 2021 following the ""final phase"" of testing. Italy was hit by heavy rainfall on Tuesday with further bad weather forecast in the coming days. Venice suffers flooding on a yearly basis. By BBC meteorologist Nikki Berry The recent flooding in Venice was caused by a combination of high spring tides and a meteorological storm surge driven by strong sirocco winds blowing north-eastwards across the Adriatic Sea. When these two events coincide, we get what is known as Acqua Alta (high water). This latest Acqua Alta occurrence in Venice is the second highest tide in recorded history. However, if we look at the top 10 tides, five have occurred in the past 20 years and the most recent was only last year. While we should try to avoid attributing a single event to climate change, the increased frequency of these exceptional tides is obviously a big concern. In our changing climate, sea levels are rising and a city such as Venice, which is also sinking, is particularly susceptible to such changes. The weather patterns that have caused the Adriatic storm surge have been driven by a strong meridional (waving) jet stream across the northern hemisphere and this has fed a conveyor belt of low pressure systems into the central Mediterranean. One of the possible effects of a changing climate is that the jet stream will be more frequently meridional and blocked weather patterns such as these will also become more frequent. If this happens, there is a greater likelihood that these events will combine with astronomical spring tides and hence increase the chance of flooding in Venice. Furthermore, the meridional jet stream can be linked back to stronger typhoons in the north-west Pacific resulting in more frequent cold outbreaks in North America and an unsettled Mediterranean is another one of the downstream effects.

'Berlin rocks' says Elon Musk as picks factory,"This video can not be played Are electric cars as 'green' as you think? Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has said Berlin will be the site of its first major European factory as the carmaker's expansion plans power ahead. ""Berlin rocks,"" Mr Musk said, adding Tesla would build an engineering and design centre in the German capital. Tesla previously said it aimed to start production in Europe in 2021. The moves come as the firm, which has also invested heavily in a Chinese factory, faces intensifying competition in the electric vehicle industry. Mr Musk made the announcement at an awards ceremony in Germany on Tuesday. The company already has an assembly site in the Netherlands, but the plans for Germany are on a far larger scale. ""Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding and that's part of the reason we are locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany,"" he said. Mr Musk also cited risks surrounding the UK's exit from the EU for his decision,according to AutoExpress,external. ""Brexit [uncertainty] made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK,"" he told the trade magazine. Mr Musk said the facility would be located near the new Berlin airport and later gave more details on what the factory would produce on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

The focus on Germany comes amid rising appetite for electric cars in Europe. Over the coming years, the biggest electric car production plants will be in Germany, France, Spain and Italy,industry analysis shows. Some 16 large-scale lithium-ion battery cell plants are confirmed or due to begin operations in Europe by 2023. Elon Musk has long been pondering where to put his European facility known as a ""gigafactory"". Mr Musk's announcement on Tuesday night came ahead of the Prime Minister giving a televised election speech from an electric car factory. It has long been an aim of government policy to attract such a gigafactory to the UK, but international investors are yet to bite. The disruption of a possible no-deal Brexit has weighed down industry investment. But even the current deal proposed by the government would involve checks for customs and the origin of parts, that are difficult for the car industry and electric car industry in particular. While Mr Musk in 2014 expressed a long term desire to open a UK factory, that wasn't expected this soon. However, industry sources had been more hopeful that Mr Musk would choose the UK for his research and development facility in the UK. That too will be situated in Germany. Tesla's European plan comes as the carmaker also moves ahead with a $2bn (Â£1.6bn) factory in Shanghai. The firm is looking to ramp up production in China, the world's biggest car market, where sales have been hurt by tariffs triggered by the US-China trade war. Tesla gets the go-ahead to build cars in China Tesla starts work on huge new China plant Musk expects 'robotaxis' to start in US next year The Shanghai facility will produce Model 3 and Model Y cars. The automaker reportedly showed off its new China-made vehicles to local media this week. Tesla's Shanghai factory under construction Still, Tesla has struggled with years of losses, fuelling investor doubts and casting a shadow over its shares in recent years. The firm has yet to turn an annual profit, although it recorded positive results in the final two quarters of 2018. Last year, Tesla took aggressive steps to slash expenses, cutting thousands of jobs and reining in other spending.

Inflation falls to three-year low in October,"UK inflation rose at its lowest pace in almost three years last month as the energy cap kept a lid on the price of electricity, gas and other fuels, according to official statistics. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said consumer prices rose 1.5% in October, against 1.7% in September. Energy regulator Ofgem lowered price caps last month. The slower pace of price rises could boost household spending power as wages are rising faster than inflation. ONS data released on Tuesdayshowed that average earnings, excluding bonuses, increased by 3.6% in the three months to September. The October inflation number was lower than the 1.6% forecast by economists, although the Bank of England has said inflation could slip to 1.25% early next year - well below its 2% target. A spokesperson for the ONS said: ""A fall in utility prices due to a lowering of the energy price cap helped ease inflation in October. However, this was partially offset by rising clothing prices."" Prices of clothes and footwear rose by 1% on the previous month, the ONS said, with the most significant price moves being in ladies' formal trousers and branded trainers. Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent The Bank's policy makers expect the decline in inflation to continue in the first half of next year, due partly to the impact of the energy price cap and a likely reduction in water bills. But they think those factors will fade and inflation will move back towards the target in the latter part of 2020. So the October data doesn't very much change the argument about the next move in interest rates. Two big uncertainties are perhaps more likely to move the dial: Brexit and the slowdown in the global economy. Indeed the Bank has already signalled as much. Persistent Brexit-related uncertainty and further weakness in global growth could mean it ""might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth and inflation"" - in other words cut interest rates. If those risks don't materialise a rise would be more likely. But no move is imminent. Gas and electricity prices fell by 8.7% and 2.2% respectively in October from September. Ofgem said that around 15 million households on default deals or pre-payment meters will see lower bills this winter as a result of its latest cap on prices which took effect from October. The cap means that households should typically pay Â£75 less a year. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the inflation figures were ""decent news for consumer purchasing power"". The 3.6% rise in wages in the three months to September compares with an inflation rate of 1.8% over the period. Jing Teow, economist at PwC, said: ""The continued trend of falling inflation since late 2017, coupled with the steady rise in wages since 2018, has boosted household spending power, which has supported UK economic growth over the past two years."" But she said there were signs that pay growth was ""cooling off"" since peaking in June this year, which might also put less pressure on firms to raise prices. The inflation rate has implications for interest rates. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the falls in energy prices meant that the drop in inflation was not ""a reflection of a weakening in underlying inflationary pressures"". She expects a further fall in utility prices in April next year. ""Overall, the figures do little to change our view that inflation will spend more time below 2% than above it in 2020 and that if Brexit is delayed further, interest rates will be cut in May 2020,"" she said. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, also said there could be pressure to cut in rates - currently at 0.75% - early in 2020. But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the inflation measure should rise back to 2% in the second half of 2020 so he doubted that rates would be cut soon.

What to look for at Trump impeachment inquiry,"Trump has decried the impeachment effort as politically motivated The US impeachment inquiry emerges from behind closed doors at last. For more than a month, the process - which could end in a Senate vote on Donald Trump's removal from office - has been shrouded in mystery. The biggest revelations have come from leaks, anonymous media reports and voluminous deposition transcripts where even the most explosive and revealing moments can be drained of drama when presented on the written page. That all changes on Wednesday. Here are four things to keep in mind as the lights go up and the cameras turn on in the House Intelligence Committee hearing room. It's unlikely there will be many surprises in the testimony offered by the three witnesses scheduled to testify this week. Acting US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent and former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch have already appeared at closed-door committee hearings, and transcripts of their depositions have been released (and, before that, leaked to the press). The bombshells, for those who want to view them as such, have already exploded. The allegations of an exchange of favours (a quid pro quo) and a shadow foreign policy have already been disclosed and picked over. Marie Yovanovitch will testify on Friday If things go according to plan for Democrats, the three witnesses will simply repeat their previous answers - only this time, with the public watching. What may be important is not what they say but how they say it. Do they look and sound credible? Are there hints of doubt in their recollections? Will they be rattled by hostile Republican questioning? Public opinion has hardened around partisan lines. Democrats are hoping increased public support could persuade wavering Republicans to support the president's removal. The impeachment process is rife with legal language - depositions and due process, evidence and examinations - but it is, at its heart, a political undertaking. Politicians are the prosecutors, defenders, judges and jury. And politicians, in the end, are answerable to the people who elected them. It is the people, the voters, for whom the politicians will be performing. The goal of this week's impeachment theatre is to shape their views and win them over. SIMPLE GUIDE:A basic take on what's going on GO DEEPER:Here's a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story WHAT'S IMPEACHMENT?A political process to remove a president VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Hear from residents of a West Virginia town ON THE DOORSTEP:A Democrat sells impeachment to voters If this week is political theatre, Bill Taylor is its leading man. His text messages, disclosed by US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, first revealed his concern about the scope of efforts by the Trump administration to pressure Ukraine to open investigations that could prove politically helpful to Mr Trump. Taylor took copious notes of meetings and conversations In his testimony, he expanded on his view of the White House's Ukrainian policy and detailed multiple occasions where he believed US military assistance and an invitation to the White House were being used to pressure the Ukrainian government to act. It was his testimony that helped prompt US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland - one of the president's point people on Ukrainian policy - to ""refresh his recollection"" and acknowledge that he did indeed tell Ukrainian officials on 1 September that US military aid likely would be withheld until they opened the requested investigations. Taylor also recounted a video conference where a woman from the White House said the Ukrainian aid was being delayed on the president's orders. Five takeways from 'explosive' Bill Taylor testimony Trumpâs man in Brussels in eye of the storm Taylor is a central figure - if not the central figure - for Democrats hoping to make the case that Mr Trump abused presidential power for personal political gain. While he will be sharing a table with senior State Department official George Kent, Democrats are counting on Taylor to clearly and compellingly explain his views and concerns in a way that the public can understand. There is a reason Democrats chose Taylor, a 72-year-old diplomat and decorated Vietnam War veteran who served in Republican and Democratic administrations, as one of the lead witnesses in their public hearings. They think he will be up to the task. According to a memo circulating on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, the Republican strategy for defending Mr Trump during the public impeachment hearings is straightforward. The president did not pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, they will say. While US military assistance had been withheld, it was because Mr Trump had legitimate concerns about Ukrainian corruption. And in the end, that aid was released without the investigations in question being ordered. When witnesses contradict these assertions or criticise the president or his subordinates - as many have done in their closed-door testimony - Republicans in the hearing will dismiss them as unelected bureaucrats whose views are shaped by policy disagreements or animosity. Republicans may also try to undermine the credibility of the anonymous whistleblower who first flagged Mr Trump's call with the Ukrainian president or argue that Mr Trump was right to ask that the Ukrainians investigate Democrat Joe Biden or his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims They could also ascribe any misconduct to the president's subordinates or acknowledge that while the president's actions were not ideal, they do not rise to an impeachable offense. That defence risks the ire of the man in the White House, however. For Democrats to find success in these hearings they have to tell a cohesive story about presidential behaviour that merits impeachment and a Senate trial. Republicans simply have to poke holes in the narrative or garble it beyond recognition. The status quo favours the Republicans. The more they can grind the investigatory gears to a halt and muddle the process, the greater the chance the entire inquiry becomes mired in partisan trench warfare. This week will be a big test of their ability to succeed - and in Democrats' ability to deflect their attacks and press ahead. Who's who in Trump-Ukraine story? How Trump-Ukraine story unfolded, step by step When Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi first announced the formal impeachment inquiry in September, she divided responsibilities between three House committees with three different chairmen. By the time the House voted two weeks ago to set out in greater detail the specifics of the impeachment process, Pelosi had settled on one committee to take the lead and one man to run the show, California congressman Adam Schiff. The former federal prosecutor has shepherded weeks of closed-door depositions, and now he'll be the one calling the shots as the process goes public. Unlike other recent-high profile congressional hearings, Schiff will have considerably more time than most other members of Congress to question witnesses or delegate the task to committee lawyers. Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff have been the faces of the impeachment inquiry Schiff has promised a process that will be ""fair to the president"", but the congressman has already been a repeated target for Trump, who has berated him with personal insults and called him corrupt and his investigation a scam. Pelosi and her fellow congressional Democrats are counting on Schiff to stay cool under pressure and present a process that is organised and professional. The California congressman has never had a bigger moment than this.

'Little sign of change' for women in top roles,"There is ""little sign of change"" in women being under-represented in top jobs in business, a government-backed review has found. In the FTSE 350, only 25 women are in chair roles, with fewer chief executives, the Hampton-Alexander Review said. It called for a ""stronger focus"" to address the imbalance. However, FTSE 100 companies are on target for women to make up at least a third of boards by the end of 2020. This year has been the ""strongest year of progress"" for board representation since the review was set up in 2011, said Denise Wilson White, the chief executive of the review. More than 900 women are now on FTSE 350 boards. The review has set targets for women to make up at least a third of boards and a third of senior leadership positions by the end of 2020. Ms White told the BBC's Today programme that the FTSE 250 had had its ""strongest year ever"" and was on course to hit that target. In the FTSE 350 as a whole since 2011, ""we've gone from 152 all-male boards down to only two today,"" she said. However, she added that more progress needed to be made in female representation in top leadership positions, which she described as ""the 50 to 80 most senior jobs in any company"". She said there was ""no shortage"" of capable and competent women able to fill those roles, but problems in company systems meant they were ""just not getting picked in the same numbers"". The chair of the review, Sir Philip Hampton, said: ""Strengthening the number of women in executive positions is critical to achieving long-term gender balance. ""We are still a long way from reaching the target for women in senior leadership roles below board level. Unless half of all appointments made this year go to women - our target for 2020 is not going to be met."" Two FTSE 250 firms - property firm Daejan Holdings and software firm Kainos Group - have all male boards, the review said. Daejan Holdings secretary Mark Jenner said the company's position was that the aims of the review were not legally binding and Daejan was under no obligation to comply with them. In addition, he said board positions were filled on merit and there were no current vacancies. The review also found that 39 firms have only appointed one woman to the board, which it called a ""one and done"" approach. These include Domino's Pizza and a number of investment trusts. Millennial men demand better parental leave Gender pay gap progress dismally slow, says charity Companies with more than 40% female board membership include Standard Life Aberdeen, Schroders and Royal Bank of Scotland, while those with 25% or fewer women on the board include National Grid and Rio Tinto. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said: ""Investors have been consistent in their demands for greater diversity. ""It's not just a nice to have. The research is clear: firms with diverse boards and management teams make better decisions, drive innovation and outperform their less diverse peers."" Industry body the CBI said businesses were ""building on last year's progress and continuing to increase diversity in the boardroom"". Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, said: ""The benefits of a diverse boardroom have been proven many times, from improved decision making to increased profits. If all male boards are to become a thing of the past, firms must not take their foot off the pedal."" However, she added that firms were ""making less progress on the executive pipeline"". ""We are still seeing too few women in senior leadership positions, whether as chief executive or running divisions. ""Heading into 2020, all firms should ensure they have diverse shortlists and that they're doing everything possible to support people from all walks of life in their careers, from ground floor to boardroom."" The Hampton-Alexander Review is supported by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Government Equalities Office. Accountancy and auditing firm KPMG is its main financial sponsor. Melanie Richards, deputy chair at KPMG UK, said: ""Behind the numbers and trends are hundreds of individual stories. ""Women who have overcome barriers that they should not have had to overcome, with leaders and boards who have worked hard to remove those barriers for current and future generations.""

Inflation falls to three year low in October,"UK inflation rose at its lowest pace in almost three years last month as the energy cap kept a lid on the price of electricity, gas and other fuels, according to official statistics. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said consumer prices rose 1.5% in October, against 1.7% in September. Energy regulator Ofgem lowered price caps last month. The slower pace of price rises could boost household spending power as wages are rising faster than inflation. ONS data released on Tuesdayshowed that average earnings, excluding bonuses, increased by 3.6% in the three months to September. The October inflation number was lower than the 1.6% forecast by economists, although the Bank of England has said inflation could slip to 1.25% early next year - well below its 2% target. A spokesperson for the ONS said: ""A fall in utility prices due to a lowering of the energy price cap helped ease inflation in October. However, this was partially offset by rising clothing prices."" Prices of clothes and footwear rose by 1% on the previous month, the ONS said, with the most significant price moves being in ladies' formal trousers and branded trainers. Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent The Bank's policy makers expect the decline in inflation to continue in the first half of next year, due partly to the impact of the energy price cap and a likely reduction in water bills. But they think those factors will fade and inflation will move back towards the target in the latter part of 2020. So the October data doesn't very much change the argument about the next move in interest rates. Two big uncertainties are perhaps more likely to move the dial: Brexit and the slowdown in the global economy. Indeed the Bank has already signalled as much. Persistent Brexit-related uncertainty and further weakness in global growth could mean it ""might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth and inflation"" - in other words cut interest rates. If those risks don't materialise a rise would be more likely. But no move is imminent. Gas and electricity prices fell by 8.7% and 2.2% respectively in October from September. Ofgem said that around 15 million households on default deals or pre-payment meters will see lower bills this winter as a result of its latest cap on prices which took effect from October. The cap means that households should typically pay Â£75 less a year. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the inflation figures were ""decent news for consumer purchasing power"". The 3.6% rise in wages in the three months to September compares with an inflation rate of 1.8% over the period. Jing Teow, economist at PwC, said: ""The continued trend of falling inflation since late 2017, coupled with the steady rise in wages since 2018, has boosted household spending power, which has supported UK economic growth over the past two years."" But she said there were signs that pay growth was ""cooling off"" since peaking in June this year, which might also put less pressure on firms to raise prices. The inflation rate has implications for interest rates. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the falls in energy prices meant that the drop in inflation was not ""a reflection of a weakening in underlying inflationary pressures"". She expects a further fall in utility prices in April next year. ""Overall, the figures do little to change our view that inflation will spend more time below 2% than above it in 2020 and that if Brexit is delayed further, interest rates will be cut in May 2020,"" she said. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, also said there could be pressure to cut in rates - currently at 0.75% - early in 2020. But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the inflation measure should rise back to 2% in the second half of 2020 so he doubted that rates would be cut soon.

Clinton 'under enormous pressure' to run in 2020,"Hillary Clinton is promoting a book she co-wrote with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton (left) Hillary Clinton has said she is ""under enormous pressure"" to challenge US President Donald Trump in next year's White House election. The former Democratic presidential nominee refused to rule it out, telling the BBC: ""Never say never."" Mrs Clinton, 72, said she thinks ""all the time"" about what kind of president she would have been if she had beaten Mr Trump in 2016. Seventeen Democrats are already vying to lead the party in 2020. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett while in the UK on a book tour, Mrs Clinton was asked whether she would run again. Clinton 'wants to hug Meghan over racism' 'Shameful' not to publish Russia report - Clinton The former secretary of state, New York senator and US first lady replied: ""I think all the time about what kind of president I would have been and what I would have done differently and what I think it would have meant to our country and the world. ""So of course I think about it, I think about it all the time. Being able to do that, and look, whoever wins next time is going to have a big task trying to fix everything that's been broken."" Pressed on whether she would throw her hat into the ring at the last minute, Mrs Clinton said: ""I, as I say, never, never, never say never. ""I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans."" Mrs Clinton did not elaborate on who was pressuring her to mount what would be her third White House campaign. The interview in London came as she promoted The Book of Gutsy Women, which she has co-written with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton. The Democratic race is still largely up in the air even as the first of the state-by-state votes that will decide which of the contenders challenges Mr Trump looms in Iowa in February. This video can not be played Hillary Clinton called on the UK to publish an intelligence report on Russian covert actions The perceived vulnerability of one front-runner, Joe Biden, has spurred former New York Mayor Michael Bloombergto take steps to enter the fray. Former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, a close ally of former President Barack Obama, is also reportedly considering jumping into the race. But the deadline has already passed to file on the Democratic primary ballot in several states, including New Hampshire, which also votes in February. How  Bloomberg could shake up 2020 race Who's leading the race to take on Trump? The filing deadline for Alabama expired last week, and the deadline for Mrs Clinton's former political heartland of Arkansas was on Tuesday. Some of the 14 states that will vote on so-called Super Tuesday in March have filing deadlines next month. Political gossip about whether Mrs Clinton might jump into the White House race continues to set tongues wagging in Washington DC. Some of this speculation has been stoked by the Clintons themselves. Last month when Mr Trump goaded Mrs Clinton to enter the presidential race, she retorted in a tweet: ""Don't tempt me. Do your job."" At a Georgetown University event in Washington DC in October, former President Bill Clinton said of his wife, who was sitting beside him: ""She may or may not ever run for anything."" Election day is less than a year away now and the race to become the Democratic challenger to Donald Trump is hotting up.

The presenter belted out 231 songs, assisted by more than 90 celebrity guests, including Rick Astley, Nicole Scherzinger and Craig David. He ate spoonfuls of honey every hour to keep his vocal cords coated - along with the occasional Pudsey donut. ""I am in such a state,"" Clark-Neal told Radio 2's Zoe Ball as he approached the end of the challenge on Wednesday. ""It doesn't feel real.

""That sore throat today is totally worth it, @Rylan!"" tweeted Radio 2. ""We are so incredibly proud to announce that we've hit ONE MILLION POUNDS (Â£1,027,776 to be precise!)"" The final grand total will be revealed during Friday night's Children In Need broadcast on BBC One. Rylan's challenge saw him duet with Dermot O'Leary on You Don't Bring Me Flowers, rap with Trevor Nelson and DJ Spoony on a version of Rapper's Delight, and dance with Strictly contestants Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard.

""It was amazing and, do you know what, I didn't actually think about this when I signed up to do this,"" said the Strictly: It Takes Two presenter. ""I didn't really think that I would need that, but actually visiting the project and meeting all the kids and volunteers and speaking to them and understanding how much this money impacts their lives, when I am sort of dying at four o'clock in the morning trying to garble together a song I know what I'm doing it for now.""

'Fat cat smuggler' falls foul of Russian airline,"A cat in a back pack (file image) Russian carrier Aeroflot has stripped a passenger of his air miles for breaching its rules by sneaking his overweight cat aboard a flight. Mikhail Galin, 34, took his cat Viktor on board flight SU1702, from Moscow to Vladivostok, Aeroflot said. Under Aeroflot's rules, pets weighing more than 8kg (17lb) must be placed in the luggage hold. Because Viktor was too heavy for the passenger cabin, Mr Galin devised a cunning plan. He swapped Viktor for a smaller cat during check-in to get around the weight restrictions. Pilot banned from flying after passenger cockpit photo Flight attendant smuggled drugs in 'highly organised' ring 'The world's longest and most spectacular hijacking' The airline said because Mr Galin had broken the rules it had ""taken the decision to take this passenger out of its frequent flyer programme"". ""All of the miles collected during his time in the programme will be annulled,"" the airline said. Mr Galinrevealed how he had sneaked Viktor on board the flight earlier this month in a Facebook post that vent viral,external. In the post, Mr Galin said he had had Viktor with him on a flight from the Latvian capital Riga to Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok, which included a stopover in Moscow. But when he tried to board the second leg of the flight in the Russian capital, Aeroflot staff would not allow him to take Viktor into the passenger cabin. Allow Facebook content?

""The weigh-in showed that the animal had fattened up to 10 kilograms, a level not allowed for the cabin,"" Mr Galin wrote. Unwilling to place the cat in the luggage hold, Mr Galin delayed his flight and took the ""strategic decision to find a similar cat of a lower weight"" in Moscow. A day later Mr Galin returned to the airport with the smaller ""cat double"", which passed the weight limit test at the check-in desk. Mr Galin then gave the smaller cat back to its owners at the airport before boarding the plane to Vladivostok with Viktor. His mistake, it seems, was posting on Facebook about the ""operation to replace the fat cat Viktor"". A picture on his public profile shows Viktor sitting on the plane next to a glass of sparkling wine. The post drew the attention of Aeroflot, prompting it to launch an investigation that confirmed the cat swap on CCTV. In another post,Mr Galin appeared to accept his punishment with good humour,external. He shared a picture of Viktor as a kitten, ""when his weight still met the requirements of the air carrier"".

Bolivian senator becomes interim president,"Jeanine ÃÃ±ez proclaimed herself interim president with the backing of the Constitutional Court Bolivian opposition senator Jeanine ÃÃ±ez has assumed the interim presidency of the South American country following Evo Morales's resignation. Ms ÃÃ±ez said she was next in line under the constitution and vowed to hold elections soon. Her appointment was endorsed by Bolivia's Constitutional Court. Lawmakers from Mr Morales's party boycotted the session, and the former president branded Ms ÃÃ±ez ""a coup-mongering right-wing senator"". Mr Morales has sought asylum in Mexico, arguing that his life was in danger. He resigned on Sunday after weeks of protests over a disputed presidential election result. He said he was forced to stand down but had done so willingly ""so there would be no more bloodshed"". What's next for Bolivia? Boliviaâs democracy shaky as interim leader prepares country for elections Highs and lows of Evo Morales' presidency At Wednesday's news conference in Mexico City, Mr Morales said: ""If the people ask me, we are ready to return to pacify [Bolivia]."" He also called for a ""national dialogue"" to resolve the crisis and rejected the legitimacy of the interim president, AFP news agency reports. Ms ÃÃ±ez, 52, is a qualified lawyer and a fierce critic of Mr Morales. She was previously director of the Totalvision TV station, and has been a senator since 2010, representing the region of Beni in the National Assembly. As the deputy Senate leader, Ms ÃÃ±ez took temporary control of the body on Tuesday after Bolivia's vice-president and the leaders of the senate and lower house resigned. That put her next in line for the presidency under the constitution. This video can not be played Bolivia crisis: Ms ÃÃ±ez said earlier that she was willing to take control The parliamentary session to appoint Ms ÃÃ±ez was boycotted by lawmakers from Mr Morales's leftist Movement for Socialism party, who said it was illegitimate. ""Before the definitive absence of the president and vice president... as the president of the Chamber of Senators, I immediately assume the presidency as foreseen in the constitutional order,"" Ms ÃÃ±ez said to applause from opposition lawmakers. Bolivia's highest constitutional court backed her assumption of power. Writing on Twitter from Mexico, Mr Morales condemned the ""sneakiest, most nefarious coup in history"" and lawmakers from his party, who hold a majority in Bolivia's legislative assembly, have threatened to nullify her appointment. Mr Morales, a former coca farmer, was first elected in 2005 and took office in 2006, the country's first leader from the indigenous community. He won plaudits for fighting poverty and improving Bolivia's economy but drew controversy by defying constitutional limits to run for a fourth term in October's election. Pressure had been growing on him since contested election results suggested he had won outright in the first round. The result was called into question by the Organization of American States, a regional body, which had found ""clear manipulation"" and called for the result to be annulled. Why protesters are on the streets worldwide In response, Mr Morales agreed to hold fresh elections. But his main rival, Carlos Mesa - who came second in the vote - said Mr Morales should not stand in any new vote. The chief of the armed forces, Gen Williams Kaliman, then urged Mr Morales to step down in the interests of peace and stability. Announcing his resignation, Mr Morales said he had taken the decision in order to stop fellow socialist leaders from being ""harassed, persecuted and threatened"". This video can not be played Watch Evo Morales announce his resignation He fled to Mexico after three weeks of protests in which seven people were killed, according to the latest official figures. After arriving in Mexico City on Tuesday, he thanked Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, whom he credited with saving his life. ""While I have life I'll stay in politics, the fight continues. All the people of the world have the right to free themselves from discrimination and humiliation,"" he said.

Venice under water following record high tide,"This video can not be played Parts of Venice have been left under water by record flooding Severe flooding in Venice that has left much of the Italian city under water is a direct result of climate change, the mayor says. The highest water levels in the region in more than 50 years would leave ""a permanent mark"", Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro tweeted. ""Now the government must listen,"" he added. ""These are the effects of climate change... the costs will be high."" The waters in Venice peaked at 1.87m (6ft), according to the tide monitoring centre. Only once since official records began in 1923 has the tide been higher, reaching 1.94m in 1966. The tourist sites hit by Venice's floods Images showed popular sites left completely flooded and people wading through the streets as Venice was hit by a storm. St Mark's Square - one of the lowest parts of the city - was one of the worst hit areas. St Mark's Basilica was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years, according to church records. Pierpaolo Campostrini, a member of St Mark's council, said four of those floods had now occurred within the past 20 years. The mayor said the famous landmark had suffered ""grave damage"". The crypt was completely flooded and there are fears of structural damage to the basilica's columns. The city of Venice is made up of more than 100 islands inside a lagoon off the north-east coast of Italy. Two people died on the island of Pellestrina, a thin strip of land that separates the lagoon from the Adriatic Sea. A man was electrocuted as he tried to start a pump in his home, and a second person was found dead elsewhere. Mr Brugnaro said the damage was ""huge"" and that he would declare a state of disaster, warning that a project to help prevent the Venetian lagoon suffering devastating floods ""must be finished soon"". ""The situation is dramatic. We ask the government to help us,"" he said on Twitter, adding that schools would remain closed until the water level subsides. He also urged local businesses to share photos and video footage of the devastation, which he said would be useful when requesting financial help from the government. People throughout the city waded through the flood waters. A number of businesses were affected. Chairs and tables were seen floating outside cafes and restaurants. In shops, workers tried to move their stock away from the water to prevent any further damage. One shopkeeper, who was not named, told Italy's public broadcaster Rai: ""The city is on its knees."" Three waterbuses sank, but tourists continued their sightseeing as best they could. One French couple told AFP news agency that they had ""effectively swum"" after some of the wooden platforms placed around the city in areas prone to flooding overturned. On Wednesday morning, a number of boats were seen stranded. A project to protect the city from flooding has been under way since 2003 but has been hit by soaring costs, scandals and delays. The so-called Mose project - a series of large barriers or floodgates that would be raised from the seabed to shut off the lagoon in the event of rising sea levels and winter storms - was successfully tested for the first time in 2013. Watch: Venice flood barriers pass first test The project has already cost billions of euros in investment. According to Italy's infrastructure ministry, the flood barriers will be handed over to the Venice city council at the end of 2021 following the ""final phase"" of testing. Italy was hit by heavy rainfall on Tuesday with further bad weather forecast in the coming days. Venice suffers flooding on a yearly basis. By BBC meteorologist Nikki Berry The recent flooding in Venice was caused by a combination of high spring tides and a meteorological storm surge driven by strong sirocco winds blowing north-eastwards across the Adriatic Sea. When these two events coincide, we get what is known as Acqua Alta (high water). This latest Acqua Alta occurrence in Venice is the second highest tide in recorded history. However, if we look at the top 10 tides, five have occurred in the past 20 years and the most recent was only last year. While we should try to avoid attributing a single event to climate change, the increased frequency of these exceptional tides is obviously a big concern. In our changing climate, sea levels are rising and a city such as Venice, which is also sinking, is particularly susceptible to such changes. The weather patterns that have caused the Adriatic storm surge have been driven by a strong meridional (waving) jet stream across the northern hemisphere and this has fed a conveyor belt of low pressure systems into the central Mediterranean. One of the possible effects of a changing climate is that the jet stream will be more frequently meridional and blocked weather patterns such as these will also become more frequent. If this happens, there is a greater likelihood that these events will combine with astronomical spring tides and hence increase the chance of flooding in Venice. Furthermore, the meridional jet stream can be linked back to stronger typhoons in the north-west Pacific resulting in more frequent cold outbreaks in North America and an unsettled Mediterranean is another one of the downstream effects.

Does UK lag other rich nations on health and care?,"The UK has fewer doctors and nurses and poorer access to elderly long-term care than other rich nations, a study shows. The OECD review also warned that many Brits were living unhealthy lives with high rates of drinking and obesity. But it praised the ""strong access"" to health care delivered by the NHS, saying there were low levels of inequality compared to other countries. Spending at 9.8% of GDP - a measure of the size of the economy - was above the 8.8% average for the 36 nations. The review - carried out every two years - looks at the performance and characteristics of the wealthiest nations across all continents. The review looked at the number of doctors and nurses per 1,000 people. The UK has 2.8 doctors and 7.8 nurses per 1,000 people. That compares with OECD averages of 3.5 and 8.8 respectively. The findings chime with warnings from unions and NHS bosses about high vacancy rates in the NHS. Although the OECD review acknowledged that the number of doctors was on the rise. The government is in the process of expanding training places. The health service tends to fare well in terms of efficiency in these sort of international comparisons. And this OECD report is no different. It says the NHS provides very good access to health care for just above average levels of spending. The outcomes, on the whole, are pretty good - or at least in line with the average. Treatment and survival for things like heart attacks and breast cancer are good. Meanwhile, relatively few people live with diabetes. The OECD review reserved its strongest commentary for what it calls long-term care. In the UK this is largely delivered by the social care system run by councils. It is means-tested and heavily rationed so only the poorest and neediest get help from the state. It said British people generally had high levels of poor health after 65 - only 50% of women and 60% of men are free from disability after this point. The OECD review said good-quality long-term care was particularly important for improving the quality of life for older populations. But while access to health care was good, it was a different picture for long-term care, which includes help with daily tasks such as washing and dressing. Spending on such care was below average, while informal carers shared a heavy burden, with nearly one in five people aged over 50 acting as informal carers, the fourth highest among the 18 countries for which there was comparable data. In England, there have been years of talks and arguments over how to reform the social care system. Following the 2017 election the government promised to bring forward plans. But they were delayed on numerous occasions before the latest election was called. Smoking rates are pretty low, but when it comes to the way we live our lives, that is about all the good news. Adults consume higher rates of alcohol compared with other nations and nearly two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese. Both were higher than the OECD average. Drug abuse, particularly heroin, was a ""concern"", the OECD said, with its researchers noting there had been an increase in opioid-related deaths. It also warned that gains in life expectancy have started slowing in recent years.

Tesla picks Berlin for first European factory,"This video can not be played Are electric cars as 'green' as you think? Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has said Berlin will be the site of its first major European factory as the carmaker's expansion plans power ahead. ""Berlin rocks,"" Mr Musk said, adding Tesla would build an engineering and design centre in the German capital. Tesla previously said it aimed to start production in Europe in 2021. The moves come as the firm, which has also invested heavily in a Chinese factory, faces intensifying competition in the electric vehicle industry. Mr Musk made the announcement at an awards ceremony in Germany on Tuesday. The company already has an assembly site in the Netherlands, but the plans for Germany are on a far larger scale. ""Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding and that's part of the reason we are locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany,"" he said. Mr Musk also cited risks surrounding the UK's exit from the EU for his decision,according to AutoExpress,external. ""Brexit [uncertainty] made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK,"" he told the trade magazine. Mr Musk said the facility would be located near the new Berlin airport and later gave more details on what the factory would produce on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

The focus on Germany comes amid rising appetite for electric cars in Europe. Over the coming years, the biggest electric car production plants will be in Germany, France, Spain and Italy,industry analysis shows. Some 16 large-scale lithium-ion battery cell plants are confirmed or due to begin operations in Europe by 2023. Elon Musk has long been pondering where to put his European facility known as a ""gigafactory"". Mr Musk's announcement on Tuesday night came ahead of the Prime Minister giving a televised election speech from an electric car factory. It has long been an aim of government policy to attract such a gigafactory to the UK, but international investors are yet to bite. The disruption of a possible no-deal Brexit has weighed down industry investment. But even the current deal proposed by the government would involve checks for customs and the origin of parts, that are difficult for the car industry and electric car industry in particular. While Mr Musk in 2014 expressed a long term desire to open a UK factory, that wasn't expected this soon. However, industry sources had been more hopeful that Mr Musk would choose the UK for his research and development facility in the UK. That too will be situated in Germany. Tesla's European plan comes as the carmaker also moves ahead with a $2bn (Â£1.6bn) factory in Shanghai. The firm is looking to ramp up production in China, the world's biggest car market, where sales have been hurt by tariffs triggered by the US-China trade war. Tesla gets the go-ahead to build cars in China Tesla starts work on huge new China plant Musk expects 'robotaxis' to start in US next year The Shanghai facility will produce Model 3 and Model Y cars. The automaker reportedly showed off its new China-made vehicles to local media this week. Tesla's Shanghai factory under construction Still, Tesla has struggled with years of losses, fuelling investor doubts and casting a shadow over its shares in recent years. The firm has yet to turn an annual profit, although it recorded positive results in the final two quarters of 2018. Last year, Tesla took aggressive steps to slash expenses, cutting thousands of jobs and reining in other spending.

What to look for at Trump impeachment hearing,"Trump has decried the impeachment effort as politically motivated The US impeachment inquiry emerges from behind closed doors at last. For more than a month, the process - which could end in a Senate vote on Donald Trump's removal from office - has been shrouded in mystery. The biggest revelations have come from leaks, anonymous media reports and voluminous deposition transcripts where even the most explosive and revealing moments can be drained of drama when presented on the written page. That all changes on Wednesday. Here are four things to keep in mind as the lights go up and the cameras turn on in the House Intelligence Committee hearing room. It's unlikely there will be many surprises in the testimony offered by the three witnesses scheduled to testify this week. Acting US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent and former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch have already appeared at closed-door committee hearings, and transcripts of their depositions have been released (and, before that, leaked to the press). The bombshells, for those who want to view them as such, have already exploded. The allegations of an exchange of favours (a quid pro quo) and a shadow foreign policy have already been disclosed and picked over. Marie Yovanovitch will testify on Friday If things go according to plan for Democrats, the three witnesses will simply repeat their previous answers - only this time, with the public watching. What may be important is not what they say but how they say it. Do they look and sound credible? Are there hints of doubt in their recollections? Will they be rattled by hostile Republican questioning? Public opinion has hardened around partisan lines. Democrats are hoping increased public support could persuade wavering Republicans to support the president's removal. The impeachment process is rife with legal language - depositions and due process, evidence and examinations - but it is, at its heart, a political undertaking. Politicians are the prosecutors, defenders, judges and jury. And politicians, in the end, are answerable to the people who elected them. It is the people, the voters, for whom the politicians will be performing. The goal of this week's impeachment theatre is to shape their views and win them over. SIMPLE GUIDE:A basic take on what's going on GO DEEPER:Here's a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story WHAT'S IMPEACHMENT?A political process to remove a president VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Hear from residents of a West Virginia town ON THE DOORSTEP:A Democrat sells impeachment to voters If this week is political theatre, Bill Taylor is its leading man. His text messages, disclosed by US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, first revealed his concern about the scope of efforts by the Trump administration to pressure Ukraine to open investigations that could prove politically helpful to Mr Trump. Taylor took copious notes of meetings and conversations In his testimony, he expanded on his view of the White House's Ukrainian policy and detailed multiple occasions where he believed US military assistance and an invitation to the White House were being used to pressure the Ukrainian government to act. It was his testimony that helped prompt US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland - one of the president's point people on Ukrainian policy - to ""refresh his recollection"" and acknowledge that he did indeed tell Ukrainian officials on 1 September that US military aid likely would be withheld until they opened the requested investigations. Taylor also recounted a video conference where a woman from the White House said the Ukrainian aid was being delayed on the president's orders. Five takeways from 'explosive' Bill Taylor testimony Trumpâs man in Brussels in eye of the storm Taylor is a central figure - if not the central figure - for Democrats hoping to make the case that Mr Trump abused presidential power for personal political gain. While he will be sharing a table with senior State Department official George Kent, Democrats are counting on Taylor to clearly and compellingly explain his views and concerns in a way that the public can understand. There is a reason Democrats chose Taylor, a 72-year-old diplomat and decorated Vietnam War veteran who served in Republican and Democratic administrations, as one of the lead witnesses in their public hearings. They think he will be up to the task. According to a memo circulating on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, the Republican strategy for defending Mr Trump during the public impeachment hearings is straightforward. The president did not pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, they will say. While US military assistance had been withheld, it was because Mr Trump had legitimate concerns about Ukrainian corruption. And in the end, that aid was released without the investigations in question being ordered. When witnesses contradict these assertions or criticise the president or his subordinates - as many have done in their closed-door testimony - Republicans in the hearing will dismiss them as unelected bureaucrats whose views are shaped by policy disagreements or animosity. Republicans may also try to undermine the credibility of the anonymous whistleblower who first flagged Mr Trump's call with the Ukrainian president or argue that Mr Trump was right to ask that the Ukrainians investigate Democrat Joe Biden or his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims They could also ascribe any misconduct to the president's subordinates or acknowledge that while the president's actions were not ideal, they do not rise to an impeachable offense. That defence risks the ire of the man in the White House, however. For Democrats to find success in these hearings they have to tell a cohesive story about presidential behaviour that merits impeachment and a Senate trial. Republicans simply have to poke holes in the narrative or garble it beyond recognition. The status quo favours the Republicans. The more they can grind the investigatory gears to a halt and muddle the process, the greater the chance the entire inquiry becomes mired in partisan trench warfare. This week will be a big test of their ability to succeed - and in Democrats' ability to deflect their attacks and press ahead. Who's who in Trump-Ukraine story? How Trump-Ukraine story unfolded, step by step When Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi first announced the formal impeachment inquiry in September, she divided responsibilities between three House committees with three different chairmen. By the time the House voted two weeks ago to set out in greater detail the specifics of the impeachment process, Pelosi had settled on one committee to take the lead and one man to run the show, California congressman Adam Schiff. The former federal prosecutor has shepherded weeks of closed-door depositions, and now he'll be the one calling the shots as the process goes public. Unlike other recent-high profile congressional hearings, Schiff will have considerably more time than most other members of Congress to question witnesses or delegate the task to committee lawyers. Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff have been the faces of the impeachment inquiry Schiff has promised a process that will be ""fair to the president"", but the congressman has already been a repeated target for Trump, who has berated him with personal insults and called him corrupt and his investigation a scam. Pelosi and her fellow congressional Democrats are counting on Schiff to stay cool under pressure and present a process that is organised and professional. The California congressman has never had a bigger moment than this.

"Johnson promises to end Brexit 'groundhoggery'The UK can't afford to ""squander"" more time, the Tory leader will say in his first big election speech.","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our ambition is unlock the whole nation's potential"" Delivering Brexit would help the UK close the ""opportunity gap between rich and poor"", Boris Johnson has said. In his first big speech of the election campaign, he promised to boost regional industry and drive a ""clean energy revolution"" after the UK leaves the EU. He said a future Tory government would double investment in high-tech research and development to Â£18bn. But earlier former Tory David Gauke said Mr Johnson's plan will lead to a ""bad outcome for the country"". And Labour said Mr Johnson's Brexit deal was flawed and another referendum was needed. In other election developments: Boris Johnson is heckled on a visit to flood-hit Stainforthto see the emergency response Jeremy Corbyn rows back on comments that he would not back a Scottish independence referendumin the ""first term"" of a new government Labour ispromising to outspend the Conservatives on the NHSin England The Lib Dems ruleout any electoral pacts with Labour after two of its candidates stand down Former Tory rebelDavid Gauke, who is standing as an independent candidate, says an outright Tory would be a ""bad outcome"" for the UK The SNP is to take legal actionover its exclusion from the ITV head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn The Green Party says it would appointa Carbon Chancellorto oversee its Green New Deal and policy Speaking during a visit to an electric taxi manufacturer near Coventry, the PM set out his vision for post-Brexit Britain, saying his goal was to unite the country and ""level up"" economic performance by boosting the regions. He said the UK must be at the heart of the world's ""green revolution"", harnessing the power of science, innovation and technology to tackle climate change and create high-skilled, high wage jobs. A Tory victory on 12 December would see the UK leave the EU in January, he said, and that would be good for the country's ""politics, economy and psychological health"" after months of paralysis. ""We must get Brexit done because we are democrats,"" he said, saying while Leave voters wanted the result of the 2016 referendum result to be respected, Remain voters also accepted the ""wrangling had to end"". What does 'Get Brexit done,' mean? Will delaying Brexit cost Â£1bn a month? Donald Tusk: Don't give up on stopping Brexit But he departed from excerpts of the speech briefed to the media on Tuesday, leaving out references to Brexit ""groundhoggery"" and claims that calls for another Brexit referendum and a further vote on Scottish independence were a form of ""onanism"", or masturbation. Asked about this at a press conference after the speech, he blamed it on a ""stray draft"" of the speech released to the media. The Tory leader said the UK's economic fundamentals were sound, but he compared the country to a ""cup-winning horse trying to run on three legs"" with huge untapped potential and often ""vastly different"" educational outcomes. ""If every child had the same start and the same encouragement, think of the all untapped talent in this country,"" he said. ""Yet the solution to that inequality is within our grasp... not just to close the opportunity gap between rich and poor but also between the regions of this country."" He promised to make the ""small improvements in life that people are craving"" by addressing transport bottlenecks, improving rural bus services and broadband connections. He also said British apprentices must be employed on all ""big new public sector"" contracts after Brexit. Mr Johnson said the UK must be at the heart of the world's ""green revolution"" To demonstrate his party's support for enterprise, he said a future Tory government would double funding for research and development to Â£18bn in the next Parliament, which would amount to the ""biggest ever increase in support for R&D"". ""We proudly back businesses across this country because they are creating the wealth that actually pays for the NHS and everything else."" A Labour victory, he claimed, would lead to a ""Technicolor coalition"" with the SNP, prolonging the uncertainty for business over Brexit and the future of the UK. The PM is facing claims from a former cabinet colleague that his electionwould lead to a ""very hard Brexit""after Mr Gauke attacked the policy of the Conservatives to not extend the implementation period for Brexit past December 2020. Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Labour has clear and simple Brexit plan - Corbyn The Tories plan to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Union during that time, but have pledged to leave without one if no deal is reached by the deadline. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage cited the pledge as one of the reasons for his decision not to stand candidates in the 317 seats won by the Tories at the last general election, in 2017. This video can not be played David Gauke says a Conservative majority will move the UK towards ""a very hard Brexit"" Mr Gauke said ""one simply cannot renegotiate a trade deal in that time period"", and leaving without a deal would be ""disastrous for the prosperity of our countryâ¦ [making] whole sectors unviable"". But Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, said his former colleague was ""wrong"". Tories in fresh attack on Labour spending plans Flooding an absolute tragedy, says PM 'Stop Brexit' megaphone man to stand for Lib Dems He defended the progress the prime minister has made on Brexit, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""People throughout the summer said that Boris Johnson would not be able to secure a deal with the EU. ""The withdrawal agreement will never be reopened, they said. The backstop is unviable, you won't get it changed. ""They are people who have been left with oeuf on their faces because he succeeded in securing that deal in defiance of the sceptics and the cynics, and we can secure a free trade agreement by the end of 2020."" MPs backed Mr Johnson's Brexit deal in principle before Parliament was dissolved. But they refused to endorse his timetable to rush it through in days, meaning the PM had to abandon his ""do or die"" pledge to take the UK out by the 31 October deadline.

"Gauke: Tory majority 'bad outcome for country'The former Conservative justice secretary will stand as an independent to oppose a ""hard Brexit"".Election 2019","This video can not be played Former minister David Gauke: ""A Conservative majority... will take us in the direction of a very hard Brexit"" Former justice secretary David Gauke says a Conservative majority at the upcoming election would be a ""bad outcome for the country"". Mr Gauke - who confirmed he will run as an independent in 12 December poll - was among the MPs expelled from the Tories by Boris Johnson after he voted against a no-deal Brexit. He said a majority led by Mr Johnson would mean a ""very hard Brexit"". But Tory Minister Michael Gove said his former colleague was ""precisely wrong"". Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast the Conservatives were pursuing ""a good Brexit deal which works for whole UK [and] which will enable us to have a relationship with the EU based on free trade and friendly co-operation."" Responding to Mr Gauke's comments, Mr Johnson said: ""We are fighting for every vote we can get. I regret we haven't got his support, but we will do our best in the campaign ahead."" Mr Gauke confirmed his decision to stand in South West Hertfordshire - where he has been the MP since 2005 - at a political awards ceremony on Tuesday. But he has urged voters in some constituencies to vote for the Liberal Democrats LIVE: Election campaign latest Tories choose candidate to take place of Gauke Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Gauke attacked the policy of the Conservatives to not extend the implementation period for Brexit past December 2020. During these months, the UK would stick to the EU rules on issues such as freedom of movement. The Tories plan to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Union during that time, but have pledged to leave without one if no deal is reached by the deadline. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage cited the pledge as one of the reasons for hisdecision not to stand candidates in the 317 seats won by the Toriesat the last general election, in 2017. This video can not be played Tory Minister Michael Gove says the UK ""can secure a free trade deal by the end of 2020"" Mr Gauke said ""one simply cannot renegotiate a trade deal in that time period"", and leaving without a deal would be ""disastrous for the prosperity of our countryâ¦ [making] whole sectors unviable"". But he said Mr Johnson was so ""boxed in"" to the plan that he couldn't change his mind even if he wanted to - and he showed no sign of that. ""He would have letters flooding in to the chairman of the 1922 committee [trying to oust him] and Nigel Farage would be out making a lot of noise,"" said Mr Gauke. ""I don't think that either the parliamentary party or the wider Conservative membership would allow him to do that. He is boxed in unless Parliament is in a position to force him to extend.""

Mr Gauke said his comments were not a personal attack on Mr Johnson, although he said the PM ""lacks qualities some would ideally want in prime minister"". But he urged voters to support ""the centre ground"" in the election so they could stop a hard Brexit, even lending their support to the Liberal Democrats if needs be. ""I have to say I am impressed by [Lib Dem leader] Jo Swinson and if I was living in a lot of constituencies I would lend my vote,"" he told Today. Mr Gauke now backs a confirmatory referendum on Mr Johnson's deal versus Remain. ""I have reluctantly come to that view,"" he said. ""I thought the best outcome for our country was for us to unite behind some kind of soft Brexit [but] that option isn't there any more.

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr Gove, said his former colleague was ""a good friend, but I think on this issue he's got it precisely wrong"". He told Breakfast: ""The only way that we can Brexit done is by making sure we do have a functioning majority government. ""We're going to get a good deal with the EU and we're going to get it by the end of 2020."" Mr Gove added: ""One of the problems that we've had is that Parliament has engaged in endless dither and delay on this, and that's because we haven't had a strong majority.""

MP convicted over expenses withdraws from seat,"Chris Davies had been an MP since 2015 but was unseated by a petition after admitting submitting two false expenses invoices A former MP who lost his seat following a conviction for a false expenses claim has quit the general election after briefly becoming the Conservative candidate for Ynys Mon. Chris Davies pulled out after other Welsh Tories criticised his selection. ""I will not want to put my wife and family through any more distress,"" the former Brecon and Radnorshire MP said. A senior Welsh Conservative source told the BBC the campaign had been ""shaky to say the least"". ""The candidate selection has been seriously flawed and chaotic,"" the source added. Another claimed a Conservative AM had been approached to stand in Ynys Mon on Wednesday - the approach was rejected. Brecon and Radnorshire by-elections past By-election loss for Tories cut majority Tory MP pleads guilty to false expenses claim Announcing his decision to withdraw from the election, Mr Davies said: ""Given the reaction in the media to the idea of me being a candidate, I have decided to pull out of the selection process."" Conservative AM Nick Ramsay said Mr Davies had ""done the right thing"". ""As John Major once said, when the curtain falls, it's time to leave the stage,"" he tweeted. It leaves Ynys Mon without a Tory candidate, with the deadline for candidate selection on Thursday. Mr Davies lost a by-election in Brecon and Radnorshire triggered by a recall petition earlier this year. Headmitted two charges of a false expenses claim in Marchat Westminster Magistrates' Court after trying to split the cost of Â£700 worth of pictures between two office budgets by creating fake invoices, when he could have claimed the amount by other means. Mr Davies made an ""unreserved apology"" and was ordered to complete 50 hours of unpaid work and was fined Â£1,500. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

News of his selection for Ynys Mon broke on Tuesday night, prompting incredulity from Angela Burns, Welsh Conservative AM for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire. Claiming Mr Davies had been imposed by the party, she said: ""You couldn't make it up."" ""It is inexplicable,"" another Welsh Conservative source said. Mr Davies had tried and failed to win selection as the general election candidate in Brecon and Radnorshire again before the Ynys Mon selection was made. Chris Davies apologised after his conviction But Mr Davies withdrew after he realised he would not be able to command support on Anglesey, the source claimed. One Conservative told BBC Wales there was a ""feeling within the party that Chris Davies had paid the penalty and deserved another try"". However there had been ""huge resistance"" from within the party locally and that is why Mr Davies had withdrawn, the source added, realising he would not be able to command support in Anglesey. The local party were only made aware of his selection on Tuesday, the source said. Lord Davies of Gower, Welsh Conservative chairman, had defended the selection before Mr Davies quit, saying: ""Chris made a mistake and has paid the price. He must now be allowed to move on."" The constituency of Ynys Mon includes the island of Anglesey and the smaller Holy Island. The Conservatives held the seat - previously known as Anglesey - between 1979 and 1987, followed by Plaid Cymru until 2001, and since then by Labour. Labour has selected Mary Roberts for the 12 December poll, while Plaid Cymru has picked Aled ap Dafydd. The Brexit Party intends to stand Helen Jenner. Ms Roberts said: ""Chris Davies has rightly withdrawn. The Welsh Conservatives are in complete disarray."" Plaid's candidate said: ""For the Tories to consider that he was suitable in the first place shows how out of touch they are."" Deputy leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Baroness Christine Humphreys said the Conservatives had ""demonstrated their utter contempt"" for Ynys Mon voters. The summer by-election cut the Conservative working majority to just one when Jane Dodds overturned Mr Davies's 8,038 majority to beat Conservative Chris Davies by 1,425 votes.

Tories suspend members over Islamophobia claims,"The Conservatives have suspended a number of members over claims of Islamophobic social media posts. The Guardian says,externalit has seen details of racist content posted, shared or endorsed by 25 sitting and ex-Tory councillors. The Conservatives say they take ""swift action... on not just anti-Muslim discrimination, but discrimination of any kind"". But in a tweet Labour accused the party of ""showing their true colours"". The Guardian says it handed a dossier containing the allegations, produced by an anonymous Twitter user, to the Conservative Party. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove reiterated the party's pledge to hold an investigation into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party, and promised it would start before the end of the year. Tory members 'see Islam as threat to British life' Tory peer accuses Hancock of 'whitesplaining' Leadership rivals back Islamophobia inquiry A Conservative spokesperson said the individuals named in the dossier had been ""suspended immediately, pending investigation"". ""The Conservative Party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. ""That's why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to stamp them out as and when they occur."" It is understood not all the names provided in the dossier are members of the Conservative Party, but the party was unable to say how many members had been suspended. Responding to the disclosures, the Muslim Council of Britain said Islamophobia was ""endemic"" in the Conservative Party. It comes as the Conservative Party faces calls to hold an independent inquiry into Islamophobia following incidents highlighted to the party and in the media. Earlier this year a number of Conservative Party members were suspended,after the BBC highlighted 20 casesto the party of members posting or endorsing Islamophobic material online.

Arctic blast brings record temperatures to US,"Michigan is among the US states affected by heavy snowfall An Arctic air mass has brought record-breaking low temperatures to several places in the US. The Arctic blast, which began in Siberia, has brought heavy snow and ice to many areas. Daily records have been set in states including Kansas and Illinois. Forecasters say hundreds of records could be matched or broken this week. Four traffic deaths have been linked to the bad weather and more than 1,000 flights have been cancelled. Schools have also been closed in some areas. The National Weather Service (NSW) said the air mass was continuing to spread from the Plains towards the East Coast. It warned that the cold front would make it feel like ""the middle of winter"" rather than November for much of the eastern two-thirds of the country. Ice loss causing Arctic to reflect less heat Beach in Finland covered in rare 'ice eggs' Why is Colorado having so many avalanches? Several cities in Kansas set record low temperatures on Tuesday, when compared to the same date in previous years. The lowest temperature was recorded in Garden City, where it dropped to -1F (-18C), breaking the record of 7F set last year. Chicago recorded a low of 7F,breaking the previous record of 8F set in 1986,,externalthe NWS said. The city also set a daily record for snowfall on Monday.

""It is pretty much about the coldest we can be this time of year [and] it could break records all over the region,"" he added, according to AP news agency. Numerous schools and businesses remained shuttered on Tuesday because of the unusual cold weather. The cold weather has also affected road conditions.

Bolivian senator declares herself president,"Jeanine ÃÃ±ez proclaimed herself interim president with the backing of the Constitutional Court Bolivian opposition senator Jeanine ÃÃ±ez has assumed the interim presidency of the South American country following Evo Morales's resignation. Ms ÃÃ±ez said she was next in line under the constitution and vowed to hold elections soon. Her appointment was endorsed by Bolivia's Constitutional Court. Lawmakers from Mr Morales's party boycotted the session, and the former president branded Ms ÃÃ±ez ""a coup-mongering right-wing senator"". Mr Morales has sought asylum in Mexico, arguing that his life was in danger. He resigned on Sunday after weeks of protests over a disputed presidential election result. He said he was forced to stand down but had done so willingly ""so there would be no more bloodshed"". What's next for Bolivia? Boliviaâs democracy shaky as interim leader prepares country for elections Highs and lows of Evo Morales' presidency At Wednesday's news conference in Mexico City, Mr Morales said: ""If the people ask me, we are ready to return to pacify [Bolivia]."" He also called for a ""national dialogue"" to resolve the crisis and rejected the legitimacy of the interim president, AFP news agency reports. Ms ÃÃ±ez, 52, is a qualified lawyer and a fierce critic of Mr Morales. She was previously director of the Totalvision TV station, and has been a senator since 2010, representing the region of Beni in the National Assembly. As the deputy Senate leader, Ms ÃÃ±ez took temporary control of the body on Tuesday after Bolivia's vice-president and the leaders of the senate and lower house resigned. That put her next in line for the presidency under the constitution. This video can not be played Bolivia crisis: Ms ÃÃ±ez said earlier that she was willing to take control The parliamentary session to appoint Ms ÃÃ±ez was boycotted by lawmakers from Mr Morales's leftist Movement for Socialism party, who said it was illegitimate. ""Before the definitive absence of the president and vice president... as the president of the Chamber of Senators, I immediately assume the presidency as foreseen in the constitutional order,"" Ms ÃÃ±ez said to applause from opposition lawmakers. Bolivia's highest constitutional court backed her assumption of power. Writing on Twitter from Mexico, Mr Morales condemned the ""sneakiest, most nefarious coup in history"" and lawmakers from his party, who hold a majority in Bolivia's legislative assembly, have threatened to nullify her appointment. Mr Morales, a former coca farmer, was first elected in 2005 and took office in 2006, the country's first leader from the indigenous community. He won plaudits for fighting poverty and improving Bolivia's economy but drew controversy by defying constitutional limits to run for a fourth term in October's election. Pressure had been growing on him since contested election results suggested he had won outright in the first round. The result was called into question by the Organization of American States, a regional body, which had found ""clear manipulation"" and called for the result to be annulled. Why protesters are on the streets worldwide In response, Mr Morales agreed to hold fresh elections. But his main rival, Carlos Mesa - who came second in the vote - said Mr Morales should not stand in any new vote. The chief of the armed forces, Gen Williams Kaliman, then urged Mr Morales to step down in the interests of peace and stability.

Tories suspend members over Islamophobia claimsThe party takes action after the Guardian newspaper hands it a dossier of allegations.UK Politics,"The Conservatives have suspended a number of members over claims of Islamophobic social media posts. The Guardian says,externalit has seen details of racist content posted, shared or endorsed by 25 sitting and ex-Tory councillors. The Conservatives say they take ""swift action... on not just anti-Muslim discrimination, but discrimination of any kind"". But in a tweet Labour accused the party of ""showing their true colours"". The Guardian says it handed a dossier containing the allegations, produced by an anonymous Twitter user, to the Conservative Party. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove reiterated the party's pledge to hold an investigation into Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice within the party, and promised it would start before the end of the year. Tory members 'see Islam as threat to British life' Tory peer accuses Hancock of 'whitesplaining' Leadership rivals back Islamophobia inquiry A Conservative spokesperson said the individuals named in the dossier had been ""suspended immediately, pending investigation"". ""The Conservative Party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. ""That's why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to stamp them out as and when they occur."" It is understood not all the names provided in the dossier are members of the Conservative Party, but the party was unable to say how many members had been suspended. Responding to the disclosures, the Muslim Council of Britain said Islamophobia was ""endemic"" in the Conservative Party. It comes as the Conservative Party faces calls to hold an independent inquiry into Islamophobia following incidents highlighted to the party and in the media. Earlier this year a number of Conservative Party members were suspended,after the BBC highlighted 20 casesto the party of members posting or endorsing Islamophobic material online.

"Labour Party hit by second cyber-attackThe party says the first DDoS attack against it failed and it has ""ongoing security processes in place"".Election 2019","This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""A cyber attack against a political party in an election is suspicious"" Labour is reportedly suffering a second cyber-attack after saying it successfully thwarted one on Monday. The party says it has ""ongoing security processes in place"" so users ""may be experiencing some differences"", which it is dealing with ""quickly"". The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack floods a computer server with traffic to try to take it offline. The BBC's Gordon Corera has been told Monday's attack was not linked to a state. Earlier, a Labour source said that attacks came from computers in Russia and Brazil. Our security correspondent said he had been told the first attack was a low-level incident - not a large-scale and sophisticated attack. A National Cyber Security Centre spokesman said the Labour Party followed the correct procedure and notified them swiftly of Monday's cyber-attack, adding: ""The attack was not successful and the incident is now closed."" Meanwhile, Labour has denied that there has been a data breach or a security flaw in its systems afterthe Times reported the party's website had exposed the names of online donors,external. Live: Latest election news Cyber-attacks on UK firms 'jump' in 2019 Following reports of a second cyber-attack, a Labour Party spokesperson said: ""We have ongoing security processes in place to protect our platforms, so users may be experiencing some differences. We are dealing with this quickly and efficiently."" DDoS attacks direct huge amounts of internet traffic at a target in an effort to overwhelm computer servers, causing their software to crash. They are often carried out via a network of hijacked computers and other internet-connected devices known as a botnet. The owners of which may be unaware their equipment is involved. DDoS attacks are not normally recognised as being a hack as they do not involve breaking into a target's systems to insert malware. They can vary in sophistication and size, and are sometimes used as a diversionary tactic to carry out a more damaging attack under the radar. Several companies provide services to repel DDoS attacks, but they can be costly. The BBC has confirmed that Labour is using software by the technology company Cloudflare to protect its systems. The US-based company boasts it has 15 times the network capacity of the biggest DDoS attack ever recorded, meaning it should be able to absorb any deluge of data directed at one of its clients. BBC political correspondent Jessica Parker said ""Labour Connects"", a tool for campaigners to design and print materials was disrupted on Monday and was ""closed for maintenance"" on Tuesday morning. A message on the site on Monday said it was experiencing issues ""due to the large volume of users"". This video can not be played EXPLAINED: What is a DDoS attack? Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Monday's cyber-attack was ""very serious"" and also ""suspicious"" because it took place during an election campaign. ""If this is a sign of things to come, I feel very nervous about it,"" he said. In a letter sent to Labour campaigners, Niall Sookoo, the party's executive director of elections and campaigns, said: ""Yesterday afternoon our security systems identified that, in a very short period of time, there were large-scale and sophisticated attacks on Labour Party platforms which had the intention of taking our systems entirely offline. ""Every single one of these attempts failed due to our robust security systems and the integrity of all our platforms and data was maintained."" Labour's general secretary Jennie Formby said on Twitter the attack was a ""real concern"" but she added she was proud of the party's staff who ""took immediate action to ensure our systems and data are all safe "". Emily Orton, from Darktrace, an AI company for cyber-security, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""Really this is the tip of the iceberg in terms of the types of threats that, not just the Labour Party, but all political parties are going to be without a doubt experiencing on a daily basis."" ""I think anyone involved in politics and in government need to be preparing themselves for a lot more stealthy, sophisticated attacks than this,"" she added. By Leo Kelion, Technology desk editor The Times has revealed that Labour exposed the names of people who had donated money via an online tool. The details could be found via an RSS web feed generated by the site's code, which most browsers provide a way to inspect. In most cases the information was limited to the donors' first names and the sums given. But because some people had mistakenly added their surname to the first name input box, this too was disclosed. Labour denies this represented a security flaw or that a reportable data breach had occurred. It also believes that only a small number of full names were exposed. However, it made changes to shut down the RSS feed last night. ""The Labour Party takes its responsibilities for data protection extremely seriously,"" a spokesman said. ""If any concerns are raised, we assess them in line with our responsibilities under GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation ] and the Data Protection Act."" The Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC: ""We will not be commenting publicly on every issue raised during the general election. ""We will, however, be closely monitoring how personal data is being used during political campaigning and making sure that all parties and campaigns are aware of their responsibilities.""

'Fat cat smuggler' falls foul of Russian airlineMikhail Galin is stripped of his air miles after sneaking his overweight cat on an Aeroflot flight.Europe,"A cat in a back pack (file image) Russian carrier Aeroflot has stripped a passenger of his air miles for breaching its rules by sneaking his overweight cat aboard a flight. Mikhail Galin, 34, took his cat Viktor on board flight SU1702, from Moscow to Vladivostok, Aeroflot said. Under Aeroflot's rules, pets weighing more than 8kg (17lb) must be placed in the luggage hold. Because Viktor was too heavy for the passenger cabin, Mr Galin devised a cunning plan. He swapped Viktor for a smaller cat during check-in to get around the weight restrictions. Pilot banned from flying after passenger cockpit photo Flight attendant smuggled drugs in 'highly organised' ring 'The world's longest and most spectacular hijacking' The airline said because Mr Galin had broken the rules it had ""taken the decision to take this passenger out of its frequent flyer programme"". ""All of the miles collected during his time in the programme will be annulled,"" the airline said. Mr Galinrevealed how he had sneaked Viktor on board the flight earlier this month in a Facebook post that vent viral,external. In the post, Mr Galin said he had had Viktor with him on a flight from the Latvian capital Riga to Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok, which included a stopover in Moscow. But when he tried to board the second leg of the flight in the Russian capital, Aeroflot staff would not allow him to take Viktor into the passenger cabin. Allow Facebook content?

""The weigh-in showed that the animal had fattened up to 10 kilograms, a level not allowed for the cabin,"" Mr Galin wrote. Unwilling to place the cat in the luggage hold, Mr Galin delayed his flight and took the ""strategic decision to find a similar cat of a lower weight"" in Moscow. A day later Mr Galin returned to the airport with the smaller ""cat double"", which passed the weight limit test at the check-in desk. Mr Galin then gave the smaller cat back to its owners at the airport before boarding the plane to Vladivostok with Viktor. His mistake, it seems, was posting on Facebook about the ""operation to replace the fat cat Viktor"". A picture on his public profile shows Viktor sitting on the plane next to a glass of sparkling wine. The post drew the attention of Aeroflot, prompting it to launch an investigation that confirmed the cat swap on CCTV.

"Johnson vows to end Brexit 'groundhoggery'The UK can't afford to ""squander"" more time, the Tory leader will say in his first big election speech.Election 2019","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our ambition is unlock the whole nation's potential"" Delivering Brexit would help the UK close the ""opportunity gap between rich and poor"", Boris Johnson has said. In his first big speech of the election campaign, he promised to boost regional industry and drive a ""clean energy revolution"" after the UK leaves the EU. He said a future Tory government would double investment in high-tech research and development to Â£18bn. But earlier former Tory David Gauke said Mr Johnson's plan will lead to a ""bad outcome for the country"". And Labour said Mr Johnson's Brexit deal was flawed and another referendum was needed. In other election developments: Boris Johnson is heckled on a visit to flood-hit Stainforthto see the emergency response Jeremy Corbyn rows back on comments that he would not back a Scottish independence referendumin the ""first term"" of a new government Labour ispromising to outspend the Conservatives on the NHSin England The Lib Dems ruleout any electoral pacts with Labour after two of its candidates stand down Former Tory rebelDavid Gauke, who is standing as an independent candidate, says an outright Tory would be a ""bad outcome"" for the UK The SNP is to take legal actionover its exclusion from the ITV head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn The Green Party says it would appointa Carbon Chancellorto oversee its Green New Deal and policy Speaking during a visit to an electric taxi manufacturer near Coventry, the PM set out his vision for post-Brexit Britain, saying his goal was to unite the country and ""level up"" economic performance by boosting the regions. He said the UK must be at the heart of the world's ""green revolution"", harnessing the power of science, innovation and technology to tackle climate change and create high-skilled, high wage jobs. A Tory victory on 12 December would see the UK leave the EU in January, he said, and that would be good for the country's ""politics, economy and psychological health"" after months of paralysis. ""We must get Brexit done because we are democrats,"" he said, saying while Leave voters wanted the result of the 2016 referendum result to be respected, Remain voters also accepted the ""wrangling had to end"". What does 'Get Brexit done,' mean? Will delaying Brexit cost Â£1bn a month? Donald Tusk: Don't give up on stopping Brexit But he departed from excerpts of the speech briefed to the media on Tuesday, leaving out references to Brexit ""groundhoggery"" and claims that calls for another Brexit referendum and a further vote on Scottish independence were a form of ""onanism"", or masturbation. Asked about this at a press conference after the speech, he blamed it on a ""stray draft"" of the speech released to the media. The Tory leader said the UK's economic fundamentals were sound, but he compared the country to a ""cup-winning horse trying to run on three legs"" with huge untapped potential and often ""vastly different"" educational outcomes. ""If every child had the same start and the same encouragement, think of the all untapped talent in this country,"" he said. ""Yet the solution to that inequality is within our grasp... not just to close the opportunity gap between rich and poor but also between the regions of this country."" He promised to make the ""small improvements in life that people are craving"" by addressing transport bottlenecks, improving rural bus services and broadband connections. He also said British apprentices must be employed on all ""big new public sector"" contracts after Brexit. Mr Johnson said the UK must be at the heart of the world's ""green revolution"" To demonstrate his party's support for enterprise, he said a future Tory government would double funding for research and development to Â£18bn in the next Parliament, which would amount to the ""biggest ever increase in support for R&D"". ""We proudly back businesses across this country because they are creating the wealth that actually pays for the NHS and everything else."" A Labour victory, he claimed, would lead to a ""Technicolor coalition"" with the SNP, prolonging the uncertainty for business over Brexit and the future of the UK. The PM is facing claims from a former cabinet colleague that his electionwould lead to a ""very hard Brexit""after Mr Gauke attacked the policy of the Conservatives to not extend the implementation period for Brexit past December 2020. Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Labour has clear and simple Brexit plan - Corbyn The Tories plan to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Union during that time, but have pledged to leave without one if no deal is reached by the deadline. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage cited the pledge as one of the reasons for his decision not to stand candidates in the 317 seats won by the Tories at the last general election, in 2017. This video can not be played David Gauke says a Conservative majority will move the UK towards ""a very hard Brexit"" Mr Gauke said ""one simply cannot renegotiate a trade deal in that time period"", and leaving without a deal would be ""disastrous for the prosperity of our countryâ¦ [making] whole sectors unviable"". But Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, said his former colleague was ""wrong"". Tories in fresh attack on Labour spending plans Flooding an absolute tragedy, says PM 'Stop Brexit' megaphone man to stand for Lib Dems He defended the progress the prime minister has made on Brexit, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""People throughout the summer said that Boris Johnson would not be able to secure a deal with the EU. ""The withdrawal agreement will never be reopened, they said. The backstop is unviable, you won't get it changed. ""They are people who have been left with oeuf on their faces because he succeeded in securing that deal in defiance of the sceptics and the cynics, and we can secure a free trade agreement by the end of 2020."" MPs backed Mr Johnson's Brexit deal in principle before Parliament was dissolved. But they refused to endorse his timetable to rush it through in days, meaning the PM had to abandon his ""do or die"" pledge to take the UK out by the 31 October deadline.

Flood-affected communities to get more help,"This video can not be played The BBC's David Shukman views the scale of the flooding in the Doncaster area from a helicopter Some residents in a flood-stricken village could be out of their homes for up to three weeks as efforts continue to make the area safe. Doncaster Council said 1,900 people had been taken to safety, with the village of Fishlake being one of the worst hit. About 200 Army workers are in South Yorkshire supporting the flood effort. The prime minister visited flood-hit Stainforth to see the emergency response. But some onlookers shouted at him to say ""you took your time"". One resident told Boris Johnson: ""I'm not very happy about talking to you so, if you don't mind, I'll just mope on with what I'm doing."" Mr Johnson said he understood the strength of feeling as ""you cannot underestimate the anguish that a flood causes"". Doncaster flooding: Latest updates Shelley Beniston, who is organising supply runs in Fishlake, told Mr Johnson there had not been enough help from authorities. When the prime minister asked if there was anything he could do to help, she replied: ""I think it's more or less all coming in now, a little bit too late though."" The PM said the government was ""plainly going to have to do more"" to equip places with flood defences. Speaking in Warwickshire on Wednesday evening Mr Johnson added: ""We as a country need to be investing in the long term in flood defences. ""We have already put Â£2.6bn in as a government and we've ensured that places that are particularly vulnerable get more per capita. ""That's why I stress importance of investment in infrastructure"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson got a frosty reception from some residents in South Yorkshire Doncaster Council said every effort was being made to increase pumping so people could return home sooner but more widespread rain is forecast, withwarnings in place for large parts of the country. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: ""Obviously the prospect of any more rainfall is troubling for people in areas where catchments are already full. ""Taking on more rainfall is only going to add to the problems that are already there."" South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said it was monitoring the weather ""closely"" and had ""resources on the ground and on standby if needed"". Assistant chief fire officer Steve Helps advised residents to ""watch the news, monitor the weather forecast and of course to take direction from the police, the emergency services or local authorities"". Contingency plans include additional high volume pumps and boats. Electricity supplier Northern Powergrid said it had brought in additional staff and resources in case of problems. It said it was putting in flood barriers around two electricity substations which power around 15,000 homes and businesses in the Doncaster area. Personnel from the Light Dragoons have laid sandbags in Stainforth, near Doncaster, in a bid to shore up the village's bridge. About 500 homes have been flooded in Doncaster with 1,200 properties evacuated in areas hit by the floods. Hundreds of people in Fishlake have fled their homes after the village was submerged and the fire service has been working to rescue people. The council said the village was not safe and that ""a return to properties is discouraged in the strongest possible terms"". Roads into Fishlake remain closed and the Environment Agency said people should not attempt to enter the area. Soldiers have been helping move sandbags in areas affected by the flooding Doncaster Council said the Environment Agency, along with emergency services, were working hard to make the area safe but ""the latest estimates suggest a safe return could be up to three weeks away for some residents"". Scott Godfrey, landlord of the Hare and Hounds, has been using the pub as a refuge, giving affected residents accommodation and hot food as well as delivering meals to people stranded in their homes. He said they had been let down by the council ""big style"" because it had rowed back on its promise of helping with provisions to send out to villagers. ""We had 45 residents that were stranded who wanted meals. Luckily everyone pulled together and we managed to get some hot meals out,"" he said. The authority said it would now be offering humanitarian aid to those who have remained in Fishlake but added this should not be attempted by residents. Meanwhile, the neighbouring village of Stainforth has been coming to the aid of those evacuated from their homes. Soldiers from Light Dragoons receive a briefing from Doncaster Council On Tuesday, Mr Johnson announced more support for communities affected by flooding following a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. It came amid criticism from Labour and the Liberal Democrats who said he should declare a ""national emergency"". What's life like in a flooded village? What constitutes a 'national emergency'? Have flood and fire services been cut? Mr Johnson said authorities were working ""flat out"" and a request had been made for ""a little bit more help"" from the military in getting sandbags and other defences to some of the affected areas. Jon Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said Mr Johnson's proposals were ""too little too late"". ""You can't trust Boris Johnson to look out for the North or the Midlands or protect our communities from flooding,"" he said. Other measures announced on Tuesday were: Funding for local councils where households and businesses have been affected - equivalent to Â£500 per eligible household Up to Â£2,500 for small and medium-sized businesses which have suffered severe impacts not covered by insurance Flooding wiped out the stock of Re-Read, a social enterprise that gives free books to children Referring to the response for people affected by the flooding, Mr Johnson added: ""I know there will be people who feel that that isn't good enough. ""I know there will be people who are worrying about the damage to their homes, who will be worried about the insurance situation, worried about the losses they face. ""All I want to say to those people is that there are schemes to cover those losses."" Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Miliband spoke to affected residents in the Bentley suburb of Doncaster Many homeowners in South Yorkshire are keeping sandbags at their homes in case the floods return The five severe flood warnings along the River Don in South Yorkshire have been removed, but20 flood warnings,external- meaning ""flooding is expected"" - remain in place. Last week extensive downpours meant several areas were struck by a month's worth of rain in a single day. Baby Indie was born to Dan Greenslade and Jade Croft on Friday A couple who became new parents on Friday and hours later were told their home in Fishlake was underwater, have described the support they have received from local people as ""invaluable"". ""Thank God for the people of Stainforth, and other people around for the support that they've shown,"" said Dan Greenslade. Meanwhile, a Doncaster salon offered free ""pamper"" sessions for local children affected by flooding, and dozens of swans were rescued from oil from an upturned barge in Rotherham and cars which had been trapped in flood water. Churches and community centres have collected toiletries, clothes, cleaning products and food for the hundreds of people displaced from their homes. Is there such a thing as a 'national emergency'?

Why insurance does not always cover damage,"Pam Webb has been left with damage to her home and business As a business owner, it is the worst kind of double-whammy - first flood waters pour through the premises, and then the insurance does not cover the cost of starting over again. Pam Webb told the BBC that her spa in Fishlake, near Doncaster, was once covered for such a situation, but not anymore. ""I feel really selfish in saying this, and I hope that other people aren't in this boat, but I've lost my home and my business and my livelihood that I've worked so hard for,"" she said. ""And the girls who worked for me, or worked with me, it's their livelihoods as well."" She has been looking for solace, but can find none, she said. Mrs Webb lives above her business - and so cases such as hers are quite rare. Most residents are covered for flood damage as a standard part of their home insurance policy, with the back up of a relatively new scheme to protect those in flood risk areas. This scheme, known as Flood Re, does not cover businesses in the same way. That makes this a complex area of finance, as is often the case with insurance. The result of the latest flooding in Fishlake and other areas of England has been more questions over protection and financial cover against flooding. Far from it. There have been a series of major floods to hit the UK in fairly recent years. Repeat flooding left many homeowners unable to insure their homes, or facing large, unaffordable premiums as the risk in those areas was so high. As a result, the Flood Re system was introduced in 2016 - when it was estimated some 350,000 homes would benefit. This means insurance companies should offer lower premiums than was previously the case to these householders, as the flood risk element of policies can be passed on to the reinsurer Flood Re. Many homes affected by the latest flooding would have been protected as a result. Community rallies to help flood-hit villagers In pictures: Rain floods parts of northern England How do you stop flooding? Householders who are eligible also see their policy excesses - the amount they have to pay towards a claim - capped at Â£250. Previously, some people had to pay several thousand pounds towards repairs. All this should happen behind the scenes, so householders in these high-risk areas should be able to buy home and contents insurance just like everyone else. There isa register,externalto show which areas are covered. It is paid for via a Â£180m-a-year levy from insurance companies - which regular policyholders effectively pay for through slightly higher premiums. So, most households will be covered for flood damage as standard, assuming they buy insurance in the first place, although not every insurer is signed up to the Flood Re scheme. ""Home buildings and contents policies cover flood and storm damage. If your home is uninhabitable while repairs are being carried out, your insurer will arrange for and pay the cost of any alternative temporary accommodation you may need,"" said Malcolm Tarling of the Association of British Insurers (ABI). Vehicles with comprehensive motor insurance should also be covered for flood damage. It does not for thousands of businesses, as commercial property is not covered by the Flood Re scheme. This, it seems, is part of the reason why Mrs Webb's premises - which included her home upstairs - was not covered. Brian Brown, of Defaqto - an information company which analyses insurance industry data, said that most businesses would be covered for flood damage unless they were in a high-risk area. In those areas, insurance policies might exclude flood damage, and require businesses to pay extra for the cover. Alternatively, the policies may include flood damage, but have a high excess. He suggested that those facing high insurance bills owing to their location should use a broker to find a policy that was affordable and appropriate. Fishlake is one of a number of areas hit by the flooding Businesses are not the only exclusions from the Flood Re scheme. Homes built since 2009 are not eligible. The idea is that the scheme does not want to encourage housebuilders to construct homes in high flood-risk areas, knowing they would be backed up by Flood Re. Recent, stricter building regulations should also reduce the risk. There areclear instructions,externalfor those affected by flooding. Insurance companies send representatives to areas that are affected. In general, the advice is not to throw damaged property away, to keep receipts for any emergency repairs, and not to be in a rush to redecorate as drying out can take many months. The ABI said the insurers would advise customers on these issues. Businesses should reduce potential damage by putting stock up high and use tiles on the floor - which could mean cheaper premiums through a broker. There is also a wider consideration for those buying home and contents insurance in areas that might not be at risk of flooding but which could be affected by the weather. Defaqto has found, for example, that only 21% of home contents insurance policies and 24% of home buildings policies include cover for home emergencies, such as boiler breakdown, as standard. So a sudden dip in temperature can lead to a big bill for a replacement boiler. Extra cover may be more expensive, so householders have to weigh up which is the best financial option for them.

Where are the seats that could turn the election?,"There are 650 constituencies in the UK but most of the campaigning for the general election will take place in a smaller number. As ever, much of the focus will be on marginal constituencies - places where the winning majority in 2017 was small. However, at this election the parties will also be targeting a large number of constituencies beyond the marginal seats. There will be a lot of focus on areas that voted strongly to Leave or strongly to Remain in the EU referendum - even where the majorities are large. Big swings cannot be ruled out. A striking aspect of the2017 general electionwas that the result in lots of constituencies was very close. The normal working definition for a marginal seat is one where the majority is under 10%, which usually means under about 5,000 votes - although that does depend on turnout and the size of the constituency. Then, within that group of seats, there are the ultra-marginals: places where the majority is under 2% - about 1,000 votes. In 2017 there were 51 of these ultra-marginals - considerably more than in previous elections. In fact there were eight seats with a majority under 50. All those will be hotly contested. The Conservatives will be hoping to win back some of the seats they lost last time - likeCanterbury,external,Keighley,externalandKensington,external- while Labour will try to take seats where it got within a whisker - such asArfon,external,Pudsey,externalandSouthampton Itchen,external. And the Lib Dems will hope to win seats they've previously held likeRichmond Park,external,St Ives,externalandSheffield Hallam,external. In Scotland there are 46 marginal seats, using the 10% definition, out of a total of 59. So almost all the constituencies are potentially in play. Of particular interest will be the 21 seats lost by the SNP in 2017. Nearly all voted Remain in the EU referendum so the SNP hopes its anti-Brexit stance will help it to recapture as many of them as possible. In many cases it would only take a small shift - places likeStirling,externalandGordon,external, held by the Conservatives, andRutherglen & Hamilton West,externalandMidlothian,external, both held by Labour. Another seat to keep an eye on is Fife North East. It's the most marginal constituency in the whole country with an SNP majority over the Liberal Democrats of just two votes. In fact, that's the smallest majority in any seat this century. It's not just Scotland where Brexit will influence which seats are targeted. Strongly Leave and strongly Remain areas are likely to be crucial. The Conservatives are hoping to capture longstanding Labour constituencies that voted heavily to Leave - even those outside the normal marginal range. The map shows that these are concentrated in the Midlands and parts of the north of England - seats likeWest Bromwich West,external,Bolsover,external, andHyndburn,external. However, the Brexit Party has a similar goal. It describesHartlepool,externalas its number one target. On the other hand, the Liberal Democrats are targeting heavily-Remain seats, mostly in the south of England, even though some have quite big majorities. Places likeSt Albans,external,Winchester,external, andCambridge,external. Another feature of the Brexit battle at this election is the agreement made by the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party to stand aside for one another in 60 seats across England and Wales. It's impossible to know whether this will affect who wins any of the constituencies but it should give a boost to Plaid in places likeLlanelli,externalandYnys Mon,externaland to the Lib Dems in seats includingHazel Grove,externalandThornbury & Yate,external. Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid agree election pact Brexit Party will not stand in Tory seats Corbyn rules out election pacts with rival parties What is tactical voting? Where parties choose to put up candidates could have a bigger impact in Northern Ireland than anywhere else. InBelfast South,external, for example, Sinn Fein is standing aside in favour of the SDLP to increase its chances of ousting the DUP. The SDLP will return the favour in Belfast North. Meanwhile inFermanagh & South Tyrone,externalthe DUP will stand aside to assist the UUP, as it did in 2017. Another seat to keep an eye on isFoyle,externalwhere it's a different story. It's the most marginal constituency in Northern Ireland and was a Sinn Fein gain from the SDLP last time. One of the features of recent general elections has been Labour's increasing dominance in London. As a region it used to be fairly representative of the whole country, politically speaking, but over time that has changed. In 2017 Labour won 49 of the 73 seats across the city. There's also evidence that the effect has started to spill out from central London to the outskirts and to constituencies in the surrounding areas. That seems to be linked to an increase in the number of people leaving London - especially those in their 30s and 40s. Labour will be hoping that this demographic change could help it in seats likeChingford & Woodford Green,external,Crawley,external, andMilton Keynes South,external- all popular destinations for people leaving London.

MP convicted over expenses to stand for Tories,"Chris Davies had been an MP since 2015 but was unseated by a petition after admitting submitting two false expenses invoices A former MP who lost his seat following a conviction for a false expenses claim has quit the general election after briefly becoming the Conservative candidate for Ynys Mon. Chris Davies pulled out after other Welsh Tories criticised his selection. ""I will not want to put my wife and family through any more distress,"" the former Brecon and Radnorshire MP said. A senior Welsh Conservative source told the BBC the campaign had been ""shaky to say the least"". ""The candidate selection has been seriously flawed and chaotic,"" the source added. Another claimed a Conservative AM had been approached to stand in Ynys Mon on Wednesday - the approach was rejected. Brecon and Radnorshire by-elections past By-election loss for Tories cut majority Tory MP pleads guilty to false expenses claim Announcing his decision to withdraw from the election, Mr Davies said: ""Given the reaction in the media to the idea of me being a candidate, I have decided to pull out of the selection process."" Conservative AM Nick Ramsay said Mr Davies had ""done the right thing"". ""As John Major once said, when the curtain falls, it's time to leave the stage,"" he tweeted. It leaves Ynys Mon without a Tory candidate, with the deadline for candidate selection on Thursday. Mr Davies lost a by-election in Brecon and Radnorshire triggered by a recall petition earlier this year. Headmitted two charges of a false expenses claim in Marchat Westminster Magistrates' Court after trying to split the cost of Â£700 worth of pictures between two office budgets by creating fake invoices, when he could have claimed the amount by other means. Mr Davies made an ""unreserved apology"" and was ordered to complete 50 hours of unpaid work and was fined Â£1,500. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

News of his selection for Ynys Mon broke on Tuesday night, prompting incredulity from Angela Burns, Welsh Conservative AM for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire. Claiming Mr Davies had been imposed by the party, she said: ""You couldn't make it up."" ""It is inexplicable,"" another Welsh Conservative source said. Mr Davies had tried and failed to win selection as the general election candidate in Brecon and Radnorshire again before the Ynys Mon selection was made. Chris Davies apologised after his conviction But Mr Davies withdrew after he realised he would not be able to command support on Anglesey, the source claimed. One Conservative told BBC Wales there was a ""feeling within the party that Chris Davies had paid the penalty and deserved another try"". However there had been ""huge resistance"" from within the party locally and that is why Mr Davies had withdrawn, the source added, realising he would not be able to command support in Anglesey. The local party were only made aware of his selection on Tuesday, the source said. Lord Davies of Gower, Welsh Conservative chairman, had defended the selection before Mr Davies quit, saying: ""Chris made a mistake and has paid the price. He must now be allowed to move on."" The constituency of Ynys Mon includes the island of Anglesey and the smaller Holy Island. The Conservatives held the seat - previously known as Anglesey - between 1979 and 1987, followed by Plaid Cymru until 2001, and since then by Labour. Labour has selected Mary Roberts for the 12 December poll, while Plaid Cymru has picked Aled ap Dafydd. The Brexit Party intends to stand Helen Jenner. Ms Roberts said: ""Chris Davies has rightly withdrawn. The Welsh Conservatives are in complete disarray."" Plaid's candidate said: ""For the Tories to consider that he was suitable in the first place shows how out of touch they are."" Deputy leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Baroness Christine Humphreys said the Conservatives had ""demonstrated their utter contempt"" for Ynys Mon voters. The summer by-election cut the Conservative working majority to just one when Jane Dodds overturned Mr Davies's 8,038 majority to beat Conservative Chris Davies by 1,425 votes.

Primark guard preyed on shoplifting teenage girlsZia Uddin attacked four 15-year-old girls at the Kingston Primark store in 2017.London,"Zia Uddin kept condoms in the control room where he sexually assaulted the girls A Primark security guard has been found guilty of sexually assaulting teenage girls he accused of shoplifting. Zia Uddin, 27, from east London, attacked four 15-year-old girls while working at the Kingston store in 2017. Uddin threatened the teenagers with calling the police and their parents if they did not perform sexual acts on him in the control room of the store. He was convicted of one count of rape and four counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Kingston Crown Court heard Uddin's colleagues had noticed his strange behaviour, which included making requests to delete CCTV, and not properly completing paperwork on shoplifting. He was also known to keep condoms in the control room, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Once detained, some victims offered to pay for the items they had stolen, suggested they could work in the store to make amends, or even never enter the shop again. Zia Uddin knew where the ""blind spots"" were on the Kingston branch's CCTV However, once alone in the back office, Uddin, from Manor Park in Newham, made clear he was only interested in sexual acts in exchange for letting them go. Prosecutors said one girl only did as he asked because ""there was no other choice"" and it was the only way out of the situation. Graham Partridge, from the CPS, said Uddin ""preyed on young girls in a vulnerable situation"". ""He abused his authority by telling them to perform sexual acts for him on the promise they would then be released without their parents or the police being informed about what they had done. ""Having worked in security, Uddin was also well aware of the CCTV camera 'blind spots' and took advantage of these in order to carry out his offending."" He added that Uddin claimed all the victims were liars and refused to take responsibility for his actions. Uddin will be sentenced next Tuesday. A spokeswoman for Primark said: ""This has been a horrendous ordeal for the victims and their families and we are truly sorry for what they have suffered. Our thoughts are very much with them. ""The nature of these offences is shocking and distressing. ""Zia Uddin abused the trust that was placed in him by his employer, Brooknight Security, and by us, by taking advantage of his victims, who were young and vulnerable.""

"'Little sign of change' for women in top rolesMore women are needed in senior roles, although board membership is making progress, a review finds.Business","There is ""little sign of change"" in women being under-represented in top jobs in business, a government-backed review has found. In the FTSE 350, only 25 women are in chair roles, with fewer chief executives, the Hampton-Alexander Review said. It called for a ""stronger focus"" to address the imbalance. However, FTSE 100 companies are on target for women to make up at least a third of boards by the end of 2020. This year has been the ""strongest year of progress"" for board representation since the review was set up in 2011, said Denise Wilson White, the chief executive of the review. More than 900 women are now on FTSE 350 boards. The review has set targets for women to make up at least a third of boards and a third of senior leadership positions by the end of 2020. Ms White told the BBC's Today programme that the FTSE 250 had had its ""strongest year ever"" and was on course to hit that target. In the FTSE 350 as a whole since 2011, ""we've gone from 152 all-male boards down to only two today,"" she said. However, she added that more progress needed to be made in female representation in top leadership positions, which she described as ""the 50 to 80 most senior jobs in any company"". She said there was ""no shortage"" of capable and competent women able to fill those roles, but problems in company systems meant they were ""just not getting picked in the same numbers"". The chair of the review, Sir Philip Hampton, said: ""Strengthening the number of women in executive positions is critical to achieving long-term gender balance. ""We are still a long way from reaching the target for women in senior leadership roles below board level. Unless half of all appointments made this year go to women - our target for 2020 is not going to be met."" Two FTSE 250 firms - property firm Daejan Holdings and software firm Kainos Group - have all male boards, the review said. Daejan Holdings secretary Mark Jenner said the company's position was that the aims of the review were not legally binding and Daejan was under no obligation to comply with them. In addition, he said board positions were filled on merit and there were no current vacancies. The review also found that 39 firms have only appointed one woman to the board, which it called a ""one and done"" approach. These include Domino's Pizza and a number of investment trusts. Millennial men demand better parental leave Gender pay gap progress dismally slow, says charity Companies with more than 40% female board membership include Standard Life Aberdeen, Schroders and Royal Bank of Scotland, while those with 25% or fewer women on the board include National Grid and Rio Tinto. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said: ""Investors have been consistent in their demands for greater diversity. ""It's not just a nice to have. The research is clear: firms with diverse boards and management teams make better decisions, drive innovation and outperform their less diverse peers."" Industry body the CBI said businesses were ""building on last year's progress and continuing to increase diversity in the boardroom"". Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, said: ""The benefits of a diverse boardroom have been proven many times, from improved decision making to increased profits. If all male boards are to become a thing of the past, firms must not take their foot off the pedal."" However, she added that firms were ""making less progress on the executive pipeline"". ""We are still seeing too few women in senior leadership positions, whether as chief executive or running divisions. ""Heading into 2020, all firms should ensure they have diverse shortlists and that they're doing everything possible to support people from all walks of life in their careers, from ground floor to boardroom."" The Hampton-Alexander Review is supported by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Government Equalities Office. Accountancy and auditing firm KPMG is its main financial sponsor. Melanie Richards, deputy chair at KPMG UK, said: ""Behind the numbers and trends are hundreds of individual stories. ""Women who have overcome barriers that they should not have had to overcome, with leaders and boards who have worked hard to remove those barriers for current and future generations.""
