Trump rages at Clinton and Russia inquiry,"US President Donald Trump has launched a Twitter tirade about the ""guilt"" of Hillary Clinton and the opposition Democratic Party. His Sunday morning outburst came amid reports that the first arrest in the Russian collusion inquiry would be made this week, possibly as early as Monday. Mr Trump insisted allegations of collusion between his campaign and Russia were ""phony"" and a ""witch hunt"". He said Republicans were united behind him, before urging: ""DO SOMETHING!"" Media reports say the first charges have been filed in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election to assist Mr Trump. It is not clear what the charges are and whom they are targeting, CNN and Reuters report, quoting unnamed sources. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US intelligence agencies have already concluded that the Russian government sought to help Mr Trump win the election. Mr Mueller's investigation is looking into any links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Both deny there was any collusion. His team is known to have conducted extensive interviews with several current and former White House officials. Mueller was appointed special counsel after Trump fired FBI director James Comey Mr Mueller, a former FBI director, was appointed by the department of justice as special counsel in May shortly after Mr Trump fired FBI director James Comey. Mr Trump said on Friday that it was now ""commonly agreed"" that there was no collusion between him and Russia but said that there were links between Moscow and Mrs Clinton. Republican lawmakers have said that a uranium deal with a Russian company in 2010, when Mrs Clinton was secretary of state, was sealed in exchange for donations to her husband's charity. A Congressional investigation has been opened into the case. Democrats say it is an attempt to divert attention from the alleged ties between Russia and Mr Trump.

Lynx escapes from animal park,"This video can not be played Lynx at Borth Wild Animal Kingdom similar to the one that has gone missing A lynx has escaped from a wildlife park in Ceredigion. The Eurasian lynx, which is about twice the size of a domestic cat, escaped from Borth Wild Animal Kingdom, near Aberystwyth. Police said they have been told the animal went missing some time during the last five days. Park operators said there has never been an attack recorded on people - but warned the public it could retaliate ""if cornered or trapped"". Staff said the lynx should not be approached if spotted - as it is a wild animal and has sharp teeth and claws. ""We have fully-trained keepers on hand to deal with the situation,"" said a park official. ""She is not used to hunting live prey but will chase rabbits and rodents when she gets hungry. ""Lynx can travel about 12 miles a day, but the chances are she hasn't gone far. ""We will be putting out camera traps around the perimeter of the zoo and relying on sightings by the public. Once we learn her location and follow her trail pattern we can set up monitored traps to catch her."" The wild cat is described as being tan and white in colour with dark spots on her back and legs, with a thick, stubby tail which is no more than six inches long. The Eurasian lynx The lynx is one of a number kept at the animalarium in Borth If the animal is seen, people are asked to contact the zoo park directly or the police. Dyfed-Powys Police said the public in the area should be ""alert and vigilant"". ""The lynx is unlikely to approach people, but may attempt to take livestock or pets as food,"" said a force spokeswoman. ""We do however advise that the animal should not be approached as it could become aggressive if cornered. ""It is believed that the lynx remains in fairly close proximity to the Animalarium, but of course it could potentially go further afield.""

Kim Jong-un visits cosmetics factory,"Mr Kim was seen inspecting make-up products and hairspray North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has visited a cosmetics factory in Pyongyang, accompanied by his wife Ri Sol-ju and sister Kim Yo-jong. State media released undated photos of the visit on Sunday. Both women are rarely seen in public. Ms Kim's appearance comes shortly after herrecent promotionto a powerful position in North Korea's government. Foreign luxury goods including make-up have become scarce in North Korea after several rounds of UN sanctions. Keeping up with the Kims: North Korea's first family Who is Kim Jong-un's sister? Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea Over the years many countries have stopped importing luxury goods into North Korea as a result of sanctions. North Korea appears to havedeveloped its own cosmetics industry,,externalwith reports of local ""high-end"" brands such as Bomhyanggi and Unhasu becoming popular with consumers. Ms Ri, seen here on the right wearing a black and white dress, was featured in several pictures Though he is better known for his photo ops at military installations and missile test sites, Mr Kim's visit to a cosmetics factory serves an important propaganda purpose in telegraphing the legitimacy of Mr Kim's rule to the Pyongyang elite and middle-class. He has frequently been photographed at factories and other key sites of North Korea's civilian economy, while state media have claimed significant advances in the production of consumer goods such as 3D televisions and smartphones. The visit is ""to show that North Korea can look out for its own people, and provide prosperity on a level comparable to Beijing and Seoul,""  North Korean analyst Ankit Panda told the BBC. ""Even if we know it's not true, it's important for the regime to show its people that it can provide material pleasures."" During his visit to the Pyongyang Cosmetics Factory, Mr Kim praised the company for producing ""world-level cosmetics"" and for upgrading its premises to a level ""to be proud of in the world"", reported North Korean state news agency KCNA. Wearing a stylish black and white dress, Ms Ri is prominently featured in the photographs. Ms Kim meanwhile cannot be identified in the photographs, but the report by state news agency KCNA mentioned she was present along with other top officials. Little is known of Mr Kim's family and personal life, and family members rarely appear in public. Mr Kim's public appearances are also highly choreographed. Though the visit mentioned Ms Kim was present, she was hardly seen in the photographs Mr Panda told the BBC that it was significant that he chose to appear with his wife and sister this time. ""It emphasises the primacy of the family, that blood ties are important to him, that his children will succeed him,"" said Mr Panda. Given her recent promotion, Ms Kim's presence also ""signals that the Kim regime wants the world to see that she's in a more visible powerful position"". Earlier this month Mr Kim placed his sister in the country's top decision-making body, the Politburo. Mr Kim was reportedly pleased with the factory's products and recent upgrade Mr Kim's visit comes amid rising tension in the Korean peninsula over a series of North Korean missile and nuclear tests and escalating rhetoric between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump - who is due to visit South Korea's capital Seoul in about a week's time. The North Korean leader's visit was broadcast on state media a day after US Defence Secretary James Mattis said the US would ""never accept"" a nuclear-armed North Korea. Mr Mattis, who was on a tour of Asia and was visiting Seoul on Saturday, reiterated the US stance that any use of nuclear weapons by North Korea would be met with a ""massive military response"".

Have Halloween costume bans gone too far?,"Shopping for Halloween Canadian schools are wrestling with how to guide students and parents towards Halloween costumes that aren't considered offensive or culturally insensitive. In early October, a Canadian school board emailed a checklist ""Is my costume appropriate?"" to parents planning their children's Halloween costumes. Fuschia Martians, mythical creatures, and animals got the all clear. On the what not to wear list for 31 October -cowboy and Indiancostumes,slaves,terrorist,gypsy,Rastafarianand ""urban ghettoresident"". The checklist from the Conseil scolaire Viamonde, which oversees 51 schools in Ontario, was criticised as an example of political correctness gone haywire. But school board spokeswoman Claire Francoeur said the guidelines, first sent out in 2016, has generally garnered positive reactions from parents. She says complaints mostly stemmed from stressed parents frustrated at ""having another thing to think about"" or who had hoped to recycle old costumes that failed the checklist. Halloween traditions around the world Canadian town bans teens from trick-or-treating The board believes strongly in its values of ""respect for each other"" and that includes Halloween, Francoeur says. ""We live in a society that has changed a lot in the past 10, 15 years,"" she says. ""So this is another change."" Educators are trying to navigate the holiday where costumes must be neither too gory nor too scary, as well as age-appropriate and culturally sensitive. In Winnipeg,a primary school became so bogged down,externalin debate it scrapped Halloween altogether. The date 31 October is now being celebrated as ""tie and scarf"" day, one of four themed costume days the school settled on instead of celebrating Halloween. Examples of Ohio Universityâs Students Teaching About Racism in Society costume campaign In 2011, Ohio University launched the ""We're a Culture Not a Costume"" campaign. Similar campaigns have subsequently been adopted across North America, including by Canadian universities and primary and secondary schools. Costumes have become a fraught issue on Canadian university campuses too. 'Anne Frank' costume sparks controversy 'Psychotic nympho' outfit criticised Student unions have taken steps to avoid controversies like the 2014 one at Ontario's Brock University, where white students dressed in blackface as a Jamaican bobsleigh team and won a prize for a get-up decried as racist. Brock University's student union now vets the costumes of people attending their annual Halloween party and refuses entry to participants who don't to comply with costume rules. The no-no list includes:black face, traditional orreligious head dresses,geishacostumes, andDay of the Deadmakeup. Last November, Queen's University said it would investigate after photos of students at a party dressed asBuddhist monks,Middle East sheiksandVietcongwas published online, sparking controversy. At Waterloo University, the student union has launched an ""I am not your costume"" social media campaign. ""Making someone else's culture and/or identity a caricature for you to wear for one night is a terrible costume idea,"" the group says on its website. But not everyone thinks dressing up as someone not of your culture or race is automatically problematic. A family shops for Halloween costumes Ottawa writer Kate Jaimetwrote an op-ed for the Toronto Star,external- provocatively titled ""The Halloween ethno-police frighten me"" - after her four-year-old daughter was told she couldn't dress as a ""Native princess"". ""The message my daughter got was that she could not pretend - could not even imagine herself - to be a Native person,"" Jaimet wrote. Jaimet says she heard from some indigenous readers who explained to her why they felt the costume was inappropriate, ""I've realised that a child's Halloween costume is not a hill to die on and that if agreeing that non-indigenous people shouldn't dress up as indigenous people for Halloween is part of what it takes to have better race relations in this country, then I can accept that,"" she told the BBC. ""But I don't think that we should generalise that to saying that no child should wear a costume from any different culture, or that no artist should represent different cultures in their work, or that no one should incorporate the traditions or wisdom of other cultures into their lives."" Jaimet's daughter eventually dressed as an angel. At Conseil scolaire Viamonde, students who show up in costumes that are ""subject of discussion"" aren't sent home. Instead, they're used to start in-class conversations. Schools and boards across Canada have since reached out to Viamonde asking for copies of the checklist. ""For people who say we're alone in this - I don't think so,"" says Francoeur. Wesleyan University in Connecticut posted a flier advising students to avoid costumes with dreads, afros or anything that might ""trivialise human suffering, oppression, and marginalisation"" A white student was expelled from a fraternity at the University of Central Arkansas for wearing blackface At Texas's Baylor University, students dressed up as maids and construction workers for a Mexican-themed ""Cinqo de Drinko"" fraternity party. The whole fraternity was suspended In 2005,  Prince Harry dressed up as a Nazi for a fancy-dress party and later apologised Additional reporting by Robin Levinson-King Canadian town bans teens from trick-or-treating Halloween display sparks 911 calls 'Anne Frank' costume sparks controversy At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Huge Barcelona rally for Spanish unity,"This video can not be played Barcelona rally demonstrator: 'I feel forgotten by Catalan government' Hundreds of thousands have attended a rally for Spanish unity in Barcelona after Catalonia was stripped of its autonomy for declaring independence. Many urged the jailing of sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont. Mr Puigdemont was dismissed as Spain's central government took control of Catalan institutions. Spain's foreign minister has said that he could run for re-election in December - if he has not been imprisoned by then. Alfonso Dastis's comments come as Spain's chief prosecutor prepares to file criminal charges against the pro-independence leader, who has said he does not recognise the order from Madrid removing him from power. Meanwhile, in an open letter, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has urged the Catalan regional police force to accept temporary direction from Madrid. Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since a referendum, organised by Mr Puigdemont's separatist government, was held earlier this month in defiance of a ruling by the Constitutional Court which had declared it illegal. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. Police said at least 300,000 people had turned out in Barcelona, Catalonia's largest city, for the pro-unity rally. Organisers and the government in Madrid put the turnout at more than a million people. Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain? Veteran Catalan politician Josep Borrell, a former president of the European Parliament, told demonstrators: ""Mr Puigdemont may speak on behalf of some of the Catalan people, but I am also Catalan, I am also part of the Catalan people, and I do not recognise his right to speak in my name."" Among the demonstrators was Marina Fernandez, a 19-year-old student, who said she was unhappy with the actions taken by the Catalan authorities. ""I am enraged about what they are doing to the country that my grandparents built,"" she told the AFP news agency. Another protester, Maria Lopez, told Reuters news agency: ""What do we want? That they don't break us up. They are shameless, shameless, and Mr Puigdemont needs to be taken to prison."" Pro-Spain protesters gathered at the Gaudi-designed Casa Batllo in Barcelona The deputy president of the deposed Catalan government, Oriol Junqueras, has condemned Madrid's actions. ""The president of the country is and will remain Carles Puigdemont,"" he wrote in Catalan newspaper El Punt Avui. ""We cannot recognise the coup d'etat against Catalonia, nor any of the anti-democratic decisions that the PP [Spain's ruling Popular Party] is adopting by remote control from Madrid."" By Gavin Lee, BBC News, Barcelona Many of them waved Spanish flags and chanted ""Viva Espana"" and ""The streets are for everyone"" as they marched through Barcelona in support of Spanish unity and against Catalonia's unilateral declaration of independence. Catalonia's main opposition party said the region's ""silenced majority"" was now speaking. The atmosphere was peaceful, as police helicopters monitored from above. Several off-duty police officers who had joined the protest told the BBC they felt there was deep division in their ranks, and were worried what could come next if their separatist colleagues refused to take orders from Madrid. The key issue is what happens to Carles Puigdemont, who is still calling himself the Catalan president - despite having been removed from office by the Spanish government, along with his cabinet and more than 100 officials. His job, in all but title, has been transferred to Spain's deputy prime minister until elections in December. Independence supporters are being urged to resist any attempt by Madrid to forcefully remove the separatist leaders. Friday saw the regional parliament declare independence, with Madrid responding by declaring the move illegal. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy then announced the dissolution of the regional parliament and the removal of Mr Puigdemont as Catalan leader, and ordered that fresh elections should be held on 21 December. Mr Puigdemont has urged ""democratic opposition"" to direct rule from Madrid, which has said it would welcome his participation in the election. What powers has Catalonia now lost? The case for and against independence This video can not be played Flags in Catalonia and what they mean On Sunday, Belgium's Migration Minister Theo Francken told local TV the separatist leader could be given asylum protection which Spain would find difficult to reverse. ""If you see the situation at the moment, the prison sentences and the repression from Madrid and the prison sentences that are bandied about... the question is obviously whether somebody like that has the chance of a fair trial,"" he told Reuters. There is no suggestion that Mr Puigdemont is seeking to leave Catalonia. He had been expected to attend a football match in Girona, the heartland of the pro-independence movement, which saw the local team beat Real Madrid - who Mr Rajoy supports - by 2-1. But he apparently did not make an appearance. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Reality Check: Police violence in Catalonia A poll published by Spanish national newspaper El Pais on Saturday suggested a small majority of Catalans (52% to 43%) were in favour of the dissolution of the regional parliament and the holding of elections. Fifty-five per cent of Catalan respondents opposed the declaration of independence, with 41% in favour. Before Madrid took over the Catalan government, the region had one of the greatest levels of self-government in Spain. It has its own parliament, police force and public broadcaster, as well as a government and president, though those have now been dismissed. Catalans had a range of powers in many policy areas,externalfrom culture and environment to communications, transportation, commerce and public safety.

Ex-Monarch owner 'wants to repay costs',"The former owner of the collapsed airline Monarch says it has a ""moral obligation"" to help repay the taxpayer if it profits from the sale of assets. The government spent Â£60m getting passengers home after the UK's fifth biggest airline went bust. Now, Greybull Capital has pledged in a letter to the Transport Committee that it would help ""defray the costs"". But it is unclear if any profit will be made, as much depends on the future of Monarch's lucrative airport slots. Monarch's administrators, KPMG, are seeking clarification in court about whether or not they have the right to sell the take-off and landing rights. As Monarch's main secured creditor, Greybull - run by brothers Marc and Nathaniel Meyohas and Richard Perlhagen - has first call on any cash realised from asset sales. In a statement on Sunday, Greybull said: ""We concur wholeheartedly with the secretary of state's recent statement that any stakeholder who finds themselves in-pocket at the end of the administration process would be under a moral obligation to contribute to other stakeholders. ""This would include helping to defray the costs incurred by the Department for Transport in repatriating Monarch customers. ""This was first discussed in principle with the secretary of state and his department several weeks ago. We also agree with the secretary of state that it is premature to prejudge the outcome of the administration."" Greybull's letter to the committee, sent on 24 October and signed by Mr Meyohas, underlined the private equity firm's commitment to ""profit sharing with stakeholders"". This video can not be played Final Monarch planes leave their base at London Luton Airport This is why the firm felt a moral obligation to help foot the bill for the repatriation from any profits, Greybull said. About 110,000 passengers were on holiday and booked to fly home when Monarch ceased trading at the start of October. The Civil Aviation Authority described efforts to return passengers to the UK as ""the biggest peacetime repatriation effort"". In addition,more than 2,000 people lost their jobs, with many still struggling to find work. The job of selling Monarch's assets and returning any money to creditors and investors is in the hands of KPMG. The administrators maintain they have the right to sell the airport slots, reportedly worth about Â£60m, and have gone to court to establish this right. ""Given the complexity of the slot exchange process, we are seeking a judicial review on this particular matter,"" Blair Nimmo, partner at KPMG, said in a statement on Friday. Airport slots are assigned to airlines twice each year by Airport Coordination Limited. Slots can also be taken on by an airline in the event of a takeover. In its letter to MPs, Greybull repeated its regret over the airline's collapse. ""We have acted responsibly and been a highly supportive shareholder of Monarch since 2014. ""We remain deeply sorry and saddened that circumstances beyond its control led to the failure of Monarch despite the best efforts of so many to turn around the company and the significant capital provided by Greybull to rescue Monarch from bankruptcy since 2014.""

22 things you need to know about Blue Planet II,"A year after the epic Planet Earth II, Sir David Attenborough is returning to our screens with a follow-up to 2001's Blue Planet. No spoilers, but we've seen the first episode and as sequels go we can confirm it's better than Sex And The City 2. We've also been to the press conference and spoken to some of the team behind the new series. Here are 22 things you need to know about Blue Planet II - complete with behind-the-boat info and what you can expect from the first episode. 1. Five babies were born to crew members in the time it took to film. Blue Planet II involved ""125 shoots, 6,000 hours filming underwater and 1,000 hours filming in submersibles"", explains production manager Katie Hall. But away from the shoots, she adds, it was also a busy time for the crew: ""We had three weddings. Four houses were bought. Five babies. Two babies on the way. ""That's what happens when you're filming for four years."" 2. ""Oceans cover 70% of the surface of our planet, and yet they are still the least explored,"" says Sir David Attenborough in the opening sequence. ""Hidden beneath the waves, there are creatures beyond our imagination,"" he continues. Roughly translated, we think he's saying: ""Look, I know you might have seen Finding Dory multiple times but this is the real deal."" 3. Hans Zimmer is doing the music again. It's bad news for Fifth Harmony fans as the soundtrack has already been sorted by composer and general legend Hans Zimmer. ""We actually put the music out to tender, we weren't sure who we wanted to do it,"" explains executive producer James Honeyborne. ""And although we loved Planet Earth II [which Zimmer also did the soundtrack for] we wanted to keep this feeling fresh. ""But Hans came to us with such an impassioned pitch as to why he wanted to do it, which was incredible."" 4. There will be seven episodes in the series. And they're split into different habitats - like deep ocean, the coral reefs, the open ocean and the coastlines. ""Once you start dividing those up, you start to see where some of the stories would naturally fit,"" says James. 5. We wouldn't fancy filling out the risk assessment form for this show. ""When we green light each shoot, we're constantly mitigating risk,"" says Katie. ""But bar a couple of earaches, a little bit of water at the bottom of a submersible, and one cameraman stubbed his finger, we were extraordinarily lucky. ""But the planning that goes into every single shoot, and managing the risk - whether that's financial risk or health and safety - you don't see any of that."" Shame. 6. There's some serious drama in the opening episode. Spoiler alert etc, etc. In the opening episode, we meet some birds. Who sometimes like to fly down to the ocean and chill out a bit on the surface. Unfortunately for them, there's some rather hungry giant trevallies (ie big scary fish) lurking under the water. And they have a particular taste for birds. We won't give much more away, but it's safe to say you're about to see somesnakes and iguanas-level dramago down. 7. Fish are Facebook-friendly. The trailer for the new series has already built up 43 million viewson social media,external. Which is all part of a new digital strategy this year, according to Tom McDonald, who is (deep breath) head of commissioning at the BBC's Natural History and Specialist Factual unit. ""One of the interesting things about Planet Earth II was that more people watched itthan the X Factorresults show when they were up against each other last year,"" he says. ""So if there is a younger audience out there that is going to consume natural history content, we should focus our digital strategy on them, which is what we've done this year."" 8. New technology was built to film the series. ""We built a huge piece of housing which we called the megadome which allowed us to slice the sea in half so you can see above and below at the same time,"" James says. ""We also built a tow-cam which can be pulled behind a boat which allowed us to travel with really fast-moving animals like dolphins and tuna."" 9. They've brought back those 'making of' segments at the end of the episodes. Remember on Planet Earth II, you'd get 50 minutes worth of TV show, and then 10 minutes of how the episode you've just seen was shot? Half the time, the ""making of"" bit was even more interesting and eventful than the show itself. Well, they've brought that bit back - and this series will have a segment called Into The Blue at the end of each instalment. 10. There's some stuff in the series that even Sir David Actual Attenborough didn't know about. ""When we first showed him some clips, he was like, 'Oh I didn't know this' and 'I didn't know that',"" James says. ""Genuinely he was surprised. It's always good if you can surprise David, it doesn't happen often."" 11.One Walrus has clearly been watching Titanic. At one point in the first episode, a walrus tries to seek refuge from a preying polar bear on a floating iceberg. Problem is, there are already some walruses (walri?) on said berg. Clearly, this walrus watched Titanic, and, like the rest of us, thought there was plenty of room for Kate Winslet to shift over and make room for Leonardo DiCaprio on that piece of wood. Unfortunately, the extra weight of this particular walrus on this particular iceberg causes it to collapse, ruining the party for everybody (there's always one). 12. Bottle-nosed dolphins are super-cute They just look so friendly don't they, you'd definitely go for a drink with one. 13. Dolphins surf, Sir David explains, ""to strengthen friendships, develop social skills, and for the sheer exhilaration of it"". Coincidentally, this is also why humans do karaoke. 14. The show doesn't shy away from the impact of pollution. ""You can't go out there and make a series like this without seeing some really big issues unfolding in front of you,"" says James. ""You can go to the middle of the ocean and find plastics from many different continents coming together. ""The impact that has on the wildlife can be devastating."" In the show, we hear Sir David comment: ""There are worrying signs that conditions in the oceans that have remained relatively stable for millennia, are changing radically."" 15. Warning: The first episode includes ""mating"". In case you're planning to watch with your parents. Fortunately, the mating involves this handsome chap. 16. Some shots weren't filmed on location. Earlier this week, The Guardian said some footage had been captured in ""controlled laboratory conditions"". After the report was published, Jamesexplainedthe series was overwhelmingly shot on location, but in a few select instances, such as rock pools in the Coasts episode, labs were used. ""Filming in the wild would have been too disruptive for the wildlife,"" he said. ""It would have been impossible to film close-ups of this magical world, so we worked with scientists to accurately recreate a rock pool in the controlled conditions of the lab."" 17. It wasn't originally going to be called Blue Planet II. ""The series was commissioned as Oceans,"" explains Tom. ""It was a very easy commission, instinctively the channel understood it was a brilliant thing to do and it felt like it was the right time to go back to this habitat. ""It was never designed so that we'd have Planet Earth II last year and Blue Planet II this year, so now it looks like it was a brilliant strategy, but it wasn't exactly conceived that way."" 18. Tusk fish are determined little creatures. There is one tusk fish who travels to the edge of the coral reef every morning, Sir David explains, looking for some breakfast. While most of us would grab some Special K from the cupboard, this guy travels quite some distance in search of a small clam. Using his mouth, he takes it back to his ""kitchen"" - which is essentially a massive rock, against which he starts bashing the clam repeatedly in order to crack it open. ""It's not easy when you have no hands,"" Sir David observes. 19. Not all of the plans for the series came off. ""There were lots of shoots that failed, to put it bluntly,"" says Tom. ""The team set out to capture particular species, and when you watch this, I think James and his team make it look really easy. ""And when I think about the number of variables when it comes to filming in the ocean, I think it's remarkable what they were able to capture."" 20. In true W1A style, the show has led to more collaborative BBC working. ""Some of the new technologies that were invented specifically for this series are already being deployed by the Natural History Unit on future projects,"" says Tom. James adds: ""There was a sequence on The One Show last week about sturgeon [not Nicola], and they borrowed our probe lens, which is great - we built it, they were able to use it."" 21. There's going to be a podcast to accompany the series. So make sure you're all caught-up on Serial. 22. So... Planet Earth II. Blue Planet II. What's next? ""We have a big landmark series for next year which is very different to Blue Planet II,"" says Tom. ""It's been announced already, it's called Dynasty, not to be confused with Carringtons and Colbys, so who knows if it will stay that title. ""But the premise of each film is we take one animal family and follow them for a number of years to see the ups and downs of their family lines. ""I'm already viewing episodes of it, and it's incredibly visceral. It feels so different to this."" There's more. ""One other thing I'm really excited about is a series the NHU have made which is on in January called Animals With Cameras, a really simple proposition. ""We've built bespoke cameras for different species, that the animals wear, so we can see the world from an animal's point of view. ""There's meerkats in it,"" he adds. ""That's my innovation for 2018, more meerkats."" Blue Planet II begins on BBC One at 20:00 GMT on Sunday.The series has been sold to more than 30 countries around the world.

"The mystical fascist who admired Hitler, beloved of the alt-right","Savitri Devi, a mystical admirer of Hitler and a cat-loving devotee of the Aryan myth, seemed destined to fade into obscurity after her death 25 years ago. But thanks to the rise of the extreme right, her name and her image now crop up online more and more, writes Maria Margaronis. In 2012, browsing the website of Greece's Golden Dawn party for an article I was writing, I stumbled on a picture of a woman in a blue silk sari gazing at a bust of Hitler against a blazing sunset sky. What was this apparently Hindu woman doing on the site of an openly racist party devoted to expelling all foreigners from Greece? I filed her as a curiosity at the back of my mind, until the rising tide of extreme-right politics in Europe and America threw up the name ""Savitri Devi"" once again. It isn't hard these days to find discussions of Savitri Devi's books on neo-Nazi web forums, especially The Lightning and the Sun, which expounds the theory that Hitler was an avatar - an incarnation - of the Hindu god Vishnu, and Gold in the Furnace, which urges true believers to trust that National Socialism will rise again. The American extreme-right website Counter-Currents hosts an extensive online archive of her life and work. Her views are reaching a wider public, too, thanks to American alt-right leaders such as Richard Spencer and Steve Bannon, former Trump chief strategist and chair of Breitbart News, who have taken up the account of history as a cyclical battle between good and evil â a theory she shared with other 20th Century mystical fascists. Richard Spencer in Charlottesville (August 2017) Dark metal bands and American right-wing radio stations also roar about the Kali Yuga, the Dark Age of Hindu mythology, which Savitri Devi believed that Hitler was once destined to bring to an end. Who was Savitri Devi, and why are her ideas being resurrected now? Despite the sari and the name she was a European, born Maximiani Portas to an English mother and Greek-Italian father in Lyon in 1905. From an early age, she despised all forms of egalitarianism. ""A beautiful girl is not equal to an ugly girl,"" she told an interviewer sent by the Holocaust denier Ernst Zundel in 1978. Swept up by Greek nationalism, she arrived in Athens in 1923 at the same time as thousands of refugees displaced after Greece's disastrous military campaign in Asia Minor at the end of World War One. She blamed the Western allies for Greece's humiliation, and for what she saw as the unjustly punitive terms imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles. In Savitri's mind, Greece and Germany were both victims, denied the legitimate aspiration of uniting all their people in one territory. That view, combined with a passionate anti-Semitism which she claimed she learned from the Bible, led her to identify herself early on as a National Socialist. Hitler was Germany's champion but, she said, his desire to eradicate Europe's Jews and restore the ""Aryan race"" to its rightful position of power made him her ""Fuhrer"" too. Listen to the Radio 4 documentarySavitri Devi: From the Aryans to the Alt-righton the BBC iPlayer In common with anti-Semitic thinkers since the 18th century, Savitri blamed Judeo-Christianity for destroying the glory that was Greece and the Aryans' mythical ancient utopia. In the early 1930s she sailed for India in search of a living version of Europe's pagan past, convinced that the caste system, by forbidding intermarriage, had preserved pure Aryans there. (Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who visited India in the 1970s, shared her misconception.) So unusual was the sight of a European woman travelling fourth class by train that she was placed under surveillance by the British colonial authorities. But Savitri had little to do with the British in India until World War Two, when she passed information she gleaned from them to the Japanese. She learned Indian languages, married a Brahmin (whom she believed to be an Aryan like herself), and forged an elaborate synthesis of Nazism and Hindu myth, in which Hitler was a ""man against time"" destined to bring about the end of the Kali Yuga and usher in a new golden age of Aryan supremacy. Young Brahmins training to be priests in Varanasi In Kolkata in the 1930s, Savitri worked for the Hindu Mission, now a quiet neighbourhood shrine but in those days a centre for Hindu nationalist campaigning and missionary activity. The politicisation of India's religious communities under the British had helped to foster the growth of the Hindutva movement, which argued that the Hindus were the true heirs of the Aryans and that India was an essentially Hindu nation. Savitri offered her services to the Mission's director, Swami Satyananda, who (like many Indians before independence) shared her admiration for Hitler and allowed her to mix Nazi propaganda with her talks on Hindu identity. She travelled the country lecturing in Hindi and Bengali, salting her talks about Aryan values with quotations from Mein Kampf. In 1945, devastated by the fall of the Third Reich, she returned to Europe to work for its restoration. Her arrival in England is described in her book Long-Whiskers and the Two-Legged Goddess, a children's fable whose heroine is a cat-loving Nazi like herself. Savitri Devi was often photographed in swastika earrings The heroine, Heliodora, ""had no 'human feelings' in the ordinary sense of the word,"" she wrote. ""She had been, from her very childhood, much too profoundly shocked at the behaviour of man towards animals... to have any sympathy for people suffering on account of their being Jews."" Savitri was always clear that she preferred animals to humans. Like Hitler, she was a vegetarian. She viewed the world as if from a great distance, caring more for what she saw as the deep patterns of nature than for human lives. Visiting Iceland, she spent two nights on the slopes of Mount Hekla as it erupted. ""The original sound of creation is 'Aum',"" she wrote.  ""The volcano says every two or three seconds, 'AUM! AUM! AUM!' And the Earth is trembling under your feet all the time."" In 1948, Savitri managed to enter occupied Germany, where she distributed thousands of pro-Nazi leaflets, bearing the words: ""One day we shall rise and triumph again! Hope and wait! Heil Hitler!"" She said years later that she was glad to be arrested by the British occupation authorities because it brought her closer to her jailed Nazi ""comrades"". During her imprisonment, which was cut short by her husband's intervention through the Indian government, she grew close to a former Belsen wardress condemned as a war criminal, ""a beautiful-looking woman, a blonde of about my age."" Savitri's sexuality has been the subject of some speculation. Her marriage to Asit Mukherjee was allegedly celibate because they were not of the same caste; the Nazi financier Francoise Dior, niece of the fashion designer, claimed to have been her lover. Francoise Dior claimed to have been Savitri's lover In her later years, Savitri Devi returned to India, where she seemed to feel most at home. Living in a flat above a garage on a quiet Delhi street she devoted herself to the neighbourhood cats, going out every morning to feed them bread and milk bedecked in the gold jewellery traditionally worn by married Hindu women. She died at a friend's house in England in 1982. Her ashes were laid to rest with full fascist honours, purportedly next to those of American Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell. Savitri Devi in Delhi, in 1980 Savitri Devi herself is almost forgotten in India now, but the Hindu nationalism she espoused and helped to promote is in the ascendant, much to the concern of her nephew, the veteran left-wing journalist Sumanta Banerjee. ""In her book A Warning to the Hindus, which came out in 1939, she advised the Hindus to cultivate a 'spirit of organised resistance throughout Hindudom,'"" he says. ""The targets of this resistance were the Muslims, who were a threat, according to her, to the Hindus. And this is the same fear that is being echoed today."" Hindutva is the official ideology of Prime Minster Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, whose politicians have claimed that Muslims and secularists have undermined the strength of the Hindu nation. Though the party's official spokesmen condemn violence, the riots that led to the tearing down of the Babri Mosque at Ayodhya in 1992 and the current waves of attacks - sometimes fatal - by vigilante groups on Muslims and dissenters tell a different story. Hindutva is the official ideology of Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party In the US, racism, anti-communism and Christian fundamentalist notions about the impending apocalypse have together prepared the ground for the far right's flirtation with occult Nazism and Hindu prophecies. And as in India, the traditional ruling majority's fear of losing power has been an effective recruiting tool. ""Since the middle of the Obama administration the single most important factor in the minds of people who joined the Tea Party was the idea that white people were being shoved aside,"" says researcher and writer Chip Berlet. ""The far right and organised white supremacist groups have both been buoyed up by fear among many white citizens in the United States that they're being displaced and humiliated."" Savitri Devi's work forms part of the history of both India's Hindu nationalists and the European and American extreme right. Her flamboyant, eccentric writings contain - unvarnished and uncensored - all their key ideas: that human beings can be divided into ""races"" which should be kept separate; that certain groups are superior to and more entitled than others; that these groups are under threat; and that the dark times in which we live will only end when they again take power, returning us to a mythical golden age.

Me too: I was sexually harassed at 11,"Following the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, women have been sharing their stories of sexual harassment online using the hashtag #metoo.  Here, Shaimaa Khalil writes about her first experience of harassment as a child growing up in Egypt. There's one particular day - soon after I turned 11 - that I can't forget. I was at my grandparents' house and for the first time I'd been allowed to go out with a cousin and her friend, without any adults - three girls on our own, out on our first adventure. ""Be careful. Don't go too far and don't spend your money on stupid things,"" my grandma warned us. She meant ice cream - and yes, we were planning to spend our money on that. I was excited, but nervous. This needed to go well if I was to stand a chance of ever going out on my own! ""OK Shaimaa,"" I remember thinking. ""No falling, no fighting, no losing your money.""  I should have added: ""No getting sexually harassed by teenage boys.""  But how could I know? In the busy summer streets of Alexandria, we hadn't realised we were being followed. But three boys walking behind started bumping into us.  Then one of them groped me. Shaimaa Khalil as a teenager in Egypt All I could do to escape our tormentors was walk ahead as fast as I could, with my cousin and her friend trying to catch up. But they kept following us. The three of us held hands and rushed back toward my grandparents' house. The boys were right behind. Now verbally harassing us. I was frightened, but also angry. These boys had ruined my big day. I turned around and yelled: ""Kifaya! Enough!"" ""Kifaya!"" one of them echoed, mocking me. Later on, my mother chastised me. ""You talked to them?"" she fumed. ""You don't talk to someone who's harassing you â¦ you just keep going. That's what they want - if you engage and make a scene, they win."" My grandma chimed in. ""Were you loud? Were you laughing and being silly for no reason? I know how you can get, Shaimaa."" I tried to remember if I'd laughed. I probably had. I was having fun - until I got sexually harassed. ""And why that sleeveless shirt? It's too short, your whole bottom is showing,"" she went on. I had no idea how the conversation turned from me complaining about three horrible boys and what they did to me, to my being blamed for their actions. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 BST It was the first time I was sexually harassed but of course not the last. Some later incidents were much worse. But that day had a lasting effect.  It informed the way I felt about walking the streets of Egypt and how I behaved in them. All my life I wanted the freedom to do things on my own, and here I was, confronted with the reality for Egyptian women - that with the freedom to be in the streets came harassment. My mother laid down some rules: 1. It will happen. It's normal. 2. Don't smile. Frown preferably. 3. Walk fast. Don't linger. 4. Wear long shirts that cover your behind. 5. Do not bring attention to yourself in any way. In the years to come, these rules would sometimes work, but often wouldn't. Sexual harassment would become a part of mine and my friends' lives. Our experiences varied from verbal harassment, to inappropriate touching, to groping, to having men try to rip our clothes off. The culprits were everyone from random men on the streets - shopkeepers, doormen- to teachers, co-workers and relatives. But we wouldn't dream of speaking up. As with all Egyptian women, we had to balance harassment on the streets against more restrictions at home. Shaimaa Khalil is a presenter for Newsday on the BBC World Service In 2013 a UN report said that 99% of the women it surveyed in Egypt had been sexually harassed. ""We don't need a report,"" one of my friends laughed at the time. ""Just come and live with us for a bit!"" A recent poll suggests that Cairo is the world's most dangerous megacity for women, but I can attest that my city also lives up to this scandalous reputation. Things have moved on quite a bit since I was 11. Young women are now much more vocal. There have been campaigns against sexual harassment and law enforcement takes it more seriously. Yet all of this hasn't stopped the harassers. I don't live in Egypt now, but when I visit I can feel myself tense up. I still have my invisible armour - those rules my mum set out.  I'm always on guard when I'm alone in the streets. I have an eight-year-old niece who reminds me so much of myself when I was her age. Soon enough she'll want to venture out on her own. And here's what I'll probably tell her: ""Don't laugh, don't linger, and if something happens,  call someone and get back home."" But here's what I really want to tell her: ""You look beautiful. Laugh, have fun, enjoy yourself  - and if some horrible person harasses you, shout, make a scene and defend yourself! And always, always remember: it is not your fault!""

The young man who shook the Catholic Church to its core,"Martin Luther began the Protestant Reformation 500 years ago Five hundred years ago, a young German monk began the Protestant Reformation, shattering the authority of the Catholic Church. Centuries later, there are signs that the churches have put aside their differences. I pray theeâ¦ go not to Wittenberg.(Hamlet Act I, Scene ii). In an early scene from Shakespeare's play, Hamlet's mother Gertrude begs him not travel to Wittenberg. She believes that her son's studies in a provincial German town on the banks of the River Elbe may be a threat to their security and the Catholicism of his upbringing. She had good reason to be worried. For that is precisely what happened when a monk called Martin Luther engaged in the concentrated study of scripture at the University of Wittenberg. It would lead him to some Biblical beliefs - particularly the doctrine of justification by faith alone - that would transform Luther's understanding of church, God and eternal life. It would also result in him hammering 95 theses - arguments and objections - to the doors of the Schlosskirche, or University church. With each blow, the authority and stability of the Catholic Church was challenged as never before. The door of the Wittenberg Schlosskirche, where Luther nailed his theses ""He wanted to rediscover Christ,"" says Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, Germany's most senior Protestant bishop, ""and he fought against certain practices of the Church of his time."" ""And since it was not possible to agree upon these things and to find a way forward to reform the Church, he started something new.  And many people went with him,"" adds the bishop. The anniversary of Luther's protest will be marked in Wittenberg on 31 October, 500 years after he hammered on the University church's doors. A religious movement which challenged the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church Began in Germany in 1517 but soon spread through much of northern Europe Held that salvation came by grace through faith alone, not by good works or deeds Led to the creation of Protestant churches separate from the Roman Catholic Church The Church of England broke from the Catholic Church later in the 16th Century But this theological earthquake began a little earlier. If Paul the Apostle was converted on the road to Damascus, then for Martin Luther it was thunder and lightening on the road to Erfurt. Luther, aged 21, was returning to university having spent time visiting his parents in 1505. As he walked, the heavens opened and a deluge of Biblical proportions rained down. It provoked such fear and anxiety that he cried out to Saint Anne, the Virgin Mary's mother, promising that if he survived he would enter a monastery. Two weeks later Luther was admitted to the house of Augustinian friars in Erfurt and the rest, as they say, is history. Bishop Heinrich Bedford-Strohm: ""Luther wanted to rediscover Christ"" Luther's theological crisis was accelerated by a Dominican monk called Johann Tetzel, who was charged with collecting so-called indulgences on behalf of the Catholic Church. These were payments which were made in the hope that individuals, and their deceased relatives, would be fast-tracked through purgatory into heaven. Tetzel was an effective travelling salesman. He would ask his audience: ""Don't you hear the voices of your wailing dead parents and others? From this you could redeem us with small alms."" He would even offer a jingle that would not be out of place in a modern advertising campaign: ""When the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs."" But as Luther read the New Testament letter to the Romans, he was transfixed by the phrase ""the righteousness of God"". He later explained his epiphany: ""I began to understand that the righteousness of God is that by which the righteous lives by a gift of God, namely by faith."" Suddenly, Luther came to believe that one's acceptance before God could not be purchased by indulgences, nor achieved by good works, but only received through faith. He also came to the conclusion that only scripture could determine the governance of the Church and the practice of Christians. Luther's observations were not well received. Within a year, Pope Leo X dismissed Luther as an outspoken drunk who would repent when sober, describing him as ""a son of iniquity"". Excommunicated in 1521, Luther was dragged before the Diet of Worms, an assembly of the Holy Roman Empire, but refused to recant, uttering words which are now permanently linked to him: ""Here I stand, I can do no other, God help me."" Before Luther could be punished, the territorial prince of Saxony, Elector Frederick the Wise, arranged for him to be smuggled away to his castle at Wartburg. There he would spend a year translating the New Testament into German. With the advent of the printing press, alongside Luther's translation, the word began to spread. Tourists have flocked to Wittenberg to see Lucas Cranach's altarpiece Luther's breakthrough led local artist Lucas Cranach to paint his friend, in disguise, alongside the disciples at the Last Supper. The clear suggestion was that Martin Luther was much closer to the New Testament message than the Catholic Church. But as the Reformation spread through Europe, it was marked by bloody episodes of warfare and violence. Wars were waged in central, western and northern Europe from 1524 to 1649, fuelled by the religious rivalry that Luther had unwittingly inspired. Eventually, the two Churches would co-exist peacefully, but without any formal links. To mark the anniversary, we brought together the respective leaders of the Anglican and Catholic Churches in England. Today, the Churches are arguably closer than at any point since the Reformation. The leader of the Church of England, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, said: ""It's unimaginable that 50, 60 years ago that the two of us should have sat doing an interview together."" Cardinal Nichols and the Archbishop of Canterbury agree relations are improving between Catholics and Protestants Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster and leader of Catholics in England and Wales, also expressed relief that violence is no longer part of theological disagreement. ""I hope we will always maintain that mutual respect and freedom for religious expression in all its aspects,"" he said. To demonstrate the setting aside of differences, an act of reconciliation will take place at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday. Mr Welby will present copies of a text that seeks to resolve the dispute that erupted in Wittenberg. Although the joint declaration has been signed by denominational leaders, many individuals within their Churches still do not agree and prefer to stick with their own traditions. But they might consider the question asked by Pope Francis, when he visited the Lutheran Church in Rome two years ago. In a brief homily, he asked: ""If we have the same baptism, shouldn't we be walking together?""

Boy critical after shopping centre fall,"The boy fell near Debenhams on Saturday evening A 15-year-old boy who fell from a bridge in the Trafford Centre is critically ill in hospital. The teenager fell from a footbridge leading to the car park near the Debenhams store at the Greater Manchester shopping centre at about 20:15 BST on Saturday. Five 15-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of assault. Four have now been released while one is helping officers with their inquiries. Officers appealed for witnesses. Initial enquiries suggested the boy had been involved in an altercation with a group of youths but this no longer appears to be the case, police said. Det Sgt Stephen Warriner from Greater Manchester Police's Trafford borough said: ""This is a tragic incident which has left a boy fighting for his life in hospital. ""My thoughts are with his family who are understandably beside themselves at this awful time.""

Have Halloween costume bans gone too far in Canada?,"Shopping for Halloween Canadian schools are wrestling with how to guide students and parents towards Halloween costumes that aren't considered offensive or culturally insensitive. In early October, a Canadian school board emailed a checklist ""Is my costume appropriate?"" to parents planning their children's Halloween costumes. Fuschia Martians, mythical creatures, and animals got the all clear. On the what not to wear list for 31 October -cowboy and Indiancostumes,slaves,terrorist,gypsy,Rastafarianand ""urban ghettoresident"". The checklist from the Conseil scolaire Viamonde, which oversees 51 schools in Ontario, was criticised as an example of political correctness gone haywire. But school board spokeswoman Claire Francoeur said the guidelines, first sent out in 2016, has generally garnered positive reactions from parents. She says complaints mostly stemmed from stressed parents frustrated at ""having another thing to think about"" or who had hoped to recycle old costumes that failed the checklist. Halloween traditions around the world Canadian town bans teens from trick-or-treating The board believes strongly in its values of ""respect for each other"" and that includes Halloween, Francoeur says. ""We live in a society that has changed a lot in the past 10, 15 years,"" she says. ""So this is another change."" Educators are trying to navigate the holiday where costumes must be neither too gory nor too scary, as well as age-appropriate and culturally sensitive. In Winnipeg,a primary school became so bogged down,externalin debate it scrapped Halloween altogether. The date 31 October is now being celebrated as ""tie and scarf"" day, one of four themed costume days the school settled on instead of celebrating Halloween. Examples of Ohio Universityâs Students Teaching About Racism in Society costume campaign In 2011, Ohio University launched the ""We're a Culture Not a Costume"" campaign. Similar campaigns have subsequently been adopted across North America, including by Canadian universities and primary and secondary schools. Costumes have become a fraught issue on Canadian university campuses too. 'Anne Frank' costume sparks controversy 'Psychotic nympho' outfit criticised Student unions have taken steps to avoid controversies like the 2014 one at Ontario's Brock University, where white students dressed in blackface as a Jamaican bobsleigh team and won a prize for a get-up decried as racist. Brock University's student union now vets the costumes of people attending their annual Halloween party and refuses entry to participants who don't to comply with costume rules. The no-no list includes:black face, traditional orreligious head dresses,geishacostumes, andDay of the Deadmakeup. Last November, Queen's University said it would investigate after photos of students at a party dressed asBuddhist monks,Middle East sheiksandVietcongwas published online, sparking controversy. At Waterloo University, the student union has launched an ""I am not your costume"" social media campaign. ""Making someone else's culture and/or identity a caricature for you to wear for one night is a terrible costume idea,"" the group says on its website. But not everyone thinks dressing up as someone not of your culture or race is automatically problematic. A family shops for Halloween costumes Ottawa writer Kate Jaimetwrote an op-ed for the Toronto Star,external- provocatively titled ""The Halloween ethno-police frighten me"" - after her four-year-old daughter was told she couldn't dress as a ""Native princess"". ""The message my daughter got was that she could not pretend - could not even imagine herself - to be a Native person,"" Jaimet wrote. Jaimet says she heard from some indigenous readers who explained to her why they felt the costume was inappropriate, ""I've realised that a child's Halloween costume is not a hill to die on and that if agreeing that non-indigenous people shouldn't dress up as indigenous people for Halloween is part of what it takes to have better race relations in this country, then I can accept that,"" she told the BBC. ""But I don't think that we should generalise that to saying that no child should wear a costume from any different culture, or that no artist should represent different cultures in their work, or that no one should incorporate the traditions or wisdom of other cultures into their lives."" Jaimet's daughter eventually dressed as an angel. At Conseil scolaire Viamonde, students who show up in costumes that are ""subject of discussion"" aren't sent home. Instead, they're used to start in-class conversations. Schools and boards across Canada have since reached out to Viamonde asking for copies of the checklist. ""For people who say we're alone in this - I don't think so,"" says Francoeur. Wesleyan University in Connecticut posted a flier advising students to avoid costumes with dreads, afros or anything that might ""trivialise human suffering, oppression, and marginalisation"" A white student was expelled from a fraternity at the University of Central Arkansas for wearing blackface At Texas's Baylor University, students dressed up as maids and construction workers for a Mexican-themed ""Cinqo de Drinko"" fraternity party.

PM vows to tackle Westminster abuse,"Theresa May said she was ""determined to protect staff who work for MPs"" Theresa May has reacted to claims of harassment of staff by MPs by calling for new grievance procedures. In a letter to Commons Speaker John Bercow, the PM said the current House of Commons disciplinary regime lacked ""teeth"" and needed to be reformed. A mediation service should be set up for all MPs, regardless of their party, she said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ready to back the PM and establish ""robust and effective"" new rules. In her letter to the speaker, Mrs May said she was concerned by reports of alleged mistreatment of parliamentary workers and was ""determined to protect those staff who work for MPs"". She said the current system for airing grievances was not fair on employees, many of whom were young and in their first job. ""I believe it is important that those who work in the House of Commons are treated properly and fairly - as would be expected in any modern workplace."" She said she wanted to see contractually-binding grievance procedures, rather than the current system under which MPs were not bound by decisions from IPSA - the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. Mrs May said there was already a confidential phone line, an online portal and an advice service for MPs to report abuse but she now wanted to ""go further"". Parliamentary staff and the public needed to have confidence in the system, she said, and cross-party support would ""play an important role in this"". Mrs May asked Mr Bercow to help her do ""all we can to ensure that the reputation of Parliament is not damaged further by allegations of impropriety"". A Labour spokesman said: ""There must be robust procedures inside as well as outside Parliament for dealing with abuse and harassment. ""Jeremy (Corbyn) is ready to meet the speaker and the prime minister as soon as possible to strengthen those procedures and parliamentary-staff employment conditions. All political parties are also under an obligation to ensure their own internal procedures are robust and effective."" This video can not be played Diane Abbott also spoke to Andrew Marr about the culture at Westminster It comes as Conservative MP and international trade ministerMark Garnier faces a Cabinet Office investigationinto whether he has breached ministerial rules. His former secretary Caroline Edmondsontold the Mail on Sunday,externalhe had given her money to buy two vibrators at a Soho sex shop. Ms Edmondson, who has since left to work for another MP, was also quoted as saying that on another occasion in a bar, in front of witnesses, he told her: ""You are going nowhere, sugar tits."" Mark Garnier is an international trade minister The Mail reported that Mr Garnier admitted the claims, saying: ""I'm not going to deny it, because I'm not going to be dishonest."" He said his actions could look like ""dinosaur behaviour"" in the current climate, but told the paper: ""It absolutely does not constitute harassment."" The incidents date back to 2010 - before Mr Garnier was a government minister. Meanwhile, former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb wasreported by the Sunday Telegraph,externalto have admitted sending ""explicit"" messages to a 19-year-old woman after a job interview at Westminster in 2013. The married Conservative MP, who admitted meeting the woman ""a few times,"" was quoted by the paper as saying he had been ""foolish"" but that there had been no sexual contact. ""I accept any kind of sexual chatter like this is totally wrong and I am sorry for my actions,"" the MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire said. Mr Crabb resigned last year as work and pensions secretary following reports of a similar incident. He did not respond to requests from the BBC for a comment.

Minister investigated over sex toy errand,"Conservative MP Mark Garnier is to face an investigation into whether he broke ministerial rules after he admitted asking his secretary to buy sex toys. The international trade minister also confirmed calling her ""sugar tits,""according to the Mail on Sunday,external, but he said it did not amount to harassment. The Cabinet Office will look at whether the Ministerial Code of Conduct has been breached. Mr Garnier did not respond to BBC requests for a comment. PM vows to tackle Westminster abuse Concern over Holyrood harassment claims It comes as the prime minister wrote to Commons Speaker John Bercow, calling for a new contractually-binding grievance procedure to be set up for all MPs and their staff. Mrs May also asked Mr Bercow for his advice on how the culture at Westminster can be changed. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn backed her call for reforms. Mr Garnier's former secretary, Caroline Edmondson, told the Mail on Sunday he had given her money to buy two vibrators at a Soho sex shop. Ms Edmondson, who has since left to work for another MP, was quoted as saying that on another occasion in a bar, in front of witnesses, he told her: ""You are going nowhere, sugar tits."" The Mail reported that Mr Garnier had admitted the claims, saying: ""I'm not going to deny it, because I'm not going to be dishonest. I'm going to have to take it on the chin."" Mr Garnier conceded that his actions could look like ""dinosaur behaviour"" in the current climate, but added: ""It absolutely does not constitute harassment."" The incidents date back to 2010 - before Mr Garnier was a government minister. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said recent newspaper reports about inappropriate behaviour by MPs and ministers were ""totally unacceptable if true"". Asked about the working culture at Westminster, he said: ""Things have got better in recent years but there is still some way to go. ""There are mums and dads who have daughters who are politics students hoping to get a job in Westminster, and they must be able to be confident that if they get that job, their daughter will not be subject to some of these behaviours that we have been seeing."" This video can not be played Diane Abbott: ""Making sexual harassment a joke is one of the reasons it's not been dealt with"" Shadow Home Secretary Dianne Abbott told the Andrew Marr show the culture for women in Parliament had improved since she was elected in 1987, but said there was ""still a long way to go"". She also criticised Conservative Environment Secretary Michael Gove,who was forced to apologiseon Saturday after he likened being interviewed by BBC presenter John Humphrys to ""going into Harvey Weinstein's bedroom"". ""I heard it and I didn't think it was funny - particularly in Parliament, making sexual harassment a joke is one of the reasons it's not being dealt with,"" she said. ""You've got to realise that it's undermining and demeaning for women and undermines and demeans the institution."" Ms Abbott said Labour had set up a new process for dealing with complaints of sexual harassment, but she stressed that it was an issue for all parties to deal with. Referring to Sheffield HallamMP Jared O'Mara, who has been suspended by the Labour Partywhile it investigates misogynistic and homophobic comments attributed to him, she said: ""That language and that tone is unacceptable"". Labour MP Liz Kendall told BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics she knew of people in her own party who had not reported harassment ""because they were urged not to"". She backed the creation of a new independent reporting system. Conservative MP Anna Soubry called for an urgent statement from Commons leader Andrea Leadsom on what can be done to ensure complaints are dealt with properly. She told the Sunday Politics previous attempts by Conservative whips to set up a new grievance procedure had been frustrated by an inability to ""get all the agreement that was necessary"". Meanwhile, former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb wasreported by the Sunday Telegraph,externalto have admitted sending ""explicit"" messages to a 19-year-old woman after a job interview at Westminster in 2013. The married MP, who admitted meeting the woman ""a few times,"" was quoted by the paper as saying he had been ""foolish"" but that there had been no sexual contact. ""I accept any kind of sexual chatter like this is totally wrong and I am sorry for my actions,"" the MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire said. Mr Crabb resigned last year as work and pensions secretary following reports of a similar incident. He did not respond to requests from the BBC for a comment. George Riley has reported on major sporting events for Radio 5 live Elsewhere,the Sunday Times is reporting,externalthat BBC Radio 5 live sports broadcaster George Riley has been suspended, following claims that a number of women have complained about his behaviour. Mr Riley has not commented and the BBC has not confirmed or denied the report.

Child maintenance loophole to be shut,"Parents will no longer be able to use a legal loophole to avoid paying child maintenance,under new laws to be brought in,externalwithin months. If a parent owes maintenance, payment can currently be taken only from a bank account held solely by them. A ""small minority"" are avoiding payments by having a joint account with a partner, the government says. It says new rules mean money can be taken from joint accounts, which could mean an extra Â£390,000 being collected. Unpaid child maintenance backlog in UK is Â£3.8bn Safeguards will be put in place over deducting money from joint accounts, the Department for Work and Pensions said. These include taking from a joint account only when the paying parent does not have their own account - or there is not enough money in their own account. Bank statements will be reviewed to establish which funds belong to the paying parent, and both account holders will be given the right to make their case before any money is taken. However, family and divorce lawyer Vanessa Lloyd-Platt said that in practice there would be ""terrible problems"" in distinguishing between which money belongs to what party in a joint account. She added: ""Can you imagine, if you've gone into a new relationship - you've got married again, and you've got a joint account with your new partner or new wife - that could cause that marriage to be disrupted terribly."" Earlier this year, figures from the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme showed a UK backlog of more than Â£3.8bn in uncollected child maintenance payments. About 1.2 million people were owed child maintenance, the figures showed. Dalia Ben-Galim, policy director at the charity Gingerbread which helps single parents, said the new law is ""a welcome step forward"" but said other loopholes in the system need to be addressed. For example, she said it is hard for the Child Maintenance Service to connect with HMRC to track a parent's additional sources of money such as rental income or dividend payments if the spouse is a company director or if the ex-partner is self-employed and does self assessment tax. Maya, a mother of one daughter, told BBC Radio 5 live that she once went two years without receiving maintenance payments from her ex-husband. She said the new rules could help since previously there had been no guarantee she would receive her money on time, even thoughthe Child Support Agency,externalwas able to take it directly from her former spouse's employer. ""At the end of each month, I'd be keeping my fingers crossed, thinking 'has he paid? Has he paid?'"" she said. Men and women have shared their experience with BBC News: 'No justice' Felicity in Stockton-on-Tees has been fighting for child maintenance for six years. ""The father of my children has a limited company and he pays himself a salary of Â£150 per week. So he has to pay the bare minimum child maintenance for his two children, whilst he pays all the profit from his company to his wife, the director of his company. No justice!"" 'It's ruining me' Billy in south-east England says that when he was on CSA his payments were manageable. ""Now I'm paying close to Â£600 a month for one child who resides in Cumbria. This is a third of my net income. I love my child dearly and will always pay my way but I don't believe this a fair payment and it is ruining me financially."" 'Not enough for lunch money' One woman from east London has two children with her ex-partner. ""I was told in 2007 he should pay Â£64 per week. He didn't pay and as he was self-employed CMA could not retrieve the payments. Two years ago I was told he was on benefits, that money could not be taken from him, and over Â£15,000 was wiped off the debt. Now I receive Â£6.72 per week. That does not even pay for lunch money for one child a week. So after 10 years of fighting and phone calls my ex basically pays nothing towards the children."" 'My ex cheats the system' Another man from Shrewsbury, who did not want to be named, is a father of three and hopes closing the loophole will work both ways. ""One daughter lives with my ex-wife and her partner. My ex cheats the system. She claims benefits - meaning she pays Â£8 a week in child maintenance - whilst living off her partner's wages. I'm a full time nurse. The CMA wants Â£300 per month from me."" Caroline Dinenage, minister for family support, housing andchild maintenance,external, said: ""Our priority is for children to get the support they need. ""Only a small minority of parents try to cheat their way out of paying towards their children, and this new power will be another tool to tackle those who do.""

"Woman, 95, seeks lost war nurse's family","Former Flying Nightingale, Margaret Wilson, hopes to track down the family of a fellow nurse who died in the conflict One of the last living air ambulance nurses to have served during World War Two is seeking help with tracking down a former colleague's family. Margaret Wilson, 95, was one of 95 nurses who risked their lives transporting nearly 100,000 wounded soldiers to British hospitals. Known asthe Flying Nightingales, the nurses went unrecognised until 2008. Mrs Wilson says she hopes to contact the family of Margaret Walsh, one of two nurses who died in action. Flying Nightingales were civilian volunteers who risked their lives The nurses were sent into mainland Europe from three bases in England from 1944. Because their outbound planes were carrying ammunition supplies for the forces, they were unable to use the Red Cross emblem to protect them from attack. Although the nurses were given parachutes, they were told they were not allowed to use them if the plane was shot down on its return from Europe. Instead, they had to stay with the wounded soldiers and be on hand to provide medical support should anyone survive the crash. In 2015, the BBC tracked down Lilian Westwho believed she was the last living Flying Nightingale. But, following the article, London-born Mrs Wilson, who now lives in Perth, Australia, came forward. She said had never been on an aircraft before she applied to join the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). ""The reaction I would have now would be, 'Hey, no way. I'm not going up there',"" she said. ""But it's amazing the sort of things you do during a war."" Mrs Wilson was stationed at Down Ampney, in Gloucestershire, and shared a hut with another nurse - Margaret Walsh, whose plane went down over the Channel in April 1945. Miss Walsh, 33, from Hove, Sussex, was lost along with the crew. It is believed she was the daughter of Major Patrick Walsh and Mary Margaret Walsh ""Margaret used to read cards and we used to take the mickey a little bit,"" said Mrs Wilson. The nurses were told they must go down with their planes in case they could treat any crash survivors ""One day I came back from my flight into the hut and I saw she was upset. She was due to go out and she had obviously seen something on the cards. ""I said, 'If you are worried, I'll take your place on the plane. No problem. I'm all dressed to go.' But Margaret wouldn't let me. ""I think the middle of the next day, we were told that the plane was lost over the Channel. Margaret's body was never found. ""The incident still lives with me so clearly and it's one of my big sorrows I was never able to contact her family and talk to them about her. I can still see her face - I can still remember her."" Each plane had one nurse treating up to 20 wounded soldiers Mrs Wilson made dozens of trips across the Channel between 1944 and 1945, transporting wounded soldiers and freed prisoners of war in RAF Dakota planes to British hospitals. ""Each plane had only one nurse to look after between 10 and 20 very badly wounded soldiers,"" she said. ""Some had lost legs and arms, some were blind and had injuries. It was so sad. They were mostly young boys, about the same age as me, 20 or 21 years old."" One of her last flights was on 8 May. ""We were halfway home when the pilot called out, ""Hey boys! The war is over!"" Well, I have never been kissed by so many men in my life,"" she said. ""We were all crying and laughing at the good news. That was the happiest flight of all."" She left the air force in 1945 and got married. However, she never mentioned her nursing career to her friends or family. ""My own sons didn't know until about 20 years ago,"" she said. ""My Australian friends were fuming when they found out about the award - I had never told them about what I did. ""I suppose it's a generational thing. Personally, I don't think there was anything brave about it. We were just doing a job. We didn't expect any recognition."" The nurses' bravery was largely forgotten until 2008 when they werefinally honoured for their bravery,external. Mrs Wilson, who emigrated in 1968, was presented with a statue of Florence Nightingale and a letter signed by the Duchess of Cornwall at a ceremony in Australia. Margaret Wilson, pictured during the time she served She was also invited to a grand tea at a museum run by the Royal Australian Air Force where she was allowed to go inside an old Dakota. ""It brought back so many memories,"" she said. ""I am ashamed to say I shed a few tears.""

Acid attack on nightclub doormen,"Two men are receiving treatment for burns Two doormen were the victims of an acid attack after removing a man from a nightclub in Greater Manchester. The attack at White Hotel on Dickinson Street in Lower Broughton, Salford, happened at about 03:45 GMT on Sunday. A man who had earlier been told to leave the club returned with a knife and a bottle of what is believed to be acid. The doormen are receiving treatment for burns and their injuries are not life-threatening. Det Sgt Pat Wood said it was a ""vicious and dangerous attack on men who were just trying to their job"". ""Although their injuries aren't life-threatening, they are likely to have permanent skin damage and no doubt at the time of the attack they were thinking the worst."" The offender is described as white, in his late 20s, of average build, about 6ft tall and with short brown hair.

'Thousands' driving without diesel filters,"It is illegal to drive a diesel car with the particulate filter removed Thousands of motorists are breaking the law by driving diesel cars without pollution filters, experts have told BBC 5 live Investigates. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency says 1,800 cars have been caught since 2014. But experts say they believe the number is much higher, claiming the current MOT test, which requires only a visual inspection, is not fit for purpose. The DVSA says it plans to introduce changes to improve the test next year. All new diesel cars produced after 2009 have diesel particulate filters designed to reduce pollution levels, but they can sometimes get clogged up and break down, costing thousands of pounds to replace. Because of the cost involved, some motorists are opting instead to have them removed. It is illegal for drivers to use a car with the DPF removed, but it is not illegal for garages to take them out. 5 live Investigates followed the progress of a car which had its filter removed through MOT tests at three different garages. This video can not be played UK scientists estimate air pollution cuts British people's lives by an average of six months Mechanics failed to spot the filter had been taken out on each occasion. Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at Kings College, London, said the health impact was devastating. ""If a DPF is removed, it takes the work being done to restrict emissions back 30 years. ""A car with a DPF removed has a particulate count 20 times higher than one with it. ""The particles lead to numerous health problems such as lung cancer, heart attacks, strokes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's - and can also affect an unborn child in the womb."" This video can not be played Simple tips to avoid inhaling air from traffic and other common sources of pollution Experts have told 5 live Investigates that the 1,800 cars which failed the MOT test since 2014 because the filter had been removed are just the tip of the iceberg. They believe many thousands more are getting away with it because current emission tests do not always detect it, and another test - which involves only a visual inspection of the filter unit from the outside - is not adequate. Nick Molden, chief executive of Emissions Analytics, said: ""It is clear a more detailed inspection of vehicles is required during MOT, and potentially spot-checking of vehicles in real world situations is needed, too. ""The MOT test is clearly not fit for purpose in checking if a DPF has been removed."" But some motorists say the problem with DPFs lies with the manufacturers - as they can need to be replaced multiple times, while the cost can be prohibitive. Andrew Giller was quoted Â£1,000 for a replacement on his seven-year-old car - and he had to get it done four times in quick succession because it kept getting clogged up. He said: ""The car manufacturer should play a responsible part and guarantee the DPF filter for the life of the car. ""The problem is with the manufacturers, not the vehicle owner, but we are bearing the enormous cost of inefficient manufacture."" Another car owner, Liz, told the BBC she bought a second-hand car without realising the DPF had been removed. She said: ""I am reliant on my car for work and getting the kids to school, have never broken the law and was shocked to find out I was driving an illegal car. ""I cannot afford as a single parent to pay Â£3,200 for new unit for a car that is only worth Â£5,000."" Labour MP Mary Creagh, who is chairwoman of the environmental audit committee, said: ""I'm concerned there could be tens of thousands of cars on the road which have had the DPF removed. ""The government should tighten MOT tests and close the legal loophole that allows garages to remove them and cheat the public out of clean air."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said there were plans to improve the test to make it more effective. A spokesman for the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency said: ""DVSA is making further changes to the MOT manual and to the diesel emissions limits for modern vehicles, in May 2018. ""These will make the test more robust and better able to detect where emissions control equipment has been tampered with.""

NHS Airbnb-style scheme 'not ruled out',"The idea of NHS hospital patients recuperating in Airbnb-style accommodation has not been ruled out, health minister Philip Dunne has said. Southend Hospital had been linked to a trial where hospital patients could be discharged to people's spare rooms. The hospital distanced itself from the idea following criticism by politicians and health groups. But Mr Dunne told BBC Radio 5 live he ""wouldn't immediately reject it"" as ""one's got to trial different things"". The pilot scheme, proposed in Essex, would have seen some 30 hospital patients staying in local residents' spare rooms instead of in hospital while they waited to be discharged. The idea followed warnings about delays in discharges from UK hospitals. Hospital backs off 'Airbnb beds' plan As part of the trial, healthcare start-up CareRooms said it would recruit ""hosts"" whose properties had spare rooms or annexes with a private bathroom. Southend Hospital later said the pilot would not be supported until certain criteria had been met. However, when asked by the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar if the idea deserved a look, health minister MP Mr Dunne said: ""Well, I wouldn't rule it out. ""This is not national policy, anything innovative needs to be very carefully scrutinised and assessed before we proceed with it. ""But I wouldn't, just as an immediate knee jerk, say that new models of care in the community are necessarily wrong."" The idea followed warnings about delays in discharges from UK hospitals Mr Dunne added that the idea had involved ""people who may have had minor procedures who need a bit of help"". It could also include B&B owners who were already medically trained and could offer accommodation, he said. But Tom Abell, deputy chief executive of Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""While we welcome and encourage new ideas and innovation, there is no intention and there never has been for the hospital to support this pilot at this time."" The idea first emerged last week, when it sparked widespread debate. Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said the scheme would be a ""sticking plaster"" for wider NHS issues, while shadow social care minister Barbara Keeley warned there were ""clear safety risks"". Ex-Labour minister Lord Clark warned that ""vulnerable patients"" would be allocated to homes where the host had no ""medical expertise"". However, Dr Harry Thirkettle, co-founder of CareRooms, said the idea could help patients who either live alone and do not have support leave hospital sooner. He said that some people may find the scheme preferable to staying in hospital. An NHS England spokesman said it was ""good to hear innovative ideas from NHS staff"", but the idea was ""a long way from being implemented"" and would need to be very ""carefully assessed"" before being tested.

I became fixated on losing weight - Mellor,"Writer Kay Mellor says she became ""fixated"" on losing weight as she was researching her TV series Fat Friends. The hit ITV drama, starring James Corden, aired between 2000 and 2005 and focused on a slimming group in Leeds. She attended a group to help her writing, but was then told by the leader she needed to lose weight. The 66-year-old told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs: ""I started to want to lose weight so I could please her and please all the class."" The Bafta award-winning writer said she had been surprised to be told she was overweight. She said: ""I stood on the scales, she looked at me and I looked at her and she said: 'We'll start half a stone at a time'. ""And I went: 'Sorry?' - looked down at the thing - and she said: 'You're two stone overweight.""' Mellor added: ""But then, slowly, I became fixated, myself."" Mellor also told Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young about her shock at becoming pregnant at the age of 16. ""I didn't know anything, really, I was so naive,"" she said. ""Literally, the second time I'd had sex I was pregnant, because I'd never heard of the pill, and then for ages I was missing my periods and I didn't even realise I was pregnant."" Mellor said she did not find out she was expecting until she was four and a half months pregnant.

Boy critical after Trafford Centre fall,"The boy fell near Debenhams on Saturday evening A 15-year-old boy who fell from a bridge in the Trafford Centre is critically ill in hospital. The teenager fell from a footbridge leading to the car park near the Debenhams store at the Greater Manchester shopping centre at about 20:15 BST on Saturday. Five 15-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of assault. Four have now been released while one is helping officers with their inquiries. Officers appealed for witnesses. Initial enquiries suggested the boy had been involved in an altercation with a group of youths but this no longer appears to be the case, police said. Det Sgt Stephen Warriner from Greater Manchester Police's Trafford borough said: ""This is a tragic incident which has left a boy fighting for his life in hospital. ""My thoughts are with his family who are understandably beside themselves at this awful time."" A spokeswoman for the Trafford Centre said: ""We are doing all we can to support the police investigation.""

Heathrow probe over 'security USB stick find',"Heathrow Airport says it has launched an internal investigation after a USB stick containing security information was reportedly found on the street. The Sunday Mirror reported that the USB stick had 76 folders,externalwith maps, videos and documents, including details of measures used to protect the Queen. A man found it in west London and handed it into the paper, it said. Heathrow said all of its security plans had been reviewed and it was ""confident"" the airport was secure. ""We have also launched an internal investigation to understand how this happened and are taking steps to prevent a similar occurrence in future,"" it said. The Sunday Mirror said there were at least 174 documents on the stick, which it said was found on the pavement, and some were marked as ""confidential"" or ""restricted"", but could be read. Some files disclosed the types of ID needed to access restricted areas, a timetable of security patrols and maps pinpointing CCTV cameras, the paper said. One document highlighted recent terror attacks and talked about the type of threat the airport could face, it said. The information has been passed to Heathrow intelligence chiefs, the Sunday Mirror said. The statement from the airport said Heathrow's ""top priority"" was the safety and security of passengers and staff. ""The UK and Heathrow have some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world, and we remain vigilant to evolving threats by updating our procedures on a daily basis.""

Huge pro-Spain rally begins in Barcelona,"This video can not be played Barcelona rally demonstrator: 'I feel forgotten by Catalan government' Hundreds of thousands have attended a rally for Spanish unity in Barcelona after Catalonia was stripped of its autonomy for declaring independence. Many urged the jailing of sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont. Mr Puigdemont was dismissed as Spain's central government took control of Catalan institutions. Spain's foreign minister has said that he could run for re-election in December - if he has not been imprisoned by then. Alfonso Dastis's comments come as Spain's chief prosecutor prepares to file criminal charges against the pro-independence leader, who has said he does not recognise the order from Madrid removing him from power. Meanwhile, in an open letter, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido has urged the Catalan regional police force to accept temporary direction from Madrid. Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since a referendum, organised by Mr Puigdemont's separatist government, was held earlier this month in defiance of a ruling by the Constitutional Court which had declared it illegal. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. Police said at least 300,000 people had turned out in Barcelona, Catalonia's largest city, for the pro-unity rally. Organisers and the government in Madrid put the turnout at more than a million people. Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia What next for Spain? Veteran Catalan politician Josep Borrell, a former president of the European Parliament, told demonstrators: ""Mr Puigdemont may speak on behalf of some of the Catalan people, but I am also Catalan, I am also part of the Catalan people, and I do not recognise his right to speak in my name."" Among the demonstrators was Marina Fernandez, a 19-year-old student, who said she was unhappy with the actions taken by the Catalan authorities. ""I am enraged about what they are doing to the country that my grandparents built,"" she told the AFP news agency. Another protester, Maria Lopez, told Reuters news agency: ""What do we want? That they don't break us up. They are shameless, shameless, and Mr Puigdemont needs to be taken to prison."" Pro-Spain protesters gathered at the Gaudi-designed Casa Batllo in Barcelona The deputy president of the deposed Catalan government, Oriol Junqueras, has condemned Madrid's actions. ""The president of the country is and will remain Carles Puigdemont,"" he wrote in Catalan newspaper El Punt Avui. ""We cannot recognise the coup d'etat against Catalonia, nor any of the anti-democratic decisions that the PP [Spain's ruling Popular Party] is adopting by remote control from Madrid."" By Gavin Lee, BBC News, Barcelona Many of them waved Spanish flags and chanted ""Viva Espana"" and ""The streets are for everyone"" as they marched through Barcelona in support of Spanish unity and against Catalonia's unilateral declaration of independence. Catalonia's main opposition party said the region's ""silenced majority"" was now speaking. The atmosphere was peaceful, as police helicopters monitored from above. Several off-duty police officers who had joined the protest told the BBC they felt there was deep division in their ranks, and were worried what could come next if their separatist colleagues refused to take orders from Madrid. The key issue is what happens to Carles Puigdemont, who is still calling himself the Catalan president - despite having been removed from office by the Spanish government, along with his cabinet and more than 100 officials. His job, in all but title, has been transferred to Spain's deputy prime minister until elections in December. Independence supporters are being urged to resist any attempt by Madrid to forcefully remove the separatist leaders. Friday saw the regional parliament declare independence, with Madrid responding by declaring the move illegal. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy then announced the dissolution of the regional parliament and the removal of Mr Puigdemont as Catalan leader, and ordered that fresh elections should be held on 21 December. Mr Puigdemont has urged ""democratic opposition"" to direct rule from Madrid, which has said it would welcome his participation in the election. What powers has Catalonia now lost? The case for and against independence This video can not be played Flags in Catalonia and what they mean On Sunday, Belgium's Migration Minister Theo Francken told local TV the separatist leader could be given asylum protection which Spain would find difficult to reverse. ""If you see the situation at the moment, the prison sentences and the repression from Madrid and the prison sentences that are bandied about... the question is obviously whether somebody like that has the chance of a fair trial,"" he told Reuters. There is no suggestion that Mr Puigdemont is seeking to leave Catalonia. He had been expected to attend a football match in Girona, the heartland of the pro-independence movement, which saw the local team beat Real Madrid - who Mr Rajoy supports - by 2-1. But he apparently did not make an appearance. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Reality Check: Police violence in Catalonia A poll published by Spanish national newspaper El Pais on Saturday suggested a small majority of Catalans (52% to 43%) were in favour of the dissolution of the regional parliament and the holding of elections. Fifty-five per cent of Catalan respondents opposed the declaration of independence, with 41% in favour. Before Madrid took over the Catalan government, the region had one of the greatest levels of self-government in Spain. It has its own parliament, police force and public broadcaster, as well as a government and president, though those have now been dismissed. Catalans had a range of powers in many policy areas,externalfrom culture and environment to communications, transportation, commerce and public safety.

#MeToo fallout continues in the papers,"Some prisoners are to be granted the right to vote, the Sunday Times says The Sunday Times,externalreports that some prisoners are to be granted the right to vote. Under the plans - which the paper says were circulated among ministers last week - prisoners with jail sentences of less than a year, who are let out on day release, would be able to take part in elections. The paper notes that the proposal follows a 12-year dispute with the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 2005 that it was a breach of prisoners' rights to deny them the opportunity to vote. A Ministry of Justice spokesman told BBC News that it would not comment on speculation. The Mail on Sunday,externalsays a Brexit minister has confirmed to the paper that he once greeted his secretary with crude language and asked her to buy sex toys. Mark Garnier tells the Mail that his comment was a reference to a television programme, and that asking her to buy sex toys was ""good-humoured high-jinks"". He denies his behaviour constitutes sexual harassment. Senior Conservative donors tellthe Observer,externalthat Theresa May should walk away from Brexit negotiations without an agreement - if the deal offered by the EU is not satisfactory. One, Michael Farmer, who also donated millions to the Leave campaign, believes an unfavourable deal would cause the issue of Europe to ""smoulder"" for another generation. ""'No deal' would free us to take advantage of the many opportunities that would be open to Britain,"" he says. The Observer says the interventions are a sign of growing frustration among pro-Brexit Tories about the pace of negotiations with Brussels. There is widespread coverage of an apology made by Environment Secretary Michael Gove, after he made a joke referencing the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who is facing allegations of sexual assault. There's widespread coverage of an apology made by Environment Secretary Michael Gove At a special edition of the Today programme to mark its 60th anniversary, Mr Gove compared being interviewed by John Humphrys to going into Harvey Weinstein's bedroom. The online newspaper theIndependent,externalsays his comments provoked a ""furious backlash"". The Spectator's gossip columnist Steerpike,externalasks why the same outrage was not directed at Mr Gove's co-interviewee Neil Kinnock, who - during the exchange - remarked that ""John goes way past groping"". The Sunday Mirror,externalreports that nearly half of all troops who failed drugs tests in the first half this year were allowed to stay on. The Mirror believes it is a sign that defence chiefs are softening their zero-tolerance policy on substance abuse. A Ministry of Defence spokesman tells the paper personnel could get a reprieve if they have made ""an uncharacteristic mistake"". But an un-named senior officer says drugs are a problem in the armed forces. The Sunday Telegraph,externalbelieves there is growing evidence that a small but significant number of runners are cheating at amateur races. The paper documents several techniques; performance-enhancing drugs, the taking of short-cuts and the use of so-called ""bib mules"", where competitors give their race number to a faster runner. In an editorial, the Telegraph pins the blame on social media which, it says, encourages showing off, even if if involves a little air-brushing. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The Sunday Times reports that a group of senior women presenters and editors at the BBC have uncovered ""a string of suspected cases of sexual harassment"".,external They are said to have raised concerns about the conduct of two men. The paper says a 5 live sports broadcaster, George Riley, has been suspended pending an investigation. He hasn't commented and the BBC has not confirmed or denied the report. A BBC spokesman said later: ""We can't comment on individuals but treat any allegations seriously and have processes in place for investigating them."" Meanwhile, the Sun on Sunday says Theresa May is ""sweating"" over a dossier of alleged hounding, propositioning and groping of young women by Tory MPs. The paper claims some of the allegations are against cabinet ministers - forcing the prime minister to reckon with the prospect of an emergency reshuffle. She is said to have held emergency meetings with aides, to draw up a plan of action in case a senior figure is named publicly. The front page of theSunday Telegraph,externalfeatures a warning from the medical director of NHS England that the lack of a central system for ordering changes on safety grounds is leaving patients in danger. In an interview with the paper, Sir Bruce Keogh says the hundreds of organisations within the health service have ""their own views"" and that there should be a ""simpler way"" when action is required. In an editorial, the Telegraph complains that the health service has a ""flawed structure"" that is protected from criticism by an ""our NHS"" moral crusade. It believes ""real change"" will only happen by admitting that other systems are better. In Spain, the Catalan newspaperLa Vanguardia,externalnotices that the word ""independence"" was missing from a televised address by the region's deposed leader, calling for peaceful opposition to direct rule by Madrid. The paper interprets this as a sign that Carles Puigdemont is trying to calm tensions. The news websitePolitico,external, however, believes his remarks ""deepened the stand-off"" with the Spanish government and that the formal surroundings of his pre-recorded address suggest he hasn't accepted being sacked.

"The mystical fascist who admired Hitler, beloved by the alt-right","Savitri Devi, a mystical admirer of Hitler and a cat-loving devotee of the Aryan myth, seemed destined to fade into obscurity after her death 25 years ago. But thanks to the rise of the extreme right, her name and her image now crop up online more and more, writes Maria Margaronis. In 2012, browsing the website of Greece's Golden Dawn party for an article I was writing, I stumbled on a picture of a woman in a blue silk sari gazing at a bust of Hitler against a blazing sunset sky. What was this apparently Hindu woman doing on the site of an openly racist party devoted to expelling all foreigners from Greece? I filed her as a curiosity at the back of my mind, until the rising tide of extreme-right politics in Europe and America threw up the name ""Savitri Devi"" once again. It isn't hard these days to find discussions of Savitri Devi's books on neo-Nazi web forums, especially The Lightning and the Sun, which expounds the theory that Hitler was an avatar - an incarnation - of the Hindu god Vishnu, and Gold in the Furnace, which urges true believers to trust that National Socialism will rise again. The American extreme-right website Counter-Currents hosts an extensive online archive of her life and work. Her views are reaching a wider public, too, thanks to American alt-right leaders such as Richard Spencer and Steve Bannon, former Trump chief strategist and chair of Breitbart News, who have taken up the account of history as a cyclical battle between good and evil â a theory she shared with other 20th Century mystical fascists. Richard Spencer in Charlottesville (August 2017) Dark metal bands and American right-wing radio stations also roar about the Kali Yuga, the Dark Age of Hindu mythology, which Savitri Devi believed that Hitler was once destined to bring to an end. Who was Savitri Devi, and why are her ideas being resurrected now? Despite the sari and the name she was a European, born Maximiani Portas to an English mother and Greek-Italian father in Lyon in 1905. From an early age, she despised all forms of egalitarianism. ""A beautiful girl is not equal to an ugly girl,"" she told an interviewer sent by the Holocaust denier Ernst Zundel in 1978. Swept up by Greek nationalism, she arrived in Athens in 1923 at the same time as thousands of refugees displaced after Greece's disastrous military campaign in Asia Minor at the end of World War One. She blamed the Western allies for Greece's humiliation, and for what she saw as the unjustly punitive terms imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles. In Savitri's mind, Greece and Germany were both victims, denied the legitimate aspiration of uniting all their people in one territory. That view, combined with a passionate anti-Semitism which she claimed she learned from the Bible, led her to identify herself early on as a National Socialist. Hitler was Germany's champion but, she said, his desire to eradicate Europe's Jews and restore the ""Aryan race"" to its rightful position of power made him her ""Fuhrer"" too. Listen to the Radio 4 documentarySavitri Devi: From the Aryans to the Alt-righton the BBC iPlayer In common with anti-Semitic thinkers since the 18th century, Savitri blamed Judeo-Christianity for destroying the glory that was Greece and the Aryans' mythical ancient utopia. In the early 1930s she sailed for India in search of a living version of Europe's pagan past, convinced that the caste system, by forbidding intermarriage, had preserved pure Aryans there. (Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who visited India in the 1970s, shared her misconception.) So unusual was the sight of a European woman travelling fourth class by train that she was placed under surveillance by the British colonial authorities. But Savitri had little to do with the British in India until World War Two, when she passed information she gleaned from them to the Japanese. She learned Indian languages, married a Brahmin (whom she believed to be an Aryan like herself), and forged an elaborate synthesis of Nazism and Hindu myth, in which Hitler was a ""man against time"" destined to bring about the end of the Kali Yuga and usher in a new golden age of Aryan supremacy. Young Brahmins training to be priests in Varanasi In Kolkata in the 1930s, Savitri worked for the Hindu Mission, now a quiet neighbourhood shrine but in those days a centre for Hindu nationalist campaigning and missionary activity. The politicisation of India's religious communities under the British had helped to foster the growth of the Hindutva movement, which argued that the Hindus were the true heirs of the Aryans and that India was an essentially Hindu nation. Savitri offered her services to the Mission's director, Swami Satyananda, who (like many Indians before independence) shared her admiration for Hitler and allowed her to mix Nazi propaganda with her talks on Hindu identity. She travelled the country lecturing in Hindi and Bengali, salting her talks about Aryan values with quotations from Mein Kampf. In 1945, devastated by the fall of the Third Reich, she returned to Europe to work for its restoration. Her arrival in England is described in her book Long-Whiskers and the Two-Legged Goddess, a children's fable whose heroine is a cat-loving Nazi like herself. Savitri Devi was often photographed in swastika earrings The heroine, Heliodora, ""had no 'human feelings' in the ordinary sense of the word,"" she wrote. ""She had been, from her very childhood, much too profoundly shocked at the behaviour of man towards animals... to have any sympathy for people suffering on account of their being Jews."" Savitri was always clear that she preferred animals to humans. Like Hitler, she was a vegetarian. She viewed the world as if from a great distance, caring more for what she saw as the deep patterns of nature than for human lives. Visiting Iceland, she spent two nights on the slopes of Mount Hekla as it erupted. ""The original sound of creation is 'Aum',"" she wrote.  ""The volcano says every two or three seconds, 'AUM! AUM! AUM!' And the Earth is trembling under your feet all the time."" In 1948, Savitri managed to enter occupied Germany, where she distributed thousands of pro-Nazi leaflets, bearing the words: ""One day we shall rise and triumph again! Hope and wait! Heil Hitler!"" She said years later that she was glad to be arrested by the British occupation authorities because it brought her closer to her jailed Nazi ""comrades"". During her imprisonment, which was cut short by her husband's intervention through the Indian government, she grew close to a former Belsen wardress condemned as a war criminal, ""a beautiful-looking woman, a blonde of about my age."" Savitri's sexuality has been the subject of some speculation. Her marriage to Asit Mukherjee was allegedly celibate because they were not of the same caste; the Nazi financier Francoise Dior, niece of the fashion designer, claimed to have been her lover. Francoise Dior claimed to have been Savitri's lover In her later years, Savitri Devi returned to India, where she seemed to feel most at home. Living in a flat above a garage on a quiet Delhi street she devoted herself to the neighbourhood cats, going out every morning to feed them bread and milk bedecked in the gold jewellery traditionally worn by married Hindu women. She died at a friend's house in England in 1982. Her ashes were laid to rest with full fascist honours, purportedly next to those of American Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell. Savitri Devi in Delhi, in 1980 Savitri Devi herself is almost forgotten in India now, but the Hindu nationalism she espoused and helped to promote is in the ascendant, much to the concern of her nephew, the veteran left-wing journalist Sumanta Banerjee. ""In her book A Warning to the Hindus, which came out in 1939, she advised the Hindus to cultivate a 'spirit of organised resistance throughout Hindudom,'"" he says. ""The targets of this resistance were the Muslims, who were a threat, according to her, to the Hindus. And this is the same fear that is being echoed today."" Hindutva is the official ideology of Prime Minster Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, whose politicians have claimed that Muslims and secularists have undermined the strength of the Hindu nation. Though the party's official spokesmen condemn violence, the riots that led to the tearing down of the Babri Mosque at Ayodhya in 1992 and the current waves of attacks - sometimes fatal - by vigilante groups on Muslims and dissenters tell a different story. Hindutva is the official ideology of Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party In the US, racism, anti-communism and Christian fundamentalist notions about the impending apocalypse have together prepared the ground for the far right's flirtation with occult Nazism and Hindu prophecies. And as in India, the traditional ruling majority's fear of losing power has been an effective recruiting tool. ""Since the middle of the Obama administration the single most important factor in the minds of people who joined the Tea Party was the idea that white people were being shoved aside,"" says researcher and writer Chip Berlet. ""The far right and organised white supremacist groups have both been buoyed up by fear among many white citizens in the United States that they're being displaced and humiliated."" Savitri Devi's work forms part of the history of both India's Hindu nationalists and the European and American extreme right. Her flamboyant, eccentric writings contain - unvarnished and uncensored - all their key ideas: that human beings can be divided into ""races"" which should be kept separate; that certain groups are superior to and more entitled than others; that these groups are under threat; and that the dark times in which we live will only end when they again take power, returning us to a mythical golden age.

Apology for gay men convictions,"The first minister is to apologise on behalf of the Scottish government to gay men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences. Nicola Sturgeon will make the apology at Holyrood on 7 November to coincide with new legislation giving an automatic pardon to those affected. The legislation was promised by Ms Sturgeon when she presented her programme for government in September. The law will also allow the removal of such crimes from criminal records. A Scottish government spokesman said that Ms Sturgeon would apologise to those convicted prior to 2001 under discriminatory laws against same-sex sexual activity that is now legal. He added: ""The apology will be made on behalf of the Scottish government for the treatment of homosexual men under previous governments and will coincide with the introduction of legislation to provide people convicted under these laws an automatic pardon. ""The bill will right a historic wrong and give justice to those who found themselves unjustly criminalised simply because of who they loved."" The legislation was first confirmed by Justice Secretary Michael Matheson in October last year. He announced plans for automatic pardons just days after similar legislation was scuppered at Westminster. The legislation was first confirmed by Michael Matheson in October last year That happened after a private member's bill by the SNP's John Nicolson, which would have pardoned all men living with UK convictions,was ""talked out"" of the Commons. The UK government failed to support that private members bill in favour of bringing forward its own plans. Coming Oot: The fabulous history of gay Scotland Illegal to be gay: Scotland's history Under its Policing and Crime Act, gay and bisexual men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences in England and Walesreceived posthumous pardons. Those who are living can be pardoned after the secretary of state agrees the conduct is no longer criminal. Tim Hopkins, director of the Equality Network, said: ""The apology is important because it shows that it was the discriminatory laws that were wrong, and not the consensual relationships that were made criminal by those laws. ""We look forward to seeing the detail of the bill. ""If it implements the policy announced by the Scottish government, it will be a hugely important statement that Scotland regrets the discrimination of the past, and now considers its LGBTI people to be fully equal citizens who deserve equal respect. ""It will also be of direct practical importance to people who currently have one of these convictions show up on criminal record checks for jobs or volunteer posts.""

Fat Friends writer 'fixated' on weight,"Writer Kay Mellor says she became ""fixated"" on losing weight as she was researching her TV series Fat Friends. The hit ITV drama, starring James Corden, aired between 2000 and 2005 and focused on a slimming group in Leeds. She attended a group to help her writing, but was then told by the leader she needed to lose weight. The 66-year-old told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs: ""I started to want to lose weight so I could please her and please all the class."" The Bafta award-winning writer said she had been surprised to be told she was overweight. She said: ""I stood on the scales, she looked at me and I looked at her and she said: 'We'll start half a stone at a time'. ""And I went: 'Sorry?' - looked down at the thing - and she said: 'You're two stone overweight.""' Mellor added: ""But then, slowly, I became fixated, myself."" Mellor also told Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young about her shock at becoming pregnant at the age of 16. ""I didn't know anything, really, I was so naive,"" she said. ""Literally, the second time I'd had sex I was pregnant, because I'd never heard of the pill, and then for ages I was missing my periods and I didn't even realise I was pregnant."" Mellor said she did not find out she was expecting until she was four and a half months pregnant. The teenager and her boyfriend Anthony decided to keep the baby and get married, but their vicar refused to marry them because he thought ""it wouldn't last"". They got married at a register office - and will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary this year. Flintoff to star in Fat Friends musical The Leeds-born writer chose the Fat Friends theme tune - the Beautiful South's Perfect 10 - as one of her Desert Island Discs, because ""every time I heard that I used to get excited and get butterflies"". She said: ""It was such a lovely time of my life, it was a drama that was really important to me because I thought I had something to say about weight and body image."" The series, which also featured actors Ruth Jones, Alison Steadman and Sheridan Smith, has now been turned into a musical and starts touring next month - starring ex-England captain Andrew Flintoff. He has also been cast in Mellor's new TV drama Love, Lies and Records which will air on BBC One this autumn.

Mum's plea to end 'no grass' gun culture,"Khadija Sonko spoke out after figures revealed a sharp rise in gun-related crime in Merseyside The family of an 18-year-old murder victim has made an appeal for an end to the ""no grass"" culture they believe has prevented the teenager's killers being caught. Student Yusuf Sonko was shot dead in Liverpool in June but police are yet to charge anyone over his murder. His mother Khadija Sonko believes gun crime is worsening in the city due to a code of silence among teenage gangs. She spoke out after figures revealed a sharp rise in gun crime in Merseyside. Mrs Sonko, who works for a homelessness charity, told BBC Inside Out North West: ""We need to come together and we need to fight this and we need to speak to our children. We need to say this is no good, this is not allowed."" She said the family lived in hope that someone out there has information that will help catch her son's killers - but only if they decide to come forward. ""If you really know about what happened to Yusuf, I'm sure somebody knows, please, please go tell police. And see justice done for Yusuf."" Yusuf Sonko was due to sit his final A-level exam when he was killed Speaking during a recent community march in memory of Yusuf, his sister Abby said: ""If you know your child was there, encourage them to do the right thing and go to the police. ""Forget that 'no grass' culture. You need to speak up."" Father Papa Sonko said: ""You don't have to be scared because the police are not stupid to give your name publicly to let the killers know you. ""Go out today, do the right thing, tell the police what you know. ""[Gun crime] will continue until we all come together to say you enough is enough. Let's try and stop these guns on the street. Let's make the children believe there is a better life for them."" James Meadows was shot dead in Huyton earlier this month Thomas Baker died after he was found with gunshot wounds at Stanley Meat Market in Old Swan, Liverpool, in January Aaron Lewis was shot shot dead outside a chip shop in the Toxteth area of of the city in February Yusuf Sonko died after being shot in a street in June, also in Toxteth James Meadows died after he was shot in the head while riding pillion on a motorbike in Huyton earlier this month Yusuf was found shot in Tagus Street, Toxteth, on the evening of 2 June. Described as ""polite, kind and humble"", he was due to sit his final A-level exam and had hoped to study business at university. Detectives believe he may have been inadvertently caught up in a dispute between rival groups. However, he was not thought to have been personally involved and his father says officers told him he was ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"". A 21-year-old man and 17-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of murder but later released while the investigation continues. Merseyside Police recorded 91 shootings over the 2016-17 financial year. These resulted in 34 injuries and four deaths, with a further two deaths since April this year. The previous 12 months saw 61 shootings and two deaths. The force also said it had recovered 74 firearms believed to be linked to crime so far in 2017, which has doubled from the 37 found over the same period last year. In total, the region has seen 31 shooting-related deaths over the past decade, with numbers generally fluctuating from year to year. The murder of Rhys Jones sparked a national outcry in 2007 Stuart Kirby, professor of policing and criminal investigation at the University of Central Lancashire, said the so-called ""no grass"" culture had been passed through ""generations and generations"". He said there could be a ""stigma"" attached to informing on people within communities, and it was very difficult for people to come forward because they faced living with that stigma ""for years to come"". ""Even if they left the area, their family and friends would get the ramifications,"" he said. ""It can be implicit intimidation - people hanging around outside your house and anonymous calls. Or it can be explicit threats when you leave the house. Sometimes children are approached."" James Riley, was a Liverpool probation officer for 18 years specialising in organised crime. He now delivers an educational programme in schools. He believes children need to learn from an early age that the stigma of not informing on criminals is wrong. With this in mind, his Get Away 'N' Get Safe Gangs Prevention Programme aims to change the language commonly used by teenagers. ""You've got young people who are using this word 'grass' and 'snitch' and I'm trying to challenge attitude and that culture,"" he said. ""I say to young people that the brave person speaks up. If nobody spoke up, it means that our streets are becoming more dangerous."" Det Ch Supt Chris Green said gun crime in Liverpool is still a problem This year marks 10 years since 11-year-oldRhys Jones was killed in Liverpoolin Liverpool in one of the country's most notorious shootings. This was a murder that did prompt many informants to come forward, including12 people who all contacted the BBC's Crimewatch programme,externaland gave the same name. Killer Sean Mercer was later jailed for life following a nine-week murder trial. However, Merseyside Police Det Ch Supt Chris Green said the shooting had not led to a reduction in gun crime in the city. ""It should have been a watershed moment,"" he said. ""But there are still people in this city who are only too prepared to pick up a gun and then use it. ""For me the statistics only tell part of the story, really, because actually one firearms discharge is one too many. That is the mantra we go by. We want to reduce that number to zero."" Prof Kirby said he believed police now had a ""greater understanding"" about the reluctance of some people to provide information. The Crimestoppers charity, which allows people to contact detectives anonymously, was ""invaluable"", he said. The case of Rhys Jones was a positive example of a time when the public stood up and said ""enough is enough"" and did help the police. He added: ""The more people who do come forward makes it is easier for others to do the same. It is so important if the community can challenge things.""

More protection for endangered species,"Species like chimpanzees are seeing large reductions in numbers A UN-backed wildlife conference held in the Philippines has voted for additional protections for a list of 33 endangered species including chimpanzees, leopards and giraffes. Whale sharks, the world's largest fish, were also included on the list. The six-day long Convention of Migratory Species (CMS) concluded on Saturday, demanding better protections for species that cross country borders. The group's executive secretary said ""everybody has to pitch in"" to efforts. ""It has helped to convey the message that the future of migratory wildlife is integral to our own future and that we all have the responsibility to act,"" Bradney Chamber said. Governments also made commitments to co-operate on reducing the negative impacts of marine debris, noise pollution and climate change on migratory species. Visitors can swim with whale sharks in the Philippines as part of an eco-tourism initiative More than 1,000 delegates from 129 countries debated species' protection at the 12th conference of its kind, backed by the United Nations Environment Programme. China is still not part of the delegation, but organisers said the country had made some advances on animal protection, such ascommitting to shut-down the ivory tradeand banning the serving of endangered species, such as shark fin soup, at government events. Hosts the Philippines lobbied for the inclusion of whale sharks, which have become a tourist attraction for the nation. Three other shark species were also included in the list. How should we protect endangered species? How did China save the giant panda? Snow leopard no longer 'endangered' Ten species of vultures were also singled out for special protection, alongside well-known African mammals deemed to be in danger. Giraffes are on decline on the continent, with only 90,000 thought to be left in the wild. Lesser-known species were also singled out for protection - including the Gobi Bear found in the Gobi desert in Mongolia and China. Organisers said only 45 of them remain in the wild.

Iceland ruling party ahead despite losses,"Ms JakobsdÃ³ttir says she wants to use Iceland's economic boom to fund investment Iceland's main centre-right party looks set to remain the largest in a snap election called after a scandal over a paedophile toppled the coalition. Despite significant losses, PM Bjarni Benediktsson's Independence Party is ahead of the Left-Green Movement as votes are counted. But with other coalition parties losing ground it was still unclear who would get a mandate to form a government. Iceland's second snap election in a year was held amid deep voter distrust. The row that brought down the government erupted after it emerged that Mr Benediktsson's father had written a letter saying the paedophile should have his ""honour restored"". Most of the parties say investment is needed in welfare, infrastructure and tourism but disagree about how to fund it. Pirate Party MP forced to wear eyepatch With more than half of the votes counted: TheIndependence Partyhas about 25%. It has said it wants to fund infrastructure spending by taking money out of the banking sector. It has been part of every ruling coalition since 1980, except during the 2009-2013 economic crisis TheLeft-Green Movementis on 17%. Led by 41-year-old KatrÃ­n JakobsdÃ³ttir, it wants to use the country's economic boom to fund investment and restore trust in government TheSocial Democratic Allianceis on course to almost double its vote share with nearly 13%, potentially giving it a key role in coalition talks Former PM Gunnlaugsson (L) and Mr Benediktsson are standing despite their respective controversies The furore over Mr Benediktsson's father's letter relates to an old Icelandic system allowing convicts to have certain civil rights restored if three letters of recommendation from persons of good character are provided. Icelanders were furious at the secret backing for Hjalti SigurjÃ³n Hauksson - convicted in 2004 of raping his stepdaughter almost every day for 12 years from when she was five. He served a five-and-a-half-year jail term. The government has also been accused of an attempted cover-up after it refused to disclose who had written the letter of recommendation. The Bright Future party said it was quitting the three-party coalition over the ""serious breach of trust"". It now appears likely to lose all of its four seats. The island of 340,000 people was one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis but has turned its economy around by focusing on tourism. Last year a tax haven scandal forced the then prime minister to resign. Leaked information from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca showed at the time that PM Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson owned an offshore company with his wife, but had not declared it. Mr Gunnlaugsson has denied wrongdoing and is standing in the current election with his new Centre Party.
