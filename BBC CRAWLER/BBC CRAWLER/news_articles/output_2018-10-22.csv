Saudis now admit journalist was murdered,"This video can not be played How Saudi critics keep going missing Saudi Arabia has blamed the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi on a ""rogue operation"", giving a new account of an act that sparked a global outcry. Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told Fox News ""the murder"" had been a ""tremendous mistake"" and denied the powerful crown prince had ordered it. Khashoggi was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The Saudis, under intense pressure to explain Khashoggi's whereabouts, have offered conflicting accounts. They initially said he had left the consulate on 2 October - but on Friday admitted for the first time he was dead, saying he had been killed in a fight. This claim met widespread scepticism. How Saudis changed story on Khashoggi All you need to know about his death Turkish officials believe Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was murdered by a team of Saudi agents inside the building and say they have evidence to prove it. Adel al-Jubeir's comments, describing the incident as murder, are some of the most direct to come from a Saudi official. ""We are determined to find out all the facts and we are determined to punish those who are responsible for this murder,"" he said. Who's who in the 'hit squad'? Saudi summit website attacked by hackers ""The individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority,"" he added. ""There obviously was a tremendous mistake made, and what compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover up."" The minister also said that Saudi Arabia did not know where the body was and insisted the action had not been ordered byCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, seen as the country's most powerful figure. ""Even the senior leadership of our intelligence service was not aware of this,"" he said, calling it a ""rogue operation"". Who was the victim? 'The Arab world is facing its own Iron Curtain' However, Yeni Safak, a media outlet close to Turkey's government, says it has information showing that the office of the crown prince received four phone calls from the consulate after the killing. Reuters news agency reported on Sunday it had spoken to a Saudi official who said Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of. A Saudi operative then reportedly donned Khashoggi's clothes and left the consulate. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Separately, CNN quoted a senior Turkish official as saying a Saudi agent had been captured on surveillance footage dressed as the journalist. The video appears to show the man leaving the consulate by the back door on the day the journalist was killed, wearing Khashoggi's clothes, a fake beard and glasses, CNN said. In another development, Turkish police found a car belonging to the Saudi consulate left in an underground car park in Istanbul. The police asked prosecutors and Saudi diplomats for permission to search the vehicle. Turkish media also posted footage apparently showing Saudi consular staff in Istanbul burning documents a day after Khashoggi's disappearance. Saudi Arabia admitted for the first time on Friday that the journalist had died, suggesting he had been killed in a fight with some of the people he was meeting inside the consulate. Until this point the authorities had maintained that the Saudi critic was last seen leaving the building alive. Officials say they have arrested 18 people, sacked two aides of Mohammed bin Salman and set up a body, under his leadership, to reform the intelligence agency over the killing. Both King Salman and the crown prince called Khashoggi's son, Salah, on Sunday to express their condolences over his death, the Saudi Press Agency reports. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Salah Khashoggi resides in Saudi Arabia and had reportedly been barred from leaving the country to visit his father who was living in self-imposed exile in the US. Meanwhile, Jamal Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, who raised the alarm about his disappearance after waiting for him for hours outside the consulate, was given 24-hour police protection, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reports. Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, dismissed the Saudi version of events. ""One cannot help but wonder how there could have been a 'fist fight' between 15 young expert fighters... and a 60-year-old Khashoggi, alone and defenceless,"" he wrote in Yeni Safak newspaper. ""The more one thinks about it, the more it feels like our intelligence is being mocked."" President Erdogan said he would reveal the ""naked truth"" of the matter in parliament on Tuesday. US PresidentDonald Trump earlier said there had been ""deception"" and ""lies"" in Saudi Arabia's explanation,external, having previously said he found their narrative to be credible. The UK, France and Germany expressed shock at the death and demanded a full explanation. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt condemned the killing ""in the strongest possible terms"". He acknowledged Britain's close security links with Saudi Arabia but warned that London would ""act accordingly"" if ""the appalling stories we are reading turn out to be true"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier said she would not allow arms exports to Saudi Arabia to continue, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened to cancel a multi-billion dollar defence contract. But several of Saudi Arabia's regional allies - including Kuwait and Egypt - have come out in its support. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? Turkish investigators say they have audio and video evidence which shows Khashoggi was killed by a team of Saudi agents inside the consulate. Police have searched the nearby Belgrad forest in Istanbul where they believe the body may have been taken. Investigators are searching Belgrad forest for the body Both the consulate and the residence of the Saudi consul have been searched.

Anti-plastic focus 'dangerous distraction',"Guy Singh-Watson's company supplies organic vegetables to tens of thousands of homes each week. The anti-plastic ""fervour"" sweeping across the UK is weakening the fight against climate change, the founder of an organic food company has said. Guy Singh-Watson, a prominent green entrepreneur and campaigner, said more focus should be put on cutting carbon. PM Theresa May has pledged to ban all avoidable plastic waste by 2042. Environmental experts have said that the anti-plastic movement showed the public could be ""mobilised"" for action on green issues. There has been growing awareness of the damage caused by single-use plastics after TV seriesBlue Planet IIhighlighted the issue last year. But Mr Singh-Watson, founder of Riverford Organic Farmers, which supplies about 47,000 boxes of vegetables to homes in the UK each week, said demonising plastic could do more harm than good. He said: ""The fervour - the almost religious fervour - of some of our customers in (being) anti-plastic can actually create problems. ""Plastic is not in itself an evil material, it is the fact that we use so much of it. ""The biggest environmental challenge facing our planet is climate change - and anything that distracts attention from that is potentially dangerous."" All the plastic you can and cannot recycle What is your chosen supermarket doing to fight plastic? Mr Singh-Watson, whose company is aiming to use only fully compostable plastic by 2020, says switching materials isn't always the best option - as some, like paper, can have a higher carbon footprint than plastic. He said it would be ""a step in the wrong direction"" if companies focused too much on their plastic usage, rather than addressing energy efficiency or reducing their carbon footprint in other ways. The government has pledged to tackle plastic waste and is considering a number of proposals, including a ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds. Cut out cling film by using an upturned bowl or plate to cover leftovers, suggests Friends of the Earth. Choose loose fruit and vegetables, rather than packaged products. Make a habit of bringing your own reusable bags to put them in, the campaign group adds. Reusable cups and containers can reduce the need for manufactured packaging, cutting carbon emissions as well as waste, says environmental body the Grantham Institute. Use your voice. The institute says politicians will act only if they know people care about environmental issues, so contact your MP or local council to press for action on reducing waste and carbon emissions. Mr Singh-Watson said the biggest single issue the government needs to sort is the ""ridiculous"" lack of a unified recycling policy across the country. He said companies struggle to come up with ""sensible packaging"", as different collection policies mean they don't know which material is the best option. There are currently 39 different recycling schemes in England, but that is being reviewed by the government. Alyssa Gilbert, director of policy at Imperial College's Grantham Institute, which works on climate change and environmental action, said the popularity of the plastics issue proved there was enthusiasm for tackling environmental problems. ""The public have been mobilised and engaged in thinking about their relationship to the environment, and that's an amazing thing,"" she said. But she agreed the wrong approach to cutting plastic use could be counter-productive. Some plastic - such as wrapped cucumbers - helped to combat food waste, which in turn contributes to carbon emissions, she said. And many UK companies were taking quite sophisticated approaches, such as co-operating to reduce the number of plastics used in the high street so that recycling becomes easier and more efficient, she added. Reducing plastic also reduced dependence on the oil it is made from, says Rosie Cotgreave, a campaigner for Friends of the Earth. She said: ""Consumers are right to call for less plastic, but it's government policy and action that's needed if we are going to get to grips with the scale of the problem.""

Nobel winners plead for Brexit science deal,"Nobel winner Sir Paul Nurse: ""Take science seriously"" in Brexit talks Some of the biggest names in science are pleading for a deal on Brexit to avoid damaging British and European research. A letter to Theresa May and Jean-Claude-Juncker has been signed by 29 Nobel Laureates and six winners of the prestigious Fields medal. Science needs ""the flow of people and ideas across borders"", it says. It comes as a survey found that many scientists are considering leaving the UK. Sir Paul Nurse, one of the signatories and a Nobel prize-winner for research into breast cancer, said: ""The message is, 'take science seriously'."" Science can help tackle global challenges like treating disease, generating clean energy and guaranteeing food supplies, the letter says - but to do that it needs to bring together the most talented researchers. And it says Britain and the EU ""must now strive to ensure that as little harm as possible is done to research"". Funding and freedom of movement are the two big concerns. Over the years of Britain's membership of the EU, leading scientists say that the UK has been extremely successful at landing European grants. Britain's overall financial contributions have been larger than the sums received but the UK's top scientific academy, the Royal Society, calculates that British science as a sector has gained financially. ""...it receives a greater amount of EU funding for research and development than the proportion of its contribution analyses suggests is earmarked for this,"" it says. Members states pay their national contributions into a central pot which is then divided between the different spending programmes. The UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) reports an ""indicative"" figure for the UK's contribution to EU research and development of â¬5.4bn over the period 2007-2013. During this time, it says, the UK received â¬8.8bn in direct EU funding for research, development and innovation activities. Sir Paul reckons that without a deal, British science could lose about Â£1bn a year. There had been hopes that Britain could rapidly negotiate a new science relationship with the EU, with an associate status like that of Switzerland, in which contributions are made and grants received. But that has not happened so far. The other worry is that without freedom of movement, the brightest scientific talent may be put off by the bureaucracy of having to apply for a visa. In an internal survey, staff at the Francis Crick Institute in London were asked for their views on Brexit - the Crick is the largest biomedical research centre under one roof in Europe. Of the roughly 1,000 scientists on the staff, 40% are from EU countries and a priority was to find out what they might do after Brexit. 78% of the EU scientists said they were ""less likely"" to stay in the UK. 51% of all the institute's scientists - including those from Britain - said they were less likely to stay. 45% of lab heads said Brexit had already affected their work - either recruiting new scientists, being excluded from EU programmes or facing increased costs after the fall in the pound. 97% of those who responded said a no-deal Brexit would be bad for UK science. One manager of a lab at the institute, Val Maciulyte from Lithuania, told me the ""uncertainty"" of the Brexit process meant she was considering moving after seven years in Britain. ""I think that definitely makes me think of other places than the UK, I'm thinking about other options in Europe, in central Europe, or even maybe going back to Lithuania,"" she said. Jasmin Zohren, a post-doctoral researcher from Germany, said it was difficult to plan because ""no one knows what is going to happen"" but she wants to live in a country that is in the EU, despite ""loving London"". She said: ""I'm currently funded by the EU - also for my PhD which I did in the UK - and I know that lots of this money will not arrive in the UK any more. And of course that's a big concern."" A senior scientist, Monica Rodrigo from Spain, said that the uncertainty was having an impact on everyone. ""I think the biggest thing is the level of stress that people are having because it's not only affecting your professional life but it's affecting other things,"" she said. ""Even if you're a British scientist it's affecting how you carry on your life and what you're going to do in the future - are you going to stay where there's limited funding or go somewhere else?"" I put it to Sir Paul that even without a deal, British science would be strong enough to cope. ""We will of course survive, we will of course receive funding from the government and we will keep going,"" he says. ""But at the moment Britain is at the top of the tree; we are considered widely around the world to be the best and we are in danger of losing that top position if we don't get this right."" A government spokesman said: ""The UK plays a vital role in making Europe a pioneering base for research, and values the contribution that international researchers make to the UK. ""This will not change when we leave the EU. ""We will seek an ambitious relationship on science and innovation with our EU partners, exploring future UK participation in mutually beneficial research programmes, and will continue to support science, research and innovation through our modern industrial strategy. ""We have a proud record of welcoming the world's brightest scientists and researchers to work and study here, and after we leave the EU we will have an immigration system to support this.""

New Premier Inn chain shrinks rooms in half,"Would you stay in a pod less than half the size of a normal Premier Inn room? For prices as low as Â£19, the Whitbread chain is betting the answer is yes. The first Zip by Premier Inn hotel opens in the Roath area of Cardiff early next year and will have 138 rooms sized 8.5 sq m including a bathroom. Whitbread says customers are willing to sacrifice room size and central locations for a bargain basement price. PriestmanGoode, which designs first class plane cabins, designed the rooms. They have twin single beds that can be pushed together to create a double bed, as well as air conditioning, flat screen TVs and WiFi. Whitbread said the smaller room format would allow it to use a wider range of buildings in towns and cities across the UK. Coca-Cola to buy Costa coffee for Â£3.9bn Costa UK sales slide It has secured a second location in Southampton that will have 140 rooms and is searching for more sites. Alison Brittain, Whitbread chief executive, said Zip would let the company access a wider range of customers, including those who are ""on a particularly tight budget but still expect and deserve the basics done brilliantly"". Greg Johnson, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Zip should allow Whitbread to open hotels in locations that could not sustain a regular Premier Inn. He added that the main chain already has 800 hotels with about 80,000 rooms and would soon account for one in every eight hotel stays in the UK, suggesting that segment of the market was close to saturation. In April, Whitbread said it would spin off its Costa coffee chain in the wake of pressure from activist investors, before revealing a shockÂ£3.9bn sale of the chain to Coca-Colaat the end of August. The FTSE 100 firm has tested its new hotel format with six Zip rooms on sale for several months at an unspecified Premier Inn hotel. There are more than 800 Premier Inns in the UK, along with 10 Hub by Premier Inn hotels in central locations in London and Edinburgh. Hub is described as ""design-led"", with 11 sq m rooms that cost more than the Â£57 average for the main chain. Whitbread is still planning to open more Premier Inn hotels as well as new Hub and Zip locations. The Yotel chain also offers compact pod-style rooms in New York, Boston and Singapore city centres, as well as Gatwick, Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle and Schiphol airports at considerably higher prices. Capsule, or pod, hotels with rooms barely larger than a single bed first emerged in Japan and were popular with ""salarymen"" who missed their last train home after one too many drinks.

US to build up nuclear arsenal - Trump,"This video can not be played US National Security Adviser John Bolton told Sarah Rainsford the US was now a ""more secure country"" President Donald Trump has warned that the US will bolster its nuclear arsenal to put pressure on Russia and China. Speaking to reporters, he repeated his belief that Russia has violated the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, which he has threatened to leave. Russia denies this. The Cold War-era treaty banned medium-range missiles, reducing the perceived Soviet threat to European nations. Russia has warned it will respond in kind if the US develops more weapons. Mr Trump said the US would build up its arsenal ""until people come to their senses"". Is this back to a nuclear arms race? Reality Check: Where are the world's nuclear weapons? He added: ""It's a threat to whoever you want to include China and it includes Russia and it includes anybody else that wants to play that game... [Russia has] not adhered to the spirit of that agreement or to the agreement itself."" Meanwhile, US National Security Adviser John Bolton has been holding talks in Moscow after Russia condemned the US plan to quit the deal. Mr Bolton was told that the US withdrawal would be a ""serious blow"" to the non-proliferation regime. However, Russia's Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev also said the Kremlin was ""ready"" to work with the US to remove ""mutual"" grievances over the INF. As Mr Bolton began his visit, Moscow warned it would take steps to maintain the balance of nuclear power. ""We need to hear the American side's explanation on this issue,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""Scrapping the treaty forces Russia to take steps for its own security."" A Russian Iskander-M missile launches during a 2017 exercise The INF treaty was signed by US President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, in the final years of the Cold War. It banned ground-launched medium-range missiles, with a range of between 500 and 5,500km (310-3,400 miles), both nuclear and conventional. On Sunday, one of the original signatories of the INF treaty, Mikhail Gorbachev, said a US withdrawal would reverse efforts made to achieve nuclear disarmament. Trump and the nuclear codes Mikhail Gorbachev, left, and Ronald Reagan sign the deal in 1987 But the US insists the Russians have, in breach of the deal, developed a new medium-range missile called the Novator 9M729 - known to Nato as the SSC-8 - which would enable Russia to launch a nuclear strike at Nato countries at very short notice. Moscow denies the missile breaches the treaty butNato said in July that Russia had failed to provide any ""credible answer"" over the missile,externaland concluded that ""the most plausible assessment would be that Russia is in violation of the treaty"". Germany's foreign minister has described Mr Trump's planned withdrawal from the INF as ""regrettable"", and described the agreement as ""hugely important, particularly for us in Europe"". But leaving the INF is also seen as a counter-move to China, which has not signed up to the deal and can therefore develop such weapons at will. The decision could create uncertainty over the future of other disarmament agreements between the US and Russia, such as the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty which ends in February 2021. The last time the US withdrew from a major arms treaty was in 2002, when President George W Bush pulled the US out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned weapons designed to counter ballistic nuclear missiles.

Mayo and Whiley leave Radio 2 DrivetimeSimon Mayo is leaving Radio 2 altogether after a huge listener backlash to the new Drivetime show.Entertainment & Arts,"The Radio 2 Drivetime show with Simon Mayo and Jo Whiley is to end after just a few months on air. Mayo is leaving BBC Radio 2 altogether but will continue to present his 5 Live film show with Mark Kermode. Whiley will remain on the station but move to the 7-9pm slot, which means Drive will get a brand new presenter. Mayo has fronted Drivetime for eight years, but the station added Whiley as a co-host in May -a move which led to a huge backlash from the audience. BBC News understands Mayo will not be moving to a rival broadcaster, despite some media reports suggesting he was leaving to host a breakfast show on a commercial station. Whiley's addition to Drivetime came after Radio 2 was criticised for its lack of female presenters.

""Some of the abuse she has had here has been appalling. Support for a show is one thing, assaulting the dignity of a warm-hearted and loyal friend is another. ""So by all means discuss what's happening here, but let's keep some civility. Thank you. Here endeth the lesson."" Analysis by Steven McIntosh, BBC entertainment reporter Zoe Ball will take over from Chris Evans in January Before Jo Whiley joined Drivetime, Radio 2's daytime schedule was made up entirely of white men over 50. While many critics acknowledged the station desperately needed more women, most argued Whiley was not the right person for the job, citing the lack of chemistry she and Mayo had. Listeners also did not respond well - hundreds have contacted BBC News to voice their unhappiness with Drivetime in recent months. So this was perhaps inevitable, but the timing of this announcement is interesting. It's worth noting that the latest radio listening figures (RAJARs) are due to be published later this week, which may have shown a dramatic drop-off in listeners since Whiley joined the show. It has not yet been announced who will take over Drivetime, but the station may now take the opportunity to get more women into the daytime schedule. As a result, we could see someone like Sara Cox,who lost out to Zoe Ballon becoming the new breakfast presenter, taking over the slot. Whiley said: ""I'm incredibly sad that Simon has decided to leave Radio 2. He's a brilliant broadcaster, a great friend and I really will miss working with him. ""However, I'm very much looking forward to hosting a new show for a new year which will have music at the very heart of it as well as guests and live sessions. Dream show, actually. Can't wait!"" Simon Mayo presents the Film Review show with Mark Kermode Whiley's new 7-9pm weekday show will see Radio 2's evening specialist shows move slots. A Radio 2 spokesperson said: ""The Cerys Matthews Blues Show (Mon), Jamie Cullum (Tues), The Folk Show with Mark Radcliffe (Weds) and Bob Harris Country (Thurs) will all move from 8pm-9pm to 9pm-10pm. ""Radio 2 remains committed to featuring the broadcast range of music across the network."" They added that announcements about shows currently in the 9pm-10pm slot would be made in due course. Lewis Carnie, Head of Radio 2 said: ""Simon is a fantastic broadcaster, and I'd like to thank him for entertaining millions of Radio 2 listeners with his wit and warmth over the years. ""With Simon leaving, we've taken this opportunity to take a fresh look at the schedule, and create a show for Jo which will focus on her passion for music.""

Trump cutting US aid over migrant caravan,"This video can not be played Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan President Donald Trump has said the US will ""begin cutting off"" foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador because of a large convoy of migrants heading north. Mr Trump criticised the countries on Monday for allowing people to leave the region and come ""illegally"" to the US. The group is travelling through Mexico, but is still far from the US border. Human rights organisations have said that cutting aid would make the situation worse. The president has not specified what money will be cut and it is unclear if such action can be taken by presidential order. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In 2017, Guatemala received over $248m (Â£191m) in US aid. The same year, Honduras received $175m and El Salvador $115m, according to the US Agency for International Development. ""Cutting aid to refugee-producing countries will only make worse the conditions that displace people in the first place,"" said Human Rights Watch on Sunday. The organisation said root causes must be addressed. ""People generally don't want to leave their homes if they can live normal, safe lives there."" This video can not be played Celebrations and sickness - thousands of migrants make it to Mexico, but what happens next? Though President Trump has accused the migrants of trying to illegally enter the US, many of the families travelling towards the border are seeking asylum. They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries. Watch: Migrant caravan travels north By the BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Mexico The square in Tapachula - the first major population centre inside Mexico for these migrants - has turned into what looked like a makeshift camp. Along one side, ambulances lined up so medics could treat those who had become sick or got injured on their journey. Mexicans came to offer food, water and clothes to the many hundreds of Hondurans who rested ahead of the long punishing journey that still remains ahead of them to the US border. Many women among the group in particular have told us that they could never have made this journey alone, because it would have been too dangerous. So in spite of their tiredness, they are glad to be with others. But there is a sense that this is no longer just a convoy of those here in Tapachula, but that there is now a long stream of people stretching back along the route through Guatemala to Honduras, with people stuck at various obstacles and others who are still coming to join this migration. Curbing illegal immigration was one of the main campaign promises Mr Trump made when he ran for president. His Republican Party is facing mid-term elections on 6 November and could be unseated by Democrats in the House of Representatives. Without offering evidence, Mr Trump has repeatedly suggested the caravan was politically motivated. On Monday he urged people to blame Democrats for the border crisis, saying: ""Remember the mid-terms"". He also tweeted that the caravan contained ""criminals and unknown Middle Easterners"". When he was later pressed by journalists on what this meant, he offered no origin for the claim but invited reporters to investigate for themselves. On Sunday, the migrant caravan reached the town of Tapachula, approximately 37km (23 miles) from Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. The Mexican authorities had earlier tried to stop them at a border bridge, but some managed to cross into Mexico illegally by boat over the Suchiate river. ""We have sunburn. We have blisters. But we got here. Our strength is greater than Trump's threats,"" migrant Britany HernÃ¡ndez told AFP news agency. It is expected to take weeks before the caravan reaches the US-Mexico border, according to US media. One of the closest border crossings in Brownsville, Texas is still over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) away from Tapachula. The last leg of their journey will also have to wait until Mexico processes the group, and asylum claims can take up to 45 days. A group of about 1,000 Hondurans set off on foot from a bus terminal in the crime-ridden city of San Pedro Sula on 13 October in an attempt to escape unemployment and the threat of violence. Many of those in the caravan are women with children Many of them had become aware of the caravan after a former lawmaker had published a poster announcing the caravan on Facebook. News of it quickly spread on social media. They have since been joined by other Central American nationals as they crossed Guatemala towards the Mexican border. The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world and many try to flee gang violence. Playing mother to El Salvador's gang children Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' How gang violence is spreading fear in El Salvador The exact number is hard to determine as the group has split up. Some are already in the Mexican city of Tapachula, while others are still at the Guatemala-Mexico border. The caravan has been growing in size with more people joining along the way Some estimates put the number of migrants who left Ciudad Hidalgo for Tapachula on Sunday at 5,000 while a Mexican federal police commander gave a lower number of 3,000. Another 1,500 migrants are estimated to be waiting to cross at the Guatemalan side of the border. A newly formed group of 1,000 mainly Honduran migrants has set off for the US, as well. However, 3,400 Hondurans have also turned back, according to official figures. Honduran President Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez urged citizens not to join the caravan. His country has also sent buses to the Mexico-Guatemala border to repatriate those who may have changed their minds about heading to the US or who are simply too exhausted to carry on. Mexico said it would stop those who did not have passports or the correct visas at its southern border. But faced with thousands of migrants and after initial clashes, riot police got back on the buses that had brought them to the border bridge. About 900 migrants crossed the river and made it into Mexico, without the police intervening. In pictures: Migrants face border tear gas On Monday, incoming Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Marcelo Ebrard - who will take up the post on 1 December - told reporters that Mr Trump's tweets were linked with domestic politics. ""The tweets we've been seeing lately do not surprise me, they do not surprise the government,"" he said via an interpreter, according to Reuters news agency. ""It's very close to the mid-term elections in the United States,"" Mr Ebrard said after meeting with Canada's foreign minister in Ottawa. Mr Ebrard did not answer when asked directly about how Mexico will treat the caravan, but said that his country planned changes to its immigration policy. ""There are going to be many more work visas. We are going to invest in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador,"" he said. Mexican officials say they have been encouraging the migrants to apply for asylum and that more than 1,000 have started the process. Those whose claims are rejected by Mexican officials will be deported. Those who managed to cross into Mexico expressed their joy at having it made that far. Many shouted ""Yes, we could!"" and ""we won't stop"". This video can not be played Migrant caravan: 'May God soften Trump's heart' ""We're exhausted, it's been a terribly difficult journey but we have hope: we've made it to Mexico, which means a lot to us,"" a migrant called JosÃ© Luis told BBC Mundo. A woman called MarÃ­a, who is taking part in the caravan with her husband and her two small children, told BBC Mundo's Ana Gabriela Rojas: ""We are very happy to be here and we ask Mexican authorities and people to let us pass through.

Man who halted Nazi nuclear plan dies at 99,"This video can not be played Joachim Ronneberg led a vital commando raid Joachim Ronneberg, the Norwegian resistance fighter who sabotaged Nazi Germany's nuclear weapons ambitions during World War Two, has died aged 99. In 1943, he led a top-secret raid on a heavily-guarded plant in Norway's southern region of Telemark. The operation was immortalised in the 1965 Hollywood film Heroes of Telemark, starring Kirk Douglas. Ronneberg later worked as a radio journalist and helped raise awareness of the dangers of war among the young. He told the BBC in 2013 that he only realised the importance of the mission after atomic bombs were dropped on Japan's Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. ""He is one of our great heroes,"" Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg told NTB news agency. ""Ronneberg is probably the last of the best known resistance fighters to pass away."" Born in 1919 in the town of Aalesund, Joachim Ronneberg fled Norway after the Nazis invaded in 1940. The then 21-year-old escaped with eight friends by boat to Scotland, but was determined to return and fight. The man who stopped Hitler's A-bomb French Resistance fighter dies aged 101 The tip-off from a Nazi that saved my grandparents Germany at the time needed so-called heavy water - with an extra atomic particle in its hydrogen nucleus - in its race against the Allies to produce an atomic bomb. Large amounts of heavy water, or deuterium oxide, at that time was only made at the Norsk Hydro facility in Rjukan, Telemark. This made the largest hydroelectric plant of its type a target for the resistance. But a small team tasked with destroying it in 1942 failed. The following year, Ronneberg chose a team of five other commandos in an Allied operation codenamed Gunnerside. ""We were a gang of friends doing a job together,"" he told the BBC during the 70th anniversary of the mission. The men parachuted on to a plateau, skied across country, descended into a ravine and crossed an icy river before using the railway line to get into the plant and set their explosives. ""We very often thought that this was a one way trip,"" he said. Ronneberg remembered his friends and fellow fighters at a memorial of their operation in London in 2013 After the explosion, the men escaped into neighbouring Sweden by skiing 320km (200 miles) across Telemark - despite being chased by some 3,000 German soldiers. With a wry smile, Ronneberg described it as ""the best skiing weekend I ever had"". The operation, coupled with US air raids the following year, led the Germans to abandon their plans and was later described as the most successful act of sabotage of World War Two. Ronneberg was reluctant to talk about his experience despite numerous books, documentaries and TV series retelling the story. He broke his silence in the 1970s, when he began raising awareness of the dangers of war among young people. ""Those growing up today need to understand that we must always be ready to fight for peace and freedom,"" he said.

Officers sacked over club scuffle,"Julian Cole was left brain-damaged and paralysed after a scuffle outside a nightclub in 2013 Three PCs involved in arresting a man left paralysed and brain-damaged have been sacked after being found guilty by a misconduct panel. Julian Cole was involved in a scuffle with doormen and police officers outside a nightclub in Bedford in 2013. The officers were found to have lied in statements about Mr Cole's condition during his arrest. PCs Nicholas Oates, Sanjeev Kalyan and Hannah Ross were found guilty of gross misconduct and dismissed. They had failed to ask ""basic questions"" to check his welfare during arrest, and he needed CPR at the police station, the hearing was told. Speaking after the verdict, Mr Cole's mother, Claudia Cole, said: ""This tribunal decision makes it clear that not only did the officers lie about the event involving Julian, they showed an inhuman indifference to his welfare."" Assistant Chief Constable Jackie Sebire called the case a ""tragedy"", adding: ""I apologise that [the officers'] conduct following the incident fell well short of what we expect at Bedfordshire Police."" She added that the length of time the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) took with their investigations was ""simply unacceptable"". Sports science student Mr Cole, then aged 19, had gone to the former Elements nightclub on 5 May 2013 for a night out with friends, but was ejected through a side door. Mr Cole was injured outside the former Elements nightclub on Mill Street in Bedford He was refused a refund by door staff and kept trying to get back in to the club, leading to staff calling the police at 01:34 GMT on 6 May. During one attempt to enter the nightclub, Mr Cole was taken to the ground by a bouncer, before standing back up, the hearing was told. He was then ""taken to the ground"" by PCs Oates, Kalyan and Ross at 01:48 before being cuffed with ""his face down on the ground"". The three officers lifted him from the ground, and he was taken via a police van to the police station. At 02:02 PC Ross called an ambulance, and paramedics arrived at the police station and began CPR on Mr Cole, who was not breathing. Thirty minutes later he was taken to hospital where a broken vertebra was discovered. Mr Cole was taken to hospital after paramedics arrived at the police station The panel found that PC Ross ""made up her account"" of Mr Cole moving his legs in an ""attempt to demonstrate she had taken Mr Cole's report of neck pain seriously when she had not"". The hearing was also told that PC Kalyan tried to ""shift responsibility"" over what happened to the student. He was found to have lied in his statement when he stated that he had heard PC Ross ask Mr Cole if he could move his legs, and that he moved them in response. PC Oates had also said that Mr Cole had walked to the police van during his arrest, which the panel said he knew was not true. PCs Ross, Kalyan and Oates ""did not ask any basic questions concerning his welfare"". However, the panel added this was ""most unlikely to have changed the outcome for [Mr Cole]"". Julian Cole was a sports science student at the University of Bedfordshire The panel also said that Sgt Andrew Withey failed to make ""any enquiry"" when PC Ross asked whether Mr Cole should go directly to hospital or custody, and failed to ""react"" to hearing Mr Cole say his neck hurt. Sgt Withey was given a final written warning after being found guilty of misconduct. PC 'lied about man's injuries' Arrest probe officer 'feared assault' Student paralysed after police scuffle The PCs were found to have breached standards of honesty, while all four were found by the misconduct panel in Stevenage to have breached standards of duties and responsibilities.

McGuinness and Flintoff join Top Gear,"Andrew Flintoff, Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris will present the new-look show Paddy McGuinness and Andrew Flintoff will be the new presenters of Top Gear, the BBC has confirmed. The pair will take over from Matt LeBlanc, after he steps down from presenting duties at the end of the next series. The comedian and former England cricket captain will join existing presenter and former racing driver Chris Harris to complete the new-look line-up. Filming for the 27th series of the BBC Two show will begin in early 2019. Rory Reid, who joined the Top Gear team after the departure of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, will no longer have a main presenting role. He began fronting spin-off show Extra Gear in 2016, and went on to co-host the main programme alongside LeBlanc and Harris on the most recent series. Rory Reid will continue to present Extra Gear According to the BBC, he ""will remain part of the Top Gear family"", along with Sabine Schmitz, and will continue to be the face of Extra Gear. Lancashire lads McGuinness and Flintoff - also known as Freddie Flintoff - were unveiled as the new faces of the motoring show on Monday morning. Matt LeBlanc to leave Top Gear 25 things to know about Top Gear's 25th series McGuinness commented: ""Getting the Top Gear gig is a real honour and I'm thrilled the BBC have given me this opportunity. ""To be hosting a show I've watched and loved from being a small boy is beyond exciting."" Ashes-winning former cricket captain Flintoff said: ""It's not often you have the chance to do both of your dream jobs, but I'm now lucky enough to say I will have. ""I've always been passionate about cars and I'm so excited to be joining the Top Gear team."" Matt LeBlanc announced he was stepping down earlier this year The next series of Top Gear - LeBlanc's last as lead host and 26th overall - will begin early in 2019 on BBC Two, before Paddy, Freddie and Chris take over later in the year. Flintoff retired from cricket in 2013 with a recurring knee injury and currently presents the podcastFlintoff, Savage and the Ping Pong Guyfor BBC Radio 5 Live, alongside Robbie Savage and Matthew Syed. It is unclear whether he will continue to host the award-winning show, which has helped him cement his new career as a presenter and broadcaster. He has also previously been a team captain on Sky's A League of their Own. Take Me Out presenter McGuinness rose to fame alongside fellow Lancashire comedian Peter Kay in programmes including Phoenix Nights and Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere. Earlier this year Paddy hosted Sport Relief on the BBC with Claudia Winkleman. Chris Harris (right) will now host alongside McGuinness and Flintoff Both McGuinness and Flintoff have a number of motoring offences to their names. McGuinness avoided a driving ban last year after hiring the lawyer sometimes nicknamed Mr Loophole, Nick Freeman. Despite the star having previously pleaded guilty to the driving offence, the case was thrown out on a technicality. Flintoff, meanwhile, has avoided a ban on several occasions after being caught speeding. In 2014, it was claimed a ban would have an adverse effect on his extensive charity work. The cricket all-rounder was also stripped of his position as England vice-captain following a drunken escapade on a pedalo in the Caribbean during the 2007 Cricket World Cup in St Lucia.

Student died after 'initiation' bar crawl,"Ed Farmer was found unresponsive and blue and taken to hospital A university student died after taking part in an ""initiation-style"" bar crawl, an inquest has heard. Newcastle University student Ed Farmer, 20, died in hospital in December 2016. A round of 100 triple vodkas had been ordered at one of the pubs on the bar crawl, the hearing at Newcastle Coroner's Court was told. Mr Farmer, of Leicester, was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in the early hours after being found unconscious. A post-mortem examination found he had five times the legal drink-drive limit of alcohol in his blood. The inquest heard excess alcohol caused cardiac arrest which led to brain damage and his death. James Carr, who was the chairman of the university's Agricultural Society and a second-year student at the time, told the inquest the night out was staged every year to welcome new arrivals. That was despite ""initiation-style"" ceremonies having been banned by the university, he said. CCTV footage played at the inquest showed a large group of students visiting a number of bars. At one point Mr Farmer was seen falling over before being held up by two other students and then carried by his arms and legs. After ending up at Mr Carr's house in the Jesmond area of the city, a third-year student shaved Mr Farmer's head. Mr Carr told the inquest he was woken by another student at around 04:30 GMT who told him Mr Farmer needed to be taken to hospital. ""I was panicking if I'm honest, I was in a state of shock,"" Mr Carr said. Dr Reuben Sahara, head of the royal infirmary's Emergency Medicine Department, told the inquest earlier treatment ""may"" have saved Mr Farmer. Dr Sahara said there was a spectrum of alcohol poisoning and that cardiac arrest was at the ""very end of that scale"". He said: ""We knew that the situation was very grave from the outset. I would agree that had he been in hospital prior to cardiac arrest then I would expect the patient to survive."" The hearing is expected to last for four days.

Mayo and Whiley leave Radio 2 Drivetime,"The Radio 2 Drivetime show with Simon Mayo and Jo Whiley is to end after just a few months on air. Mayo is leaving BBC Radio 2 altogether but will continue to present his 5 Live film show with Mark Kermode. Whiley will remain on the station but move to the 7-9pm slot, which means Drive will get a brand new presenter. Mayo has fronted Drivetime for eight years, but the station added Whiley as a co-host in May -a move which led to a huge backlash from the audience. BBC News understands Mayo will not be moving to a rival broadcaster, despite some media reports suggesting he was leaving to host a breakfast show on a commercial station. Whiley's addition to Drivetime came after Radio 2 was criticised for its lack of female presenters. Mayo wrote on Twitter on Monday morning: ""I'll continue with the (flagship) film show on 5 Live with Mark Kermode and, beyond that, other radio adventures beckon! ""But for now it's just the sadness of leaving. Radio 2 has been a wonderful place for me - my happiest radio I think. Our listeners are really quite extraordinary."" Mayo and Whiley show unpopular with listeners He added: ""Maybe it needs to be said, maybe not but so there is no room for argument I'll be clear. ""I've loved working with the exceptional Jo Whiley and when the show was 'reconfigured ' she was my first and only choice. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Some of the abuse she has had here has been appalling. Support for a show is one thing, assaulting the dignity of a warm-hearted and loyal friend is another. ""So by all means discuss what's happening here, but let's keep some civility. Thank you. Here endeth the lesson."" Analysis by Steven McIntosh, BBC entertainment reporter Zoe Ball will take over from Chris Evans in January Before Jo Whiley joined Drivetime, Radio 2's daytime schedule was made up entirely of white men over 50. While many critics acknowledged the station desperately needed more women, most argued Whiley was not the right person for the job, citing the lack of chemistry she and Mayo had. Listeners also did not respond well - hundreds have contacted BBC News to voice their unhappiness with Drivetime in recent months. So this was perhaps inevitable, but the timing of this announcement is interesting. It's worth noting that the latest radio listening figures (RAJARs) are due to be published later this week, which may have shown a dramatic drop-off in listeners since Whiley joined the show. It has not yet been announced who will take over Drivetime, but the station may now take the opportunity to get more women into the daytime schedule. As a result, we could see someone like Sara Cox,who lost out to Zoe Ballon becoming the new breakfast presenter, taking over the slot. Whiley said: ""I'm incredibly sad that Simon has decided to leave Radio 2. He's a brilliant broadcaster, a great friend and I really will miss working with him. ""However, I'm very much looking forward to hosting a new show for a new year which will have music at the very heart of it as well as guests and live sessions. Dream show, actually. Can't wait!"" Simon Mayo presents the Film Review show with Mark Kermode Whiley's new 7-9pm weekday show will see Radio 2's evening specialist shows move slots. A Radio 2 spokesperson said: ""The Cerys Matthews Blues Show (Mon), Jamie Cullum (Tues), The Folk Show with Mark Radcliffe (Weds) and Bob Harris Country (Thurs) will all move from 8pm-9pm to 9pm-10pm. ""Radio 2 remains committed to featuring the broadcast range of music across the network."" They added that announcements about shows currently in the 9pm-10pm slot would be made in due course. Lewis Carnie, Head of Radio 2 said: ""Simon is a fantastic broadcaster, and I'd like to thank him for entertaining millions of Radio 2 listeners with his wit and warmth over the years. ""With Simon leaving, we've taken this opportunity to take a fresh look at the schedule, and create a show for Jo which will focus on her passion for music.""

Lil Wayne necklace pays student's uni fees,"An art student who made a solid gold necklace for Lil Wayne has said the sale helped pay for her course fees. Joy Bonfield-Colombara, 29, from south-east London, said she was struggling to pay her Â£9,500-a-year course fees at the prestigious Royal College of Art. But just as she was considering dropping out, she received an email from a friend of the US rapper who wanted to buy him a birthday present. The 18-carat gold pendant is in the shape of Lil Wayne's face. It features two diamonds for the Lollipop singer's famous teardrop tattoos, which represent the deaths of people in his family. Lil Wayne's latest album Tha Carter V, which features collaborations with Snoop Dogg, Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott and Kendrick Lamar, reached number five in the UK charts this month. Artist Joy BC said Lil Wayne's friend told her: ""He absolutely loves it"" Ms Bonfield-Colombara, who goes by the name Joy BC, said she was ""freaking out"" when she was told who the commission - which she said was for ""thousands"" of pounds - was for. ""I was about to say 'no, I'm really sort of trying to figure out stuff with school'. They then said it's for my friend's birthday and told me who the friend was,"" she said. ""I listened to hip hop from a young age. I used to listen to him in the club!"" She said she had two to three weeks to complete the order in time for Lil Wayne's 36th birthday. Lil Wayne, wearing the necklace in New Orleans earlier this month, also wears it in his new music video Uproar ""I phoned my boyfriend and said I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out,"" she said. ""I hand carve everything, it takes me a really long time. One piece I made for someone took nine months. ""My boyfriend was like you can't do a Ronaldo on him,"" she said, referring toa bronze bust of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo that was mocked on social media. ""He said 'it's got to look like him, you can't make an awful portrait'."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The whole time I was questioning whether I should do it. But I'm really enjoying the course. ""I needed to find close to Â£10,000. I did a GoFundMe page and managed to raise Â£1,500 through that. Then I got this email. I couldn't believe it."" Although the commission - which she said cost ""thousands"" - does not cover all of her fees, she said it pays for a ""chunk"".

Toddler hurt by discarded needle in Wetherspoon pub,"Oscar spent five hours at hospital after suffering the injury, his mother said A toddler had to be tested for HIV and hepatitis after pricking his finger on a discarded needle in a Wetherspoon restaurant, his mother has revealed. Amy Bate said two-year-old Oscar found the needle under a table at The Glass House in St Helens on Sunday. She said she would have to wait months to find out if he had been infected, but the National Aids Trust said there were no recorded cases of discarded needles leading to HIV infections. Wetherspoon has issued an apology. Ms Bate said she felt ""sick"" when she realised what had happened. ""He just said 'ouch' and I could see he was holding what looked like a blue marker pen lid with a needle in it,"" she said. ""The table had been cleaned before we sat down, but we didn't check the floor. ""My mind is racing now - I won't be able to relax until I know for sure he is alright."" Ms Bate said medics at Whiston Hospital had classed Oscar as being at ""low risk"" of HIV infection, but he would have to have further treatment for three weeks and then blood tests every three months. Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said the manager at the pub ""and the company apologise wholeheartedly to the lady and her family"". The company had offered the family a Â£50 gift card. ""This is a horrible incident and obviously shouldn't happen - [they] shouldn't have had to go through the trauma of having an HIV test at the hospital,"" he added. Kat Smithson, director of policy and campaigns at the National AIDS Trust charity, said: ""There have been no cases anywhere in the world of somebody contracting HIV through a needle stick injury from a needle discarded in a public place. ""The problem of discarded needles is a concern for many people who would like public places to be safe and pleasant, particularly for children.""

May says 95% of Brexit deal now agreed,"This video can not be played Theresa May: âThere are four steps we need to take.â Theresa May has said she is prepared to ""explore every possible option"" to break the deadlock in Brexit talks. She told MPs 95% of the terms of exit were agreed but the Irish border was still a ""considerable sticking point"". While willing to consider extending the UK's transition period beyond 2020, she said this was ""undesirable"" and would have to end ""well before"" May 2022.

Is time running out for PM?,"It has become something of a weekend ritual that hardline Brexiteers breathe fire and brimstone and declare they are on the verge of triggering a vote of confidence in Theresa May. On Monday mornings the chairman of the 1922 committee Sir Graham Brady inspects his office safe and finds a pile of letters in the corner falls short of the magic number - 48 - needed to trigger a vote. And so the prime minister limps on for another week until the ritual starts out all over again. This time, however, there is a different feel. Theresa May managed to achieve the extraordinary feat last week of uniting Remain and Leave Tories in despair after she floated the idea of extending the transition period after the UK leaves the EU. There are now Remain Tories saying the time has come for her to go. Until now three factors have ensured that the prime minister has been safe from the sniping. If any of these change then the weekend ritual may have a different ending when Sir Graham opens his safe in the coming weeks. The three factors are: Numbers. The Brexiteers have so far lacked the 48 signatures (15% of the Conservative parliamentary party) needed to trigger a confidence vote. If they have ever come close to the 48 figure some MPs have declined to join in because they say the plotters definitely lack the crucial other number - the 158 votes (50% of the parliamentary party plus one) needed to unseat the prime minister in a confidence vote. Fear of the other. Possibly the greatest factor in the prime minister's favour has been a fear that she could be replaced by the other side. So Remainers fear she could be replaced by a hardline Brexiteer and vice versa. As a Remainer of the head, but possibly a Leaver of the heart, Theresa May has been well placed to straddle this divide. Grudging admiration. Theresa May won admiration as home secretary - when she was patronised by members of the Cameron-Osborne circle - and as prime minister for the dogged way in which she carries on with her job in difficult circumstances. Many Tories, both Leavers and Remainers, have been impressed by the way she has charted a seemingly impossible course between the demands of her party and the guidelines laid down by Brussels. For the moment these three factors are likely to mean that Theresa May will hang on. But the mood is changing. If you examine the three factors in reverse you can see how events could move against the prime minister: Grudging admiration - or harmful obstinacy. There is a growing feeling that what may appear an admirable quality - determination - could become a weakness. The fear is that the prime minister's unyielding approach leaves her too slow to adapt as the nature of the negotiations change. Fear of the other - or other options might be better. If both sides have doubts about Theresa May's fundamental negotiating skills then they may start to reassess their concerns about a new prime minister emerging from the other side of the Brexit divide. Remainers, who were terrified of Boris Johnson making it to No 10, are now feeling less anxious about a contest as his star wanes. David Davis divides opinion but he does attract support across the party, while some of his strongest lieutenants in past contests supported Remain in the referendum. Numbers... can change. If doubts about Theresa May harden and doubts about successors soften then the numbers to trigger a confidence vote could be met. One of the most ominous thoughts I have heard in recent days is that as many as one hundred Tory MPs could withhold their support in a confidence vote. Even if she persuaded 158 Tory MPs to support her, the party would be ""ungovernable"" at that point, according to a former cabinet minister who floated this possibility with me. The odds are that Theresa May will soldier on for the moment. She did after all exceed expectations in her recent Conservative party conference speech. But Margaret Thatcher was cheered at the end of her speech to the 1990 conference. The following month she was out.

Retired lorry driver Colin Glover, 72, and his wife were standing nearby when the bus crashed into the shop.

Police closed Market Square for investigations and reopened the area at about 14:20 BST Mr Glover added: ""I ran straight to the bus and lifted the flap to turn the engine off. ""There were lots of people trying to help get people off the bus, but I don't know how many there were on board. ""It was quite a panic. People were wondering what had happened. ""It was a big surprise and a shock. You do not expect to see a bus sticking halfway in to a shop window."" More news and stories from across Yorkshire Mr Glover said he thought the two people who worked in the opticians had been on their lunch break when the bus crashed.

Thief jailed for dead neighbour pizza crime,"Robert Sharkey spent thousands of pounds of Marie Conlon's money on pepperoni pizzas A man who spent Â£6,000 of his dead neighbour's savings on pizzas has been sentenced to two years. Robert Sharkey, 24, of Grays Hill, Bangor, was convicted of 11 charges after failing to report the woman had died, and then stealing from her. The charges included using one of Marie Conlon's debit cards to buy almost Â£6,000 worth of pepperoni pizzas. The offences occurred when Sharkey lived above Ms Conlon's flat at Larkspur Rise in Belfast. Man spent dead neighbour's Â£6,000 on pizza Belfast woman lay dead for two years The  68-year-old woman had died in January 2015. In court on Monday, Judge Piers Grant told Sharkey: ""What you did affronts the sensibilities of all right-thinking people."" The judge said that while Sharkey was using Mrs Conlon's card to buy pizza and other items, he must have known she was lying in an ever-worsening state of decomposition. ""To continue this disgraceful behaviour on such a regular basis can only be explained by complete indifference, greed and selfishness,"" said the judge. At an earlier hearing, the court was told that Mrs Conlon's body had lain for two years in her apartment while Sharkey memorised the details of her bank card to buy pizza. He pleaded guilty to preventing Mrs Conlon's lawful burial and breaking into her home. He also pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation by using her bank card to buy pizzas worth Â£5,988.39. He bought the same pizza - pepperoni with anchovies on top - every day until he was caught. He also bought goods from Sainsbury's worth more than Â£3,000 and mobile phone credit of more than Â£1,000. Sharkey was sentenced at Belfast Crown Court sitting in Downpatrick. Half of his sentence will be served in jail, the other half on licence.

Man admits murdering midwife after affair,"Samantha Eastwood was missing for over a week before her body was found in a shallow grave A man has admitted murdering a midwife following a ""longstanding"" affair. The body of Samantha Eastwood, 28, was found in a shallow grave in Caverswall, Staffordshire, in August, eight days after she went missing. Michael Stirling, 32, the brother-in-law of her ex-fiance John Peake, pleaded guilty to her murder when he appeared at Northampton Crown Court. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Stafford Crown Court on 3 December. Ms Eastwood was last seen in uniform leaving work at Royal Stoke University Hospital on the morning of 27 July. Her body was discovered on 5 August wrapped in a duvet cover with tape covering her eyes and mouth, a previous hearing was told. Staffordshire Police said a post-mortem examination has taken place, but further tests are required to confirm her cause of death. Michael Stirling pleaded guilty to murdering Samantha Eastwood After Stirling entered his plea, his defence barrister Charles Miskin QC said the murder ""was not a premeditated act"". ""The context of the killing was a background of growing tension arising from a longstanding, but not particularly intense, affair,"" he added. Latest news and stories from the West Midlands Mr Miskin said that on the afternoon of the killing ""various things were said"" between the two. ""There was an argument in that context and that led to him being very angry,"" he added. ""After a struggle and while she was on the floor, he put his hands over her throat, her mouth and nose, and as a result of that she died. ""During his intense rage, he originally intended to cause her really serious bodily harm, but matters escalated and he carried out the intention to kill her."" Tributes to the midwife had been left outside Royal Stoke University Hospital, where she worked Mr Miskin said Stirling ""panicked afterwards and buried her in an area of which he had some knowledge"". ""He entirely accepts that he tried, wholly dishonestly, to mislead others in the afternoon after the killing. ""He is absolutely horrified about what happened and is deeply sorry, not for himself, but for all the others who are victims of this crime."" Midwife's body 'found in shallow grave' Two released in midwife murder probe Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said that two days before the murder Stirling had researched methods on how to ""kill oneself"". He told the court Stirling had a history of mental health problems as recently as 2015. Stirling, of Gratton Road, Bucknall, Stoke-on-Trent, admitted murdering Ms Eastwood between 26 July and 5 August at Baddeley Green, Stoke-on-Trent. Ms Eastwood's mother, sister and ex-fiancÃ© John Peake watched from the public gallery as he entered his plea via video-link. Samantha Eastwood's body was found in a shallow grave in Caverswall, eight days after she went missing Det Insp Dan Ison said Stirling's guilty plea had ""saved a lot of heartache for the family"". ""Obviously Michael Stirling was known to the family and he's lied to them and lied to police. ""They haven't known, on occasion, who to believe."" Police previously said two other men aged 28 and 60 who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender over the death are to face no further action. Since the midwife's death, well-wishers have raised more than Â£15,800 to help her family with funeral costs.

Baby died as drunk mother slept on her,"Stacey Atkinson has had another child since her baby died A drunk mother whose seven-week old daughter died as she fell asleep holding her on a sofa has walked free from court. Stacey Atkinson, 30, admitted wilfully neglecting Chloe Atkinson Wilkie, causing unnecessary suffering or injury to health, at Liverpool Crown Court. Judge Andrew Menary QC said society demanded a prison sentence was imposed, but it would be suspended. He sentenced Atkinson, of St Helens, to 12 months, suspended for 12 months. Judge Menary told her: ""You have suffered a terrible punishment with the reality of what you did. ""I have no doubt you're truly remorseful for what you have done and have learned from this bitter experience. ""The authorities have investigated this matter and are perfectly satisfied you and your partner in all other respects are loving, caring and perfectly capable parents."" The court was told that Atkinson, of Harris Street, found the baby apparently lifeless when she woke three hours after falling asleep, having drunk half a bottle of vodka. Jurors were told of the ""harrowing"" trauma she had experienced trying to resuscitate her while waiting for paramedics. ""She will carry the guilt for the rest of her life that Chloe trusted her and she let her down,"" her lawyer, Laura Tipping, said. Phil Astbury, prosecuting, said Atkinson called emergency services at 18:23 GMT on 17 November 2016, and despite prolonged resuscitation efforts by paramedics, Chloe was pronounced dead at 19:15 GMT.

Run aground ferry captain and mate suspended,"This video can not be played An eyewitness describes hearing shouting in the ""disorientating"" thick fog The master and mate of a car ferry that struck yachts and ran aground off the Isle of Wight have been suspended. The Red Falcon ran aground in fog off East Cowes on Sunday morning, weeks after another vessel operated by Red Funnel tore yachts from their moorings. Red Funnel said the suspensions were ""standard industry practice"" and it was changing its procedures on operating in restricted visibility. The owner of a yacht which sank said he has been contacted by the ferry firm. Nigel Minchin told BBC News ""it was obviously a big embarrassment for them"" after being called by Red Funnel's CEO Fran Collins on Sunday evening. Nigel Minchin said his yacht, pictured in about 1980, has been moored in Cowes for many years The mast of the sunken yacht could be seen in Cowes Harbour after the crash Mr Minchin's yacht, Greylag, which he has moored in Cowes since 1980, was recovered on Monday. A Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) investigation has begun. The ferry company said the master and mate had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. The vehicle ferry, which left Southampton for East Cowes at 07:00 BST, ran aground an hour later while entering the harbour in low visibility, coming to a halt about 50m (165ft) off the esplanade. School to enforce 'silent corridor' rule 'I don't trust people after drink spike' Police chief calls for fireworks sale ban Forty passengers were stuck on board until the vessel was refloated three hours later. No-one was injured. It comes after a catamaran and a channel marker post werestruck by sister ship Red Eagleand two yachts were later found drifting early on 27 September. The two incidents are understood to involve different ships masters. A channel marker post was struck during the incident on 27 September Fran Collins, Red Funnel's CEO, said she was ""concerned"" about the two incidents. ""It's too early to speculate about the similarities, if any, with the last incident, but they both happened in restricted visibility so we're making immediate changes to our operating procedures to prevent any reoccurrence,"" she said. ""They are around how we look at what the visibility conditions are like... we're looking at putting tighter limits on that and slight changes for how the bridge teams operate."" She insisted the craft were ""fully manned and in full compliance with all the regulations"". An inspection carried out in Southampton later on Sunday confirmed there was no damage to the hull of the Red Falcon and the ship has since returned to service. Red Funnel said it had handed over chart plots of the ferry's movements which are recorded electronically to the MAIB. The Red Falcon ran aground while entering Cowes Harbour in dense fog Passenger Ed Anderson, from Guildford, said the thick fog had ""really set in"" as the vessel approached Cowes. He described being in his car waiting to approach the quayside when he felt it ""go into reverse quite rapidly"". ""Full credit to Red Funnel staff and crew - they were excellent and made sure we were fed and watered and kept informed of what was happening. I suppose it could have been quite stressful.""

Q&A: The Brexit backstop,"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

Town centre evacuation after 'stink bomb',"Customers at the Last Post had complained of feeling unwell Paisley town centre was evacuated after reports of a suspected gas leak which it is now believed to have been a smell caused by a stink bomb. Emergency services were called to JD Wetherspoons' The Last Post pub on County Square at about 21:10 on Sunday. Fire appliances, ambulance and police attended and Scottish Gas was asked to investigate after customers complained of feeling unwell. Several people were treated as a precaution. ScotRail cancelled its Glasgow Central to Ayr service for a short time due to ""emergency services dealing with an incident near the railway"". A cordon was extended to the surrounding streets and social media reports suggested up to eight fire appliances were in attendance along with police and ambulance teams. Eddie Gorshon, spokesman for JD Wetherspoon, told the BBC Scotland news website: ""At around 20:15 the pub manager was alerted to a gas substance in the air by a staff member. ""The gas engineer arrived and he concluded that it was not a gas leak. The manager was told to keep everyone out of the building. ""At around 21.30 the fire brigade and police arrived and begin to set up a cordon around the entire pub and shut Paisley Gilmour street train station."" The incident is believed to have been triggered by the letting off of a ""stink bomb"". Mr Gershon said the pub had been fully ventilated and that CCTV from The Last Post had been given to police to investigate. Staff were allowed back into the building at about 22:45.

Man admits to murdering midwife,"Samantha Eastwood was missing for over a week before her body was found in a shallow grave A man has admitted murdering a midwife following a ""longstanding"" affair. The body of Samantha Eastwood, 28, was found in a shallow grave in Caverswall, Staffordshire, in August, eight days after she went missing. Michael Stirling, 32, the brother-in-law of her ex-fiance John Peake, pleaded guilty to her murder when he appeared at Northampton Crown Court. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Stafford Crown Court on 3 December. Ms Eastwood was last seen in uniform leaving work at Royal Stoke University Hospital on the morning of 27 July. Her body was discovered on 5 August wrapped in a duvet cover with tape covering her eyes and mouth, a previous hearing was told. Staffordshire Police said a post-mortem examination has taken place, but further tests are required to confirm her cause of death. Michael Stirling pleaded guilty to murdering Samantha Eastwood After Stirling entered his plea, his defence barrister Charles Miskin QC said the murder ""was not a premeditated act"". ""The context of the killing was a background of growing tension arising from a longstanding, but not particularly intense, affair,"" he added. Latest news and stories from the West Midlands Mr Miskin said that on the afternoon of the killing ""various things were said"" between the two. ""There was an argument in that context and that led to him being very angry,"" he added. ""After a struggle and while she was on the floor, he put his hands over her throat, her mouth and nose, and as a result of that she died. ""During his intense rage, he originally intended to cause her really serious bodily harm, but matters escalated and he carried out the intention to kill her."" Tributes to the midwife had been left outside Royal Stoke University Hospital, where she worked Mr Miskin said Stirling ""panicked afterwards and buried her in an area of which he had some knowledge"". ""He entirely accepts that he tried, wholly dishonestly, to mislead others in the afternoon after the killing. ""He is absolutely horrified about what happened and is deeply sorry, not for himself, but for all the others who are victims of this crime."" Midwife's body 'found in shallow grave' Two released in midwife murder probe Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said that two days before the murder Stirling had researched methods on how to ""kill oneself"". He told the court Stirling had a history of mental health problems as recently as 2015. Stirling, of Gratton Road, Bucknall, Stoke-on-Trent, admitted murdering Ms Eastwood between 26 July and 5 August at Baddeley Green, Stoke-on-Trent. Ms Eastwood's mother, sister and ex-fiancÃ© John Peake watched from the public gallery as he entered his plea via video-link. Samantha Eastwood's body was found in a shallow grave in Caverswall, eight days after she went missing Det Insp Dan Ison said Stirling's guilty plea had ""saved a lot of heartache for the family"". ""Obviously Michael Stirling was known to the family and he's lied to them and lied to police. ""They haven't known, on occasion, who to believe."" Police previously said two other men aged 28 and 60 who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender over the death are to face no further action. Since the midwife's death, well-wishers have raised more than Â£15,800 to help her family with funeral costs.

Morrisons loses data leak challenge,"Morrisons has lost its challenge to a High Court ruling that it is liable for a data breach that saw thousands of its employees' details posted online. The Court of Appeal upheld the original decision against the supermarket, issued in December 2017. Workers brought a claim against the company after employee Andrew Skelton stole the data, including salary and bank details, of nearly 100,000 staff. Morrisons said it would now appeal to the Supreme Court. If that appeal fails, those affected will be able to claim compensation for ""upset and distress"". The case is the first data leak class action in the UK. It follows a security breach in 2014 when Skelton, then a senior internal auditor at the retailer's Bradford headquarters, leaked the payroll data of employees. He posted the information - including names, addresses, bank account details and salaries - online and and sent it to newspapers. He was jailed for eight years in 2015 after being found guilty at Bradford Crown Court of fraud, securing unauthorised access to computer material and disclosing personal data. Morrisons had argued that it could not be held liable for the criminal misuse of its data. But three Court of Appeal judges rejected the company's appeal, saying they agreed with the High Court's earlier decision. They said Morrisons was ""vicariously liable for the torts committed by Mr Skelton against the claimants"". Nick McAleenan of JMW Solicitors, who was representing the claimants, said they were ""delighted"" with the outcome. ""These shop and factory workers have held one of the UK's biggest organisations to account and won - and convincingly so,"" he added. ""This latest judgement provides reassurance to the many millions of people in this country whose own data is held by their employer."" Morrisons said in a statement after the hearing: ""A former employee of Morrisons used his position to steal data about our colleagues and then place it on the internet and he's been found guilty for his crimes. ""Morrisons has not been blamed by the courts for the way it protected colleagues' data, but they have found that we are responsible for the actions of that former employee, even though his criminal actions were targeted at the company and our colleagues. ""Morrisons worked to get the data taken down quickly, provide protection for those colleagues and reassure them that they would not be financially disadvantaged. In fact, we are not aware that anybody suffered any direct financial loss. ""We believe we should not be held responsible, so that's why we will now appeal to the Supreme Court.""

Government 'misled' on Northern Rock loans,"This video can not be played Mark and Lisa Elkins are being forced to sell their house A US private equity company has been accused of misleading the government about the biggest sale of state assets in UK history. BBC Panorama has discovered Cerberus told the government it was planning to offer homeowners better mortgage deals before its Â£13bn purchase of former Northern Rock mortgages in 2016. But the company hasn't provided any new mortgages and 65,000 homeowners are still trapped on high interest rates. Cerberus denies the allegation. Many of the homeowners are mortgage prisoners, who cannot shop around for a better deal because their loans are too large or their credit rating has been damaged. Lisa and Mark Elkins have to pay Â£2,500 a month on their mortgage because their interest rate is nearly 5%. That's about three times the best market rate. They have tried to keep up with the monthly payments by taking on extra jobs and working long hours. The couple has also borrowed Â£20,000 from family and friends. But Lisa says they now have no choice but to sell their home of 15 years: ""I love the neighbours and I love the house but it's become a rock around my neck. You feel like you're sinking and you can't get up and I can't have that any more."" The couple has been trapped on high interest rates since the government took over Northern Rock in 2007. BBC Panorama has calculated that the high rates have cost the Elkins an additional Â£30,000 over the past decade. Mark tells the programme the money could have transformed their lives: ""We wouldn't have been forced into taking on loans from family and struggling. I could have a day or two days off, I could have had a weekend."" The Labour peer Lord McFall says that many homeowners are paying large amounts of extra interest: ""In some of the case studies I've seen, people with a mortgage would be paying an extra Â£40-50,000 in the mortgage before it's completed. That is totally unacceptable."" At the time of the Â£13bn sale, the government bank, UKAR, told Lord McFall that homeowners should get better mortgage deals from Cerberus. In a letter to the peer, UKAR said that ""by returning ownership to the private sector the option to be offered new deals, extra lending and fixed rates should become available to them"". A UKAR spokesman told the programme that Cerberus had the ability to lend to the former Northern Rock customers and that UKAR believed they intended to do so. ""The reply to Lord McFall sent on behalf of the UKAR board of directors was based on information presented to UKAR and the board had no reason to disbelieve this at that time."" Panorama understands that the information presented to UKAR was in the pitch documents Cerberus submitted when it applied to buy the mortgages. Rachel and Adrian Neale, Hinckley They said they planned to ""evolve into an online challenger bank"" providing customers with ""a wider range of products"". Before the sale was finalised, however, the Financial Conduct Authority told Cerberus it couldn't offer new mortgages until it put the right systems and people in place. Nearly three years later, Cerberus still hasn't done that. The private equity firm said: ""Cerberus and our affiliates take great pride in being good corporate citizens who are committed to compliance with the strongest ethical standards and all legislative and regulatory requirements. We reject any allegations by BBC Panorama to the contrary."" Some of the homeowners say that as well as paying high interest rates, they have also been poorly treated by Cerberus. Rachel and Adrian Neale, from Hinckley, fell into arrears on their mortgage when Rachel became seriously ill with Crohn's Disease. They have paid off most of the arrears and have kept up their monthly payments with Cerberus's mortgage company, Landmark Mortgages. But Landmark keeps making mistakes and issuing default notices. The couple say they have already made about 70 complaints and that nearly all have been upheld. ""You're in their palm basically,"" said Adrian. ""They can do what they want, that's how it makes you feel, they can pull the rug from underneath you at any time."" It can take hours on the phone to sort out the mistakes and the default notices have badly affected Adrian's building business. ""I can't take on big jobs because I can't gain credit to fund a big job. Building merchants, credit accounts, I can't get access to it and it's held me back massively really in my business."" Landmark says it is committed to high standards of fair customer treatment: ""Our staff are trained to deliver fair, consistent and right customer outcomes. Landmark promotes high conduct standards, adopting a tailored approach to customers experiencing financial hardship to ensure we find a suitable and fair solution.""

Lioness kills father of her cubs at zoo,"Lioness Zuri had lived with Nyack for eight years and the zoo said the two had never shown aggression before A lioness has killed the father of her three cubs in their pen at a zoo in the US, officials say. Zuri, 12, attacked 10-year-old Nyack and staff at Indianapolis Zoo could not separate the pair. He died of suffocation. The lions had lived in the same enclosure for eight years, and had three cubs together in 2015. In a Facebook post the zoo said staff would conduct a ""thorough review"" to try to find out what happened. ""Nyack was a magnificent lion and he will be greatly missed,"" it read.

There had never been any noticeable aggression between the two, the statement said. ""[Staff] build strong bonds with the animals so any loss affects us all greatly,"" Indianapolis Zoo curator David Hagan told Reuters. ""For a lot of us, it's just like a family member.""

Search for blame after train mows down crowd,"The tragedy has prompted outrage and grieving relatives are demanding answers India is still reeling after 58 people, including children, were killed after an express train ploughed into a crowd of festival-goers last Friday. The crowd had gathered on railway tracks near the city of Amritsar in northern Punjab state and had no warning the train was headed their way. Few heard the train because of the sound of fireworks being set off. Officials have been trading blame but fury is mounting after the police complaint cited ""unnamed persons"". ""What had been a celebration turned into a horror show. There were so many bleeding and mutilated bodies,"" Manjit Singh, one of the survivors, who just escaped the train's path, told BBC Punjabi's Ravinder Singh Robin. The crowd were watching celebrations for the popular Hindu festival of Dussehra, which involved the burning of a firecracker-filled effigy of demon king Ravana and a fireworks display. Eyewitnesses described how people searched for their loved ones on and around the railway tracks and in the bushes nearby with the help of light from their mobile phones. Although the police have registered a complaint they have done so against ""unnamed persons"" as it is still unclear who is responsible for the accident. The event took place in a large field separated from the railway tracks by a wide ditch. A low wall marks the boundary of the field, and so by standing on the tracks people were able to gain a vantage point to watch the fireworks. The organisers had also installed large LED screens facing the tracks, suggesting that they had planned for people outside the field to witness the effigy being burnt. ""People were sitting on the railway tracks and they were taking videos of the celebration,"" Dr Navjot Kaur, a former state lawmaker who attended the event but left before the accident occurred, told BBC Punjabi. ""Organisers take permission from the railways for such events. The train should have come slowly. It should have been stopped or the driver should have honked multiple times for people to leave the tracks."" The effigy-burning is a popular annual event Railway officials have been quoted by local media as saying that it was dark and smoky and that the crowd had assembled after a curve in the tracks, making it hard for the train's driver to spot them and react in time to avoid a collision. A video of the event that has been circulated widely shows one of the organisers telling Dr Kaur that 5,000 people are standing on the tracks. ""They are not bothered about the trains - not even if 500 trains cross the tracks,"" he says. At least 59 dead as India train mows down crowd Why do India's trains keep going off the rails? Viewpoint: Does India need bullet trains? The district's deputy commissioner Kamaldeep Singh Sangha told BBC Punjabi that the organisers had written to local police to inform them about the event. He added that the police had given permission but had asked them to follow the Supreme Court's guidelines for such public gatherings. The guidelines state that permission must be granted by the fire department, the railways and the health and safety department. Officials from all three departments told BBC Punjabi that the organisers did not seek their permission. But the event's main organiser, Mithu Madan, said in a video statement that they repeatedly asked people not to stand on the tracks. He said they had the necessary permits and added that they had done everything they could to guarantee the safety of those in the field. At one point, Mr Madan broke down in the video, saying, ""My heart hurts at what happened. We had organised this event to bring people together to celebrate a festival."" Survivors have also said that officials had to have been aware of the event because it had been held annually for some two decades, with politicians attending. Punjab's chief minister, Amarinder Singh, has ordered an inquiry into the accident and announced that the families of those who died will receive 500,000 rupees ($6,800; Â£5,200) in compensation. Police have admitted they are currently focused on helping the injured and dispensing compensation but say they will soon begin investigating to ascertain who was responsible for the tragedy. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has ordered an inquiry Unfortunately, disasters resulting from a lack of preparation or poor management of crowds are not uncommon in India. And the deadliest accidents have occurred during religious festivals or gatherings, which often draw thousands of people. In 2015, 27 pilgrims died in a stampede on the banks of a holy river in southern India. It was attributed to poor planning as people rushed to take a dip in the river at a time they believed was auspicious. In 2013, some 91 pilgrims, mostly women and children, were killed in a stampede on a bridge at a Hindu festival in central India. Most were crushed after panic broke out amid a rumour that the bridge was collapsing and others drowned when they jumped from the bridge into the river below. But India is also home to some of the world's largest annual pilgrimages, involving millions of people, and many of these events are praised for their organisation.

"PM: It's about UK's future, not mine","This video can not be played Theresa May: âThere are four steps we need to take.â Theresa May has said she is prepared to ""explore every possible option"" to break the deadlock in Brexit talks. She told MPs 95% of the terms of exit were agreed but the Irish border was still a ""considerable sticking point"". While willing to consider extending the UK's transition period beyond 2020, she said this was ""undesirable"" and would have to end ""well before"" May 2022. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said the Tories were ""terminally incompetent and hamstrung by their own divisions"". And the European Parliament Brexit's co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt has said the withdrawal agreement was 90% complete, rather than the figure of 95% given by Mrs May. The Irish border remained the biggest stumbling block, he told a committee in Strasbourg, but he was confident a deal could be agreed before the EU summit in December. Commons Live: MPs question ministers on Brexit Abuse of Theresa May condemned by politicians Commons bid to block EU Brexit 'backstop' Brexit: All you need to know This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn called PM's statement a âmixture of failure, denial and delusion,"" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, speaking to the BBC in New York, said speculation about the Conservative leadership was ""unhelpful"" and some of the language that had been used about Mrs May was ""dreadful"". He said Tory MPs ""need to give her the space to finish the negotiation,"" adding ""it is very difficult to negotiate with the European Union when you also have to negotiate with your own colleagues"". The PM had his ""full support"", said the leading Brexiteer, and ""she is - and will be - the prime minister that leads us out of the European Union at the end of March 2019"". Hopes of reaching agreement on the terms of the UK's exit by the end of the year have been held up by a lack of a solution to the Irish border issue. At last week's EU summit, European leaders refused to sign off plans for a special Brexit meeting in November to seal the withdrawal agreement, saying insufficient progress had been made. But updating MPs, Mrs May insisted the process was moving in the right direction, with the future status of Gibraltar and the UK's RAF bases in Cyprus having been settled in recent days. ""Taking all of this together, 95% of the Withdrawal Agreement and its protocols are now settled."" This video can not be played Theresa May has my full support - Liam Fox She urged the EU to do more to ensure commitments entered into by both sides to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland were honoured by whatever means necessary. One idea is to extend the transition period, currently due to end on 31 December 2020, to give the two sides more time to agree their future economic partnership and ensure controversial contingency plans, the so-called Irish backstop, do not ever come into force. Both Tory Brexiteers and Remainers worry this would delay further the moment of the UK's proper departure from the EU, and potentially cost billions in terms of extra payments. But Mrs May told MPs that protecting the UK's integrity was so important that she had a duty to explore ""every possible solution"" to keeping the Irish border open and ensuring no new barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. She said the UK should be able to make a ""sovereign choice"" in December 2020 between extending the transition period for a short period or invoking the backstop - which would see the whole of the UK stay in a temporary, time-limited customs arrangement with the EU. She suggested the transition option might be preferable as it would ""mean only one set of changes for businesses at the point we move to the future relationship"". ""But in any such scenario we would have to be out of this implementation period well before the end of this parliament,"" she added. Urging Tory MPs to hold their nerve during the toughest part of the negotiations, she rejected calls for another referendum and said reports that civil servants were planning for such an eventuality were untrue. She said she would not be listening to those who wanted to ""stop Brexit"" through a new referendum - which she said should be called a ""politicians' vote"" rather than a ""people's vote"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The EU are now actively working with us."" She explained that people had had their vote, in the 2016 referendum, and a repeat would be a case of politicians telling them to have another go. But one of her party's MPs, Sarah Wollaston, said the only ""politicians' vote"" would be if they found a way to ignore the views of the people who took part in the People's Vote march past Downing Street to call for a new referendum. Marchers call for 'people's vote' on Brexit A weekend of feverish speculation suggested Mrs May had 72 hours to save her job ahead of a meeting of the 1922 committee of backbench MPs on Wednesday. During more than three hours of Brexit questions in the Commons, Tory MPs condemned the anonymous briefing against the PM over the weekend, which suggested she faced being ""knifed"" by her party, but expressed frustrations about government concessions. John Whittingdale said Leave voters were being asked to wait more than four years after the 2016 Brexit vote to regain full control of their laws and money. And former cabinet minister John Redwood said staying in the EU's customs union up to the end of 2021 could cost the UK between Â£15bn and Â£20bn at a time when resources were ""desperately needed"" for domestic priorities such as the NHS, schools and Universal Credit. He told MPs it would be ""an act of great rashness"" to a financial settlement which amounted to a ""surrender document which we cannot afford"". In a separate statement, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the ""meaningful vote"" on the final Brexit deal could not be allowed to prevent or delay the UK's departure from the EU. The choice MPs faced, he said, was between the ""best deal"" negotiated by the government and a no-deal alternative, adding he was ""very sure that will focus minds"". But Labour said it would not support this while former Tory education secretary Nicky Morgan questioned what legal advice ministers had received to support its position.

About 200 people are believed to have joined police to search nearby woodland In a statement posted on Facebook, the village association said 100 people joined the search on Saturday and about 200 on Sunday. ""Volunteers went out in groups looking at the roads, verges and woodland areas,"" it said, adding that two local residents were ""currently searching other open spaces by drones"".

The group said the search was being co-ordinated by residents Sharon Brine and Shaun Fishenden, in conjunction with Kent Police. Ms Brine and Mr Fishendon said: ""We are very proud of how residents have pulled together. With the help of local people we have been able to cover a vast amount of open space in a very short amount of time."" Kent Police said they were ""increasingly concerned"" for Ms Wellgreen In a new appeal for information, Ch Insp Tony Dyer said Ms Wellgreen had still not been in contact with her family and said she had left her car at home.

Tobacco firm attacked for anti-smoking ad,"The campaign was launched in a four-page wraparound in the Daily Mirror One of the world's biggest tobacco firms, Philip Morris, has been accused of ""staggering hypocrisy"" over its new ad campaign that urges smokers to quit. The Marlboro maker said the move was ""an important next step"" in its aim to ""ultimately stop selling cigarettes"". But Cancer Research UK said the firm was just trying to promote its smoking alternatives, such as heated tobacco. ""This is a staggering hypocrisy,"" it said, pointing out the firm still promotes smoking outside the UK. ""The best way Philip Morris could help people to stop smoking is to stop making cigarettes,"" George Butterworth, Cancer Research UK's tobacco policy manager said. The charity said smoking was the leading preventable cause of cancer and it encouraged people to switch away completely from smoking, including through the use of e-cigarettes. Tobacco giant launches anti-smoking ad Is the vape shop boom about to end? Vapers rise 'to more than three million' Health charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) also criticised the campaign - which is called Hold My Light and has been launched in a four-page wraparound on Monday's Daily Mirror - saying it was a way for Philip Morris to get around the UK's anti-tobacco advertising rules. This video can not be played Have decades of anti-smoking campaigns had an effect? There is also a campaign video, which shows a young woman negotiating a Mission Impossible-style room in order to hand her cigarette lighter over to a group of friends, who are supporting her in a bid to give up smoking. Most forms of tobacco advertising and promotion in the UK are banned, andrules introduced last yearmean cigarettes and tobacco must be sold in plain green packets. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said Philip Morris was still advertising its Marlboro brand wherever globally it was legal to do so. ""The fact of the matter is that it can no longer do that in the UK, we're a dark market where all advertising, promotion and sponsorship is banned, and cigarettes are in plain packs. ""So instead Philip Morris is promoting the company name which is inextricably linked with Marlboro,"" she said. Philip Morris has said previously that it wants to achieve a ""smoke-free"" future. Like many tobacco firms, Philip Morris is moving towards a focus on new products to replace cigarettes as the number of smokers in the UK continues to decline. In the UK, it markets several alternatives to cigarettes, including a heated tobacco product, Iqos. It also owns the Nicocig, Vivid and Mesh e-cigarette brands. The firm's managing director Peter Nixon said its new advertising campaign was ""about supporting smokers in finding alternatives"". Asked why, if Philip Morris was so keen for smokers to quit, it did not simply stop making cigarettes and focus entirely on alternative products, he said it was because smokers would just switch to a rival product. ""Cigarettes still generate 87% of our business. We want to get to [smoke-free] as soon as possible, and we want to be selling alternatives, but it does take time,"" he said. Mr Nixon said the firm had invested over Â£4bn in developing alternative products to cigarettes. The campaign suggests four ways to give up cigarettes, including going cold turkey, using nicotine patches, vaping and using heated tobacco products. In an unusual move, the Daily Mirror made a reference in its editorial column to the advertising feature which envelops the paper. It said it was ""pleased to back the campaign"". It added: ""Yes, we were surprised too that this is a campaign created by Philip Morris Ltd. But it can only be a good thing that they are now trying to encourage people to quit cigarettes."" In July last year, the government set out a plan to make England, in effect, smoke-free in the next few decades. The newTobacco Control Plan,externalaimed to cut smoking rates from 15.5% to 12% of the population by 2022. Tobacco giant launches anti-smoking ad Is the vape shop boom about to end?

"Dr Martens' profits march forwardThe British footwear firm, which sells in 58 countries, sees sales and earnings rise.Business","Strong sales in Europe and the Middle East have boosted profits at UK footwear firm Dr Martens. Earnings grew 33% to Â£50m in the year to March, with sales up 20% to Â£348.6m. The Northamptonshire-based company, most famous for its distinctive boots, said it had seen double-digit growth in revenues and profits in all regions. It started production in Northampton in 1960, and although most of its boots are now made overseas about 70,000 a year are still made at the UK factory. Dr Martens makes more than half of its revenues from its most recognisable product, the 1460 boot and sister product the 1461 shoe. The company said 40% of its revenues came from selling direct to consumers. Over the year the company, which is owned by private equity firm Permira, opened 25 new stores, including nine in the UK, giving it a total of 94 owned stores worldwide. The company said it had ""spotted"" a number of high-profile people sporting its wares, including David and Brooklyn Beckham, Kanye West, Pharrel Williams and Cardi B. Paul Mason, chairman of Dr Martens, said: ""This has been a fantastic year for Dr Martens."" He said there was still ""significant scope for growth across our markets, particularly via our Direct to Consumer channels, and this will remain a strategic priority in the years ahead"". In the past year the company appointed a new chief executive, Kenny Wilson, whose previous job was at the retro-style homeware and fashion brand, Kath Kidston. Dr Martens' air-cushioned sole was developed by Munich-based Dr Maertens and Dr Funck and the UK patent rights were sold to R Griggs Group. The footwear that emerged from their collaboration was initially sold as a work boot, but was taken up by the early skinhead youth movement of the 1960s. The boots also become popular with punks in the 1970s and had a resurgence when Britpop emerged in the 1990s.

Staff said they were alerted by ""an unusual amount of roaring"" coming from the lion pen.

The Khashoggi story so far,"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death On 2 October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's government, walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was murdered. In the months that followed, conflicting narratives emerged over how he died, what happened to his remains, and who was responsible. Saudi officials said the journalist was killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom, while Turkish officials said the agents acted on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi government. As a prominent Saudi journalist, he covered major stories, including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of the late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, for various Saudi news organisations. For decades, the 59-year-old was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US in 2017. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of King Salman and Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler. In his first column for the Post in September 2017, Khashoggi said he had feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Read excerpts from some of his columns This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi first visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 28 September 2018 to obtain a Saudi document stating that he was divorced, so that he could marry his Turkish fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz. But he was told he would have to return to pick up the document and arranged to come back on 2 October. ""He did not believe that something bad could happen on Turkish soil,"" Ms Cengiz wrote in the Post. Ms Cengiz accompanied him to the entrance of the consulate on 2 October. He was last seen on CCTV footage entering the building at 13:14 local time. The journalist's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, waited for him outside the consulate for hours Despite reassuring friends that he would not face any problems inside, he gave Ms Cengiz two mobile phones and told her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not come back out. She ultimately waited for more than 10 hours outside the consulate and returned the following morning when Khashoggi had still not reappeared. For more than two weeks, Saudi Arabia consistently denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's fate. Prince Mohammed told Bloomberg News that the journalist had left the consulate ""after a few minutes or one hour"". ""We have nothing to hide,"" he added. Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? But in a change of tune on 20 October, the Saudi government said a preliminary investigation by prosecutors had concluded that the journalist died during a ""fight"" after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. Later, a Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold. The Saudi consulate initially said Khashoggi had left after completing paperwork On 15 November, Saudi Arabia's deputy public prosecutor Shalaan al-Shalaan said the murder was ordered by the head of a ""negotiations team"" sent to Istanbul by the Saudi deputy intelligence chief to bring Khashoggi back to the kingdom ""by means of persuasion"" or, if that failed, ""by force"". Investigators concluded that Khashoggi was forcibly restrained after a struggle and injected with a large amount of a drug, resulting in an overdose that led to his death, Mr Shalaan said. His body was then dismembered and handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the consulate for disposal, he added. Five individuals had confessed to the murder, Mr Shalaan asserted, adding: ""[The crown prince] did not have any knowledge about it."" The Saudi public prosecution said in late September 2018 that a total of 31 individuals were investigated over the killing and that 21 of them were arrested. Five senior government officials were also sacked, including Deputy Intelligence Chief Ahmad Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani, a senior aide to Prince Mohammed. In January 2019, 11 individuals - who have not been named - were put on trial at the Riyadh Criminal Court in connection with Khashoggi's murder, and the public prosecutor sought the death penalty for five of them. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" Human Rights Watch said the trial, which took place behind closed doors, did not meet international standards and that authorities ""obstructed meaningful accountability"". In December 2019, the court sentenced five individuals to death for ""committing and directly participating in the murder of the victim"". Three others were handed prison sentences totalling 24 years for ""covering up this crime and violating the law"", while the remaining three were found not guilty. The public prosecution said Mr Asiri was tried but acquitted ""due to insufficient evidence"", while Mr Qahtani was investigated over the killing but not charged. At a news conference following the verdict, Shalaan al-Shalaan said the public prosecution's investigation had shown that ""the killing was not premeditated"". Ms Callamard dismissed that assertion as ""utterly ridiculous"" and said the trial represented ""the antithesis of justice"", from which the ""masterminds"" walked free. Khashoggi's son Salah met Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince weeks after the murder But Khashoggi's son Salah, who lives in Saudi Arabia, tweeted: ""We affirm our confidence in the Saudi judiciary at all levels, that it has been fair to us and that justice has been achieved."" In May 2020, Salah Khashoggi announced that he and his brothers were ""pardoning those who killed our father, seeking reward from God almighty"", accepting the public prosecution's contention that the murder was not premeditated. Four months later, the Riyadh Criminal Court commuted the death sentences handed to five of the defendants to 20 years in prison. The three others were given sentences of between seven and 10 years. The prosecution said the verdicts were final and that the criminal trial was now closed. Ms Cengiz said the ruling made ""a complete mockery of justice"". ""The Saudi authorities are closing the case without the world knowing the truth of who is responsible for Jamal's murder,"" she added. ""Who planned it, who ordered it, where is his body? These are the most basic and important questions that remain totally unanswered."" Turkish officials said that a team of 15 Saudi agents, assisted by three intelligence officers, arrived in Istanbul in the days before the murder, and that the group removed the security cameras and surveillance footage from the consulate before Khashoggi's arrival. Istanbul's chief prosecutor, Irfan Fidan, said on 31 October 2018 that the journalist was suffocated almost as soon as entered the consulate, and that his body was dismembered and destroyed. Writing in the Washington Post on 2 November, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared it had been established that Khashoggi ""was killed in cold blood by a death squad"" and ""that his murder was premeditated"". ""Yet there are other, no less significant questions whose answers will contribute to our understanding of this deplorable act"" he added. ""Where is Khashoggi's body? Who is the 'local collaborator' to whom Saudi officials claimed to have handed over Khashoggi's remains? Who gave the order to kill this kind soul? Unfortunately, the Saudi authorities have refused to answer those questions."" Mr Erdogan said he knew the order to kill Khashoggi ""came from the highest levels of the Saudi government"", but that he did ""not believe for a second that King Salman, the custodian of the holy mosques, ordered the hit"". In March 2020, the Istanbul chief prosecutor formally charged Saad al-Qahtani, Ahmad Asiri and 18 other Saudi nationals with murder. Prince Mohammed's two former aides were accused of ""instigating a premeditated murder with the intent of [causing] torment through fiendish instinct"". The others were charged with carrying out ""a premeditated murder with the intent of [causing] torment through fiendish instincts"". Saudi Arabia rejected Turkey's extradition request, so all 20 men were put on trial in absentia in Istanbul in July 2020. Court-appointed Turkish lawyers representing the defendants said their clients denied the charges. In November, the court accepted a second indictment adding another six Saudis to the case. A vice-consul and an attachÃ© were accused of ""premeditated murder with monstrous intent"". The four others were charged with destroying, concealing or tampering with evidence. A report released in June 2019 by Agnes Callamard, the special rapporteur, concluded that Khashoggi's death ""constituted an extrajudicial killing for which the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible"". She also found there was ""credible evidence"" to warrant an investigation into Prince Mohammed and other high-level Saudi officials, and said the prince should be subject to the targeted sanctions already imposed by some UN member states against other named individuals allegedly involved in the killing. Ms Callamard said both the investigations into Khashoggi's death by Saudi Arabia and Turkey ""failed to meet international standards"". This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" She called for the trial in Saudi Arabia of the 11 suspects to be suspended, saying it would ""not deliver credible accountability"". ""The trial is held behind closed doors; the identity of those charged has not been released nor is the identity of those facing the death penalty. At the time of writing, at least one of those identified as responsible for the planning and organising of the execution of Mr Khashoggi has not been charged,"" she noted. The Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, rejected the report, tweeting that it was ""nothing new"" and contained ""clear contradictions and baseless allegations which challenge its credibility"". ""The Saudi judiciary is the sole party qualified to deal with the Khashoggi case and works with full independence,"" he added. Saudi prince 'may be liable for Khashoggi death' In mid-November 2018, Turkey's government said it had shared audio recordings of the killing with Saudi Arabia, the US, the UK, Germany and France. While not officially made public, details of the recordings were included in Ms Callamard's report. The UN special rapporteur noted that she was not able to obtain copies of the recordings from Turkish intelligence or authenticate them. This video can not be played The Jamal Khashoggi secret tapes explained But in one recording, her report says, two Saudi officials are apparently heard discussing how to cut up and transport Khashoggi's body just minutes before the journalist entered the consulate. One is quoted as saying: ""The body is heavy. First time I cut on the ground. If we take plastic bags and cut it into pieces, it will be finished."" At the end of the conversation, the other asks whether ""the sacrificial animal"" has arrived. A later conversation recorded inside the consul general's office purportedly features Khashoggi being told by officials: ""We will have to take you back. There is an order from Interpol. Interpol requested you to be sent back. We are coming to get you."" The reports quotes Khashoggi as replying that ""there isn't a case against me. I notified some people outside; they are waiting for me; a driver is waiting for me."" At 13:33 local time, he is heard saying: ""There is a towel here. Are you going to give me drugs?"" Someone responds: ""We will anaesthetise you."" The report says the conversation was followed by sounds of a struggle, during which people are heard saying, ""Did he sleep?"", ""He raises his head,"" and ""Keep pushing."" Later, there are sounds of movement, heavy panting, and plastic sheets. Turkish intelligence identified the sound of a saw at 13:39, but Ms Callamard said she and her delegation could not make out the sources of the sounds they heard. Investigators searched Belgrad forest for Khashoggi's body Assessments of the recordings by intelligence officers in Turkey and other countries suggest Khashoggi could have been injected with a sedative and then suffocated using a plastic bag, according to the special rapporteur. Turkish officials were not granted access to the Saudi consulate for DNA testing until more than two weeks after the incident. The special rapporteur said there was credible evidence that crime scenes had been ""thoroughly, even forensically, cleaned"" before investigators arrived. Among the areas searched for Khashoggi's remains are the Belgrad forest, which a consular attachÃ© visited on 1 October 2018, and the coastal town of Yalova, the location of a farmhouse allegedly owned by a Saudi national. None of those put on trial have been identified by Saudi prosecutors, but the report by the UN special rapporteur named them, citing information from ""various governments' sources"". According to the report, the five facing the death penalty were Fahad Shabib Albalawi; Turki Muserref Alshehri; Waleed Abdullah Alshehri; Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, an intelligence officer who the US says worked for the crowd prince's aide Saud al-Qahtani; and Dr Salah Mohammed Tubaigy, a forensic doctor with the interior ministry. The other six defendants were Mansour Othman Abahussain; Mohammed Saad Alzahrani; Mustafa Mohammed Almadani; Saif Saad Alqahtani; Muflih Shaya Almuslih, reportedly a member of the consulate staff; and Ahmad Asiri, the former deputy intelligence chief. According to interviews conducted by the special rapporteur, the defendants' lawyers argued during a court hearing in January that they were ""state employees and could not object to the orders of their superiors"". Turkish officials identified these men as Saudis suspected of involvement in Khashoggi's murder Three defendants allegedly said that Khashoggi ""started screaming, so they covered his mouth to prevent him from making noise, which accidentally killed him"", according to the report. Ms Callamard noted that she had heard no screaming in the audio recordings from the consulate. Mr Asiri was cited as telling the court that he had ""never ordered the use of force"" to bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia. Nine of the defendants named by Ms Callamard were previously identified by Turkish officials as members of the 15-strong team of agents sent to Istanbul. Most of the agents arrived at and departed from the city's airport by private or commercial jet the same day as Khashoggi's killing. CCTV footage appears to show vehicles driving them to the consulate, and two hours after Khashoggi's arrival, some of them heading to the consul's residence. The special rapporteur said three men were filmed entering the residence with what seemed like plastic trash bags, and at least one rolling suitcase. Khashoggi's killing was internationally condemned and caused a diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and some of its closest allies, including the US. After the murder was confirmed by the Saudis, then US President Donald Trump described it as the ""worst cover-up in history"". However, he defended US ties to the kingdom, a key trading partner. Analysing Trump's Saudi statement line by line Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West This response was widely derided by senators in Congress, who pointed the finger at Prince Mohammed. According to US media reports, the CIA - whose director heard the consulate audio recordings - concluded with ""medium to high confidence"" that Prince Mohammed ordered Khashoggi's killing. Mr Trump denied that and his administration defied a legal requirement to release an unclassified report identifying anyone implicated in ""the directing, ordering or tampering of evidence"" in the case. His successor, Joe Biden, has said he will declassify the report. The US, Canada, France and the UK all levied sanctions against 18 Saudis allegedly linked to the killing. The Saudi crown prince was not among them. Germany, Finland and Denmark were among the European nations to cancel arms deals with Saudi Arabia after the killing.

Crew suspensions over run aground ferry,"This video can not be played An eyewitness describes hearing shouting in the ""disorientating"" thick fog The master and mate of a car ferry that struck yachts and ran aground off the Isle of Wight have been suspended. The Red Falcon ran aground in fog off East Cowes on Sunday morning, weeks after another vessel operated by Red Funnel tore yachts from their moorings. Red Funnel said the suspensions were ""standard industry practice"" and it was changing its procedures on operating in restricted visibility. The owner of a yacht which sank said he has been contacted by the ferry firm. Nigel Minchin told BBC News ""it was obviously a big embarrassment for them"" after being called by Red Funnel's CEO Fran Collins on Sunday evening. Nigel Minchin said his yacht, pictured in about 1980, has been moored in Cowes for many years The mast of the sunken yacht could be seen in Cowes Harbour after the crash Mr Minchin's yacht, Greylag, which he has moored in Cowes since 1980, was recovered on Monday. A Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) investigation has begun. The ferry company said the master and mate had been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. The vehicle ferry, which left Southampton for East Cowes at 07:00 BST, ran aground an hour later while entering the harbour in low visibility, coming to a halt about 50m (165ft) off the esplanade. School to enforce 'silent corridor' rule 'I don't trust people after drink spike' Police chief calls for fireworks sale ban Forty passengers were stuck on board until the vessel was refloated three hours later. No-one was injured. It comes after a catamaran and a channel marker post werestruck by sister ship Red Eagleand two yachts were later found drifting early on 27 September. The two incidents are understood to involve different ships masters. A channel marker post was struck during the incident on 27 September Fran Collins, Red Funnel's CEO, said she was ""concerned"" about the two incidents. ""It's too early to speculate about the similarities, if any, with the last incident, but they both happened in restricted visibility so we're making immediate changes to our operating procedures to prevent any reoccurrence,"" she said. ""They are around how we look at what the visibility conditions are like... we're looking at putting tighter limits on that and slight changes for how the bridge teams operate."" She insisted the craft were ""fully manned and in full compliance with all the regulations"". An inspection carried out in Southampton later on Sunday confirmed there was no damage to the hull of the Red Falcon and the ship has since returned to service. Red Funnel said it had handed over chart plots of the ferry's movements which are recorded electronically to the MAIB. The Red Falcon ran aground while entering Cowes Harbour in dense fog Passenger Ed Anderson, from Guildford, said the thick fog had ""really set in"" as the vessel approached Cowes. He described being in his car waiting to approach the quayside when he felt it ""go into reverse quite rapidly"". ""Full credit to Red Funnel staff and crew - they were excellent and made sure we were fed and watered and kept informed of what was happening. I suppose it could have been quite stressful.""

"Brexit about UK's future, not mine - May","This video can not be played Theresa May: âThere are four steps we need to take.â Theresa May has said she is prepared to ""explore every possible option"" to break the deadlock in Brexit talks. She told MPs 95% of the terms of exit were agreed but the Irish border was still a ""considerable sticking point"". While willing to consider extending the UK's transition period beyond 2020, she said this was ""undesirable"" and would have to end ""well before"" May 2022. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said the Tories were ""terminally incompetent and hamstrung by their own divisions"". And the European Parliament Brexit's co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt has said the withdrawal agreement was 90% complete, rather than the figure of 95% given by Mrs May. The Irish border remained the biggest stumbling block, he told a committee in Strasbourg, but he was confident a deal could be agreed before the EU summit in December. Commons Live: MPs question ministers on Brexit Abuse of Theresa May condemned by politicians Commons bid to block EU Brexit 'backstop' Brexit: All you need to know This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn called PM's statement a âmixture of failure, denial and delusion,"" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, speaking to the BBC in New York, said speculation about the Conservative leadership was ""unhelpful"" and some of the language that had been used about Mrs May was ""dreadful"". He said Tory MPs ""need to give her the space to finish the negotiation,"" adding ""it is very difficult to negotiate with the European Union when you also have to negotiate with your own colleagues"". The PM had his ""full support"", said the leading Brexiteer, and ""she is - and will be - the prime minister that leads us out of the European Union at the end of March 2019"". Hopes of reaching agreement on the terms of the UK's exit by the end of the year have been held up by a lack of a solution to the Irish border issue. At last week's EU summit, European leaders refused to sign off plans for a special Brexit meeting in November to seal the withdrawal agreement, saying insufficient progress had been made. But updating MPs, Mrs May insisted the process was moving in the right direction, with the future status of Gibraltar and the UK's RAF bases in Cyprus having been settled in recent days. ""Taking all of this together, 95% of the Withdrawal Agreement and its protocols are now settled."" This video can not be played Theresa May has my full support - Liam Fox She urged the EU to do more to ensure commitments entered into by both sides to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland were honoured by whatever means necessary. One idea is to extend the transition period, currently due to end on 31 December 2020, to give the two sides more time to agree their future economic partnership and ensure controversial contingency plans, the so-called Irish backstop, do not ever come into force.

Addison Lee plans self-driving taxis by 2021,"Would you trust a taxi with no driver? Taxi firm Addison Lee is betting its customers will be ready to, in London at least, in just three years' time. It has joined forces with self-driving software specialist Oxbotica, and says the tie-up means it will offer self-driving taxis in the capital by 2021. The move will pit it against rival ride-hailing app Uber, which is also planning to roll out driverless cars on its network in the future, pending regulatory permission. Addison Lee says it will now work with Oxbotica on digitally mapping public roads in and around the capital. The detailed maps will record the position of kerbs, road signs and traffic lights in preparation for autonomous cars. Addison boss Andy Boland said it hopes to offer shared minibus shuttles to passengers, to use to get to work, to study or to the airport. He said the technology would help the firm ""address congestion, free space used for parking and improve urban air quality"". Why you have (probably) already bought your last car Critics say the tech behind driverless cars still needs a lot of work The industry has been forecast to be worth Â£28bn in the UK by 2035. Mr Boland said he wanted Addison Lee to be at the ""forefront"" of the shift to self-driving cars. The firm, which is owned by private equity giant Carlyle, reported a Â£20.8m annual loss in its most recent results to August last year. It blamed investment on transforming ""from a London private hire business to a global premium ground transport provider"" for the disappointing performance. Self-driving cars have been hailed as the future of the ride-hailing industry as well as a way to reduce traffic accidents. Other companies including Ford, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler and car supplier Bosch are also investing in the development of self-driving vehicles. However, there have been warnings that the technology is being deployed before it is ready. Earlier this year,Uber temporarily suspended self-driving car testsin all cities in the US and Canada following a fatal accident. ChancellorPhilip Hammond said last yearhe wanted to have ""fully driverless cars"" without a safety attendant on board in use by 2021.

UK urged to take back IS 'foreign fighters',"Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces A senior US military commander has called on the UK to take back Islamic State fighters who have been ""caught on the battlefield"" in Syria. Maj Gen Patrick Roberson, commander of US special ops, also called on the government to repatriate two Londoners who have been called the ""IS Beatles"". The UK says El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey have been stripped of their British citizenship. The government is negotiating for them to face trial in the US. Speaking to the BBC from a jail in Syriain August, Mr Elsheikh and Mr Kotey disputed the claim that they had been stripped of their British citizenship. So-called 'IS Beatles dispute extradition Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? Where should the 'IS Beatles' be tried? Asked whether Mr Elsheik and Mr Kotey should be repatriated to the UK, Gen Roberson told the BBC: ""We would certainly like them to be."" He said the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the US were ""working very hard to make sure that the countries of origin get these foreign terrorist fighters back into their custody"". So far only a handful have done that. Gen Roberson admitted it was a decision for each country involved, but he added: ""I think the SDF and us would certainly like them to be repatriated to where they came from."" He is the first senior US military officer to publicly call on the UK to take back its nationals and former nationals. US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces say they have captured 700 foreign fighters from more than 40 nations, including the UK. The SDF has not said how many are British - or former British nationals - but it is believed to be fewer than a dozen. Mr Elsheikh and Mr Kotey, who were captured in January, are believed to be part of an IS cell which became known as ""the Beatles' by their hostages because of their UK accents. The two men were associated with another Briton, Mohammed Emwazi - also known as ""Jihadi John"". He was seen in a number of high profile IS execution videos that showed the beheading of Western hostages, including US and British citizens. Emwazi was killed in a US drone strike in Raqqa, Syria, in 2015. The UK government has been in discussions with officials in Washington  about sending the pair to the US to stand trial over their alleged involvement in the killing of a number of hostages. If found guilty, they could face the death penalty. Both men have questioned whether they could be stripped of their citizenship and tried in the US. The comments of Gen Roberson suggest the US would prefer them to stand trial in the UK. The mother of Mr Elsheikh has begun a legal challenge against the British government. At a hearing at the High Court earlier this month, lawyers for the government confirmed that Mr Elsheikh had been stripped of his UK nationality in December 2014. They have argued that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute him in the UK. Mr Elsheikh's mother is challenging Home Secretary Sajid Javid's decision to share evidence with US authorities without seeking assurances the men would not face execution if they were extradited and tried there.

Dr Martens' profits march forward,"Strong sales in Europe and the Middle East have boosted profits at UK footwear firm Dr Martens. Earnings grew 33% to Â£50m in the year to March, with sales up 20% to Â£348.6m. The Northamptonshire-based company, most famous for its distinctive boots, said it had seen double-digit growth in revenues and profits in all regions. It started production in Northampton in 1960, and although most of its boots are now made overseas about 70,000 a year are still made at the UK factory. Dr Martens makes more than half of its revenues from its most recognisable product, the 1460 boot and sister product the 1461 shoe. The company said 40% of its revenues came from selling direct to consumers. Over the year the company, which is owned by private equity firm Permira, opened 25 new stores, including nine in the UK, giving it a total of 94 owned stores worldwide. The company said it had ""spotted"" a number of high-profile people sporting its wares, including David and Brooklyn Beckham, Kanye West, Pharrel Williams and Cardi B. Paul Mason, chairman of Dr Martens, said: ""This has been a fantastic year for Dr Martens."" He said there was still ""significant scope for growth across our markets, particularly via our Direct to Consumer channels, and this will remain a strategic priority in the years ahead"". In the past year the company appointed a new chief executive, Kenny Wilson, whose previous job was at the retro-style homeware and fashion brand, Kath Kidston. Dr Martens' air-cushioned sole was developed by Munich-based Dr Maertens and Dr Funck and the UK patent rights were sold to R Griggs Group. The footwear that emerged from their collaboration was initially sold as a work boot, but was taken up by the early skinhead youth movement of the 1960s. The boots also become popular with punks in the 1970s and had a resurgence when Britpop emerged in the 1990s.

Universities face grade inflation crackdown,"More than a quarter of students are now graduating with a first-class degree A surge in the number of first-class degrees awarded at university has led the government to bring in measures to tackle so-called grade inflation. Figures suggest that degrees are being ""marked up"", meaning students are leaving with a higher grade than a comparable student in previous years. More than a quarter of students now graduate with a first-class degree. Universities could now be penalised in the government's rating system if they award too many top grades. ""When you look at what makes our universities so prestigious, it comes down to the value of our degrees,"" said Universities Minister Sam Gyimah. ""The value of those degrees is threatened by grade inflation and that is a problem for students, employers and the universities themselves."" Figures released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that 26% of students graduate with a first-class degree, up from 18% in 2012-13. The increase is part of a longer term trend. In the early 1990s, only about 8% of students achieved a first. University first-class degrees soaring Too many firsts 'risks universities' credibility' University grade inflation disputed Universities are their own degree-awarding bodies and decide their own grades, but the government plans to use its rating system,the Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework (TEF),external, to discourage lower standards. Introduced in 2017, the TEF ranks universities as gold, silver or bronze by assessing multiple factors such as the student experience and quality of teaching. A panel of experts will review evidence on whether each university is awarding excessive numbers of firsts and 2:1s. A spokesman for Universities UK, which represents higher education institutions, said it would propose its own measures to prevent grade inflation. ""It is essential that students, employers and the public have confidence in the ongoing value of a UK degree,"" he said. But he said there could also be legitimate reasons for the rise in top degrees, including greater investment in the quality of teaching and technology. Some students say the fees of about Â£9,000 a year introduced in 2012 mean that many are working harder to ensure they get value for money. Sophie Wilson, who graduated last year with a first in English Literature from Sheffield University, said she worked from 9am to 8pm most days, despite struggling with depression. ""I think it's ridiculous that it's being devalued. It's more likely that people are working hard because uni is so expensive these days,"" she said. Research in 2014 by Lancaster Universityfound that improvements in degree grades were in line with the rising quality of the intake, as shown by A-level grades. The only sign of ""leniency"" was among top universities, which researchers found were 8% more likely to award higher degrees than they were in 2005, after taking into account the improved student intake. But others say that with little oversight of their degree-awarding powers, universities have an incentive to offer high grades. ""There are people who think the system isn't as robust as it might be,""Nick Hillman, head of the Higher Education Policy Institute told the BBC last year.

"Brexit about UK's future, not mine - MayThe prime minister will tell MPs progress is being made after a weekend of speculation about her job.UK Politics","This video can not be played Theresa May: âThere are four steps we need to take.â Theresa May has said she is prepared to ""explore every possible option"" to break the deadlock in Brexit talks. She told MPs 95% of the terms of exit were agreed but the Irish border was still a ""considerable sticking point"". While willing to consider extending the UK's transition period beyond 2020, she said this was ""undesirable"" and would have to end ""well before"" May 2022. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said the Tories were ""terminally incompetent and hamstrung by their own divisions"". And the European Parliament Brexit's co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt has said the withdrawal agreement was 90% complete, rather than the figure of 95% given by Mrs May. The Irish border remained the biggest stumbling block, he told a committee in Strasbourg, but he was confident a deal could be agreed before the EU summit in December. Commons Live: MPs question ministers on Brexit Abuse of Theresa May condemned by politicians Commons bid to block EU Brexit 'backstop' Brexit: All you need to know This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn called PM's statement a âmixture of failure, denial and delusion,"" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, speaking to the BBC in New York, said speculation about the Conservative leadership was ""unhelpful"" and some of the language that had been used about Mrs May was ""dreadful"". He said Tory MPs ""need to give her the space to finish the negotiation,"" adding ""it is very difficult to negotiate with the European Union when you also have to negotiate with your own colleagues"". The PM had his ""full support"", said the leading Brexiteer, and ""she is - and will be - the prime minister that leads us out of the European Union at the end of March 2019"". Hopes of reaching agreement on the terms of the UK's exit by the end of the year have been held up by a lack of a solution to the Irish border issue. At last week's EU summit, European leaders refused to sign off plans for a special Brexit meeting in November to seal the withdrawal agreement, saying insufficient progress had been made. But updating MPs, Mrs May insisted the process was moving in the right direction, with the future status of Gibraltar and the UK's RAF bases in Cyprus having been settled in recent days. ""Taking all of this together, 95% of the Withdrawal Agreement and its protocols are now settled."" This video can not be played Theresa May has my full support - Liam Fox She urged the EU to do more to ensure commitments entered into by both sides to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland were honoured by whatever means necessary. One idea is to extend the transition period, currently due to end on 31 December 2020, to give the two sides more time to agree their future economic partnership and ensure controversial contingency plans, the so-called Irish backstop, do not ever come into force. Both Tory Brexiteers and Remainers worry this would delay further the moment of the UK's proper departure from the EU, and potentially cost billions in terms of extra payments. But Mrs May told MPs that protecting the UK's integrity was so important that she had a duty to explore ""every possible solution"" to keeping the Irish border open and ensuring no new barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

Drugs 'may extend breast cancer survival'Combining a drug with hormone therapy may extend the lives of some women with advanced breast cancer.Health,"Combining a pioneering drug with hormone therapy may extend the survival of some women with advanced breast cancer, a trial suggests. Women who received palbociclib and hormone therapy lived up to 10 months longer than those given hormone treatment alone. It also delayed the time at which women needed to begin chemotherapy, which often has debilitating side-effects. Experts say the preliminary results of the trial are very encouraging. But they point out that the treatment is not a cure and will not work for everyone. 'Remarkable' therapy beats terminal breast cancer Bacon and sausages 'linked to breast cancer' Rachael Bland's cancer podcast wins award The placebo-controlled clinical trial tested the benefit of adding palbociclib to the hormone therapy fulvestrant in a trial of 521 women with advanced, oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancer whose tumours did not have the HER2 gene. Oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancers are the most common form of breast cancer, accounting for about 70% of cases. The study, led by researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, examined what effect palbociclib had on women's overall survival and whether it could delay the need for chemotherapy. The analysis found that in women whose tumours had previously responded well to hormone therapy (410 of the 521 women), the treatment extended survival by 10 months to an average of 39.7 months, compared with 29.7 months in the women who received fulvestrant and a dummy pill (placebo). However, the treatment did not extend survival in those who had previously not responded well to hormone therapy. Three years after they were enrolled in the study, 49.6% of women who received both palbociclib and fulvestrant were still alive, compared with 40.8% of women who were treated with fulvestrant alone. The group of women given the combination treatment also had a nine-month longer delay until the start of chemotherapy. Prof Nicholas Turner, who led the study, said: ""The development of palbociclib is one of the biggest advances in treatment for women with advanced breast cancer in the last two decades. ""This drug can offer women more precious time with their loved ones, and because it is a targeted treatment it is much kinder than chemotherapy, and enables many women to carry on with their lives normally."" Palbociclib was approved for use in England by NICE in November 2017, but currently is only available for women with oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who were diagnosed after the disease had begun to spread. The authors of this new study want it to also be made available to women whose breast cancer has previously been treated with hormone therapy.

Australia apologises to sex abuse victims,"This video can not be played Australian PM: âWhen a child spoke up, they werenât believedâ Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has given a national apology to victims of child sexual abuse. Hundreds of people gathered in Canberra on Monday to hear Mr Morrison deliver the emotional address in parliament. It follows a five-year inquiry which found tens of thousands of children had suffered abuse in the nation's institutions over decades. ""Today, we finally acknowledge and confront the lost screams of our children,"" he said. ""We must be so humble to fall before those who were forsaken and beg to them our apology."" The inquiry, which concluded last December, heard more than 8,000 testimonies from victims about abuse in organisations such as churches, schools and sports clubs. Why some victims shunned the apology Sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' 'I feel like a weight has been lifted' With his voice trembling at times, Mr Morrison acknowledged the suffering of victims and condemned institutional failures. ""Why were the cries of children and parents ignored? Why was our system of justice blind to injustice? Why has it taken so long to act?"" he said. Survivors shed tears and held hands as the apology was given, but some later expressed frustration at the government's wider response to the inquiry. Members of the public watch the apology in a parliamentary gallery ""As one survivor recently said to me: 'It wasn't a foreign enemy who did this to us. This was done by Australians to Australians, enemies in our midst, enemies in our midst.' The enemies of innocence. It happened day after day, week after week, month after month, decade after decade, unrelenting torment. When a child spoke up, they weren't believed and the crimes continued with impunity. One survivor told me that when he told a teacher of his abuse, that teacher then became his next abuser: trust broken, innocence betrayed, power and position exploited for evil, dark crimes."" Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten told parliament: ""There are wrongs that cannot be made right. But know that today, Australia says sorry."" The parliament later stood for a minute of silence. Victims and their supporters travelled from around the nation to hear the apology in Canberra. ""They are coming with very heavy hearts,"" said Leonie Sheedy, the chief executive of Care Leavers Australasia Network. ""It is a wonderful thing our country's apologising, but there is so much more work to be done."" Child sex abuse survivor Carolyn Unwin was at parliament on Monday One survivor told the BBC: ""For me it gave me a lot of comfort to hear [the apology]. At least we lived long enough to hear it."" Many survivors have criticised the government's response to the inquiry - especially its terms for a national compensation scheme. Victims are eligible for payments of up to A$150,000 (Â£80,000; $106,000) each.Some say the compensation is not enough, and onerous to obtain. Mr Morrison said the government had accepted most recommendations from the inquiry, but it was still considering the remaining proposals. Those not yet adopted include recommendations where federal and state responsibilities overlap. The most contentious is a proposal to make reporting abuse mandatory. In August,the Catholic Church formally rejected that call- meaning it will not force priests to break confession rules. On Monday, Mr Morrison committed to establishing a museum of remembrance to memorialise victims' stories. Hywel Griffith, BBC News in Canberra Deep in symbolism, decades overdue - the word ""sorry"" can mean so much and yet change so little. For many, the apology brings recognition of their pain, suffering and anger. But inevitably, for thousands of others who have died - many through suicide - it has all come far too late. Many of those gathered in Canberra tell me the real test of the government's sincerity will be in how it responds to the remaining recommendations. While the apology carries real weight, many survivors want greater action. In their final report, the commissioners said: ""It is not a case of a few 'rotten apples'. Society's major institutions have seriously failed."" They said over 15,000 people had contacted the inquiry, raising allegations against more than 4,000 institutions. Religious ministers and school teachers were the most commonly reported perpetrators. The greatest number were in Catholic institutions. All states and territories, and many institutions, have since signed up to the federal government-led compensation scheme.

Drugs 'may extend breast cancer survival',"Combining a pioneering drug with hormone therapy may extend the survival of some women with advanced breast cancer, a trial suggests. Women who received palbociclib and hormone therapy lived up to 10 months longer than those given hormone treatment alone. It also delayed the time at which women needed to begin chemotherapy, which often has debilitating side-effects. Experts say the preliminary results of the trial are very encouraging. But they point out that the treatment is not a cure and will not work for everyone. 'Remarkable' therapy beats terminal breast cancer Bacon and sausages 'linked to breast cancer' Rachael Bland's cancer podcast wins award The placebo-controlled clinical trial tested the benefit of adding palbociclib to the hormone therapy fulvestrant in a trial of 521 women with advanced, oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancer whose tumours did not have the HER2 gene. Oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancers are the most common form of breast cancer, accounting for about 70% of cases. The study, led by researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, examined what effect palbociclib had on women's overall survival and whether it could delay the need for chemotherapy. The analysis found that in women whose tumours had previously responded well to hormone therapy (410 of the 521 women), the treatment extended survival by 10 months to an average of 39.7 months, compared with 29.7 months in the women who received fulvestrant and a dummy pill (placebo). However, the treatment did not extend survival in those who had previously not responded well to hormone therapy. Three years after they were enrolled in the study, 49.6% of women who received both palbociclib and fulvestrant were still alive, compared with 40.8% of women who were treated with fulvestrant alone. The group of women given the combination treatment also had a nine-month longer delay until the start of chemotherapy. Prof Nicholas Turner, who led the study, said: ""The development of palbociclib is one of the biggest advances in treatment for women with advanced breast cancer in the last two decades. ""This drug can offer women more precious time with their loved ones, and because it is a targeted treatment it is much kinder than chemotherapy, and enables many women to carry on with their lives normally."" Palbociclib was approved for use in England by NICE in November 2017, but currently is only available for women with oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who were diagnosed after the disease had begun to spread. The authors of this new study want it to also be made available to women whose breast cancer has previously been treated with hormone therapy. Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said the results were ""very encouraging"". ""Although the treatment gave some people with breast cancer precious extra months, it's not a cure, and won't work for everyone.

'Super-sized' mice threat to seabirds,"A Tristan albatross on Gough Island: Their future is now at risk Super-sized mice are killing millions of seabird chicks on a remote island in the South Atlantic, threatening some rare species with extinction. According to a study from the RSPB, the mice have learned to eat the eggs and chicks of the many millions of birds that make Gough Island their home. The group says that without action, the endangered Tristan albatross is likely to go extinct. A campaign is planned to eradicate the mice entirely in 2020. Restoring South Georgia's wildlife paradise Same-sex mice have babies Gough Island is a remote UK Overseas Territory, considered to be one of the world's most important seabird colonies, hosting more than 10 million birds. A Gough Island albatross chick. The mice eat them alive Mice were introduced to the 91-sq-km volcanic island by sailors during the 19th Century. The rodents have adapted to the limited resources on the small piece of land by developing a taste for seabird eggs and chicks. Video cameras have recorded groups of up to nine mice eating the chicks alive. As a result of their success, the mice have become ""super-sized"". They are about 50% larger than a domestic mouse. ""Many of the seabirds on Gough are small and nest in burrows,"" said Dr Anthony Caravaggi, from University College Cork, in the Republic of Ireland. ""The chicks are smaller and have no escape route, so for an opportunistic mouse these chicks constitute relatively easy prey. ""The mice have done so well that they've grown bigger and are now attacking all seabirds, even Tristan albatross chicks, which are far bigger than other, smaller sea-going birds."" One of the larger than average mice that are now wreaking havoc on Gough island According to Dr Caravaggi's study, at least two million chicks are being lost on an annual basis. The big worries are the rare species on Gough, especially the Tristan albatross. Just 2,000 pairs now remain. The albatrosses mate for life and produce just one egg every other year. Parents have been recorded returning with food to find their chicks dead in the nest. Their extinction looks certain within a number of decades. ""In a very short space of time, the Tristan albatross will be lost and this is also true for a number of other species,"" said Dr Caravaggi. ""Even though the Tristan is the headline here, a great number of others, including the Atlantic petrel and MacGillivray's prion will follow suit if the mice aren't removed."" Given that the mice have adapted to the opportunity that the seabirds present, why haven't the seabirds also reacted to the threat? An Atlantic Yellow nosed albatross ""The fact is that these bird species evolved to live on islands free from predators; that's why you get so many seabirds there,"" said Dr Alex Bond, from the Natural History Museum, another author on the paper. ""For mice there are maybe new generations twice a year, but for birds like the Tristan albatross, they spend their first 10 years out at sea, so it takes a really long time for these behavioural mechanisms to kick in."" The RSPB, in conjunction with the government of Tristan da Cunha, who are custodians of Gough island, have developed a plan to wipe the mice out completely. The operation is due to take place in 2020. Given the location of the island, it is an enormous logistical challenge. It involves chartering a ship from South Africa, which will carry two helicopters and a load of poisonous, cereal pellets. These will then be spread across the island by the helicopters. They contain an anticoagulant which should kill the mice within 24 hours. ""Ridding islands of invasive species has been done on around 700 islands worldwide,"" said Dr Bond. ""So this isn't some novel thing we are doing; this is a tried-and-tested technique that can deliver the solution we need.""

Abuse of homeless 'should be hate crime',"Nearly a half of rough sleepers have felt ""intimidated"", according to a survey Attacks on people sleeping rough should be treated as hate crimes, the Liverpool mayor has said. Joe Anderson said rough sleepers should be a ""protected category"" in a letter to the home secretary aftera review of hate crime lawswas recently announced. It would send the message that the attacks ""will never be tolerated"". Homeless charity Crisis said ""changing the label... is not the answer"", adding it was more important that victims feel they can ask authorities for support. Joe Anderson says abuse of rough sleepers should not be tolerated Writing to Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Mr Anderson said people who sleep rough ""face ongoing risks above and beyond most other groups"". He cited Crisis findings from 2016,,externalwhich said nearly a third of those surveyed said they had been deliberately hit or had faced other types of violence.

Gorbachev warns on US nuclear treaty planThe ex-Soviet president says scrapping a Cold War missile deal will undermine nuclear disarmament.US & Canada,"Mr Gorbachev has questioned the sense of withdrawing from the INF Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev says US President Trump's plan to withdraw from a key Cold War nuclear weapons treaty is a reversal of efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament. Mr Gorbachev - who signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with President Reagan in 1987 - questioned the plan's intelligence. Mr Trump said Russia had been ""violating [the INF] for many years"". Russia has condemned the plans and threatened to retaliate. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin would be seeking an explanation from visiting US National Security Adviser John Bolton. Germany was the first US ally to criticise the move, with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas urging Washington to consider the consequences both for Europe and for future disarmament efforts. The INF banned ground-launched medium-range missiles, with a range of between 500 and 5,500km (310-3,400 miles). Mr Gorbachev and Mr Reagan signed the INF treaty in 1987 It was signed near the end of the Cold War, a period of relations between the US and the Soviet Union from 1945 to 1989 marked by intense international tension and overshadowed by the threat of nuclear conflict. In the past five decades the US and Russia have signed a range of joint agreements to limit and reduce their substantial nuclear arsenals. The last General Secretary of the Soviet Union Appointed in 1985, his domestic reforms and nuclear disarmament deals helped end the Cold War Resigned as Soviet president in 1991 after Soviet republics declared independence Read more:The man who lost an empire President Trump said the US would not let Russia ""go out and do weapons [while] we're not allowed to"". ""I don't know why President [Barack] Obama didn't negotiate or pull out,"" the president said of the INF treaty after a campaign rally in Nevada. Russia denies breaking missile treaty Tensions rise as US threatens to 'take out' Russian missiles In 2014,President Obama accused Russia of breaching the INFafter it allegedly tested a ground-launched cruise missile. He reportedly chose not to withdraw from the treaty under pressure from European leaders, who said such a move could restart an arms race. ""This would be a very dangerous step that, I'm sure, not only will not be comprehended by the international community but will provoke serious condemnation,"" Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. The treaty is ""significant for international security and security in the sphere of nuclear arms, for the maintenance of strategic stability,"" he told state news agency Tass. The minister also told the news agency RIA Novosti that if the US continued to behave ""clumsily and crudely"" and backed out of international agreements, ""then we will have no choice but to undertake retaliatory measures, including involving military technology"". ""But we would not want to get to this stage,"" he added. Analysis by BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus Concern about Russia's development and deployment of a missile system that breaches the INF treaty predates the Trump administration. But the president's decision to walk away from the agreement marks a significant setback for arms control. Many experts believe that negotiations should have continued to try to bring the Russians back into compliance. It is, they fear, part of the wider unravelling of the whole system of arms control treaties that helped to curb strategic competition during the Cold War. Other factors too may have played into President Trump's decision. This was a bilateral treaty between Washington and Moscow. China was free to develop and deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles. Some in the Trump administration feel that the INF treaty places them at a growing disadvantage in their developing  strategic rivalry with Beijing . The US insists the Russians have, in breach of the deal, developed a new medium-range missile called the Novator 9M729 - known to Nato as the SSC-8. It would enable Russia to launch a nuclear strike at Nato countries at very short notice. Russia has said little about its new missile other than to deny that it is in breach of the agreement. Analysts say Russia sees such weapons as a cheaper alternative to conventional forces. The New York Times reported on Fridaythe US was considering withdrawing from the treaty in a bid to counter China's expanding military presence,externalin the western Pacific. China was not a signatory of the deal, allowing it to develop medium-range missiles without restraint. The last time the US withdrew from a major arms treaty was in 2002, when President George W Bush pulled the US out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned weapons designed to counter ballistic nuclear missiles. His administration's move to set up a missile shield in Europe alarmed the Kremlin, and was scrapped by the Obama administration in 2009. It was replaced by a modified defence system in 2016. Signed by the US and the USSR in 1987,the arms control deal banned all nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with short and medium ranges,external, except sea-launched weapons The US had been concerned by the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile system and responded by placing Pershing and Cruise missiles in Europe - sparking widespread protests By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been destroyed. Both countries were allowed to inspect the others installations In 2007, Russian president Vladimir Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia's interests.

Migrant caravan inches towards the USThousands of migrants en route to the US have now crossed into Mexico illegally from Guatemala.,"This video can not be played Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan President Donald Trump has said the US will ""begin cutting off"" foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador because of a large convoy of migrants heading north. Mr Trump criticised the countries on Monday for allowing people to leave the region and come ""illegally"" to the US. The group is travelling through Mexico, but is still far from the US border. Human rights organisations have said that cutting aid would make the situation worse. The president has not specified what money will be cut and it is unclear if such action can be taken by presidential order. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In 2017, Guatemala received over $248m (Â£191m) in US aid. The same year, Honduras received $175m and El Salvador $115m, according to the US Agency for International Development. ""Cutting aid to refugee-producing countries will only make worse the conditions that displace people in the first place,"" said Human Rights Watch on Sunday. The organisation said root causes must be addressed. ""People generally don't want to leave their homes if they can live normal, safe lives there."" This video can not be played Celebrations and sickness - thousands of migrants make it to Mexico, but what happens next? Though President Trump has accused the migrants of trying to illegally enter the US, many of the families travelling towards the border are seeking asylum. They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries. Watch: Migrant caravan travels north By the BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Mexico The square in Tapachula - the first major population centre inside Mexico for these migrants - has turned into what looked like a makeshift camp. Along one side, ambulances lined up so medics could treat those who had become sick or got injured on their journey. Mexicans came to offer food, water and clothes to the many hundreds of Hondurans who rested ahead of the long punishing journey that still remains ahead of them to the US border. Many women among the group in particular have told us that they could never have made this journey alone, because it would have been too dangerous. So in spite of their tiredness, they are glad to be with others. But there is a sense that this is no longer just a convoy of those here in Tapachula, but that there is now a long stream of people stretching back along the route through Guatemala to Honduras, with people stuck at various obstacles and others who are still coming to join this migration. Curbing illegal immigration was one of the main campaign promises Mr Trump made when he ran for president. His Republican Party is facing mid-term elections on 6 November and could be unseated by Democrats in the House of Representatives. Without offering evidence, Mr Trump has repeatedly suggested the caravan was politically motivated. On Monday he urged people to blame Democrats for the border crisis, saying: ""Remember the mid-terms"". He also tweeted that the caravan contained ""criminals and unknown Middle Easterners"". When he was later pressed by journalists on what this meant, he offered no origin for the claim but invited reporters to investigate for themselves. On Sunday, the migrant caravan reached the town of Tapachula, approximately 37km (23 miles) from Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. The Mexican authorities had earlier tried to stop them at a border bridge, but some managed to cross into Mexico illegally by boat over the Suchiate river. ""We have sunburn. We have blisters. But we got here. Our strength is greater than Trump's threats,"" migrant Britany HernÃ¡ndez told AFP news agency. It is expected to take weeks before the caravan reaches the US-Mexico border, according to US media. One of the closest border crossings in Brownsville, Texas is still over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) away from Tapachula. The last leg of their journey will also have to wait until Mexico processes the group, and asylum claims can take up to 45 days. A group of about 1,000 Hondurans set off on foot from a bus terminal in the crime-ridden city of San Pedro Sula on 13 October in an attempt to escape unemployment and the threat of violence. Many of those in the caravan are women with children Many of them had become aware of the caravan after a former lawmaker had published a poster announcing the caravan on Facebook. News of it quickly spread on social media. They have since been joined by other Central American nationals as they crossed Guatemala towards the Mexican border. The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world and many try to flee gang violence. Playing mother to El Salvador's gang children Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' How gang violence is spreading fear in El Salvador The exact number is hard to determine as the group has split up. Some are already in the Mexican city of Tapachula, while others are still at the Guatemala-Mexico border. The caravan has been growing in size with more people joining along the way Some estimates put the number of migrants who left Ciudad Hidalgo for Tapachula on Sunday at 5,000 while a Mexican federal police commander gave a lower number of 3,000. Another 1,500 migrants are estimated to be waiting to cross at the Guatemalan side of the border. A newly formed group of 1,000 mainly Honduran migrants has set off for the US, as well. However, 3,400 Hondurans have also turned back, according to official figures. Honduran President Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez urged citizens not to join the caravan. His country has also sent buses to the Mexico-Guatemala border to repatriate those who may have changed their minds about heading to the US or who are simply too exhausted to carry on. Mexico said it would stop those who did not have passports or the correct visas at its southern border. But faced with thousands of migrants and after initial clashes, riot police got back on the buses that had brought them to the border bridge. About 900 migrants crossed the river and made it into Mexico, without the police intervening. In pictures: Migrants face border tear gas On Monday, incoming Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Marcelo Ebrard - who will take up the post on 1 December - told reporters that Mr Trump's tweets were linked with domestic politics. ""The tweets we've been seeing lately do not surprise me, they do not surprise the government,"" he said via an interpreter, according to Reuters news agency. ""It's very close to the mid-term elections in the United States,"" Mr Ebrard said after meeting with Canada's foreign minister in Ottawa. Mr Ebrard did not answer when asked directly about how Mexico will treat the caravan, but said that his country planned changes to its immigration policy. ""There are going to be many more work visas. We are going to invest in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador,"" he said. Mexican officials say they have been encouraging the migrants to apply for asylum and that more than 1,000 have started the process. Those whose claims are rejected by Mexican officials will be deported. Those who managed to cross into Mexico expressed their joy at having it made that far. Many shouted ""Yes, we could!"" and ""we won't stop"".

A woman called MarÃ­a, who is taking part in the caravan with her husband and her two small children, told BBC Mundo's Ana Gabriela Rojas: ""We are very happy to be here and we ask Mexican authorities and people to let us pass through.

Infected blood support payments 'must rise',"Victims of the NHS contaminated blood scandal have written to the health secretary asking for an immediate increase in support payments, the BBC has learned. The public inquiry into the scandal is not due to look at financial support until 2020. Campaign group Tainted Blood said, at the current rate, 112 more people would die before the issue was resolved. The Cabinet Office said it ""will consider"" calls for improved support. Labour MP Diana Johnson - co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Haemophilia and Contaminated Blood - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""The state has harmed these people, and the state now needs to step up and compensate them properly."" A public inquiry opened last month looking into how thousands of people in the 1970s and 80s were given blood products infected with hepatitis viruses and HIV. It is thought more than 2,400 people have died, while many others have been left in very poor health. Last week, inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff wrote to the Cabinet Office describing how some families had ""lost everything"" and ""had to live on the breadline"". He asked the government to take ""decisive action"" to tackle the issue of financial compensation. The Cabinet Office has said it ""will consider"" the recommendations and ""respond as soon as possible"". Tainted Blood, the largest support group for victims, has now written to Health Secretary Matt Hancock asking the government to address what it says is an ""unacceptable delay"" in dealing with finances. In the letter, seen by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, it calls for support payments in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to be increased to the level received by Scottish victims of the scandal. ""I believe it will be a matter of deep and future shame for this government if it fails to act, and act quickly,"" said Andrew Evans, chairman of the group. As it stands there are a number of complex financial support schemes running across the UK. Payments can range from under Â£5,000 a year to more than Â£36,000. In most cases, Scottish victims of the scandal and their families receive more than victims living in Wales, with those in Northern Ireland and England receiving the least. The campaign group says someone infected with both HIV and early-stage hepatitis C in Scotland can receive a lump sum of Â£50,000 plus Â£37,000 a year in support payments. In England a victim in a similar condition would receive around Â£26,500 a year with no lump sum. The widow of someone infected in a Scottish hospital can receive an annual support payment of Â£27,250 compared with a single one-off payment of Â£10,000 in England. The group is now asking asking for parity with the Scottish system, for payments to be backdated, and all widows' payments to be paid regardless of whether the victim has remarried or formed a civil partnership. Labour MP Diana Johnson said there was ""no reason at all why our government couldn't decide now, even though the public inquiry is under way, to say, 'Right, we're going to compensate these people and pay them properly'"". She said that as an interim measure, payments in other parts of the UK should be brought up to the same level as those in Scotland, but that she ""still [doesn't] think that's enough"". She said in ""many cases"" the lives of those affected had been ""destroyed"". Around 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with hepatitis viruses in the 1970s and 80s. It is thought more than 1,250 were also infected with HIV. Nearly 3,000 of them have since died. They were injected with a treatment - either Factor VIII or IV - used to help their blood clot. But Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment and so supplies were imported from the US. Much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. Other victims who had blood transfusions after surgery were also exposed to contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s the blood products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this, and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991 and by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk.

Plan to halt university grade inflation,"More than a quarter of students are now graduating with a first-class degree A surge in the number of first-class degrees awarded at university has led the government to bring in measures to tackle so-called grade inflation. Figures suggest that degrees are being ""marked up"", meaning students are leaving with a higher grade than a comparable student in previous years. More than a quarter of students now graduate with a first-class degree. Universities could now be penalised in the government's rating system if they award too many top grades. ""When you look at what makes our universities so prestigious, it comes down to the value of our degrees,"" said Universities Minister Sam Gyimah. ""The value of those degrees is threatened by grade inflation and that is a problem for students, employers and the universities themselves."" Figures released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that 26% of students graduate with a first-class degree, up from 18% in 2012-13. The increase is part of a longer term trend. In the early 1990s, only about 8% of students achieved a first. University first-class degrees soaring Too many firsts 'risks universities' credibility' University grade inflation disputed Universities are their own degree-awarding bodies and decide their own grades, but the government plans to use its rating system,the Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework (TEF),external, to discourage lower standards. Introduced in 2017, the TEF ranks universities as gold, silver or bronze by assessing multiple factors such as the student experience and quality of teaching. A panel of experts will review evidence on whether each university is awarding excessive numbers of firsts and 2:1s. A spokesman for Universities UK, which represents higher education institutions, said it would propose its own measures to prevent grade inflation. ""It is essential that students, employers and the public have confidence in the ongoing value of a UK degree,"" he said. But he said there could also be legitimate reasons for the rise in top degrees, including greater investment in the quality of teaching and technology. Some students say the fees of about Â£9,000 a year introduced in 2012 mean that many are working harder to ensure they get value for money. Sophie Wilson, who graduated last year with a first in English Literature from Sheffield University, said she worked from 9am to 8pm most days, despite struggling with depression. ""I think it's ridiculous that it's being devalued. It's more likely that people are working hard because uni is so expensive these days,"" she said. Research in 2014 by Lancaster Universityfound that improvements in degree grades were in line with the rising quality of the intake, as shown by A-level grades. The only sign of ""leniency"" was among top universities, which researchers found were 8% more likely to award higher degrees than they were in 2005, after taking into account the improved student intake. But others say that with little oversight of their degree-awarding powers, universities have an incentive to offer high grades. ""There are people who think the system isn't as robust as it might be,""Nick Hillman, head of the Higher Education Policy Institute told the BBC last year.

Beckham admits marriage 'hard work'Retired footballer gives candid interview to Australian TV show ahead of Invictus Games appearance.UKVideoVideo'Headless chicken sea monster' captured on filmA deep-sea swimming sea cucumber has been filmed in the Southern Ocean off East Antarctica for the first time.,"Beckham said he and wife Victoria teach their children the importance of hard work ""Hard work"" is the key to his 19-year marriage, David Beckham has admitted. He has ""grown to ignore some of the negative stuff"" that is said about him and wife Victoria, he told Australian TV show The Sunday Project. The pair are ""proud of the family"" and teach their four children - Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper - the importance of hard work, he added. Beckham spoke to the programme before joining the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in Australia for the Invictus Games. The couple attended the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding in Windsor ""I think if you know each other well, if you know you've got great friends and great family behind you, the thing we have to do is protect our children and we are very proud of the family,"" he said on the show. ""We are hard working and we feel that is the right way to bring up our children to prove and to show to them you have to work really hard to be successful,"" he went on. The retired footballer also touched on a recent Vogue front cover image of the Beckham clan - which he was absent from. He explained that the cover was ""all about Victoria's 10 years in fashion"". ""The amount she has achieved in such a short space of time - four beautiful young children, we have a beautiful dog - but obviously in her business world to be on the front cover of Vogue was a huge thing and then we did a separate picture for another cover,"" he said.

Gorbachev warns on US nuclear treaty plan,"Mr Gorbachev has questioned the sense of withdrawing from the INF Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev says US President Trump's plan to withdraw from a key Cold War nuclear weapons treaty is a reversal of efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament. Mr Gorbachev - who signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with President Reagan in 1987 - questioned the plan's intelligence. Mr Trump said Russia had been ""violating [the INF] for many years"". Russia has condemned the plans and threatened to retaliate. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin would be seeking an explanation from visiting US National Security Adviser John Bolton. Germany was the first US ally to criticise the move, with Foreign Minister Heiko Maas urging Washington to consider the consequences both for Europe and for future disarmament efforts. The INF banned ground-launched medium-range missiles, with a range of between 500 and 5,500km (310-3,400 miles). Mr Gorbachev and Mr Reagan signed the INF treaty in 1987 It was signed near the end of the Cold War, a period of relations between the US and the Soviet Union from 1945 to 1989 marked by intense international tension and overshadowed by the threat of nuclear conflict. In the past five decades the US and Russia have signed a range of joint agreements to limit and reduce their substantial nuclear arsenals. The last General Secretary of the Soviet Union Appointed in 1985, his domestic reforms and nuclear disarmament deals helped end the Cold War Resigned as Soviet president in 1991 after Soviet republics declared independence Read more:The man who lost an empire President Trump said the US would not let Russia ""go out and do weapons [while] we're not allowed to"". ""I don't know why President [Barack] Obama didn't negotiate or pull out,"" the president said of the INF treaty after a campaign rally in Nevada. Russia denies breaking missile treaty Tensions rise as US threatens to 'take out' Russian missiles In 2014,President Obama accused Russia of breaching the INFafter it allegedly tested a ground-launched cruise missile. He reportedly chose not to withdraw from the treaty under pressure from European leaders, who said such a move could restart an arms race. ""This would be a very dangerous step that, I'm sure, not only will not be comprehended by the international community but will provoke serious condemnation,"" Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. The treaty is ""significant for international security and security in the sphere of nuclear arms, for the maintenance of strategic stability,"" he told state news agency Tass. The minister also told the news agency RIA Novosti that if the US continued to behave ""clumsily and crudely"" and backed out of international agreements, ""then we will have no choice but to undertake retaliatory measures, including involving military technology"". ""But we would not want to get to this stage,"" he added. Analysis by BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus Concern about Russia's development and deployment of a missile system that breaches the INF treaty predates the Trump administration. But the president's decision to walk away from the agreement marks a significant setback for arms control. Many experts believe that negotiations should have continued to try to bring the Russians back into compliance. It is, they fear, part of the wider unravelling of the whole system of arms control treaties that helped to curb strategic competition during the Cold War. Other factors too may have played into President Trump's decision. This was a bilateral treaty between Washington and Moscow. China was free to develop and deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles. Some in the Trump administration feel that the INF treaty places them at a growing disadvantage in their developing  strategic rivalry with Beijing . The US insists the Russians have, in breach of the deal, developed a new medium-range missile called the Novator 9M729 - known to Nato as the SSC-8. It would enable Russia to launch a nuclear strike at Nato countries at very short notice. Russia has said little about its new missile other than to deny that it is in breach of the agreement. Analysts say Russia sees such weapons as a cheaper alternative to conventional forces. The New York Times reported on Fridaythe US was considering withdrawing from the treaty in a bid to counter China's expanding military presence,externalin the western Pacific. China was not a signatory of the deal, allowing it to develop medium-range missiles without restraint. The last time the US withdrew from a major arms treaty was in 2002, when President George W Bush pulled the US out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned weapons designed to counter ballistic nuclear missiles. His administration's move to set up a missile shield in Europe alarmed the Kremlin, and was scrapped by the Obama administration in 2009. It was replaced by a modified defence system in 2016. Signed by the US and the USSR in 1987,the arms control deal banned all nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with short and medium ranges,external, except sea-launched weapons The US had been concerned by the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile system and responded by placing Pershing and Cruise missiles in Europe - sparking widespread protests By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been destroyed. Both countries were allowed to inspect the others installations In 2007, Russian president Vladimir Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia's interests. The move came after the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 Russia denies breaking missile treaty Trump and the nuclear codes US: Russia 'violated missile treaty' New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Australia apologises to sexual abuse victims,"This video can not be played Australian PM: âWhen a child spoke up, they werenât believedâ Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has given a national apology to victims of child sexual abuse. Hundreds of people gathered in Canberra on Monday to hear Mr Morrison deliver the emotional address in parliament. It follows a five-year inquiry which found tens of thousands of children had suffered abuse in the nation's institutions over decades. ""Today, we finally acknowledge and confront the lost screams of our children,"" he said. ""We must be so humble to fall before those who were forsaken and beg to them our apology."" The inquiry, which concluded last December, heard more than 8,000 testimonies from victims about abuse in organisations such as churches, schools and sports clubs. Why some victims shunned the apology Sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' 'I feel like a weight has been lifted' With his voice trembling at times, Mr Morrison acknowledged the suffering of victims and condemned institutional failures. ""Why were the cries of children and parents ignored? Why was our system of justice blind to injustice? Why has it taken so long to act?"" he said. Survivors shed tears and held hands as the apology was given, but some later expressed frustration at the government's wider response to the inquiry. Members of the public watch the apology in a parliamentary gallery ""As one survivor recently said to me: 'It wasn't a foreign enemy who did this to us. This was done by Australians to Australians, enemies in our midst, enemies in our midst.' The enemies of innocence. It happened day after day, week after week, month after month, decade after decade, unrelenting torment. When a child spoke up, they weren't believed and the crimes continued with impunity. One survivor told me that when he told a teacher of his abuse, that teacher then became his next abuser: trust broken, innocence betrayed, power and position exploited for evil, dark crimes."" Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten told parliament: ""There are wrongs that cannot be made right. But know that today, Australia says sorry."" The parliament later stood for a minute of silence. Victims and their supporters travelled from around the nation to hear the apology in Canberra. ""They are coming with very heavy hearts,"" said Leonie Sheedy, the chief executive of Care Leavers Australasia Network. ""It is a wonderful thing our country's apologising, but there is so much more work to be done."" Child sex abuse survivor Carolyn Unwin was at parliament on Monday One survivor told the BBC: ""For me it gave me a lot of comfort to hear [the apology]. At least we lived long enough to hear it."" Many survivors have criticised the government's response to the inquiry - especially its terms for a national compensation scheme. Victims are eligible for payments of up to A$150,000 (Â£80,000; $106,000) each.Some say the compensation is not enough, and onerous to obtain. Mr Morrison said the government had accepted most recommendations from the inquiry, but it was still considering the remaining proposals. Those not yet adopted include recommendations where federal and state responsibilities overlap. The most contentious is a proposal to make reporting abuse mandatory. In August,the Catholic Church formally rejected that call- meaning it will not force priests to break confession rules. On Monday, Mr Morrison committed to establishing a museum of remembrance to memorialise victims' stories. Hywel Griffith, BBC News in Canberra Deep in symbolism, decades overdue - the word ""sorry"" can mean so much and yet change so little. For many, the apology brings recognition of their pain, suffering and anger. But inevitably, for thousands of others who have died - many through suicide - it has all come far too late. Many of those gathered in Canberra tell me the real test of the government's sincerity will be in how it responds to the remaining recommendations. While the apology carries real weight, many survivors want greater action. In their final report, the commissioners said: ""It is not a case of a few 'rotten apples'. Society's major institutions have seriously failed."" They said over 15,000 people had contacted the inquiry, raising allegations against more than 4,000 institutions. Religious ministers and school teachers were the most commonly reported perpetrators. The greatest number were in Catholic institutions. All states and territories, and many institutions, have since signed up to the federal government-led compensation scheme.

"UK urged to take back IS 'foreign fighters'US General Patrick Roberson also urged the UK to repatriate two Londoners dubbed the ""IS Beatles"".UK","Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces A senior US military commander has called on the UK to take back Islamic State fighters who have been ""caught on the battlefield"" in Syria. Maj Gen Patrick Roberson, commander of US special ops, also called on the government to repatriate two Londoners who have been called the ""IS Beatles"". The UK says El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey have been stripped of their British citizenship. The government is negotiating for them to face trial in the US. Speaking to the BBC from a jail in Syriain August, Mr Elsheikh and Mr Kotey disputed the claim that they had been stripped of their British citizenship. So-called 'IS Beatles dispute extradition Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? Where should the 'IS Beatles' be tried? Asked whether Mr Elsheik and Mr Kotey should be repatriated to the UK, Gen Roberson told the BBC: ""We would certainly like them to be."" He said the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the US were ""working very hard to make sure that the countries of origin get these foreign terrorist fighters back into their custody"". So far only a handful have done that. Gen Roberson admitted it was a decision for each country involved, but he added: ""I think the SDF and us would certainly like them to be repatriated to where they came from."" He is the first senior US military officer to publicly call on the UK to take back its nationals and former nationals. US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces say they have captured 700 foreign fighters from more than 40 nations, including the UK. The SDF has not said how many are British - or former British nationals - but it is believed to be fewer than a dozen. Mr Elsheikh and Mr Kotey, who were captured in January, are believed to be part of an IS cell which became known as ""the Beatles' by their hostages because of their UK accents. The two men were associated with another Briton, Mohammed Emwazi - also known as ""Jihadi John"". He was seen in a number of high profile IS execution videos that showed the beheading of Western hostages, including US and British citizens. Emwazi was killed in a US drone strike in Raqqa, Syria, in 2015. The UK government has been in discussions with officials in Washington  about sending the pair to the US to stand trial over their alleged involvement in the killing of a number of hostages. If found guilty, they could face the death penalty. Both men have questioned whether they could be stripped of their citizenship and tried in the US. The comments of Gen Roberson suggest the US would prefer them to stand trial in the UK. The mother of Mr Elsheikh has begun a legal challenge against the British government. At a hearing at the High Court earlier this month, lawyers for the government confirmed that Mr Elsheikh had been stripped of his UK nationality in December 2014. They have argued that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute him in the UK. Mr Elsheikh's mother is challenging Home Secretary Sajid Javid's decision to share evidence with US authorities without seeking assurances the men would not face execution if they were extradited and tried there.

How not to upstage someone's weddingIn pictures: Blue Peter turns 60A drawing a day tells story of family's griefVideoVideoIs tourism killing Venice?,"Princess Eugenie married Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on Friday When news broke that theDuke and Duchess of Sussex were expecting a baby,many were quick to send their congratulations. But others focused on the timing of the announcement. Although Harry and Meghan waited until Monday to go public with the pregnancy news, they did tell senior royals on Friday - the day ofPrincess Eugenie's wedding. ""I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure it's etiquette not to upstage a wedding with a baby announcement,"" one dissenter, Ali Schwartz from California, said on Twitter as others shared similar opinions. But, as some people pointed out, the public announcement was three days later  - and perhaps Friday was the last chance to tell the Royal Family before Harry and Meghan left to begin their tour to Australia. All the royal baby pictures you could possibly want, in one place Royal wedding guests sell goody bags online Katie Byrne, former bridal magazine editor, said ""it all comes down to how this sort of news is shared"". ""A wedding is a wonderfully happy occasion and often provides a spread-out family of various different (and busy) generations a brilliant opportunity to get together and catch up. ""Telling people face to face is (obviously) so much more personal than over the phone, via WhatsApp and so on, so I think making the most of a joyous occasion to discreetly share their news is a wonderful way to tell the family,"" she said, adding that other guests may have speculated about the pregnancy if Meghan was not drinking alcohol. Meghan and Harry as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended Friday's wedding ""Subtlety is pitch-perfect; hijacking the AV system to play the Spice Girls' Mama while clicking through a slideshow of scan photos during the wedding breakfast, not so much."" However, some wedding etiquette rules are much more clear-cut. Here are some of the main dos and don'ts. Proposing to your partner at weddings does happen,as documented by one unhappy bride,externalwho wrote to an agony aunt complaining that the best man stopped partway through the ceremony to propose to his girlfriend. Andin another photo, shared via a Reddit thread,,externala bride and groom look on as a guest proposes to his girlfriend. According to Ms Byrne, proposing to your partner at someone else's wedding is ""really not OK"" - unless with the ""express permission"" of the bride and groom beforehand. She adds: ""You can't be irritated if they say 'no' - unless you want them to get payback and announce their pregnancy/move to Australia/etc during your celebration, of course."" But if the bride and groom are in on a guest's grand plan to propose, the moment could be something special, as was the case for one bride in Canada. Jess Nakrayko was married and passed her wedding bouquet to her best friend who turned round and was proposed to by her own boyfriend. Jess posted on Instagram: ""My best friend was starting her love story - I didn't even think about that being me giving up my day. I have love and I want people close to me to have love too."" So-called ""unplugged weddings"" have become increasingly common, to stop guests being glued to their phones throughout the day. ""Don't forget to turn your mobile phone on to silent for the ceremony,"" says Ms Byrne. ""Playing with Snapchat during the hymns or live tweeting the usher's awkward Captain Corelli's Mandolin reading is to be avoided, naturally."" And what about sharing photographs? ""Don't post photographs on social media if the couple have expressly asked you not to,"" she adds. ""Even if they haven't, be sensitive to what you do share; that sweet group selfie of you with the bridesmaids? Yes! That shot of the bridesmaid, slick with tear-streaked mascara and mid-happy-cry? Nope."" Weddings are expensive and every extra guest makes the cost jump even more. Accordingto Vogue's guide on wedding etiquette,,externalunder no circumstances can you ask for a plus one. And if your invitation does not explicitly state you can have a plus one, do not assume you can have one. Ms Byrne says: ""No, the couple didn't forget to mention it. You just don't have one. Unless you are willing to foot the two-or-three figure bill to pay for their meal yourself, don't bother protesting too hard."" ""If you notice the dance floor is empty, go and dance,"" says Ms Byrne. ""Noticing it's empty and continuing to sit in your chair or graze at the buffet does not a great party make. Go and start a conga line instead."" And she said a bridesmaid, usher or best man should acknowledge that there will be a huge range of people attending - so ""tailor any speech or surprise to that mixed audience"" and ""don't say anything that will offend, mortify or upset"". According to etiquette guide Debrett's,,externalavoid talking about religion or politics and make an effort to include guests who do not know anyone. Black, which is traditionally associated with mourning, and white or cream, which could match too closely to the bride, is commonly considered a no-no at weddings. But,according to Debrett's,,externalif you are planning to go monochrome ""it's wise to check with your hosts beforehand"". The social etiquette guide says all-black or white outfits can be ""formal, glamorous and versatile"", giving the example of Cara Delevingne, who wore monochrome when she was bridesmaid to her elder sisters. The model also wore black to Princess Eugenie's wedding. Cara Delevingne arrives for Princess Eugenie's wedding ceremony wearing a black suit and top hat Ms Byrne says even though it is ""typically (and unfairly) women that tend to get the 'upstage' warning, men can of course upstage, too - especially if the groom is an unassuming type who isn't particularly bothered by style or fashion"". ""I think turning up in any of the following can equal a wedding day upstage: a white tux, a suit in any kind of attention-grabbing colour, texture or print, a try-hard accessory (a vanity cane, for example), a kilt at a non-Scottish wedding, a vintage Jaguarâ¦ anything that says 'Look! At! Me!."" And finally, don't be like this personwho posted on Mumsnet,externalwith the question: ""Need a great dress to upstage a bride...what can I wear?""

A drawing a day tells story of family's griefVideoVideoIs tourism killing Venice?,"Gary Andrews with his daughter Lily (11) and his son Ben (eight) How do you cope with the unexpected death of your partner of 19 years? That was the question facing Gary Andrews, 57, when his 41-year-old wife Joy died suddenly almost a year ago. Over the last 12 months he has discovered that, for him, the answer is doodling - a doodle a day to be precise. Gary, an animator and illustrator who has worked on Fireman Sam and for Disney, began his doodle diary, which he shareson social media,,externalon his 55th birthday in 2016. In a digital age he says he missed the scratch of pen on paper so ""made it a habit, last thing at night, to do a little sketch based on something that had happened that day"". However, it took on added significance when his wife, with whom he lived in Surrey along with their two children, died from sepsis. These were his first doodles following her death on 27 October: His week had started with his wife waving him off at Heathrow Airport on a Monday for a work trip to Canada. After a few days of feeling ill with flu-like symptoms, Joy was taken to hospital on the Thursday with a suspected kidney infection but her condition deteriorated rapidly. On the Friday at 03:15 she died from multiple organ failure caused by sepsis. Gary, in the departure lounge in Vancouver waiting for an emergency flight home, was told when he landed back in the UK. He had lost the woman he had been married to for 13 years, the person he describes as his best friend, and the mother of his two children - Lily, then 10, and Ben, then seven. Gary and Joy had met at an amateur theatre company The doodles were something they used to share together. ""When Joy died it became a form of therapy for me,"" he says. ""I thought I've got to keep it going because we used to look at it every night, so after she died I wasn't going to stop because it's who I am and it helps me think about what happened that day."" At the time he wrote: ""Was struggling a bit today, feeling pretty emotional. Then Lily comes out with this at bedtime. Kids are great levellers!"" They often feature Joy's presence and he says he finds it comforting, rather than difficult, to draw her. ""I close my eyes and I see her,"" he says. ""She's very present in our lives all the time, in our conversations, so drawing her just feels really natural. ""I've drawn her for the last 20 years."" One drawing which holds a particularly strong memory for him is the one he did on the day of the ceremony they held to celebrate her life. He wrote: ""Hard to draw through my tears tonight - but what an amazing send-off for my beautiful girl."" ""That's the only one I've ever done where I've had to draw it through tears,"" he says. ""I think I cried the whole time I was drawing it, but it needed to be done."" As he shared his doodles on social media, his family and friends were able to keep track of how he was coping following Joy's death. ""They liked it because it showed them where I was, my state of mind,"" he says. It was another way of communication. A phone call would often follow if he posted a couple in a row which made them worry. He says without doodling, he wouldn't have had an outlet for his thoughts. ""The great thing about the doodle is once it's down on the paper, the thought is out. ""You've got it out and can let it go. If it's a sad, negative thought - I get it down, I get it out. It kind of releases it, and then you can move on."" The doodles, which he draws in notebooks kept in chronological order on a shelf, have also been therapeutic for his children who he says ""love seeing them"". ""Lily will pick them off the shelf and go through the old ones. It's lovely that they can look back at it and use it as a memory. ""They laugh at the funny things they've done and they see the pictures of mum."" He sees it as important to document the funny moments in life as it is the poignant occasions. ""It might just be a day where my son says something stupid - and that will go in the doodle,"" he says. ""It's important to be able to laugh through grief. ""Life does go on, it has to. It has to be as silly and funny as it once was."" Gary wrote: ""Well they just blow me away with how open they are about the changes in our life. So proud."" Gary has more than 30,000 followers on Twitter and says he has experienced a ""universally lovely"" reaction to his doodles, which shows how they have struck a chord. ""People who are in a similar boat are seeing me write stuff, draw stuff, that relates to something happening in their life which maybe they haven't been able to articulate,"" he says. ""Or they see something that's been happening to them and realise they're not alone in feeling that."" Gary wrote: ""Nearly five months gone. Didn't think I had any more heart left to break but it turns out I was wrong. So beautiful and talented. #Sepsis sucks"" ""I had the best relationship,"" he says. ""We had 19 fantastic years. I was the luckiest guy. The universe decided I wasn't going to get that any longer but some good has to come out of it."" So as the anniversary of his wife's death approaches, will Gary be able to keep producing a doodle a day? ""The interaction with people has been lovely,"" he says. ""It's nice to know that there is a community out there, some of whom are taking comfort in it. ""I can't see why I would want to stop. I love doing it. I love putting my day on a piece of paper."" Sepsis is triggered by infections, but is actually a problem with our own immune system going into overdrive. As the condition develops, symptoms may worsen and some more distinctive warning signs or ""red flags"" can emerge. These vary from patient to patient, but after discussions with sepsis survivors the UK Sepsis Trust has compiled a list of the six most common signs. They include: Slurred speech or confusion Extreme shivering or muscle pain Passing no urine (in a day) Severe breathlessness ""I feel like I might die"" Skin mottled or discoloured More fromNHS Choices,external .

Australia abuse victims gather for apology,"This video can not be played Australian PM: âWhen a child spoke up, they werenât believedâ Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has given a national apology to victims of child sexual abuse. Hundreds of people gathered in Canberra on Monday to hear Mr Morrison deliver the emotional address in parliament. It follows a five-year inquiry which found tens of thousands of children had suffered abuse in the nation's institutions over decades. ""Today, we finally acknowledge and confront the lost screams of our children,"" he said. ""We must be so humble to fall before those who were forsaken and beg to them our apology."" The inquiry, which concluded last December, heard more than 8,000 testimonies from victims about abuse in organisations such as churches, schools and sports clubs. Why some victims shunned the apology Sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' 'I feel like a weight has been lifted' With his voice trembling at times, Mr Morrison acknowledged the suffering of victims and condemned institutional failures. ""Why were the cries of children and parents ignored? Why was our system of justice blind to injustice? Why has it taken so long to act?"" he said. Survivors shed tears and held hands as the apology was given, but some later expressed frustration at the government's wider response to the inquiry. Members of the public watch the apology in a parliamentary gallery ""As one survivor recently said to me: 'It wasn't a foreign enemy who did this to us. This was done by Australians to Australians, enemies in our midst, enemies in our midst.' The enemies of innocence. It happened day after day, week after week, month after month, decade after decade, unrelenting torment. When a child spoke up, they weren't believed and the crimes continued with impunity. One survivor told me that when he told a teacher of his abuse, that teacher then became his next abuser: trust broken, innocence betrayed, power and position exploited for evil, dark crimes."" Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten told parliament: ""There are wrongs that cannot be made right. But know that today, Australia says sorry."" The parliament later stood for a minute of silence. Victims and their supporters travelled from around the nation to hear the apology in Canberra. ""They are coming with very heavy hearts,"" said Leonie Sheedy, the chief executive of Care Leavers Australasia Network. ""It is a wonderful thing our country's apologising, but there is so much more work to be done."" Child sex abuse survivor Carolyn Unwin was at parliament on Monday One survivor told the BBC: ""For me it gave me a lot of comfort to hear [the apology]. At least we lived long enough to hear it."" Many survivors have criticised the government's response to the inquiry - especially its terms for a national compensation scheme. Victims are eligible for payments of up to A$150,000 (Â£80,000; $106,000) each.Some say the compensation is not enough, and onerous to obtain. Mr Morrison said the government had accepted most recommendations from the inquiry, but it was still considering the remaining proposals. Those not yet adopted include recommendations where federal and state responsibilities overlap. The most contentious is a proposal to make reporting abuse mandatory. In August,the Catholic Church formally rejected that call- meaning it will not force priests to break confession rules. On Monday, Mr Morrison committed to establishing a museum of remembrance to memorialise victims' stories. Hywel Griffith, BBC News in Canberra Deep in symbolism, decades overdue - the word ""sorry"" can mean so much and yet change so little. For many, the apology brings recognition of their pain, suffering and anger. But inevitably, for thousands of others who have died - many through suicide - it has all come far too late. Many of those gathered in Canberra tell me the real test of the government's sincerity will be in how it responds to the remaining recommendations. While the apology carries real weight, many survivors want greater action. In their final report, the commissioners said: ""It is not a case of a few 'rotten apples'. Society's major institutions have seriously failed."" They said over 15,000 people had contacted the inquiry, raising allegations against more than 4,000 institutions. Religious ministers and school teachers were the most commonly reported perpetrators. The greatest number were in Catholic institutions. All states and territories, and many institutions, have since signed up to the federal government-led compensation scheme.

Tobacco giant attacked over anti-smoking ad,"The campaign was launched in a four-page wraparound in the Daily Mirror One of the world's biggest tobacco firms, Philip Morris, has been accused of ""staggering hypocrisy"" over its new ad campaign that urges smokers to quit. The Marlboro maker said the move was ""an important next step"" in its aim to ""ultimately stop selling cigarettes"". But Cancer Research UK said the firm was just trying to promote its smoking alternatives, such as heated tobacco. ""This is a staggering hypocrisy,"" it said, pointing out the firm still promotes smoking outside the UK. ""The best way Philip Morris could help people to stop smoking is to stop making cigarettes,"" George Butterworth, Cancer Research UK's tobacco policy manager said. The charity said smoking was the leading preventable cause of cancer and it encouraged people to switch away completely from smoking, including through the use of e-cigarettes. Tobacco giant launches anti-smoking ad Is the vape shop boom about to end? Vapers rise 'to more than three million' Health charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) also criticised the campaign - which is called Hold My Light and has been launched in a four-page wraparound on Monday's Daily Mirror - saying it was a way for Philip Morris to get around the UK's anti-tobacco advertising rules. This video can not be played Have decades of anti-smoking campaigns had an effect? There is also a campaign video, which shows a young woman negotiating a Mission Impossible-style room in order to hand her cigarette lighter over to a group of friends, who are supporting her in a bid to give up smoking. Most forms of tobacco advertising and promotion in the UK are banned, andrules introduced last yearmean cigarettes and tobacco must be sold in plain green packets. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said Philip Morris was still advertising its Marlboro brand wherever globally it was legal to do so. ""The fact of the matter is that it can no longer do that in the UK, we're a dark market where all advertising, promotion and sponsorship is banned, and cigarettes are in plain packs. ""So instead Philip Morris is promoting the company name which is inextricably linked with Marlboro,"" she said. Philip Morris has said previously that it wants to achieve a ""smoke-free"" future. Like many tobacco firms, Philip Morris is moving towards a focus on new products to replace cigarettes as the number of smokers in the UK continues to decline. In the UK, it markets several alternatives to cigarettes, including a heated tobacco product, Iqos. It also owns the Nicocig, Vivid and Mesh e-cigarette brands. The firm's managing director Peter Nixon said its new advertising campaign was ""about supporting smokers in finding alternatives"". Asked why, if Philip Morris was so keen for smokers to quit, it did not simply stop making cigarettes and focus entirely on alternative products, he said it was because smokers would just switch to a rival product. ""Cigarettes still generate 87% of our business. We want to get to [smoke-free] as soon as possible, and we want to be selling alternatives, but it does take time,"" he said. Mr Nixon said the firm had invested over Â£4bn in developing alternative products to cigarettes. The campaign suggests four ways to give up cigarettes, including going cold turkey, using nicotine patches, vaping and using heated tobacco products. In an unusual move, the Daily Mirror made a reference in its editorial column to the advertising feature which envelops the paper. It said it was ""pleased to back the campaign"". It added: ""Yes, we were surprised too that this is a campaign created by Philip Morris Ltd. But it can only be a good thing that they are now trying to encourage people to quit cigarettes."" In July last year, the government set out a plan to make England, in effect, smoke-free in the next few decades. The newTobacco Control Plan,externalaimed to cut smoking rates from 15.5% to 12% of the population by 2022. Tobacco giant launches anti-smoking ad Is the vape shop boom about to end?

Taiwan train derailment kills 18,"This video can not be played The Puyuma Express 6432 service came off the tracks close to Xinma station At least 18 people have been killed and 187 injured after a passenger train derailed in north-east Taiwan. Railway authorities say they are investigating the accident, which happened in Yilan County at about 16:50 local time (08:50 GMT) on Sunday. A total of 366 passengers were on the train when all eight of its carriages derailed. The incident is Taiwan's worst rail accident in 27 years. At least three children were among the dead. ""The train was going very fast. I hit a wall when the car started to flip. Around five to six people were thrown out of the carriage door,"" passenger Henry Tseng told Reuters news agency. ""There [was] no time to think what happened. Everyone was in a rush to get out."" It is not clear if any passengers remain unaccounted for - with reports providing conflicting details. The Puyuma Express 6432 service came off the tracks close to Xinma station, near the town of Su'ao about 70km (43 miles) from Taipei. It was travelling between Taipei and the eastern county of Taitung. ""There are four carriages that were overturned at 90 degrees and the worst casualties were in those carriages,"" said Jackson Lu, director-general of the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA). He had earlier told a press conference that the train was only six years old and had been in ""pretty good condition"" before the accident. It remains unclear what caused the train to derail, but witnesses told local media they heard a loud noise then sparks and smoke. Train kills dozens at Indian festival Dog dies after lead trapped in train doors at station Children in cart killed in Dutch rail crash Video footage on local television showed passengers breaking windows to escape the carriages. ""I smashed the safety glass and crawled out and I helped to pull a young man out,"" one passenger told reporters. ""There was a person sitting behind me. I'm not sure she survived."" Authorities say five of the train's eight carriages ended up on their side Another woman, Tung Xiao-ling, lost eight family members who had been returning from her sister's wedding celebration. ""No one can accept that one day you are a bride and the next day you are mourning a family member,"" Ms Tung, who was not onboard, told Reuters. An AFP news agency reporter at the scene said more bodies were being removed from the damaged carriages at about 20:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Sunday night. Photographs from the scene show seats upended, with parts of the railway tracks twisted through carriage windows in places. Tsai Ing-wen has asked for a speedy investigation Taiwan's leader, Tsai Ing-wen, arrived in Xinma on Monday morning. She said she had ""asked prosecutors to clarify the situation"" and quickly determine what caused the derailment. She also met relatives of passengers affected by the disaster.
