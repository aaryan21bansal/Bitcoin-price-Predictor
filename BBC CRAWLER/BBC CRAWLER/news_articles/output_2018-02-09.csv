Crush death student was 'exceptional sportswoman',"Olivia Burt had been head girl at her school before starting university A student who died when she was crushed beneath a barrier outside a nightclub was ""an exceptional sportswoman"" who had sailed for Britain. Olivia Burt suffered head injuries outside Missoula in Durham just before midnight on Wednesday. First-aiders tried to save her life but the 20-year-old, from Hampshire, died at the scene. Professor David Held of Durham University said Miss Burt was ""bright and outstandingly able"". Prof Held, Master of University College, said: ""The staff and students acutely feel the loss of Olivia Burt. ""She arrived last autumn to begin reading natural science with glowing references from her school where she was regarded in the highest possible terms. ""She had an outstanding academic record and was an exceptional sportswoman. ""Those students close to her have lost a wonderful friend, whom in their shock they grieve for, alongside her family and friends. ""The college has lost a bright and outstandingly able student.  It is hard to come to terms with her loss, and we will miss her greatly."" Miss Burt, a former head girl at Bournemouth School for Girls, had been in the European Championships with the British Sailing Team and had recently joined the university's team. Forensic investigators have been at the scene According to The Tab student newspaper, the bar was packed and there was a long queue waiting to get in. In a statement, Missoula said it was ""a terrible accident"" and said staff were working with the police and security company that provides door staff. Det Supt Kevin Weir, of Durham Police, said the force and Durham County Council were investigating the death. Missoula's Wednesday-evening event, Game Over, is described by the club as Durham's biggest student night. Students said the venue in Walkergate is often busy and uses barriers when queues of people are waiting to get in. Chris Atherton, a spokesman for The Royal Yachting Association, of which Miss Burt was also a member, said: ""Olivia's passion for sailing always shone through and all those who knew her in the sailing community will miss her tremendously; she was both a likeable and fair competitor.""

Rose McGowan's former manager found dead,"Jill Messick was Rose McGowan's manager in 1997 Jill Messick, Hollywood producer and former manager of actress Rose McGowan, has died in Los Angeles, aged 50. Messick represented McGowan in 1997, when the actress alleged she was raped by Harvey Weinstein - which he denies. McGowan has previously said she was not supported by her management at the time of the alleged attack. Messick's family confirmed she took her own life on Wednesday, adding that she was used as ""collateral damage"" in the Weinstein case. This was after Weinstein's lawyer Ben Brafman published an email from Messick to help deny McGowan's rape claims. The email from Messick acknowledged that an incident had taken place between McGowan and Weinstein, but described it as ""consensual"". Weinstein maintains that McGowan's claim that she was raped by him at the Sundance Festival in 1997 is""a bold lie"". Messick's family said that she had chosen to stay out of the spotlight in recent months and ""opted not to add to the feeding frenzy, allowing her name and her reputation to be sullied despite having done nothing wrong"". They say she was ""victimised"" during the process and could not cope as she suffered from depression and bipolar disorder. Messick spent five years working at Weinstein's Miramax as an executive between 1997-2003. Harvey Weinstein and Rose McGowan appeared at a premiere for the film Grindhouse in 2007 It was in January 1997 that she first held management responsibilities for McGowan whilst working at Addis Wechsler. Messick's family said she set up a meeting with McGowan and Weinstein at the Sundance Film Festival as one of her first duties. Her family said in their statement that McGowan told Messick about the alleged assault but did not use the word rape. Messick then went to her bosses at Addis Wechsler to recount the story and her family say this was when a settlement was reached between McGowan and Weinstein. Ten months later, in November, Miramax offered her a production job. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Barnier: Brexit transition 'not a given',"This video can not be played Key points of Michel Barnier's news briefing EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that a transition period immediately after Brexit in 2019 is ""not a given"". He said ""substantial"" disagreements remained and he had ""some problems understanding the UK's position"". And he said the UK decision to quit the customs union and single market meant Irish border checks were ""unavoidable"". David Davis said he was ""surprised"" to hear Mr Barnier was unclear on the UK's stance on the transition period. ""We are seeking a time-limited period that maintains access to each other's markets on existing terms,"" said the UK's chief Brexit negotiator. He suggested there was a ""fundamental contradiction"" in the approach the European Commission was taking to Brexit talks. ""Today they acknowledged that a way to resolve disputes and infringements is needed. ""Yet at the same time they dismissed the UK's push for reasonable safeguards to ensure our interests are protected. It is not possible to have it both ways."" EU leaked paper discourteous, says Davis What is the Brexit transition phase? Reality check: How soon are Brexit answers needed? Mr Davis says businesses need ""about two years"" with much the same trading rules as they have now to allow them to adjust after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March next year. And he had hoped to get a deal with the EU on it by this March, so talks could then move on to the bigger issue of the UK's future relationship with the remaining 27 EU nations. But Mr Barnier, speaking after a week of technical discussions between civil servants on both sides, said that three ""substantial"" disagreements remained over the transition period. The pound fell sharply against the dollar and the euro during Mr Barnier's speech before recovering slightly to stand about 0.7% down on the day. The UK's refusal to guarantee permanent rights to EU nationals who come to live and work in Britain during the transition period The right of the UK to object to new EU rules and laws during the period Whether the UK could continue to participate in new justice and home affairs policies during the transition period. ""To be frank, I am surprised by these disagreements. The positions of the EU are very logical, I think,"" said Mr Barnier. He said the UK must ""accept the ineluctable consequences of its decision to leave the EU, to leave its institutions and its policies"". ""If these disagreements persist the transition is not a given."" By BBC Political Correspondent Leila Nathoo This was a politely delivered but pointed message to Britain: you can't keep up your cake-and-eat-it approach of vowing to leave the single market and customs union while still wanting no checks at the Irish border. And don't bank on a transition period (which was supposed to be the easy bit to agree) as there's still plenty we don't see eye-to-eye on. Theresa May has been keeping the government's position deliberately vague as her ministers struggle to agree among themselves on exactly how they see Britain's future ties with the EU. But the bottom line from Brussels today? Time to talk straight and put flesh on the bones. Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister should take immediate action to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" for business. ""Theresa May must end the infighting within her cabinet, drop her reckless redlines and accept Labour's proposals for a transitional deal. ""That means seeking to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during that period."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum on any final deal with the EU, said the government ""has no plan, no strategy, and no idea"". But Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Theresa May's minority government, accused Mr Barnier of ""brandishing the threat of customs controls"" when ""everyone has committed to avoiding a hard border"". They argued that the best solution was to resolve the issue through a free trade agreement and ""fresh customs partnership with Brussels"". Mr Barnier hit back at comments by David Davis, who described a leaked EU document suggesting any dispute with the UK during the transition period could mean UK benefits, such as access to the single market, being suspended as ""frankly discourteous"". The EU negotiator said he had ""not been in the least discourteous or vindictive"" adding: ""Quite simply we have to construct a withdrawal agreement which is legally sound and does not give rise to any uncertainty in anyone's mind."" This video can not be played Ireland's Europe minister tells Today they need proposals from UK on Irish border post-Brexit On the thorny issue of the border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, Mr Barnier said there was agreement that a hard border must be avoided, but added: ""It is important to tell the truth. ""A UK decision to leave the single market and to leave the customs union would make border checks unavoidable."" Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK will leave the single market and the customs union, although she has yet to spell out in detail what she wants instead. She secured an agreement on withdrawal - including avoiding the return of a hard Irish border - in December. But that has now got to be translated into a legal text before it can be ratified by the EU - and Mr Barnier said he wanted to get rid of any ambiguity on the Irish border question. The withdrawal agreement includes a fall back position if the UK leaves without a deal, which proposes ""full regulatory alignment"" with the EU. To some this sounds like staying in the single market and customs union - but other options, preferred by the UK, to avoid border checks are still on the table. Mr Barnier said the UK has accepted the need to discus how to make ""full regulatory alignment"" work in practice, while the other options are discussed in parallel. But he added: ""Time is short - very short - and we haven't a minute to lose if we want to succeed. And we do want to succeed in this orderly withdrawal.""

Female rugby referee makes history,"Joy Neville was named World Rugby Referee of the Year in November A female referee has taken charge of a top-level men's rugby union match in the UK for the first time. Joy Neville - a former Irish rugby international - officiated atFriday's Pro14 game between Ulster and Southern Kingsat the Kingspan stadium in Belfast. She was named World Rugby Referee of the Year in November, after turning professional in 2013. Before kick-off, Neville said the match was not the end of her ambitions. In a post on Twitter, she expressed her ""excitement"" and described the historic moment as the ""next opportunity"". The 34-year-old, from Limerick, previously oversaw a Challenge Cup match between Bordeaux-BÃ¨gles and Enisei-STM in December - the first woman to do so. That followed a match between Norway and Denmark in October, in the second tier of international rugby union. Bitcoin arrests at Russian nuclear lab Quiz of the week: What killed royal swans? Eurostar launches London-Amsterdam route She also took charge of the women's 2017 World Cup final between England and New Zealand. Speaking to the BBC, Neville said she had ""never intended"" to be a referee, but considered the move after retiring from playing the sport, following her grand slam with Ireland in 2013. She said a less-than-encouraging conversation with a senior rugby official had only strengthened her determination to succeed. This video can not be played How Neville became the World Rugby Referee of the Year ""I said 'look, I want your opinion on something, I have one question - do you think it's possible for a female referee to ref in division 1A in Ireland', and he said 'Joy, not in my lifetime'"". Her appointment to referee the Pro14 match between Ulster and South Africa's Southern Kings has cemented her place in history. The Pro14 involves teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Wales and, from the start of this season, South Africa. Ulster ran out clear winners in the match,scoring nine tries in a one-sided 59-10 victory. Neville says her ambitions do not end at refereeing Pro14 games, and that ultimately she would like to officiate in the Six Nations tournament. ""To be involved with the Six Nations on the line as an official would be a dream come true. Whether that's achievable...I don't know, but I'll try,"" she said.

Handbag-snatch killer on the run,"People are warned not to approach Mark Woolley (seen now, left, and in 2001) A convicted killer who ran a woman over as she tried to stop him stealing her handbag has gone on the run after being released from prison on licence. Mark Woolley was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2001 for the murder of 42-year-old costume designer Elizabeth Sherlock. He has not been seen since a probation meeting on 31 January, Scotland Yard said. Woolley, 52, was released from HMP Ranby in Nottinghamshire in November. The former heroin addict was convicted of killing Mrs Sherlock after she chased his then-girlfriend Jackie Moorehouse, who stole her bag from a cafe at Euston station. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ""He was last seen at a probation meeting in Hackney and breached his conditions on 1 February. ""Woolley is described as a white man, 5ft 4ins in height, of slim build with greying hair and various tattoos and scars on his forehead, jaw and left ear."" Police urged people not to approach him, but to call 999. Elizabeth Sherlock died in the roadside after trying to stop Woolley driving off with her bag Mrs Sherlock chased Moorehouse after her bag - containing just Â£20 in cash, a mobile phone and bank cards - was snatched on 16 April 2001 as she waited with her husband to catch a train to Wigan for her father's birthday. Mrs Sherlock jumped on the bonnet of the then 35-year-old Woolley's Ford Fiesta and clung on to the wiper blades, pleading for her life. As the car sped off she was thrown into the air and run over by a smiling Woolley. Mrs Sherlock was left dying on the roadside, her husband a few feet away. Both Woolley and Moorehouse had scores of previous drug-related convictions and stole to fuel their heroin habit. The couple, from north London, had both denied murder. Moorehouse, then 24, was cleared of the murder and manslaughter but jailed for three years after she admitted snatching the handbag.

#MeToo lawmaker faces groping inquiry,"Cristina Garcia has previously said alcohol is not an acceptable excuse for sexual misconduct A California state assemblywoman who rose to national prominence as a campaigner against sexual assault is now herself accused of misconduct. The state legislature is investigating Democrat Cristina Garcia, who featured in a Time magazine profile of #MeToo victims last year. Ms Garcia denies groping another lawmaker's male aide and attempting to fondle a lobbyist. She said she would take a leave of absence during the inquiry. When the allegations first emerged, Ms Garcia said she had ""zero recollection of engaging in inappropriate behaviour"". ""Such behaviour is inconsistent with my values,"" she added. Ms Garcia, who was elected in 2012 and chairs the Legislative Women's Caucus and the Natural Resources Committee. pledged to participate in any investigation. ""Every complaint about sexual harassment should be taken seriously,"" she said. But in a follow-up statement,external, the influential Los Angeles-area lawmaker added: ""Upon reflection of the details alleged, I am certain I did not engage in the behaviour I am accused of.""

She says she volunteered for an unpaid leave of absence ""so as not to serve as a distraction or in any way influence the process of this investigation"", adding that she looks forward to returning to work. The first accusation comes from Daniel Fierro, who said a drunken Ms Garcia cornered him after an annual legislative softball game in 2014 in the team dugout. He said Ms Garcia stroked his back, squeezed his buttocks and attempted to grab his crotch. Mr Fierro told Politico,externalhe did not originally report the incident. He said he was 25 years old at the time. He is not the only man accusing Ms Garcia of unwanted sexual advances. Another accuser, whom Politico described as a prominent lobbyist at California's state capital, claims the lawmaker tried to fondle him at a fundraiser last year. The man, who wished to remain anonymous because he represents a major industry association, said Ms Garcia had leaned in close enough to him that he could smell alcohol on her breath. She whispered that she had ""set a goal"" for herself to have sex with him and used a vulgarity, he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The accuser said he stopped Ms Garcia from grabbing his genitals, and told her ""that ain't gonna happen"". The claims come months after the lawmaker told the New York Times she had experienced sexual harassment. ""Multiple people have grabbed my butt and grabbed my breasts,"" she said about alleged incidents in the state capital of Sacramento. ""We're talking about senior lobbyists and lawmakers."" Her story later featured inTime magazine's issue honouring ""silence breakers"". Both Mr Fierro and the lobbyist said Ms Garcia was heavily inebriated at the time of the alleged assaults. In a November interview with the Associated Press news agency about alcohol at political fundraisers, Ms Garcia said that blaming drink is not an acceptable excuse for inappropriate sexual behaviour. ""I would say that most of the public realises that our job is based on relationships, and so we are expected to go out there and socialise,"" she said.

It says this should be in place by the end of 2019. It's been a long time coming, but finally passengers will have the option of travelling between the UK and the Netherlands direct by rail. The German operator Deutsche Bahn announced and then cancelled a link between the UK and Dutch capitals five years ago. Since then, Eurostar's efforts have been plagued by technical and bureaucratic set-backs. Uptake is likely to be small, at least at first. Whilst Brits are familiar with international train travel, the Eurostar brand will be much newer to those on the other end of the line. There will be only two trains a day from the UK. That compares to 70 direct flights daily from London to Amsterdam, for example. Although Eurostar cannot compete on flexibility of travel, the train company is putting itself in direct competition with the airlines on price. Fares start at Â£35 for a one-way ticket. There will be those, particularly business travellers, who would prefer access to power sockets, free wifi and room to work on a train over the retail extravaganza of modern airports. Game-changing will be de-wrinkling the passport controls process on the return leg. Hassle-free, connected travel is a luxury many will be prepared to pay handsomely for. The rail company will be running two services a day, departing at 08:31 and 17:31 respectively, with one-way fares starting at Â£35. Eurostar also says the new service will cut the journey time between London and Brussels by 17 minutes to one hour and 48 minutes. ""The launch of the London to Amsterdam service marks a historic milestone in the expansion of international high-speed rail travel, revolutionising the connection between these important destinations,"" the company said. It says more than four million passengers travel between London and Amsterdam by air each year and therefore the market is the same size as it was when the London-Paris services launched in 1994. It points out that since then, the market for travel between London and Paris has more than doubled. Why Amsterdam is hiking tourist tax.

Trump praises ex-aide accused of abuse,"This video can not be played Trump on Porter: 'We absolutely wish him well' US President Donald Trump has paid tribute to an ex-aide who quit this week amid domestic abuse allegations. ""We wish him well,"" he said in his first public remarks on the claims against ex-White House staff secretary Rob Porter. ""He worked very hard."" Chief of staff John Kelly reportedly offered to resign his post over his handling of the matter. It is alleged Mr Porter, 40, gave one ex-wife a black eye while another filed a restraining order. He denies it. Despite the allegations, he received interim security clearance to act as gatekeeper to the US president. Mr Porter resigned on Wednesday. Mr Trump's remarks come a day after the White House said it could have better handled the accusations. Mr Trump is seen walking with Mr Porter at the White House in December 2017 Speaking in the Oval Office on Friday, Mr Trump said: ""We found out about it recently and I was surprised by it, but we certainly wish him well and it's a tough time for him. ""He did a very good job while when he was in the White House. ""And we hope he has a wonderful career and he will have a great career ahead of him. Mr Porter (R) and chief of staff John Kelly (L) ""But it was very sad when we heard about it and certainly he's also very sad now. ""He also, as you probably know, says he's innocent and I think you have to remember that."" Mr Trump did not refer to Mr Porter's accusers. But US Vice-President Mike Pence condemned Mr Porter, saying he was ""appalled"" by his alleged behaviour. ""There's no tolerance in this White House, no place in America for domestic abuse,"" he told NBC. Perfect romance turned nightmare Jennifer Willoughby says she filed a protective order against Mr Porter Mr Porter's ex-wives, Colbie Holderness and Jennifer Willoughby, both accuse him of physical and emotional abuse. His first spouse, US government analyst Ms Holderness, said he kicked her on their 2003 honeymoon in the Canary Islands and punched her in the face a couple of years later on holiday in Florence, Italy. Ms Willoughby says she was married to Mr Porter from 2009-13. The motivational speaker says she obtained a protective order against him in June 2010 after he punched the glass of the door at their Alexandria, Virginia, home. Without naming him, she wrote about her experiences in ablog post entitled Why I Stayed,external. Colbie Holderness alleged Mr Porter punched her in the face on holiday in Florence, Italy A third woman who says she was Mr Porter's girlfriend contacted his ex-wives in 2016 with allegations of ""repeated abuse"", according to CNN. The unnamed woman was reportedly seeking advice on how to leave Mr Porter, but said she was afraid of him. Mr Porter said ""these outrageous allegations are simply false"". Confessions of a 'gaslighter' Chief of Staff John Kelly had some knowledge of the accusations against his deputy. The White House has denied reports that Mr Kelly offered his resignation over the matter. The chief of staff initially called Mr Porter ""a man of true integrity and honour"" after the Daily Mail reported the ex-wives' allegations on Tuesday. No longer all the president's men White House communications director Hope Hicks' (C) handling of the controversy has reportedly displeased Mr Trump He then released a new statement saying he was shocked by the claims and stressed domestic violence was unacceptable. White House communications director Hope Hicks' handling of the controversy has reportedly displeased Mr Trump. The 29-year-old aide has recently been in a relationship with Mr Porter, a Harvard graduate and former Oxford Rhodes Scholar. Mr Trump was reportedly not consulted when Ms Hicks helped draft an initial statement defending Mr Porter. 'He wasn't happy until he had me all to himself' According to CBS News, Mr Porter approached White House Counsel Don McGahn in January 2017 to inform him his ex-wives might say unflattering things about him to background check investigators. In June 2017, Mr Porter's preliminary file was sent from the FBI to the White House security office, containing the abuse allegations. Mr Porter (L), White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn (2nd L) and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders In November, Mr McGahn received a call from an ex-girlfriend of Mr Porter alleging physical violence by the aide. Mr McGahn told the White House chief of staff there was an issue with Mr Porter's security clearance, although he was vague, reports CBS. Mr Porter told Mr Kelly his ex-wives were saying false things about him. A White House spokesman said on Thursday that Mr Kelly did not realise the extent of the claims until a photo of Ms Holderness' black eye emerged on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content?

"Barnier: Brexit transition 'not a given'EU negotiator also says UK leaving single market and customs union makes Irish border checks ""unavoidable"".4h4 hours agoUK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Key points of Michel Barnier's news briefing EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that a transition period immediately after Brexit in 2019 is ""not a given"". He said ""substantial"" disagreements remained and he had ""some problems understanding the UK's position"". And he said the UK decision to quit the customs union and single market meant Irish border checks were ""unavoidable"". David Davis said he was ""surprised"" to hear Mr Barnier was unclear on the UK's stance on the transition period. ""We are seeking a time-limited period that maintains access to each other's markets on existing terms,"" said the UK's chief Brexit negotiator. He suggested there was a ""fundamental contradiction"" in the approach the European Commission was taking to Brexit talks. ""Today they acknowledged that a way to resolve disputes and infringements is needed. ""Yet at the same time they dismissed the UK's push for reasonable safeguards to ensure our interests are protected. It is not possible to have it both ways."" EU leaked paper discourteous, says Davis What is the Brexit transition phase? Reality check: How soon are Brexit answers needed? Mr Davis says businesses need ""about two years"" with much the same trading rules as they have now to allow them to adjust after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March next year. And he had hoped to get a deal with the EU on it by this March, so talks could then move on to the bigger issue of the UK's future relationship with the remaining 27 EU nations. But Mr Barnier, speaking after a week of technical discussions between civil servants on both sides, said that three ""substantial"" disagreements remained over the transition period. The pound fell sharply against the dollar and the euro during Mr Barnier's speech before recovering slightly to stand about 0.7% down on the day. The UK's refusal to guarantee permanent rights to EU nationals who come to live and work in Britain during the transition period The right of the UK to object to new EU rules and laws during the period Whether the UK could continue to participate in new justice and home affairs policies during the transition period. ""To be frank, I am surprised by these disagreements. The positions of the EU are very logical, I think,"" said Mr Barnier. He said the UK must ""accept the ineluctable consequences of its decision to leave the EU, to leave its institutions and its policies"". ""If these disagreements persist the transition is not a given."" By BBC Political Correspondent Leila Nathoo This was a politely delivered but pointed message to Britain: you can't keep up your cake-and-eat-it approach of vowing to leave the single market and customs union while still wanting no checks at the Irish border. And don't bank on a transition period (which was supposed to be the easy bit to agree) as there's still plenty we don't see eye-to-eye on. Theresa May has been keeping the government's position deliberately vague as her ministers struggle to agree among themselves on exactly how they see Britain's future ties with the EU. But the bottom line from Brussels today? Time to talk straight and put flesh on the bones. Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister should take immediate action to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" for business. ""Theresa May must end the infighting within her cabinet, drop her reckless redlines and accept Labour's proposals for a transitional deal. ""That means seeking to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during that period."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum on any final deal with the EU, said the government ""has no plan, no strategy, and no idea"". But Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Theresa May's minority government, accused Mr Barnier of ""brandishing the threat of customs controls"" when ""everyone has committed to avoiding a hard border"". They argued that the best solution was to resolve the issue through a free trade agreement and ""fresh customs partnership with Brussels"". Mr Barnier hit back at comments by David Davis, who described a leaked EU document suggesting any dispute with the UK during the transition period could mean UK benefits, such as access to the single market, being suspended as ""frankly discourteous"". The EU negotiator said he had ""not been in the least discourteous or vindictive"" adding: ""Quite simply we have to construct a withdrawal agreement which is legally sound and does not give rise to any uncertainty in anyone's mind."" This video can not be played Ireland's Europe minister tells Today they need proposals from UK on Irish border post-Brexit On the thorny issue of the border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, Mr Barnier said there was agreement that a hard border must be avoided, but added: ""It is important to tell the truth. ""A UK decision to leave the single market and to leave the customs union would make border checks unavoidable."" Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK will leave the single market and the customs union, although she has yet to spell out in detail what she wants instead. She secured an agreement on withdrawal - including avoiding the return of a hard Irish border - in December. But that has now got to be translated into a legal text before it can be ratified by the EU - and Mr Barnier said he wanted to get rid of any ambiguity on the Irish border question. The withdrawal agreement includes a fall back position if the UK leaves without a deal, which proposes ""full regulatory alignment"" with the EU. To some this sounds like staying in the single market and customs union - but other options, preferred by the UK, to avoid border checks are still on the table. Mr Barnier said the UK has accepted the need to discus how to make ""full regulatory alignment"" work in practice, while the other options are discussed in parallel. But he added: ""Time is short - very short - and we haven't a minute to lose if we want to succeed. And we do want to succeed in this orderly withdrawal.""

"London Bridge attackers 'took steroids'The three men, who killed eight people in June 2017, were found to have DHEA in their systems.7h7 hours agoUK","Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba killed eight people in the attack last June The three men who carried out last June's London Bridge terror attack were all found to have had steroids in their systems when they died. Eight people were killed when Khurum Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed others in Borough Market. Police then shot and killed the men. At a pre-inquest hearing at the Old Bailey on Friday, the court was told samples from all three attackers contained the steroid hormone DHEA. Xavier Thomas, 45, from France and Chrissy Archibald, originally from British Columbia, were both killed on the bridge. Ignacio Echeverria Miralles De Imperial, 39, from Madrid, Sebastien Belanger, 36, from France, Sara Zelenak, 21, from Brisbane, Kirsty Boden, 28, from Loxton in South Australia, James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, and Alexandre Pigeard, 26, from Caen, in Normandy were killed in the market. The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan Toxicology reports submitted to the court said the levels of the steroid in their systems were ""above the acceptable physiological range"" and that the substance had been taken ""recently prior to deathâ¦ in a period ranging from several hours to days"". An expert witness is now going to be called to give evidence to the inquest and prepare a report on the implications of the findings. It comes after a pre-inquest hearing into the Westminster Bridge attack - that took place last March - revealed the man who killed five people, Khalid Masood, hadtaken anabolic steroids before carrying out his attack. Mark Lucraft, the Chief Coroner of England and Wales, began Friday's proceedings by offering his condolences to the victims' relatives, some of whom were in court. Referring to the ""dramatic events"" that happened just three months after the previous terror attack in London, he said: ""Central London and another iconic bridge... was the scene of shocking events that devastated the lives of many. ""I hope the [inquest] will provide answers to the obvious and understandable questions that the families have... and give comfort in such difficult circumstances"". The coroner decided that two separate inquests would be carried out - one to decide on the deaths of the victims and a second one for the attackers. The latter will have a jury present. A jury is mandatory at an inquest if the coroner has reason to believe the death resulted from an act or omission of a police officer.

US markets slip as volatility continues,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 remained in correction territory on Friday despite closing higher after another bumpy ride. The Dow ended up 1.4% at 24,190 points, while the broader S&P was 1.5% higher at 2,619 points. Both have fallen 10% from the record highs hit on 26 January, indicating a ""correction"". Despite the positive finish, both indexes posted their worst weekly losses since January 2016. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4% to 6,874 points, giving the technology-focused index its worst week since February 2016. ""I don't think the market is focused on fundamentals at all - it's very volatile,"" said Anwiti Bahuguna at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Boston. In London, the FTSE 100 index ended the day down 1.1% at 7,092 points, bringing this week's declines to about 5%. How could the stock market fall affect you? Bank deputy governor urges calm on markets Kamal Ahmed: Will the fall turn into a rout? Other European markets also suffered on Friday, with Germany's Dax falling 1.4% and France's Cac 40 shedding 1.25%. On Thursday, the Dow Jones fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week, and Asian markets followed the downward trend, with Japan's Nikkei 225 shares index closing down 2.3%. The big sell-offs around the world this week have been pinned partly on concerns over the prospect of higher interest rates. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent told the BBC that markets might have underestimated the prospect of a pick-up in inflation. ""If you look at what happened last year, particularly in the United States but also other equity markets, there was extremely strong growth - big rises in prices - as people gradually realised how strong the global economy was,"" he said. ""If markets are responding understandably to that growth, it's possible they weren't pricing in the risk that that same growth would produce some inflation and some rises in interest rates, and I think what you're seeing now is the effect of that realisation."" This video can not be played An investor's guide to the ""fear index"" The global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected, because of the strength of the economy. That concern has prompted some investors to retreat from shares. On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for the view that rates in general are set to rise. The Bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting,but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying investors was agovernment budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation. Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity.

In December, he was criticised for uploading a video of a dead body recorded in Japan's so-called suicide forest. He later apologised. Since his return to YouTube, he has made a video in which he fired a taser at a dead rat, and joked on Twitter about eating detergent capsules. YouTube said his actions could ""damage"" the wider video-making community. Following the controversial video featuring a dead body, Paul was removed from the Google Preferred programme, which sells premium advertising for the most popular 5% of YouTubers. This time it has decided to temporarily suspend all advertising on his channels. ""This is not a decision we made lightly, however, we believe he has exhibited a pattern of behaviour in his videos that makes his channel not only unsuitable for advertisers, but also potentially damaging to the broader creator community,"" the company said.

London Bridge attackers 'took steroids',"Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba killed eight people in the attack last June The three men who carried out last June's London Bridge terror attack were all found to have had steroids in their systems when they died. Eight people were killed when Khurum Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed others in Borough Market. Police then shot and killed the men. At a pre-inquest hearing at the Old Bailey on Friday, the court was told samples from all three attackers contained the steroid hormone DHEA. Xavier Thomas, 45, from France and Chrissy Archibald, originally from British Columbia, were both killed on the bridge. Ignacio Echeverria Miralles De Imperial, 39, from Madrid, Sebastien Belanger, 36, from France, Sara Zelenak, 21, from Brisbane, Kirsty Boden, 28, from Loxton in South Australia, James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, and Alexandre Pigeard, 26, from Caen, in Normandy were killed in the market. The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan Toxicology reports submitted to the court said the levels of the steroid in their systems were ""above the acceptable physiological range"" and that the substance had been taken ""recently prior to deathâ¦ in a period ranging from several hours to days"". An expert witness is now going to be called to give evidence to the inquest and prepare a report on the implications of the findings. It comes after a pre-inquest hearing into the Westminster Bridge attack - that took place last March - revealed the man who killed five people, Khalid Masood, hadtaken anabolic steroids before carrying out his attack. Mark Lucraft, the Chief Coroner of England and Wales, began Friday's proceedings by offering his condolences to the victims' relatives, some of whom were in court. Referring to the ""dramatic events"" that happened just three months after the previous terror attack in London, he said: ""Central London and another iconic bridge... was the scene of shocking events that devastated the lives of many. ""I hope the [inquest] will provide answers to the obvious and understandable questions that the families have... and give comfort in such difficult circumstances"". The coroner decided that two separate inquests would be carried out - one to decide on the deaths of the victims and a second one for the attackers. The latter will have a jury present. A jury is mandatory at an inquest if the coroner has reason to believe the death resulted from an act or omission of a police officer. However, another pre-inquest review will take place first - likely to be in either June or July - before the two inquests start fully in 2019. The two hearings are expected to last a total of two months.

""All of a sudden I heard she's screaming. I don't know why she was angry,"" he said.

Anger over lollipop man's high-five ban,"Colin Spencer, 83, said he has worked as a lollipop man for 14 years A lollipop man's ban from high-fiving school children in the road has prompted anger from parents. Colin Spencer, 83, said he has worked as a lollipop man for St George's Primary School in Heaviley, Stockport, Greater Manchester for 14 years. Stockport Council said it told him to stop the high-fives and ""concentrate on ensuring highway safety"". Dawn St Clare, whose children go to the school, said the ""ridiculous"" ruling has annoyed parents and upset pupils. Mrs Clare's children love Mr Spencer and high-fiving him cheers them up Mrs Clare said the council's school crossing patrol team sent a text to parents via the school on Tuesday asking them to tell their children not to high-five Mr Spencer on the road. A text the following day said children could high-five Mr Spencer but only on the pavement. Mrs Clare said all of the parents she has spoken to have been upset, too. ""Some of these children are on the autistic spectrum and are in a routine. ""Since the ban, crossing the road has become a little bit confusing to the children... and they've gone to school upset because Colin hasn't high-fived them and they can't understand why."" Mrs Clare added: ""I think it's ridiculous to ask the children not to do [it]; it really cheered them up in the morning."" Sainsbury's card 'a rip off for women' Snow-covered car hit by parking fine Crematorium alert over exploding coconut She said all of her five children love Mr Spencer and when they see him they shout ""lolly lolly lolly"". ""We explain to the children he's not allowed to high-five, but they keep trying."" Mr Spencer said some of the pupils have ended up in tears because he can no longer high-five them on the road. ""They sent a supervisor out to say I mustn't high-five because it's disrupting traffic. ""The younger children don't understand why - some of them have started crying."" A Stockport Council spokesperson said: ""School crossing patrols are required to continually observe the road and traffic conditions to ensure the safety. ""The school crossing patrol at this location has been asked to stop 'high-fiving' and to concentrate on his core duty of ensuring highway safety.""

Teenager admits schoolgirl knife murder,"Leonne Weeks was a student at Dinnington High School A teenager has admitted stabbing to death a 16-year-old schoolgirl in South Yorkshire. The body of Leonne Weeks was found on a pathway in Dinnington, near Rotherham, on 16 January last year. Shea Peter Heeley, 19, of Doe Quarry Lane, Dinnington, pleaded guilty to murder, at Sheffield Crown Court. A post-mortem examination showed Leonne was stabbed 28 times. Police said her body was concealed behind a dumped sofa by the footpath. More on this and other South Yorkshire stories The court heard a psychiatric assessment had concluded Heeley had no diagnosable psychiatric disorders and therefore he was fit to plead. Judge Paul Watson QC said: ""You have pleaded guilty to an offence of murder. There is only one sentence and that is a sentence of life imprisonment. ""However, I will be required to determine the minimum term you will have to serve before you can even be considered for release on parole."" Leonne's body was found on a pathway in Dinnington near Rotherham Heeley was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 5 March. Det Ch Insp Martin Tate, said: ""Leonne was a young girl who had her whole life ahead of her. ""Heeley selfishly and violently took that away, leaving a family without a daughter, a sister and a friend. ""I'm pleased that the family have not had to endure a trial and that he has today admitted his guilt.""

Will it be too cold for sport?,"XXIII Olympic Winter Games Venue:Pyeongchang, South KoreaDates:9-25 February Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, Red Button, Connected TVs, BBC Sport website and mobile app. Warped skis, fake snow and predicted windchill temperatures of -25C... is Pyeongchang going to be too cold for even a Winter Olympics? As the name of the event suggests, it is supposed to be cold - but the 2018 edition, which starts on Friday, looks set to break all records. Concerned athletes are already shivering on social media, so what will seriously sub-zero temperatures mean for events, for the equipment, and for the competitors and fans getting ready for 17 days of action? Winter Olympics - Day-by-day guide to Pyeongchang 2018 Between-2Cand-5Cfor the opening ceremony - starting at 20:00 local time (11:00 GMT) - according to the Korean Meteorological Administration's news conference on Wednesday. The agency says this is ""on par"" with average February temperatures in previous years of around0Cwith temperatures at night getting down to around -10C.To date, the 1994 edition in Lillehammer, Norway, was the coldest Games on record with a low of-11C. At nearly half a mile above sea level, Pyeongchang is regarded as one of the coldest regions of South Korea, and is Earth's coldest location for its latitude. But then on Wednesday parts of the UK woke up to temperatures as low as-9C- so what's all the fuss about? It's the windchill factor. At the opening ceremony rehearsal on Saturday, biting winds dropped the temperature to-23C.The agency said spectators should ""brace themselves"" and Olympics officials have warned everyone attending to ""wrap up and prepare properly"". Situated in the Taebaek Mountains, around 50 miles from the border with North Korea, the area is also susceptible to winds that travel down from Siberia and the Manchurian Plain in north-east China, meaning it will feel much colder than the base temperatures imply Because of the freezing temperatures, Pyeongchang is susceptible to variable levels of snowfall. Major snowstorms are a rarity in the area, and in February 2017it snowed on just seven days,externalwith an average snowfall of 6.3cm. It's a concern shared by Games organisers who, as a result, have brought in snow cannons - which force cooled water and pressurised air through a 'snow gun' - to produce it artificially at a cost of Â£4.4m. At the Yongpyong Alpine Centre - which will host slalom and giant slalom alpine skiing races - 250 snow guns served by three pumping stations have been installed. ""The wind is the worst - you walk around the Olympic village and it is like a nightmare,"" says Canadian skeleton racer Kevin Boyer, ""It's funny because coming from Canada we talk about being used to the cold but this is a cold we haven't seen before."" The first real test will be Friday's opening ceremony, with reports that some athletes may miss it altogether. The Italian team has already told any staff with existing health issues to skip the curtain-raiser and has reminded its athletes to keep moving at all times. The US team havespecially heated jackets,externalfor the opening ceremony, while Australian freestyle skier Lydia Lassila has turned down the opportunity to carry her nation's flag into the opening ceremony to avoid the cold before competition. Team GB have, after a ""significant"" amount of planning, designed a kit geared around both ""performance and warmth"". Winter Olympics 2018: Great Britain's team for Pyeongchang In terms of the events, cross country skiing rules say that at -20C racing will be postponed - but that's base temperature not including windchill factor. Many previous Olympic events have been postponed because of wind, too much snow, or fog but never purely because it's too cold. Team GB cross country skier Andrew Musgrave will make his third Olympic appearance in Pyeongchang ""One of the coaches said they are throwing the skis out after today,"" said ski course technician Craig Randell, overseeing practice on Wednesday. ""You can't do anything about it, but with the cold temperatures the snow adheres to the ski base and twists it. ""They are turning their skis to garbage real fast."" Austrian alpine skier Marcel Hirscher added: ""Snow crystals get really sharp when temperatures go to -20C. It's the same as lighting a fire and burning your ski base because the snow crystals get such sharp edges."" Such icy surfaces can make competing difficult, with skiers and snowboarders struggling to dig their edges in to make turns. That said, if the ice is smooth it makes for the ultimate piste condition for the speed skiing events of downhill and super-G. On the bobsleigh and skeleton track, if temperatures are too low it can make the ice sticky, ultimately slowing the sleds down. But there's good news if you're a Dave Ryding fan. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, four-time winter Olympian Chemmy Alcott said: ""Artificial snow is very grippy and you feel great on it. ""It suits Dave Ryding, who is one of our best hopes."" The Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium - where the opening and closing ceremonies will take place - was built without a roof in order to save time, but it's a decision that organisers could come to regret given the current temperature forecast. Costing $58m (Â£44.1m) to build, the stadium also lacks central heating as it was deemed too expensive for the arena, which will be dismantled after the conclusion of March's Winter Paralympic Games. According to reports, six people who attended a concert at the pentagonal stadium in December weretreated for hypothermia,external, while others huddled in bathrooms to take a break from the icy cold. As a result, each of the 43,000 spectators expected to attend the opening ceremony on Friday will receive heating pads, a blanket, a warm seat cushion and a raincoat, while 18 heat shelters, 40 large heaters and windshields have been put up. Organisers are also planning audience participation during pre-ceremony entertainment in order to keep spectators as warm as possible. The stadium will be dismantled after the conclusion of the Olympic and Paralympic Games The last edition of the Winter Olympics - in the sub-tropical Russian city of Sochi in 2014 - was deemed the warmest ever as temperatures hit a high of 20C, hotter than some days of theLondon 2012 Summer Olympics,external. Organisers were forced to store snow in order to have enough for the duration of the Games - much of it man-made. The average temperature was just shy of 10C, beating the previous record set four years earlier at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games. Vancouver had never seen a warmer stretch of winter weather than the 31-day period that finished on 9 February, just three days before the opening ceremony. As with their successors in 2014, organisers in Canada were forced to bring in snow by thetruckload,external, with only the slopes of Whistler - situated 120km north of Vancouver - having enough of the natural stuff to host the alpine and nordic skiing events. Cross country skiers pass a section of melted snow during the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics BBC weatherman Simon King After the relatively warm Winter Olympics of Sochi and Vancouver, where there were issues with snow cover, this Olympic Games will be much colder. There will be variations and some extremes in temperature from the colder Pyeongchang mountain cluster (especially higher up in the Phoenix Snow Park and Jeongseon Alpine Centre where the air temperature is likely to be much lower), to the less cold coastal cluster of Gangneung where some events are taking place. February is typically one of the driest months of the year in Pyeongchang but on average it still gets around 5cm of fresh snow with it snowing on around 12 days of the month. That's the average.  As for the conditions over the next couple of weeks, it's very likely to be colder than average with temperatures staying below freezing for most of the time. With the wind it'll feel bitterly cold and in the colder venues probably feel more like -25C to -30C.  It is also looking drier than average during the Games so while there will be some snow at times, on the whole it'll be dry.

Stormont deal could be unveiled in days,"Stormont has been without a devolved government for more than a year There is growing speculation that a deal to end the year-long political deadlock at Stormont could be unveiled as early as next week. Northern Ireland'spower-sharing executive collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in last January. On Friday, both parties stayed away from scheduled round-table talks. Instead, British and Irish ministers met the three smaller parties - Ulster Unionists, SDLP and Alliance. Stormont deadlock Q&A NI power-sharing talks resume The politicians were told by Northern Ireland Office officials that the discussions involving the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are at ""a critical stage"". It is understood that the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has been meeting Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill andincoming party president Mary Lou McDonaldelsewhere in Stormont's Parliament Buildings. Karen Bradley is the secretary of state for Northern Ireland The new Sinn FÃ©in leadership is due to take over from Gerry Adamsat the weekend, and some sources believe the parties might feel ready to move forward after that transition has been completed. Whilst the outline of an agreement is thought to be in place, neither of the two big parties have yet signed up. One informed source suggested that some DUP MPs have yet to be convinced. In a statement on Friday night, the DUP leader said ""progress has been made"" but added that there was ""more work to do"". ""I have set out the parameters for a deal. It must be fair and balanced,"" Mrs Foster added. It is understood Arlene Foster has been meeting with Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald ""Our negotiating team will continue working next week. I want to see ministerial-led government restored to Northern Ireland. ""I hope that can be achieved by devolved government and will work towards that end."" On his last night as leader of Sinn FÃ©in, the outgoing party president Gerry Adams said: ""It isn't sorted out as we speak. ""We have made some progress but there are still considerable obstacles but as I said to our unionist friends, this is the last chance agreement."" Both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have previously said that the talks process cannot continue indefinitely. Gerry Adams was pictured leaving Stormont on his last night as leader of Sinn FÃ©in The smaller parties expressed their frustration at the fact that not all the five parties attended Friday's talks. The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, told the two governments: ""You've got my number, give me a call when something is happening."" In a later statement, he said: ""The truth is, this isn't an all-party process. It is an exclusive two-party process. ""The SDLP are not here to window dress but we want to be constructive. I've told both governments when the two-party process is concluded and they are ready to engage in five-party negotiations the SDLP will be ready to negotiate."" Colum Eastwood told the governments to give him a call when something is happening Meanwhile, an Ulster Unionist source said the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, told them: ""I feel your frustration"". It is understood the UUP leader, Robin Swann, replied: ""I am not here for a counselling session. I am here to get a government up and running"". Earlier, it emerged thatthe prime minister has been considering flying over to Belfast next week if that will help the talks. Last month, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said both he and Theresa May were happy to get engaged personally, if they thought it would make a difference. The details of any potential deal remain unclear. It is thought the parties have been examining how to resolve their differences over Irish language legislation. Previously, the Alliance party has suggested that a package of separate bills dealing with Irish, Ulster Scots and other languages might break the impasse. Sinn FÃ©in wants an Irish language act but the DUP is opposed to that demand DUP negotiators are understood to be keen to ensure there should be no repeat of last year's breakdown of devolution. They have suggested that some way to make the Stormont institutions more sustainable should be introduced. There has also been discussion of changes to the operation of the assembly's controversial""petition of concern"" system, which was designed to safeguard minorities but has been used to block a number of measures. Earlier this week, the government rejected a suggestion from Labour that the issue of same sex marriage should be taken off the talks agenda and dealt with directly via Westminster legislation. However, some sources suggest the idea could be altered so that Westminster might take over the issue if the assembly can not deal with it within a set period of time.

US markets open higher amid volatility,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 remained in correction territory on Friday despite closing higher after another bumpy ride. The Dow ended up 1.4% at 24,190 points, while the broader S&P was 1.5% higher at 2,619 points. Both have fallen 10% from the record highs hit on 26 January, indicating a ""correction"". Despite the positive finish, both indexes posted their worst weekly losses since January 2016. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4% to 6,874 points, giving the technology-focused index its worst week since February 2016. ""I don't think the market is focused on fundamentals at all - it's very volatile,"" said Anwiti Bahuguna at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Boston. In London, the FTSE 100 index ended the day down 1.1% at 7,092 points, bringing this week's declines to about 5%. How could the stock market fall affect you? Bank deputy governor urges calm on markets Kamal Ahmed: Will the fall turn into a rout? Other European markets also suffered on Friday, with Germany's Dax falling 1.4% and France's Cac 40 shedding 1.25%. On Thursday, the Dow Jones fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week, and Asian markets followed the downward trend, with Japan's Nikkei 225 shares index closing down 2.3%. The big sell-offs around the world this week have been pinned partly on concerns over the prospect of higher interest rates. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent told the BBC that markets might have underestimated the prospect of a pick-up in inflation. ""If you look at what happened last year, particularly in the United States but also other equity markets, there was extremely strong growth - big rises in prices - as people gradually realised how strong the global economy was,"" he said. ""If markets are responding understandably to that growth, it's possible they weren't pricing in the risk that that same growth would produce some inflation and some rises in interest rates, and I think what you're seeing now is the effect of that realisation."" This video can not be played An investor's guide to the ""fear index"" The global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected, because of the strength of the economy. That concern has prompted some investors to retreat from shares. On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for the view that rates in general are set to rise. The Bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting,but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying investors was agovernment budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation. Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity.

Facebook testing 'downvote' button,"Facebook is testing a new ""downvote"" button that will let people hide comments and provide feedback about them. However, the social network denied that the new feature was a ""dislike"" button, which many Facebook users have requested. The downvote button is being tried out by a small number of US users. The company also announced a number of other measures aimed at improving the Facebook community. The social network confirmed the test to news siteTech Crunch,external. ""We are exploring a feature for people to give us feedback about comments on public page posts. This is running for a small set of people in the US only,"" the company said in a statement. Downvoted comments disappear from your news feed Other social sites such as Reddit have a ""downvote"" option that reduces the visibility of unpopular posts. When Facebook's downvote button is clicked, the selected comment is hidden. People can then decide whether to flag a post as ""offensive"", ""misleading"" or ""off-topic"". However, it does not affect the visibility of the post for other people and does not affect its ranking in the news feed. Martin Garner, tech analyst at CCS Insight, said the button appeared to be part of Facebook's continued resistance to labelling itself a publisher. ""It has become very clear that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't want Facebook to have the responsibility of identifying what is offensive or misleading - and what is not - because that would put him into the position of being a publisher rather than a platform,"" he said. ""He doesn't want to do that as it takes the business in a different direction - so he is leaning on the community to do it. ""It is an open question as to whether that's the right answer or not but that's where this fits in."" On Friday, the company also announced it would double the number of engineers it employs in London to develop solutions to the problems Facebook faces. It declined to share how many additional engineers it was hiring, but said the move was an investment to ""remove bad content from the platform"". ""Whether it's scamming, bullying, harassment or false news, they will work with experts to understand the issue, identify the pattern and build a solution,"" said Facebook's Chris Cox. It also announced a $10million (Â£7m) fund that it will give away to community groups in a bid to tackle political ""polarisation"". ""Non-political communities such as churches, sports groups, parenting groups, dog walkers - these are the natural antidote to polarisation,"" said Mr Cox. ""One of the best things we can do is help people meet others who aren't like them. Groups are most effective when they bring people together offline. They're a chance for people to bond over something they do share."" Facebook Groups will be able to apply for a slice of the fund. Five community leaders will be given $1m (or about Â£715,000 in the UK) to further their causes. Up to 100 additional groups will receive up to $50,000 (or Â£35,000 in the UK).

"London Bridge attackers 'took steroids'The three men, who killed eight people in June 2017, were found to have DHEA in their systems.1han hour agoUK","Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba killed eight people in the attack last June The three men who carried out last June's London Bridge terror attack were all found to have had steroids in their systems when they died. Eight people were killed when Khurum Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed others in Borough Market. Police then shot and killed the men. At a pre-inquest hearing at the Old Bailey on Friday, the court was told samples from all three attackers contained the steroid hormone DHEA. Xavier Thomas, 45, from France and Chrissy Archibald, originally from British Columbia, were both killed on the bridge. Ignacio Echeverria Miralles De Imperial, 39, from Madrid, Sebastien Belanger, 36, from France, Sara Zelenak, 21, from Brisbane, Kirsty Boden, 28, from Loxton in South Australia, James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, and Alexandre Pigeard, 26, from Caen, in Normandy were killed in the market. The victims of the attack clockwise - Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan Toxicology reports submitted to the court said the levels of the steroid in their systems were ""above the acceptable physiological range"" and that the substance had been taken ""recently prior to deathâ¦ in a period ranging from several hours to days"". An expert witness is now going to be called to give evidence to the inquest and prepare a report on the implications of the findings. It comes after a pre-inquest hearing into the Westminster Bridge attack - that took place last March - revealed the man who killed five people, Khalid Masood, hadtaken anabolic steroids before carrying out his attack. Mark Lucraft, the Chief Coroner of England and Wales, began Friday's proceedings by offering his condolences to the victims' relatives, some of whom were in court. Referring to the ""dramatic events"" that happened just three months after the previous terror attack in London, he said: ""Central London and another iconic bridge... was the scene of shocking events that devastated the lives of many. ""I hope the [inquest] will provide answers to the obvious and understandable questions that the families have... and give comfort in such difficult circumstances"". The coroner decided that two separate inquests would be carried out - one to decide on the deaths of the victims and a second one for the attackers. The latter will have a jury present. A jury is mandatory at an inquest if the coroner has reason to believe the death resulted from an act or omission of a police officer. However, another pre-inquest review will take place first - likely to be in either June or July - before the two inquests start fully in 2019. The two hearings are expected to last a total of two months.

"UK trade deficit widens in DecemberThe gap between exports and imports rises, while the closure of a key oil pipeline hits industrial output.3h3 hours agoBusiness","A rise in oil prices and higher imports contributed to a widening of the UK's goods trade deficit in December. The gap between exports and imports rose to Â£13.6bn, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external, which was higher than analysts' forecasts. Separate ONS data showed industrial output experienced its biggest fall since 2012,external, largely due to the shutdown of the Forties North Sea pipeline. Industrial output fell by 1.3% in December from the month before. However, the ONS said UK's manufacturing sector, which is part of overall industrial output, saw output rise by 0.3% on the month, marking the eighth consecutive month of growth in the sector - the longest run in almost 30 years. Further ONS data showed construction output also rose,external, by 1.6%, in December. The total trade deficit - which covers goods and services - widened by Â£1.2bn to Â£4.9bn between November and December. Senior ONS statistician Ole Black said: ""The headline trade deficit widened in the fourth quarter with the impact of increased oil imports accentuated by rising crude prices."" ""Construction was broadly flat across 2017, thanks to a strong December. However, house building and infrastructure were the only bright spots with all other areas of the industry falling back throughout the year."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ""The sharp deterioration in the UK's net trade position in December was disappointing and means that trade is likely to have been a drag on UK growth in the final quarter of the year."" The BCC said people were continuing to buy imports despite the post-Brexit fall in the value of the pound, which has made goods bought in from abroad more expensive. ""While many exporters are benefiting from stronger growth in key trading markets, imports continue to grow at a solid pace, with businesses continuing to report little in the way of import substitution despite their high cost. ""If this trend continues as we expect, the contribution of net trade to UK GDP growth over the near term is likely to be limited at best."" The latest official data is not expected to alter the views expressed by the Bank of England on Thursday that UK growth is improving and may lead to the need for a rise in interest rates relatively soon. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said industrial production for the final quarter of 2017 was slightly lower than the 0.6% rise incorporated in the preliminary estimate of GDP.

Daily Mirror owner to buy Express titles,"Richard Desmond is chairman of Northern & Shell The owner of the Daily Mirror has agreed to buy the company behind titles including the Daily Express, the Daily Star and magazines such as OK! Trinity Mirror is to pay Â£126.7m for the publishing assets of Northern & Shell, which is chaired by Richard Desmond. Sale talks were announced in September, but a deal between the two has been on the cards for some time. The sale brings to an end Mr Desmond's 18 years as a UK newspaper owner. Northern & Shell's publishing assets include the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star and Daily Star Sunday, as well as three celebrity magazines, OK!, New! and Star. Simon Fox, chief executive of Trinity Mirror, said: ""Northern & Shell's titles have a large and loyal readership, a growing digital presence and a stable revenue mix and offer an excellent fit with Trinity Mirror."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he said: ""It's a very wise investment. We've had plenty of time to think about this carefully."" He said the deal would lead to cost savings, as the titles could pool their resources. ""For example, [instead of] sending two reporters to a football game, we can send one."" Trinity Mirror expects the deal to lead to savings of Â£20m a year. Mr Fox pledged that the publications would retain their identities: ""The Daily Express is not going to become left-wing and the Mirror is not going to become right-wing."" Fifty years ago, the Daily  Mirror and the Daily Express were Britain's two biggest papers, selling more than eight million copies a day. Today, their combined sales are less than a million and continuing to fall. This isn't a solution to the decline of print, but a way to make the most of a declining asset until someone finds a way of making serious money from news in the internet age. The other question is, what will happen to the journalism? The Express's front-page formula of health, weather and migrants is carefully aimed at its loyal but shrinking band of older, conservative readers. It would be a brave owner who took it in a radical new direction. Its Euroscepticism in particular has a long history. The Express was one of the few papers to oppose joining the Common Market in the early 1970s, although it did eventually back ""yes"" in the 1975 referendum. As well as the Mirror titles, Trinity Mirror also owns a string of leading local papers and is the UK's biggest regional newspaper owner. It publishes the Daily Record, the Sunday People and more than 200 regional newspapers, including the Birmingham Post and the Manchester Evening News. The price being paid by Trinity Mirror is only slightly above the Â£125m paid by Mr Desmond for the Express titles in 2000. The newspaper industry faces many challenges, including the growing move to online readership and the dilemma between charging readers, who may then refuse to pay and get their news elsewhere for nothing, or giving away content and risk failing to cover costs through advertising. Mr Desmond's other interests include the Health Lottery, which he has run since 2011. It is not a national lottery, but a collection of 51 local society lotteries that raise funds for health-related good causes. He is reported to be contemplating whether to bid for the licence to run the official National Lottery. Daily Mirror: 581,877 Sunday Mirror: 493,069 Sunday People: 191,188 Daily Star: 391,509 Daily Star - Sunday: 239,853 Daily Express: 364,933 Sunday Express: 317,893 Desmond 'plans National Lottery bid' Mirror in talks to buy Express newspapers How much of Fleet Street is for sale?

Oxfam denies 'Haiti prostitute' cover-up,"Haiti has never fully recovered from the 2010 earthquake that killed thousands of people One of the UK's biggest charities has denied allegations it covered up the use of prostitutes by its aid workers in Haiti. Responding to a report in The Times newspaper, Oxfam admitted that the behaviour of some of its staff had been ""totally unacceptable"". But the charity said it had publicly announced an investigation into the allegations when they surfaced in 2011. Several senior aid workers were dismissed following the investigation. ""The behaviour of some members of Oxfam staff uncovered in Haiti in 2011 was totally unacceptable, contrary to our values and the high standards we expect of our staff,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. ""Our primary aim was always to root out and take action against those involved and we publicly announced, including to media, both the investigation and the action we took as a result."" Head of Oxfam in Haiti resigns amid inquiry Oxfam said four members of staff were dismissed and three, including the country director, were allowed to resign before the end of the investigation. The director was Roland Van Hauwermeiren, who The Times alleges used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam. At the time, the charity said he had left because of serious breaches of its code of conduct. But reports say Oxfam failed to specify the men had been using prostitutes.,externalThe charity denies this, and says it disclosed sexual misconduct to the charities regulator. Oxfam has been working in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, since 1978 Dame Barbara Stocking, who was the head of Oxfam in 2011, told the BBC that the charity had a long record of having a very good code of conduct. ""Of course when that happened we looked at it all again,"" she said. ""New whistleblowing procedures were put in place, [there was] more safeguarding work and more training. You just have to have eternal vigilance."" She said Oxfam often worked in very difficult locations ""where the rule of law isn't going on"". UK culture secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC that the allegations were ""abhorrent and completely unacceptable"". ""Oxfam must now provide the Charities Commission with all the evidence they hold of events that happened in Haiti as a matter of urgency,"" he said. ""Charities must ensure that they have the highest standards of transparency and safeguarding procedures in place to protect vulnerable people and maintain the trust of the public."" A spokeswoman for the Charities Commission said: ""In August 2011, Oxfam made a report to the Commission about an ongoing internal investigation into allegations of misconduct by staff members involved in their Haiti programme. ""At the time, and based on the information provided, we were satisfied that the trustees were handling matters appropriately and did not have regulatory concerns."" The spokeswoman added: ""We will expect the charity to provide us with assurance that it has learnt lessons from past incidents"". Haiti became the world's first black-led republic and the first independent Caribbean state when it threw off French colonial control and slavery in the early 19th century. Read more about Haiti Political instability and a spate of natural disasters in recent decades have left Haiti as the poorest nation in the Americas. A devastating earthquake, the worst in more than 200 years, hit the country in 2010.

First human eggs grown in laboratory,"This video can not be played 'It could be of huge benefit to children having cancer treatment' Human eggs have been grown in the laboratory for the first time, say researchers at the University of Edinburgh. The team say the technique could lead to new ways of preserving the fertility of children having cancer treatment. It is also an opportunity to explore how human eggs develop, much of which remains a mystery to science. Experts said it was an exciting breakthrough, but more work was needed before it could be used clinically. Women are born with immature eggs in their ovaries that can develop fully only after puberty. It has taken decades of work, but scientists can now grow eggs to maturity outside of the ovary. It requires carefully controlling laboratory conditions including oxygen levels, hormones, proteins that simulate growth and the medium in which the eggs are cultured. But while the scientists have shown it is possible, the approach published in the journal Molecular Human Reproduction still needs refinement. It is very inefficient with only 10% of eggs completing their journey to maturity. And the eggs have not been fertilised, so it is uncertain how viable they are. Prof Evelyn Telfer, one of the researchers, told the BBC: ""It's very exciting to obtain proof of principle that it's possible to reach this stage in human tissue. ""But that has to be tempered by the whole lot of work needed to improve the culture conditions and test the quality of the oocytes [eggs]. ""But apart from any clinical applications, this is a big breakthrough in improving understanding of human egg development."" UK scientists edit DNA of human embryos First monkey clones created in the lab First three-parent baby born to infertile couple A lab-grown, human egg made by scientists at the University of Edinburgh The process is very tightly controlled and timed in the human body - some eggs will mature during the teenage years, others more than two decades later. An egg needs to lose half its genetic material during development, otherwise there would be too much DNA when it was fertilised by a sperm. This excess is cast off into a miniature cell called a polar body, but in the study the polar bodies were abnormally large. ""This is a concern,"" said Prof Telfer. But it is one she thinks can be addressed by improving the technology. Work on mouse eggs, which was nailed 20 years ago, showed the technology could be used to produce live animals. Matching this achievement in human tissue could eventually be used to help children having cancer treatment. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy risks making you sterile. Women can freeze matured eggs, or even embryos if they are fertilised with a partner's sperm, before starting treatment - but this is not possible for girls with childhood cancers. At the moment they can have ovarian tissue frozen before treatment, which is then put back in to mature years later if the patient wants children of their own. But if there are any abnormalities in the frozen sample then doctors will think it is too risky. Being able to make eggs in the lab would be a safer option for those patients. Mr Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, said: ""This work represents a genuine step forward in our understanding. ""Although still in small numbers and requiring optimisation, this preliminary work offers hope for patients."" It would be legal to fertilise one of the lab-made eggs to create an embryo for research purposes in the UK. But the team in Edinburgh do not have a licence to carry out the experiment. They are discussing whether to apply to the embryo authority for one, or collaborate with a centre that already has one. Prof Azim Surani, the director of germline research at University of Cambridge's Gurdon Institute, said: ""Molecular characterisation and chromosomal analysis is needed to show how these egg cells compare with normal eggs. ""It might be of interest to test the developmental potential of these eggs in culture to blastocyst stage, by attempting IVF.""

Crush death student was 'exceptional sportswoman'Olivia Burt died when she was crushed beneath a barrier outside a nightclub in Durham.4h4 hours agoTyne & Wear,"Olivia Burt had been head girl at her school before starting university A student who died when she was crushed beneath a barrier outside a nightclub was ""an exceptional sportswoman"" who had sailed for Britain. Olivia Burt suffered head injuries outside Missoula in Durham just before midnight on Wednesday. First-aiders tried to save her life but the 20-year-old, from Hampshire, died at the scene. Professor David Held of Durham University said Miss Burt was ""bright and outstandingly able"". Prof Held, Master of University College, said: ""The staff and students acutely feel the loss of Olivia Burt. ""She arrived last autumn to begin reading natural science with glowing references from her school where she was regarded in the highest possible terms. ""She had an outstanding academic record and was an exceptional sportswoman. ""Those students close to her have lost a wonderful friend, whom in their shock they grieve for, alongside her family and friends. ""The college has lost a bright and outstandingly able student.  It is hard to come to terms with her loss, and we will miss her greatly."" Miss Burt, a former head girl at Bournemouth School for Girls, had been in the European Championships with the British Sailing Team and had recently joined the university's team. Forensic investigators have been at the scene According to The Tab student newspaper, the bar was packed and there was a long queue waiting to get in. In a statement, Missoula said it was ""a terrible accident"" and said staff were working with the police and security company that provides door staff. Det Supt Kevin Weir, of Durham Police, said the force and Durham County Council were investigating the death. Missoula's Wednesday-evening event, Game Over, is described by the club as Durham's biggest student night. Students said the venue in Walkergate is often busy and uses barriers when queues of people are waiting to get in. Chris Atherton, a spokesman for The Royal Yachting Association, of which Miss Burt was also a member, said: ""Olivia's passion for sailing always shone through and all those who knew her in the sailing community will miss her tremendously; she was both a likeable and fair competitor.""

US Congress votes to end brief shutdown,"President Donald Trump tweeted that he had signed the bill re-opening the government President Donald Trump has signed a sweeping budget bill approved by Congress to re-open the government after it was briefly closed overnight. Federal funding for government services expired at midnight (05:00 GMT), after the Senate missed a voting deadline. The 650-page plan proposes an increase in spending on defence and domestic services of about $300bn (Â£215bn). The shutdown, which lasted five hours, was the second under the Republican-controlled Congress this year. Where's Trump's $500bn spending splurge going? What does a government shutdown cost? The president, who signed the bill early on Friday, said the military ""will now be stronger than ever before"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The bill had been expected to pass before the midnight deadline but lawmakers struggled with last-minute objections from Republican Senator Rand Paul, which meant they could not vote in time. The shutdown came within three weeks of the last one. Lawmakers have wrangled over the spending plan and other political demands from either side. The House approved the bill by 240 votes to 186. The Senate had passed it by 71 to 28 three hours earlier. Winners and losers from the January shutdown House Speaker Paul Ryan, a top Republican, said the bill was ""a great victory for our men and women in uniform"" as the military would get more resources. He said: ""Ultimately, neither side got everything it wanted in this agreement, but we reached a bipartisan compromise that puts the safety and wellbeing of the American people first."" Politicians from both opposing parties criticised Senator Paul for slowing the bill up and provoking the shutdown. Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill said ""it looked like he was clueless"", while Republican Senator John Thune called the shutdown ""a colossal waste of time"". While the spending bill's funding for the Pentagon delighted the national security wing of the party, fiscal conservatives were concerned about ramifications for the nation's debt. In a doom-laden speech,Senator Paul angrily charged his fellow Republicans with fiscal profligacy, accusing his colleagues of ""spending us into oblivion"". ""I ran for office because I was very critical of President Obama's trillion-dollar deficits,"" he said. ""Now we have Republicans, hand-in-hand with Democrats, offering us trillion-dollar deficits. ""I can't in all good honesty, in all good faith, just look the other way just because my party is now complicit in the deficits."" This would be ""the very definition of hypocrisy"", he added. US spending-hike budget a 'monstrosity', say budget hawks The two-year budget deal, proposed by Senate leaders on Wednesday, increases spending by ""just shy"" of $300bn, according to White House legislative affairs director Marc Short. The Washington Post put the figure,externalat half a trillion dollars. The bill contains $165bn of additional defence spending and $131bn in domestic spending, including funding for healthcare, infrastructure and tackling the US opioid crisis, reports Reuters news agency. The bipartisan agreement also keeps the government open until March 23, giving lawmakers more time to draft a full-year budget to fund federal agencies. The proposal would raise the US debt ceiling until March 2019. Despite the support of their Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who said the budget accord will ""break the long cycle of spending crises"", some Democrats have complained that the bill does not address immigration.

"Barnier: Brexit transition 'not a given'EU negotiator also says UK leaving single market and customs union means Irish border checks are ""unavoidable"".1ma minute agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Key points of Michel Barnier's news briefing EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that a transition period immediately after Brexit in 2019 is ""not a given"". He said ""substantial"" disagreements remained and he had ""some problems understanding the UK's position"". And he said the UK decision to quit the customs union and single market meant Irish border checks were ""unavoidable"". David Davis said he was ""surprised"" to hear Mr Barnier was unclear on the UK's stance on the transition period. ""We are seeking a time-limited period that maintains access to each other's markets on existing terms,"" said the UK's chief Brexit negotiator. He suggested there was a ""fundamental contradiction"" in the approach the European Commission was taking to Brexit talks. ""Today they acknowledged that a way to resolve disputes and infringements is needed. ""Yet at the same time they dismissed the UK's push for reasonable safeguards to ensure our interests are protected. It is not possible to have it both ways."" EU leaked paper discourteous, says Davis What is the Brexit transition phase? Reality check: How soon are Brexit answers needed? Mr Davis says businesses need ""about two years"" with much the same trading rules as they have now to allow them to adjust after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March next year. And he had hoped to get a deal with the EU on it by this March, so talks could then move on to the bigger issue of the UK's future relationship with the remaining 27 EU nations. But Mr Barnier, speaking after a week of technical discussions between civil servants on both sides, said that three ""substantial"" disagreements remained over the transition period. The pound fell sharply against the dollar and the euro during Mr Barnier's speech before recovering slightly to stand about 0.7% down on the day. The UK's refusal to guarantee permanent rights to EU nationals who come to live and work in Britain during the transition period The right of the UK to object to new EU rules and laws during the period Whether the UK could continue to participate in new justice and home affairs policies during the transition period. ""To be frank, I am surprised by these disagreements. The positions of the EU are very logical, I think,"" said Mr Barnier. He said the UK must ""accept the ineluctable consequences of its decision to leave the EU, to leave its institutions and its policies"". ""If these disagreements persist the transition is not a given."" By BBC Political Correspondent Leila Nathoo This was a politely delivered but pointed message to Britain: you can't keep up your cake-and-eat-it approach of vowing to leave the single market and customs union while still wanting no checks at the Irish border. And don't bank on a transition period (which was supposed to be the easy bit to agree) as there's still plenty we don't see eye-to-eye on. Theresa May has been keeping the government's position deliberately vague as her ministers struggle to agree among themselves on exactly how they see Britain's future ties with the EU. But the bottom line from Brussels today? Time to talk straight and put flesh on the bones. Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister should take immediate action to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" for business. ""Theresa May must end the infighting within her cabinet, drop her reckless redlines and accept Labour's proposals for a transitional deal. ""That means seeking to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during that period."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum on any final deal with the EU, said the government ""has no plan, no strategy, and no idea"". But Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Theresa May's minority government, accused Mr Barnier of ""brandishing the threat of customs controls"" when ""everyone has committed to avoiding a hard border"". They argued that the best solution was to resolve the issue through a free trade agreement and ""fresh customs partnership with Brussels"". Mr Barnier hit back at comments by David Davis, who described a leaked EU document suggesting any dispute with the UK during the transition period could mean UK benefits, such as access to the single market, being suspended as ""frankly discourteous"". The EU negotiator said he had ""not been in the least discourteous or vindictive"" adding: ""Quite simply we have to construct a withdrawal agreement which is legally sound and does not give rise to any uncertainty in anyone's mind."" This video can not be played Ireland's Europe minister tells Today they need proposals from UK on Irish border post-Brexit On the thorny issue of the border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, Mr Barnier said there was agreement that a hard border must be avoided, but added: ""It is important to tell the truth. ""A UK decision to leave the single market and to leave the customs union would make border checks unavoidable."" Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK will leave the single market and the customs union, although she has yet to spell out in detail what she wants instead. She secured an agreement on withdrawal - including avoiding the return of a hard Irish border - in December. But that has now got to be translated into a legal text before it can be ratified by the EU - and Mr Barnier said he wanted to get rid of any ambiguity on the Irish border question. The withdrawal agreement includes a fall back position if the UK leaves without a deal, which proposes ""full regulatory alignment"" with the EU. To some this sounds like staying in the single market and customs union - but other options, preferred by the UK, to avoid border checks are still on the table. Mr Barnier said the UK has accepted the need to discus how to make ""full regulatory alignment"" work in practice, while the other options are discussed in parallel. But he added: ""Time is short - very short - and we haven't a minute to lose if we want to succeed. And we do want to succeed in this orderly withdrawal.""

US Congress votes to end brief shutdownThe US government had shut down at midnight and was officially closed for five hours.1han hour agoUS & Canada,"President Donald Trump tweeted that he had signed the bill re-opening the government President Donald Trump has signed a sweeping budget bill approved by Congress to re-open the government after it was briefly closed overnight. Federal funding for government services expired at midnight (05:00 GMT), after the Senate missed a voting deadline. The 650-page plan proposes an increase in spending on defence and domestic services of about $300bn (Â£215bn). The shutdown, which lasted five hours, was the second under the Republican-controlled Congress this year. Where's Trump's $500bn spending splurge going? What does a government shutdown cost? The president, who signed the bill early on Friday, said the military ""will now be stronger than ever before"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The bill had been expected to pass before the midnight deadline but lawmakers struggled with last-minute objections from Republican Senator Rand Paul, which meant they could not vote in time. The shutdown came within three weeks of the last one. Lawmakers have wrangled over the spending plan and other political demands from either side. The House approved the bill by 240 votes to 186. The Senate had passed it by 71 to 28 three hours earlier. Winners and losers from the January shutdown House Speaker Paul Ryan, a top Republican, said the bill was ""a great victory for our men and women in uniform"" as the military would get more resources. He said: ""Ultimately, neither side got everything it wanted in this agreement, but we reached a bipartisan compromise that puts the safety and wellbeing of the American people first."" Politicians from both opposing parties criticised Senator Paul for slowing the bill up and provoking the shutdown. Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill said ""it looked like he was clueless"", while Republican Senator John Thune called the shutdown ""a colossal waste of time"". While the spending bill's funding for the Pentagon delighted the national security wing of the party, fiscal conservatives were concerned about ramifications for the nation's debt. In a doom-laden speech,Senator Paul angrily charged his fellow Republicans with fiscal profligacy, accusing his colleagues of ""spending us into oblivion"". ""I ran for office because I was very critical of President Obama's trillion-dollar deficits,"" he said. ""Now we have Republicans, hand-in-hand with Democrats, offering us trillion-dollar deficits. ""I can't in all good honesty, in all good faith, just look the other way just because my party is now complicit in the deficits."" This would be ""the very definition of hypocrisy"", he added. US spending-hike budget a 'monstrosity', say budget hawks The two-year budget deal, proposed by Senate leaders on Wednesday, increases spending by ""just shy"" of $300bn, according to White House legislative affairs director Marc Short. The Washington Post put the figure,externalat half a trillion dollars. The bill contains $165bn of additional defence spending and $131bn in domestic spending, including funding for healthcare, infrastructure and tackling the US opioid crisis, reports Reuters news agency. The bipartisan agreement also keeps the government open until March 23, giving lawmakers more time to draft a full-year budget to fund federal agencies. The proposal would raise the US debt ceiling until March 2019. Despite the support of their Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who said the budget accord will ""break the long cycle of spending crises"", some Democrats have complained that the bill does not address immigration. The party's leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said on Thursday morning that she was opposed to the plan, but would not order rank-and-file Democrats to vote against it.

'Missed chances' to catch double killer,"Robert Trigg, 52, had been in relationships with both women when he killed them in their homes in Worthing, West Sussex The parents of a woman murdered by her boyfriend five years after he killed another partner say they are ""finally being taken seriously"". An inquiry found Sussex Police ""missed opportunities"" when investigating the deaths of Susan Nicholson, 52, in 2011 and Caroline Devlin, 35, in 2006. Robert Trigg, 52, was convicted last year of killing them both. The findings have now been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the force said. The full report by Thames Valley Police is not expected to be published until other independent inquiries have concluded. Triggwas in a relationship with both women when he killed them in their homes, which were barely two miles apart in Worthing, West Sussex. Both deaths were treated by Sussex Police as not suspicious at the time after Trigg claimed they had died in their sleep. In 2014 Ms Nicholson's parents hired a barrister and a forensic pathologist, Dr Nathaniel Carey, to re-examine the original pathologist's report. He concluded Ms Nicholson was suffocated by having her head forced into a bed. Trigg had claimed he had rolled on top of her while they pair were asleep on a sofa. In Ms Devlin's case, he found her death was was caused by a blow to the back of her head, and not an aneurism, as first recorded. During the trial the court heard both women had suffered domestic violence at the hands of Trigg during their relationships with him. Jurors were told there were similarities between the cases of Caroline Devlin (left) and Susan Nicholson Ms Nicholson's parents, Elizabeth and Peter Skelton, spent six years and more than Â£10,000 trying to convince the police to reopen their investigation into their daughter's killing. They claimed they had been ""ignored"" and ""failed"" by police and every public body tasked with holding the force to account. Mrs Skelton, 81, said: ""Finally, we feel like we are being taken seriously. ""The more you look back at it all, the more furious you feel about how it was handled."" This video can not be played Police ""ignored us"" say Ms Nicholson's parents Mr Skelton, 83, said: ""This confirms what we knew all along. They can't just say this was a mistake. ""We have been going on about this for six years. The evidence was pointing to this the whole time."" At least two police officers were involved in the investigations into both killings, but the similarities between the cases were not regarded as suspicious. In both cases police treated Trigg like a bereaved partner rather than a suspect. Sussex Police investigated its own officers three times but found nothing wrong with their handling of Ms Nicholson's murder. A spokesman for the force said: ""Thames Valley Police have completed an independent review of the investigations. The review refers to potential missed opportunities and we have therefore referred it to the IOPC. ""We are truly sorry it took so long to get justice, and it is important we learn any lessons and provide answers for the families."" The chairman of a separate inquiry, set up in October and led by the Safer West Sussex Partnership, will examine which services came into contact with Trigg and his victims and what they did to ""manage any risks identified"". A draft report is expected in the summer but is not likely to be published until the end of the year. Man who killed two girlfriends gets life Parents of murdered woman fought for justice.

Who were Islamic State 'Beatles'?,"Mohammed Emwazi, Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh (l to r) A man who was alleged to have been part of an Islamic State group known as the Beatles has been charged and remanded in custody in the UK. Aine Davis, from west London, had just returned from Turkey, where he had served seven and a half years for terrorism offences. He has been charged with offences related to funding terrorism. Members of the group, known as the Beatles because of their British accents, murdered hostages while fighting with the IS in Syria. Davis denied being a member of the group. The four members who are said to be part of the group all grew up in west London and volunteered to fight for the Islamic State group in Syria. They ended up guarding Western hostages. US authorities say the group beheaded 27 hostages. Videos of the murders were sent around the world, causing outrage. Hostages also recall the group torturing with electric shocks, waterboarding and mock executions. They were""thugs with no knowledge of what is religion at all"", Spanish journalist and former hostage Javier Espinosa told BBC News, in 2017. Three are still living - Aine Davis, Alexanda Kotey, El Shafee Elsheikh. Mohammed Emwazi, who was nicknamed Jihadi John, was killed in Syria, in 2015. Aine Davis Davis, who lived in Hammersmith, had a number of drug convictions and was jailed in 2006 for possessing a firearm. After converting to Islam, Davis changed his name to Hamza and met Emwazi. The two were part of a group that radicalised Muslims living in London. Davis left the UK to join IS in 2013. Davis was jailed for seven and a half years in Turkey Davis was arrested near Istanbul in 2015 and in 2017 he was convicted by a Turkish court of being a senior member of a terrorist organisation. At his trial in Turkey, Davis admitted knowing Mohammed Emwazi from praying in the same mosque in west London, but denied being his friend, or a member of the ""IS Beatles"" group. He served seven and a half years in prison. Arriving back in Britain at Luton Airport in August 2022, Davis was arrested by counter-terrorism officers from the Met Police and charged with offences including possession of a firearm for a purpose connected with terrorism, and charges related to funding terrorism. Alexanda Kotey Alexanda Kotey was sentenced in April 2022 to life imprisonment in the US, having pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges including lethal hostage-taking and conspiracy to support terrorists. He admitted involvement in the deaths of four Americans - journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. Sentencing him, thejudge described his actions as ""egregious, violent and inhumane"". Kotey was one of two men reportedly ""unmasked"" by media reports in 2016 These offences carry the death penalty - but US authorities have told Britain they will not execute Kotey, who is 38. Instead, he faces life imprisonment. He has been stripped of his British citizenship. Living in west London, Kotey - who is of Ghanaian and Greek Cypriot background - had attended the al-Manaar mosque with Mohammed Emwazi. He was captured in Syria by Kurdish forces, alongside El Shafee Elsheikh. Clockwise from top left: Aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig, and journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley The cell is also blamed for the deaths of British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and Japanese journalists Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto. El Shafee Elsheikh The son of Sudanese refugees who came to Britain, Elsheikh, went to Syria in 2012 and joined al-Qaeda before signing up with IS. Hostages called him Jihadi George and say as the main guard, he carried out most of the torture. Elsheikh was captured by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, in January 2018, as they overran the last pieces of IS-controlled territory in Syria. El Shafee Elsheikh is said to have earned a reputation for ""waterboarding, mock executions and crucifixions"" He wasfound guilty of lethal hostage taking and conspiracy to commit murder. He was stripped of his British citizenship in 2018. Mohammed Emwazi Emwazi, dubbed Jihadi John, fronted a number of videos showing executed hostages. Born in Kuwait, his family moved to the UK when he was six years old, in 1988. He studied computer programming at the University of Westminster, graduating in 2009. Emwazi, thought to be the group's ringleader, was killed after an intensive manhunt in 2015 Throughout 2014, Emwazi was shown, with his face disguised, in a number of videos where Western hostages appeared to be beheaded. A top target for intelligence services,he was killed in a joint US-British drone strike in Syria, in November 2015.

Gangster ditched drugs for jihad,"Aine Davis converted to Islam in a doomed attempt to put the chaos of his life behind him Convicted of being a senior member of the self-styled Islamic State group, Aine Davis is part of a worryingly familiar trend: the petty criminal who embraced violent jihad. On the streets of west London he sold drugs and carried a gun. And on the same streets he converted to Islam, in a doomed attempt to put the chaos of his life behind him. But in the twisted version of Islam he embraced he kept faith in the gun. Briton guilty of being senior IS member His early adult years in Hammersmith saw a string of drugs convictions. Then in 2006, Davis was jailed for possessing a firearm after a police operation smashed a gang that supplied hundreds of weapons to the criminal underworld. Around this time Davis became a Muslim, took the Islamic name Hamza, and travelled across the Middle East. But trouble was never far behind. According to his wife, Amal El-Wahabi, he could not escape the influence of friends from the drug scene. We know this because El-Wahabi testified in her own trial in 2014, when she was convicted of funding her husband's terrorism. She was jailed for 28 months after tricking a friend into trying to smuggle thousands of euros to Davis, who went to Turkey in 2013. She told the Old Bailey that she had ignored her parents' concerns about Davis, whom she met at a west London mosque. It was at the mosque that Davis encountered another person whose life would become defined by extremism. That man was Mohammed Emwazi, who gained global notoriety as ""Jihadi John"", the masked man who carried out a series of grotesque beheadings of Western hostages. Britons Alan Henning (left) and David Haines were among the hostages killed by the IS cell nicknamed ""The Beatles"" Davis and Emwazi were part of a group of radicalised Muslims living in the capital. From 2012 they seized the chance to fight jihad in the vortex of violence that was engulfing Syria and Iraq. Once there, Davis and Emwazi wound up as trusted members of so-called Islamic State. With two other friends from home, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, they were allegedly put in charge of guarding hostages, who dubbed them ""The Beatles"" because of their English accents. Davis denied being a member of the group, insisting in court that stories of his involvement were false. He said he was not the head of that unit, adding: ""I am not ISIS. I went to Syria because there was oppression in my country."" One of the hostages who survived has described how, in basement rooms in a large house in northern Aleppo, the group of friends from London inflicted appalling acts of violence on their captives, who included journalists and aid workers. Detained for about six months, Spanish journalist Javier Espinosa was put in an orange jumpsuit, called Prisoner 43 and held in conditions designed as IS's version of the controversial US detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. What followed was a vision of hell: mock executions, waterboarding, and widespread torture. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Espinosa likened ""The Beatles"" to ""a group of thugs with no knowledge of what is religion at all"". They used their faith ""to try to justify all type of common crimes that they were committing"". ""I mean if they were raping, they called it marriage. If they were stealing things they called it confiscation."" He said the guard they called George would often say: ""You don't know how I hate you,"" referring to people in the West. ""He really had this deep and profound hatred of the Western world,"" Mr Espionza said. Six of the 27 hostages held by ""The Beatles"" were killed by beheading, including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines, in an orgy of choreographed violence designed to shock the world. This video can not be played The group known as ""The Beatles"" beheaded IS hostages Mohammed Emwazi ""Jihadi John"" - whose real name was Mohammed Emwazi - regularly featured in IS propaganda Mohammed Emwazi, aka ""Jihadi John"", appeared in a number of IS videos in which hostages were beheaded. In November 2015, days after the arrest of Aine Davis, he was killed in a US drone strike. The then Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK and US had worked around the clock to track down the ""barbaric murderer [who] posed an ongoing and serious threat"". Alexanda Kotey The US State Department said Alexanda Kotey recruited several UK nationals to join IS Alexanda Kotey was identified as one of the kidnap gang by the US State Department, which claimed that ""Kotey likely engaged in the group's executions and exceptionally cruel torture methods, including electronic shock and waterboarding"". It also stated that he was an IS recruiter ""responsible for recruiting several UK nationals to join the terrorist organisation"". It is understood that the 33-year-old is still in Syria, in IS territory. El Shafee Elsheikh is said by the US State Department to have earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions"" El Shafee Elsheikh, the son of Sudanese refugees to the UK, went to Syria in 2012 - it is understood that he is still there, in IS territory. The US State Department said he ""earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions"". His father, Rashid Elsheikh, told the BBC he had seen no evidence that his son was one of ""The Beatles"". He added: "" I would like to repeat my condemnation of violence against any human being whatever the reason. ""My son and anybody else is responsible and accountable for his acts."" In November 2015, Aine Davis was being monitored as he slipped across the border from Syria to attend a meeting in Istanbul. Police followed him to a complex of luxury villas by the coast in the town of Silivri. He was arrested along with a group of other men, including three Britons. Deniz Solak, 33,  from east London, Jermaine Burke, 29, from High Wycombe and Mohammed Karwani, 40, from London all denied being members of Islamic State. Mr Solak was acquitted by the court in Silivri. The cases were recently dropped against Mr Karwani and Mr Burke and both will now be deported to the UK. Speaking to BBC News, Mr Karwani's father, Sayed Jan, said: ""There is no terrorism in my family."" He said his son ""good relationships with people. We are against Daesh [so-called Islamic State]."" He said his son went to work in Turkey as a teacher and added that he had another son who had been injured in a bomb explosion in Afghanistan while working as a translator for the US Army. No evidence was produced to show the four Britons had been planning a terror attack in Turkey, as was suggested in some press reports after their arrest. But the court heard Davis was a senior figure in the ranks of IS - and the judge agreed. He was found guilty of being a senior member of a terrorist organisation and jailed for seven-and-a-half years. The London street criminal turned international terrorist is back behind bars.

Hip fracture patients 'face rehab delays',"Hip fracture patients in England and Wales are waiting up to 80 days to get rehabilitation treatment after leaving hospital, according to a survey of nearly 6,000 patients. The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy said people face a ""postcode lottery"" over waits, with only one in five people being seen within a week. It said the delay was putting people at increased risk of ill health and falls. NHS England and NHS Wales both said they were working to improve care. But what should be happening and what do you do if you or a loved one are left waiting for treatment? Those who suffer the injury typically receive surgery and then days or weeks of rehab in hospital before being discharged. NHS guidelines state that after surgery, patients should be offered rehabilitation once a day But there are no guidelines for what happens after people leave hospital. The CSP, the professional body for physiotherapists, said their rehab should quickly resume at home in order to ensure the best chances of recovery. It said ideally there should be no break between rehab in hospital and home, but failing that the wait should be no more than a week. The CSP says there is a ""postcode lottery"" over treatment, with only one in five people resuming their rehab within a week of leaving hospital. It found there was an average wait of 15 days before receiving rehab at home. The amount of rehabilitation patients received also varied greatly, its report found, with some getting less than one hour per week. Ruth ten Hove, head of research and development at CSP, said the variation was a result of the different care plans set by individual clinical commissioning groups, which oversee rehabilitation care. The CSP is now calling for guidelines to be established so that care is more consistent across England and Wales. Hip fractures are usually caused by falls in elderly people who are frail, unfit and have at least one other long-standing condition, Ms ten Hove said. A third of the those who suffer the fractures also have dementia, she said. Without quick rehabilitation they are more likely to lose mobility and confidence and suffer illnesses related to being sedentary. ""They lose confidence very quickly. That puts them at risk of further falls, so they tend not to move around very much, which then puts them at risk of chest infections, deep vein thrombosis and a very high risk of depression. ""This is a population that really shouldn't be waiting for rehab."" Alice Price died from a chest infection after waiting four months for rehab Iona Price's mother, Alice, died from a chest infection, aged 88, after she fractured her hip in 2012. The condition is one of the risk factors faced by patients who do not receive continuous rehab after leaving hospital, the CSP said. She had to wait almost four months for rehabilitation at home, her daughter said. ""During that time, she had to move into a nursing home and was completely dependent on others for her every need which soon led to depression,"" she said. ""Complete loss of independence aside, I can't help but think she would have made a much healthier recovery had her access to treatment been timely."" The CSP says people should first complain to their GP, a local patient support network, or the physiotherapy services in their hospital to get rehab. Before rehab resumes, they should do exercises that focus on improving leg strength and balance, either with a friend or relative or on their own, depending on fitness levels. Exercises can be as simple as walking, getting up and down from a chair or bed, or walking up and down stairs. Furniture or other items at home that could potentially cause someone to trip up should be removed to reduce the risk of falls. People who are worried about a friend or family member should make contact with local health services, including the person's GP. NHS England said: ""Access to physiotherapy does vary across the country which is why NHS England is working with doctors to help them to provide better and more consistent care in all areas. ""This includes providing expert advice to local health bodies to reduce variation and improve care for patients."" The Welsh Government said: ""Whilst we do not recognise these figures, we recognise the importance of receiving rehab at home as soon as possible after leaving hospital and expect all patients to be seen in a timely manner.""

Mother wants seized IS duo to face trial,"This video can not be played Bethany Haines said the men should face justice for her father's murder The families of some of the victims of an Islamic State group that beheaded hostages have said two captured fighters should face trial. British fighters Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces. Bethany Haines - whose father David, a British aid worker, was beheaded by the cell - said she hoped theydie a ""slow, painful death"". Kotey and Elsheikh were two of four UK IS members known as ""the Beatles"". ""They should be locked up and throw away the key,"" Ms Haines said. Should there be a trial, she said she would attend and ""look them in the eye and let them know I am who I am and they have certainly destroyed a big part of my life. Hopefully there will be some justice."" Alexanda Kotey, left, and El Shafee Elsheikh were the last two members of the cell at large Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was beheaded by the cell - said she wanted the two men to face life imprisonment. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Their crimes are beyond imagination."" Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? The gangster who ditched drugs for jihad Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? Mrs Foley said that she would like the men to face trial in the US but she would be ""most grateful"" so long as ""they are brought to fair trial and detained and justice is served"". ""It doesn't bring James back, but hopefully it protects others from this kind of crime,"" she said. Kotey and Elsheikh were the last two of ""the Beatles"", so-called because of their British accents. Kotey, from west London, was a guard for the group that was described by US authorities as an execution cell. The US State Department says hetook part in the torture of hostages,externaland acted as a recruiter for IS. Elsheikh""earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions"",externalwhile serving as the cell's guard, the US state department says. Both are designated terrorists by the US, which says they have used ""exceptionally cruel torture methods"". They worked with the cell's alleged ring-leader, Mohammed Emwazi. Dubbed Jihadi John, he was the masked militant from west London who featured in gruesome IS videos, taunting Western powers before beheading hostages. Mr Foley was one of the victims whose death was seen in those videos. Others were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, US journalist Steven Sotloff, and American aid worker Peter Kassig. Mr Haines was working for a French aid agency when he was captured by Islamic State militants Emwazi waskilled in a drone strike in 2015 in Raqqa, the former de facto IS capital in Syria. Aine Davis, also from west London and the fourth member of the cell, was convicted of being a senior IS member.He was jailed in Turkey last year on terrorism chargesafter being arrested near Istanbul in 2015. The father of Aine Davis has told the BBC that his son had nothing to do with the cell. Nicolas Henin, a French journalist who spent 10 months as an IS captive, told Today that he wanted justice and not revenge. He stressed that any attempt to deny the men of their civil rights would only feed IS's claims of victimisation by the West. ""I will be extremely frustrated if they were not offered a fair trial and I don't think the local authorities in northern Syria or detention in Guantanamo Bay would be justice,"" he said. US officials said the ""execution cell"" had beheaded at least 27 hostages and tortured many more. They confirmed the latest arrests. Officials quoted by US media said the two men had been captured by members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who are targeting remnants of IS. A Kurdish official from the SDF has said Kotey was on his way to Turkey when he was captured. ""He was intending to escape towards Turkey with co-operation and co-ordination with friends of his on the Turkish side. He is now under investigation with us,"" Redur Xelil said. A Turkish security official called the claim ""nonsense"". By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The Home Office will not comment on individual cases but it is understood that the two men have been stripped of their British citizenship. In recent years, there has been an increased use of this power, largely in response to those travelling out to Syria and Iraq. The home secretary can deprive someone if that is considered conducive to the public good and doing so would not make them stateless. But there is also the power to remove it if a person obtained their citizenship fraudulently or through naturalisation and there are ""reasonable grounds"" to believe the person is able to become a national of another country. The home secretary has to personally decide to carry out a deprivation.

Last of IS 'Beatles' gang captured in Syria,"Alexanda Kotey, left, and El Shafee Elsheikh were the last two members of the cell at large Two British men believed to be members of a notorious Islamic State group cell have been seized by Syrian Kurdish fighters, US officials say. Alexanda Kotey, 34, and El Shafee Elsheikh, 29, were the last two members of the cell to remain at large. The four, all from London, were nicknamed ""the Beatles"" because of their British accents. US officials said the ""execution cell"" had beheaded at least 27 hostages and tortured many more. Families of the men's victims have called for the two seized men to go on trial.

The gangster who ditched drugs for jihad The latest arrests were confirmed by US officials. Officials quoted by US media said the two men had been captured by members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who are targeting remnants of IS. The UK Foreign Office, meanwhile, said it did not comment on individual cases or investigations. Their capture was first reported by the New York Times,,externalwho noted that American officials had wanted to keep the news secret. The aim was ""to allow analysts more time to pursue the intelligence leads developed from their detention and prepare raids against unsuspecting Islamic State targets"", the newspaper said. The Syrian fighters who apprehended them told US officials in mid-January that the two may have been captured, and the men's identities were later confirmed using fingerprints and other biometric data. The families of the men told the BBC they were not aware of the capture until the story was reported by news organisations. The Islamic State group's self-declared caliphate - its area of control - shrunk rapidly last year. In October, the group lost its ""capital"" of Raqqa to the SDF.In the beginning of November, it lost Deir-al Zour in Syriaon the same day as it lost al-Qaim in Iraq. The Islamic State group has been all but destroyed in Syria The SDF is an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters opposed to IS. The US-backed group has played a key role in driving IS from its strongholds in Syria. The US has said it aims to maintain an open-ended military presence in the country to ensure the jihadist group's defeat. However, the presence of large numbers of Kurdish armed forces in northern Syria has alarmed neighbouring Turkey. Gordon Corera, security correspondent The pair are said to have provided valuable intelligence following their capture. That may be helpful in answering the wider question of what happened to the foreign fighters as the so-called caliphate disintegrated. How many of the thousands of foreign fighters were killed and how many went to other countries or would seek to come home? These men will have been priority targets - but not the only ones. Their capture also raises the issue of what happens next. They could be put on trial in the US, since they were allegedly involved in the killing of US hostages - but there may be some in the Trump administration who would like to send them to Guantanamo Bay. And it is not clear if this is - formally - an issue for the UK Government, as there are reports the pair may have had their UK citizenship stripped from them using powers available to the Home Office.

UK shares slip amid market volatility,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 remained in correction territory on Friday despite closing higher after another bumpy ride. The Dow ended up 1.4% at 24,190 points, while the broader S&P was 1.5% higher at 2,619 points. Both have fallen 10% from the record highs hit on 26 January, indicating a ""correction"". Despite the positive finish, both indexes posted their worst weekly losses since January 2016. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4% to 6,874 points, giving the technology-focused index its worst week since February 2016. ""I don't think the market is focused on fundamentals at all - it's very volatile,"" said Anwiti Bahuguna at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Boston. In London, the FTSE 100 index ended the day down 1.1% at 7,092 points, bringing this week's declines to about 5%. How could the stock market fall affect you? Bank deputy governor urges calm on markets Kamal Ahmed: Will the fall turn into a rout? Other European markets also suffered on Friday, with Germany's Dax falling 1.4% and France's Cac 40 shedding 1.25%. On Thursday, the Dow Jones fell by more than 1,000 points for the second time this week, and Asian markets followed the downward trend, with Japan's Nikkei 225 shares index closing down 2.3%. The big sell-offs around the world this week have been pinned partly on concerns over the prospect of higher interest rates. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent told the BBC that markets might have underestimated the prospect of a pick-up in inflation. ""If you look at what happened last year, particularly in the United States but also other equity markets, there was extremely strong growth - big rises in prices - as people gradually realised how strong the global economy was,"" he said. ""If markets are responding understandably to that growth, it's possible they weren't pricing in the risk that that same growth would produce some inflation and some rises in interest rates, and I think what you're seeing now is the effect of that realisation."" This video can not be played An investor's guide to the ""fear index"" The global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected, because of the strength of the economy. That concern has prompted some investors to retreat from shares. On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for the view that rates in general are set to rise. The Bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting,but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying investors was agovernment budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation. Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity.

Asia markets drop sharply after US falls,"Major Asian markets suffered sharp losses on Friday, following another day of steep falls on Wall Street. In a volatile week for global investors, Japan's Nikkei 225 index slid 2.3%, while China's Shanghai Composite slumped by 4.1%. Earlier,the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 pointsfor the second time this week. Sell-offs around the world have been pinned partly on concerns over higher interest rates. Elsewhere in Asia on Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.1%, while South Korea's Kospi index traded down 1.8% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 eased 0.9%. Those losses came as little surprise, with moves in major US markets providing the cue for global investors. What has driven the Dow's surge? Why Asia markets follow Wall Street's lead On Thursday, the Dow Jones ended 4.2% lower at 23,860, the S&P 500 closed down 3.8%, while the Nasdaq sank 3.9%. European exchanges also headed south on Thursday. China was the worst performer in Asia on Friday as losses deepened from declines seen earlier this week. Chinese stock markets tend to be volatileand are dominated by retail investors, rather than big institutions like many other major markets. But falls in China can spark nervousness around the world over sentiment in the world's second largest economy. As well as the broader sell-off, analysts said stocks in China were weighed down by people selling ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This is a common trend as the need for cash grows during this period - a time when Chinese companies typically pay bonuses and people also traditionally exchange cash and gifts during the period. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected because of the strength of the economy. That concern has prompted the pull-back from stocks. On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for the view that rates are on the up. The Bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting,but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying investors was agovernment budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation. Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. At the same time, higher interest rates can make investment alternatives to stocks, such as bonds, more attractive. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. And more turbulence could be on the way. ""The return of volatility after two relatively calm days supports the idea there are further losses to come in the days and weeks ahead,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy. The chaotic week on global markets also comes asseveral markets around the world sit on, or near record highs. Analysts have said for months that financial markets were due a correction, after a long period of rising prices. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Fidelity International's chief investment officer for Japan, Takashi Maruyama, said the ""massive volatility"" was a reaction to the rapid rise on the Japanese market since last year. He added the sell-off presented a opportunity to buy shares at more ""reasonable"" prices.

"Anger over lollipop man's high-five banThe ""ridiculous"" ruling has annoyed parents and upset and confused pupils, says parent Dawn St Clare.2m3 minutes agoManchester","Colin Spencer, 83, said he has worked as a lollipop man for 14 years A lollipop man's ban from high-fiving school children in the road has prompted anger from parents. Colin Spencer, 83, said he has worked as a lollipop man for St George's Primary School in Heaviley, Stockport, Greater Manchester for 14 years. Stockport Council said it told him to stop the high-fives and ""concentrate on ensuring highway safety"". Dawn St Clare, whose children go to the school, said the ""ridiculous"" ruling has annoyed parents and upset pupils. Mrs Clare's children love Mr Spencer and high-fiving him cheers them up Mrs Clare said the council's school crossing patrol team sent a text to parents via the school on Tuesday asking them to tell their children not to high-five Mr Spencer on the road. A text the following day said children could high-five Mr Spencer but only on the pavement. Mrs Clare said all of the parents she has spoken to have been upset, too. ""Some of these children are on the autistic spectrum and are in a routine. ""Since the ban, crossing the road has become a little bit confusing to the children... and they've gone to school upset because Colin hasn't high-fived them and they can't understand why."" Mrs Clare added: ""I think it's ridiculous to ask the children not to do [it]; it really cheered them up in the morning."" Sainsbury's card 'a rip off for women' Snow-covered car hit by parking fine Crematorium alert over exploding coconut She said all of her five children love Mr Spencer and when they see him they shout ""lolly lolly lolly"". ""We explain to the children he's not allowed to high-five, but they keep trying."" Mr Spencer said some of the pupils have ended up in tears because he can no longer high-five them on the road. ""They sent a supervisor out to say I mustn't high-five because it's disrupting traffic. ""The younger children don't understand why - some of them have started crying."" A Stockport Council spokesperson said: ""School crossing patrols are required to continually observe the road and traffic conditions to ensure the safety.

Winter Olympics ban on Russians upheld,"Viktor Ahn (middle) won three gold medals at Sochi 2014 The Court of Arbitration for Sport has dismissed an appeal by 47 Russian athletes and coaches against a ban on participation in the Winter Olympics. The Russians had argued that they had been wrongfully excluded from the Games by the International Olympic Committee. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said the decision was understandable but disappointing. It comes amid a long-running row over Russian doping which has seen the country banned from the games. However 169 Russians will compete as independents. The CAS decision was made just hours before Friday's opening ceremony. Mr Mutko, a former sports minister who has himself been banned for life from the Olympics, said there would be a competition in Russia for the banned athletes instead. ""It is difficult for CAS to take a decision in the light of previous pressure. If they had allowed [the invitations] it would have been a shock,"" he said. The group contesting the decision included 28 athletes who had life bans from the Olympics lifted by the IOC last week, when CAS ruled there was insufficient evidence they had benefited from a system of state-sponsored doping. In the aftermath of that decision, the IOC decided not to extend an invitation to those with overturned bans - saying the decision ""had not lifted the suspicion of doping"". That led to a last-minute appeal for entry on Wednesday and Thursday. But in its decision to uphold the ban on entry to the Pyeongchang Games,the CAS panel did not find that the IOC process was ""discriminatory, arbitrary or unfair"",external. Winter Olympics: Day-by-day guide Will it be too cold for a Winter Olympics? Eight reasons you'll end up watching the Winter Olympics As a result, none of the affected athletes will compete in the 2018 Winter Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February in South Korea. The 169 sportspeople who have been invited to attend will compete under the banner of ""Olympic athletes from Russia"" and will fly the Olympic flag rather than the Russian one. If they win any medals, the Olympic anthem will be played. The ban on Russia was handed down after an investigation into state-sponsored doping during the 2014 Winter Olympics, which were held in Sochi in Russia.

Richard Desmond sells Express to Mirror,"Richard Desmond is chairman of Northern & Shell The owner of the Daily Mirror has agreed to buy the company behind titles including the Daily Express, the Daily Star and magazines such as OK! Trinity Mirror is to pay Â£126.7m for the publishing assets of Northern & Shell, which is chaired by Richard Desmond. Sale talks were announced in September, but a deal between the two has been on the cards for some time. The sale brings to an end Mr Desmond's 18 years as a UK newspaper owner. Northern & Shell's publishing assets include the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star and Daily Star Sunday, as well as three celebrity magazines, OK!, New! and Star. Simon Fox, chief executive of Trinity Mirror, said: ""Northern & Shell's titles have a large and loyal readership, a growing digital presence and a stable revenue mix and offer an excellent fit with Trinity Mirror."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, he said: ""It's a very wise investment. We've had plenty of time to think about this carefully."" He said the deal would lead to cost savings, as the titles could pool their resources. ""For example, [instead of] sending two reporters to a football game, we can send one."" Trinity Mirror expects the deal to lead to savings of Â£20m a year. Mr Fox pledged that the publications would retain their identities: ""The Daily Express is not going to become left-wing and the Mirror is not going to become right-wing."" Fifty years ago, the Daily  Mirror and the Daily Express were Britain's two biggest papers, selling more than eight million copies a day. Today, their combined sales are less than a million and continuing to fall. This isn't a solution to the decline of print, but a way to make the most of a declining asset until someone finds a way of making serious money from news in the internet age. The other question is, what will happen to the journalism? The Express's front-page formula of health, weather and migrants is carefully aimed at its loyal but shrinking band of older, conservative readers. It would be a brave owner who took it in a radical new direction. Its Euroscepticism in particular has a long history. The Express was one of the few papers to oppose joining the Common Market in the early 1970s, although it did eventually back ""yes"" in the 1975 referendum. As well as the Mirror titles, Trinity Mirror also owns a string of leading local papers and is the UK's biggest regional newspaper owner. It publishes the Daily Record, the Sunday People and more than 200 regional newspapers, including the Birmingham Post and the Manchester Evening News. The price being paid by Trinity Mirror is only slightly above the Â£125m paid by Mr Desmond for the Express titles in 2000. The newspaper industry faces many challenges, including the growing move to online readership and the dilemma between charging readers, who may then refuse to pay and get their news elsewhere for nothing, or giving away content and risk failing to cover costs through advertising. Mr Desmond's other interests include the Health Lottery, which he has run since 2011. It is not a national lottery, but a collection of 51 local society lotteries that raise funds for health-related good causes. He is reported to be contemplating whether to bid for the licence to run the official National Lottery.

Asia markets drop sharply after US fallsWall Street suffered its second day of heavy losses in a volatile week for global investors.2h2 hours agoBusiness,"Major Asian markets suffered sharp losses on Friday, following another day of steep falls on Wall Street. In a volatile week for global investors, Japan's Nikkei 225 index slid 2.3%, while China's Shanghai Composite slumped by 4.1%. Earlier,the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,000 pointsfor the second time this week. Sell-offs around the world have been pinned partly on concerns over higher interest rates. Elsewhere in Asia on Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.1%, while South Korea's Kospi index traded down 1.8% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 eased 0.9%. Those losses came as little surprise, with moves in major US markets providing the cue for global investors. What has driven the Dow's surge? Why Asia markets follow Wall Street's lead On Thursday, the Dow Jones ended 4.2% lower at 23,860, the S&P 500 closed down 3.8%, while the Nasdaq sank 3.9%. European exchanges also headed south on Thursday. China was the worst performer in Asia on Friday as losses deepened from declines seen earlier this week. Chinese stock markets tend to be volatileand are dominated by retail investors, rather than big institutions like many other major markets. But falls in China can spark nervousness around the world over sentiment in the world's second largest economy. As well as the broader sell-off, analysts said stocks in China were weighed down by people selling ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This is a common trend as the need for cash grows during this period - a time when Chinese companies typically pay bonuses and people also traditionally exchange cash and gifts during the period. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected because of the strength of the economy. That concern has prompted the pull-back from stocks. On Thursday, the Bank of England seemed to offer support for the view that rates are on the up. The Bank left interest rates at 0.5% at its meeting,but said a strengthening economy meant interest rates were likely to rise sooner than the markets were expecting. Also worrying investors was agovernment budget proposal announced by US lawmakers, which raises spending caps and could fan inflation. Bond yields in the US have also risen in recent weeks, typically a signal of higher rates. Higher interest rates push up borrowing costs for companies and individuals, which can hurt corporate profits and curb economic activity. At the same time, higher interest rates can make investment alternatives to stocks, such as bonds, more attractive. The uptick in volatility comes as investors react to the shifting conditions. And more turbulence could be on the way. ""The return of volatility after two relatively calm days supports the idea there are further losses to come in the days and weeks ahead,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy. The chaotic week on global markets also comes asseveral markets around the world sit on, or near record highs. Analysts have said for months that financial markets were due a correction, after a long period of rising prices. Thursday's declines mean the Dow and S&P 500 have now fallen by more than 10% from the record highs set in January, a threshold analysts call a correction. Fidelity International's chief investment officer for Japan, Takashi Maruyama, said the ""massive volatility"" was a reaction to the rapid rise on the Japanese market since last year. He added the sell-off presented a opportunity to buy shares at more ""reasonable"" prices.

Schools 'struggle for mental health help',"A survey of UK head teachers has found that nearly half are struggling to get mental health support for their pupils. A total of 45% of 655 of school leaders quizzed by children's mental health charity Place2Be said it was a problem. One mother, who did receive support from her local school after a friend suggested she should ask for help, told the BBC how a violent incident with her son at home was a tipping point. ""The final straw came when he tried to push me down the stairs,"" says Melanie. ""And he hit me in the back as well."" Melanie's nine-year-old son was finding it hard to control his anger and was lashing out physically and verbally at her and his father and sister. But while Melanie's family did manage to get help through the school for her son's issues, the Place2Be poll suggests many other families may be being let down. The survey - carried out to mark this week'sChildren's Mental Health Week,external- found 44% of head teachers said knowing what type of support was needed was a barrier to them providing mental health support for pupils. And 37% said they did not feel confident in commissioning a counsellor or therapist. The charity also surveyed 1,198 counsellors and psychotherapists currently working in schools and found 34% said providing services in schools was difficult. In December, the Department of Health and Department for Education published a jointplan to improve children and young people's access to mental health supportat schools and colleges in England. The pledge came as NHS figures showed around one in 10 girls aged 16 or 17 was referred to specialist mental health services in England in 2016. For Melanie, accessing specialist therapy for her son from a Place2Be therapist based at their primary school has turned the whole family around. Her son, who is now 11, is a lot calmer and has learnt how to process his emotions better. ""I've now got a job - without that support I don't think I'd have had the get up and go in the morning because it was such a fight to get my son to school. ""The help the school has given us has changed our whole family unit - without Place2Be I don't know where I'd be and I don't know where my son would be. ""To admit that we needed help was hard, but then to find the help was only round the corner at the school was brilliant. ""I think this support is extremely important. It was a relief to know the help was there."" Place2Be chief executive Catherine Roche said school leaders were under enough pressure and should not be expected to become mental health experts as well. ""Our evidence and experience shows that embedding skilled mental health professionals in schools, as part of a whole school approach, can have an enormously positive impact for pupils, families and staff. ""It's encouraging that the government's Green Paper proposals have recognised this, but to really transform children's mental health provision, we need all schools to have access to dedicated funding, support and training to be able to source, commission and evaluate services effectively."" Earlier this week, the Local Government Association said every secondary school in England should be given funding to offer independent mental health counselling to all pupils. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said  the government had pledged Â£1.7bn to help ""promote, protect and improve"" children and young people's mental health and wellbeing. ""We recognise the value that school-based counselling can provide. Our proposals outlined in thechildren and young people's mental health Green Paper,externalwill provide significant additional resources for early mental health intervention for all schools. ""This includes improving the links between the NHS and schools, speeding up access to more intensive support, as well as boosting capacity to ensure early intervention and help schools to decide what other support to provide.""

Congress 'spending US into oblivion',"This video can not be played US shutdown: Senator Paul condemns spending 'hypocrisy' The US government is poised for another shutdown after a senator held up a budgetary vote by accusing Congress of ""spending us into oblivion"". Hours before federal funding expires, the Senate was hoping to pass the mammoth two-year spending bill. But Kentucky Senator Rand Paul demanded a debate in the chamber on his amendment to kill the bipartisan deal. Last month failure to pass a bill led to a three-day government shutdown. The previous one in 2013 lasted 16 days. An hour before the deadline, the Senate voted for a recess until 00:01 local time on Friday (05:01 GMT) - essentially guaranteeing a shutdown. This latest budget measure has angered Republican fiscal hawks, while Democrats are upset about the lack of an immigration concession. Funding to keep the government open runs out at midnight when a one-month spending bill expires. The White House said it was preparing federal agencies for a shutdown. The legislation faces an even tougher test in the House of Representatives, though Republican Speaker Paul Ryan said he believes they can muscle it through. Hopes for a quick vote in the upper chamber on Thursday evening dimmed as Senator Paul stood up. While the spending bill's funding for the Pentagon has delighted the national security wing of the party, fiscal conservatives are up in arms about ramifications for the nation's debt. In a doom-laden speech, the Kentucky politician angrily charged his fellow Republicans with fiscal profligacy. ""I ran for office because I was very critical of President Obama's trillion-dollar deficits,"" he said. This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown ""Now we have Republicans, hand in hand with Democrats, offering us trillion-dollar deficits. ""I can't in all good honesty, in all good faith, just look the other way just because my party is now complicit in the deficits."" This would be ""the very definition of hypocrisy"", he added. As Senator Paul pointed out, the 650-page spending plan was only unveiled on Wednesday night, so the finer details are unclear. White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said the package would increase spending by ""just shy"" of $300bn (Â£216bn). The Washington Post puts the figure,externalat half a trillion dollars. The bill contains $165bn of additional defence spending and $131bn in domestic spending, including funding for healthcare, infrastructure and tackling the US opioid crisis, reports Reuters news agency. The proposal would raise the US debt ceiling until March 2019. Despite the imprimatur of their Senate leader Chuck Schumer, who says the budget accord will ""break the long cycle of spending crises"", some Democrats have complained that the bill does not address immigration. The party's leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said on Thursday morning she was opposed to the plan, but would not order rank-and-file Democrats to vote against it. The California congresswoman has called for the bill to include a provision shielding so-called Dreamers, young immigrants who entered the US illegally as children, from deportation. This video can not be played Top Democratic Nancy Pelosi breaks record in eight-hour speech Her remarks came a day after shetold the stories of immigrants for eight hourson the floor of the lower chamber in a record-breaking speech. Obama-era guarantees for those immigrants were cancelled by US President Donald Trump and are set to become invalid next month. Illinois representative Luis Gutierrez, one of the leading congressional advocates for immigrants, is urging colleagues to vote against the plan. ""Don't collude with this administration,"" he said. Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to the president, told Fox News the deal offers long-term budget certainty and funding for his priorities including infrastructure and military funding. This video can not be played Trump: 'I'd love to see' a shutdown Earlier this week,Mr Trump said he would ""love to see"" the US government shutdownif there was no deal on funding for his proposed US-Mexico border wall. Deficits are already projected to climb because of the Trump administration's $1.5tn tax cuts, which were approved by Congress in December. Allow Twitter content?

"Protest over 'gay cure' film cancellationThe Vue cinema says the event contradicted its values, but protesters accuse it of censorship.6h6 hours agoUK","Dozens of protesters have gathered outside a London cinema to protest against the cancellation of a screening of a film advocating therapy to ""cure"" people from being gay. Christian group Core Issues Trust hired a screen at Vue Piccadilly, in the West End, to show its film - the Voices of the Silenced. But the cinema cancelled the event at the last minute, saying it contradicted the company's values. Protesters accused Vue of censorship. According to the film's makers, the documentary tells the stories of 15 people ""emerging out of homosexual lifestyles"" and aims to ""preserve and promote teachings on sexual ethics"". I was sent for 'gay cure' Push to ban 'gay conversion therapy' 'Gay cure' group's advert banned 'Pray the gay away' Michael Davidson, who leads Core Issues Trust, said the film was ""very niche"" and reflected ""our community"", which he says is a small but growing international group. The cancellation was regrettable and showed no regard for this section of the population, he added. He said the film did not disrespect the LGBT community. Rather, it raised issues from a different point of view. Michael Davidson, pictured right, says the cancellation was regrettable and showed no regard for this section of the population Andrea Williams, chief executive ofChristian Concern,external, an organisation which wants to see the UK ""return to the Christian faith"", said the Vue's decision to cancel had been ""tragic and disproportionate"". ""This is a freedom issue,"" she told the BBC. ""This film is the stories of lives that are transformed, marriages saved, fathers who stay fathers. ""There is nothing wrong with saying I don't want to do that any more. I want to access therapy to help me live in a different way,"" she said. The protest was, she added, about showing people: ""We are not going away."" The film was screened instead at an alternative venue, at a nearby conference centre in Westminster. In a statement, Vue said it was not ""our intention to censor content"". ""In some instances, where we feel that an activity and its associated campaign and content are in direct contradiction with Vue's values, we make the decision to refrain from allowing that activity to take place in our cinemas,"" it added. It said management had been made aware the private screening request would be promoting and campaigning for a medical ""cure"" to homosexuality. ""After careful consideration of the facts, a decision was made to cancel the event,"" it added. The decision, made on Tuesday, was reached independently of any external influence, including media, social media or petitions, it said. It went on to say that the Vue would ""always consider, and be sensitive to, our customers when we are asked to promote or indirectly endorse, or act as host for, one particular cause, campaign or belief"". The Core Issues Trust promotes ""change-oriented processes"" for ""relationally and sexually damaged and wounded adults who seek wholeness"". It describes itself on its website as ""a spiritual home... for believers and seekers who struggle with issues of sexual brokenness, including homosexuality"". Members of the LGBT community have said the organisation's teachings are ""unethical"". A spokesperson for campaign group Stonewall said: ""LGBT people aren't ill. Being gay, lesbian, bi or trans is not something that should be 'cured' or changed. ""This unethical and degrading practice has been condemned by all major UK health organisations.

'Missed chances' to catch double killerSussex Police's handling of the investigation into Robert Trigg is referred to a watchdog.2h2 hours agoSussex,"Robert Trigg, 52, had been in relationships with both women when he killed them in their homes in Worthing, West Sussex The parents of a woman murdered by her boyfriend five years after he killed another partner say they are ""finally being taken seriously"". An inquiry found Sussex Police ""missed opportunities"" when investigating the deaths of Susan Nicholson, 52, in 2011 and Caroline Devlin, 35, in 2006. Robert Trigg, 52, was convicted last year of killing them both. The findings have now been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the force said. The full report by Thames Valley Police is not expected to be published until other independent inquiries have concluded. Triggwas in a relationship with both women when he killed them in their homes, which were barely two miles apart in Worthing, West Sussex. Both deaths were treated by Sussex Police as not suspicious at the time after Trigg claimed they had died in their sleep. In 2014 Ms Nicholson's parents hired a barrister and a forensic pathologist, Dr Nathaniel Carey, to re-examine the original pathologist's report. He concluded Ms Nicholson was suffocated by having her head forced into a bed. Trigg had claimed he had rolled on top of her while they pair were asleep on a sofa. In Ms Devlin's case, he found her death was was caused by a blow to the back of her head, and not an aneurism, as first recorded. During the trial the court heard both women had suffered domestic violence at the hands of Trigg during their relationships with him. Jurors were told there were similarities between the cases of Caroline Devlin (left) and Susan Nicholson Ms Nicholson's parents, Elizabeth and Peter Skelton, spent six years and more than Â£10,000 trying to convince the police to reopen their investigation into their daughter's killing. They claimed they had been ""ignored"" and ""failed"" by police and every public body tasked with holding the force to account. Mrs Skelton, 81, said: ""Finally, we feel like we are being taken seriously. ""The more you look back at it all, the more furious you feel about how it was handled."" This video can not be played Police ""ignored us"" say Ms Nicholson's parents Mr Skelton, 83, said: ""This confirms what we knew all along. They can't just say this was a mistake. ""We have been going on about this for six years. The evidence was pointing to this the whole time."" At least two police officers were involved in the investigations into both killings, but the similarities between the cases were not regarded as suspicious. In both cases police treated Trigg like a bereaved partner rather than a suspect. Sussex Police investigated its own officers three times but found nothing wrong with their handling of Ms Nicholson's murder. A spokesman for the force said: ""Thames Valley Police have completed an independent review of the investigations. The review refers to potential missed opportunities and we have therefore referred it to the IOPC. ""We are truly sorry it took so long to get justice, and it is important we learn any lessons and provide answers for the families."" The chairman of a separate inquiry, set up in October and led by the Safer West Sussex Partnership, will examine which services came into contact with Trigg and his victims and what they did to ""manage any risks identified"". A draft report is expected in the summer but is not likely to be published until the end of the year. Man who killed two girlfriends gets life Parents of murdered woman fought for justice.

"UK will not block Bermuda gay marriage repealIt is 'not be appropriate' to intervene in Bermuda's decision, a foreign office minister said9h9 hours agoUK","Same-sex marriages on Bermuda-registered cruise lines like Cunard and P&O Cruises will be outlawed The UK government has said it would not be ""appropriate"" to block Bermuda's decision to repeal same-sex marriage. On Wednesday the British overseas territory became the first country in the world to pass, and then revoke, the law, replacing gay marriage with domestic partnerships. The decision also means cruise ships registered in Bermuda are likely to be banned from hosting same-sex weddings. Theresa May said the UK's dealings with Bermuda should be based on ""respect"". But critics say the law reversal will make the UK an international ""laughing stock"". The Atlantic island, which is home to 60,000 people, legalised marriage between homosexual couples in May 2017, following a Supreme Court ruling. Gay marriage: First couples wed in Australia NI Secretary Karen Bradley rejects same-sex marriage call California judge sides with baker in 'gay cake' row But thenew Domestic Partnership Act,external, approved by Bermuda Governor John Rankin on Wednesday, rolls back the legalisation. Instead of marriage, the act allows gay or straight couples to form a partnership, which the Bermuda government says carries equivalent rights. According to Bermuda's minister of home affairs, Walton Brown, the majority of Bermudians do not agree with gay couples marrying. He said: ""The act is intended to strike a fair balance between two currently irreconcilable groups in Bermuda, by restating that marriage must be between a male and a female while at the same time recognising and protecting the rights of same-sex couples."" Because of Bermuda's status as an overseas dependent territory, the UK government had the power to block the law change. But Foreign Office minister Harriett Baldwin told MPs: ""After full and careful consideration in regards to Bermuda's constitutional and international obligations, the Secretary decided that in these circumstances it would not be appropriate to use this power to block legislation, which can only can be used where there is a legal or constitutional basis for doing so, and even then only in exceptional circumstances."" Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""seriously disappointed"" about the decision to abolish same-sex marriage. But she added: ""That bill has been democratically passed by the Parliament of Bermuda, and our relationship with the overseas territories is based on partnership and respect for their right to democratic self-government."" MPs on all sides criticised the decision and called it a backward step. Labour MP Chris Bryant said the law reversal will make Britain a ""laughing stock in the international human rights field"".

Raising the issue in the Commons as an urgent question, Mr Bryant added: ""Same-sex Bermudian couples who have been married under the ruling of the Bermudian Supreme Court have now been rendered an anomaly. ""Gay and lesbian Bermudians have been told that they aren't quite equal to everyone else."" The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said: ""The problem, as many MPs pointed out, is that Britain may now find it harder to promote LGBT rights around the world when it has failed to do so in one of its own overseas territories."" The cruise companies Cunard and P&O Cruises, both of which register their ships in Bermuda, said they were ""very unhappy"" about the change in legislation, which will outlaw same-sex marriage ceremonies on their liners. ""We do not underestimate the disappointment this will cause those guests who have planned their weddings,"" the companies said in an identically-worded statement. Instead, the firms will offering same-sex couples on-board alternative ""commitment"" ceremonies.

Government targets unpaid internshipsHMRC has written to more than 500 firms recently reminding them that must be paid the minimum wage.,"The government has ramped up efforts to ""stamp out illegal unpaid internships"". HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has written to more than 500 firms over the last three months reminding them that interns classed as workers must be paid the minimum wage. The government also says it will ask HMRC to focus minimum wage enforcement work on firms using unpaid interns. The details were contained in the government'sresponse to a review of working practices,external. TheTaylor Review,externalinto working practices, published last year, concentrated particularly on the so-called gig economy of part time and flexible workers. However, it also highlighted the issue of unpaid internships. It said the government should ensure that ""exploitative unpaid internships which damage social mobility in the UK, are stamped out"". Gig workers promised rights crackdown Unpaid internships 'lock some out of careers' 'All work in UK economy should be fair' In its response released earlier this week, the government said it accepted the recommendations of the review. ""Exploitative unpaid internships should not exist and we will work to eradicate these. ""We will take action to improve the interpretation of the law and the enforcement action taken by HMRC in this area to help stamp out illegal unpaid internships,"" it added. According to the law, interns who are classed as workers must be paid at least the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage. A worker might be someone who has a contract or is subject to sanctions if they do not turn up for work. Genuine volunteers on the other hand are not entitled to the minimum wage. The government said HMRC already contacted employers who had advertised for unpaid internships to ""ensure they are aware and compliant with the law"". However, a fresh crackdown took place in the last three months. It also said it would ""formally ask"" HMRC to focus activity in the coming year on firms which use unpaid interns, ""through intelligence-led enforcement"". ""If this approach does not work, the government will review the existing policy and legal framework and will consider what other action can be taken"", it added. Last month the Sutton Trust charity estimated that 40% of 70,000 internships undertaken annually were unpaid - but said young workers need a minimum of Â£1,019 per month to live in London and Â£827 in Manchester. It backed cross-party calls to ban unpaid internships over a month long.

"Cambodian tourists bailed over fake orgyFour British nationals are among seven bailed from Cambodian jail over ""sex act"" photographs.5h5 hours agoAsia","Cambodian police released a group shot of the 10 arrested foreigners in January A court in Cambodia has granted bail to seven of the 10 foreign tourists who were charged last month with producing pornographic images. The group were arrested in January after photographs emerged of people imitating sex acts at a party in a villa in north-west Siem Reap province. If convicted, they could face up to a year in a Cambodian prison. Three of the alleged party organisers - from Britain, the Netherlands and Norway, remain in custody. A total of 87 foreigners were arrested on Jan 25 in a raid on a ""Let's get wet"" pub crawl event, after being accused by police of ""singing and dancing pornographically"". Police say most were released after being ""educated"" over their unacceptable behaviour. But ten members - five Britons, two Canadians, a Norwegian, a New Zealander and a Dutch national, were charged and detained in custody. Images allegedly from the pub crawl event showed several clothed couples on the floor of the villa, appearing to act out sexual positions. The Angkor Wat temple is a world heritage site, drawing tourists to Siem Reap province The British Foreign Office confirmed on Thursday that four British nationals were among those released on bail. They said staff continued to assist the nationals and remain in contact with the Cambodian authorities. A spokesman for the Siem Reap provincial court said those released on bail could not leave the country as they their passports had been confiscated. Siem Reap is popular with tourists because it is close to the famous ancient ruins of Angkor Wat, Cambodia's biggest tourist site. A police handout picture of people appearing to imitate sex acts at a party The country's nightlife scene has rapidly grown over the past few years as it has become more popular among backpackers and budget travellers. This has sometimes placed tourists at odds with Cambodia's socially conservative Buddhist culture. In 2016 the country announced a ban on tourists wearing ""revealing clothes"" from visiting the ancient temple park, after a number of foreign tourists were arrested and deported for taking nude photographs at the site.
