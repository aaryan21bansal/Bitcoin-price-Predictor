First female director of CIA confirmed,"Haspel oversaw a secret US facility where terror suspects were tortured The US Senate has approved the CIA's first female director, despite her role in the spy agency's post-9/11 interrogation programme. Gina Haspel's confirmation in a 54-45 vote follows a partisan fight among senators about the CIA's Bush-era use of techniques such as waterboarding. Ms Haspel, a CIA veteran, once oversaw a so-called black site in Thailand after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The former CIA chief, Mike Pompeo, left to become US Secretary of State. Republican Senator John McCain - who was tortured during his more than five years in a Vietnamese prison - had earlier announced his opposition to US President Donald Trump's nominee.

On Thursday, six Democrats crossed party lines to vote in her favour. One of them, Virginia Senator Mark Warner, said Ms Haspel had told him the agency should never have resorted to so-called enhanced interrogation techniques. He said she had pledged never to use such methods even if the president demanded it. ""I believe she is someone who can and will stand up to the president, who will speak truth to power if this president orders her to do something illegal or immoral, like a return to torture,"" he said in a speech before the vote. This video can not be played Donald Trump tells ABC News that ""waterboarding works"" Two Republicans - Jeff Flake and Rand Paul - voted against Ms Haspel, meaning she would not have been confirmed without support from Democrats. Speaking before the vote, Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Richard Burr said the confirmation of a woman as CIA head would send an important message. ""Many others who have served, or are currently serving, have cracked the glass ceiling at the agency. Gina is poised to break it,"" he said. ""It may be impossible to measure the importance of that breakthrough but I do know that it will send a signal to the current workforce and to the workforce of the future that a lifetime of commitment to the agency can and will be rewarded."" A 33-year veteran of the agency, Ms Haspel, 61, spent most of her career as an undercover operative. This video can not be played The BBC's Panorama programme witnesses the first accurate public demonstration of waterboarding In 2002, she was selected by the agency to run a ""black site"" in Thailand where harsh interrogation techniques were used that a Senate report deemed to be torture. One suspect that was brought there, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, was brutalised using methods that were later banned by President Barack Obama. Al-Nashiri, who was interrogated after Ms Haspel took over the post, was also subjected to sleep deprivation, nudity, extreme temperatures, being held in a small box, and ""walling"" (being slammed repeatedly into a wall). Three years later, Ms Haspel ordered the destruction of 92 video tapes that documented the interrogation of him, and Abu Zubaydah, who was also held at the Thai location. At least 119 men were tortured by the US in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, according to a 2014 Senate report. Human rights groups say Ms Haspel left Thailand to oversee further US torture, but it is unclear what role she played as her exact record has been classified by the CIA. Mr Trump has previously called for the US to resume waterboarding terrorism suspects.

School delay 'does not help summer-born',"Delaying a summer-born child's entry to primary school has little impact on attainment, research suggests. Children born in England between April and August, whose start in Reception was put back a year, did only marginally better in Year 1 tests, according to a government study. The number of applications to councils for delayed entry has risen sharply. Head teachers' unions want clearer guidance on whether delayed school entry for summer-born children works. Department for Education researchers looked at results achieved in the Phonics Screening Check, taken by pupils at the end of Year 1. Pupils whose school start was delayed a year in 2014 and 2015 scored on average 0.7 marks higher than other summer-born children. The researchers say the difference is not statistically significant. Pupils who were not summer-born outperformed both the delayed and normal admission summer-born pupils. Times table check trialled ahead of roll-out Summer-born pupils' late start wins MPs' backing The analysis also found parents with higher incomes were significantly more likely to request a delayed school start for their child. It also found the majority of applications, 74%, were from white British families. Children in England usually start school in the September after they turn four but parents of children born between 1 April and 31 August can request to delay entry for a year. Typically, this would mean a child starting school in Year 1, forfeiting Reception year. If a parent wishes to delay their child's admission to school until compulsory school age, at five, and be admitted into Reception, a request needs to be made to their local authority, for their child to be admitted out of their normal age group. Councils are required to make a decision in the child's best interests, taking account of parents' views and information about the child's development. Pauline Hull, of the Summer Born Campaign which has called for more flexible admissions, welcomed the report but said ""the most important comparison is how much better these children are faring having started school at age five, rather than age four, and the DfE research does not address this. ""The focus on phonics testing doesn't consider social and emotional benefits of delayed entry which is of significant importance to parents."" Anne Frank's 'dirty jokes' uncovered Row over World Cup 'flirting manual' How long are you going to live? The Department for Education surveyed 152 local authorities in England about their admissions policy. Of the 92 who responded, 1,750 requests were made to delay school entry in 2016-17, up 84% on the previous year. Overall, 75% of requests were granted. Ten of the local authorities said they had a policy of automatically agreeing all requests made to delay entry while 23 said they only agreed requests where parents presented strong evidence. The majority said they still expected parents to make a case as to why their child should start Reception late. Some councils said they were concerned that parents would delay entry for their child because it might benefit them in other ways, rather than because there was a genuine need. ""When a parent does not get a place at their preferred school they will delay their child's entry simply to get another chance to get a place at a particular school,"" said one. In a separate survey of parents from Liverpool, Hertfordshire, Devon, and Lewisham, who had all delayed their child's entry into Reception, 79% had a household income of Â£25,000 or more. Almost half earned more than Â£50,000 annually. 97% feared their child was not ready for school 38% cited a medical condition or developmental delay 13% said a lack of places in their preferred school was a factor Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""It's about taking a sensible and human approach based on the individual needs of the child in question. ""The flexibility required in order to accommodate the needs of some children born between April and August each year can cause some organisational and financial issues for schools but they are not insurmountable and more guidance from the government has certainly helped."" Julie McCulloch, Director of Policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, called for ""a consistent approach across the country"" and urged the DfE to ""review this matter to develop a policy based on emerging evidence over the impact of delayed entry to school and what works best for children"". A DfE spokeswoman said ""the phonics check measures a specific skill and doesn't tell us anything about a child's development more widely"". ""We know the Reception year is an important part of school life and we want to make sure no child misses that year of their education because they have summer birthdays.""

Universities axe foreign students survey,"In 2016-17, a total of 19% of students in higher education in the UK were from outside the country, according to official figures A Home Office advisory committee has ditched research assessing the impact of international students after academics labelled it ""unethical"". The survey, set up by the Migration Advisory Committee (Mac), which informs Home Office policy, asked for students' views on international classmates. But it could be completed by anyone and some said it posed ""loaded"" questions. A Mac spokesman stressed the survey was ""not designed to be discriminatory"", but confirmed it was being withdrawn. ""Following online commentary it has become apparent to us that we will be unable to use the responses to the survey,"" the spokesman said. The committee defended the survey, saying it was ""simply an attempt to ask students for their experiences"" and ""had the potential to show a very positive view of international students in the UK"". However, on Thursday, it concluded the survey ""cannot now be used to add to our evidence base"". Prof Tanja Bueltmannâ, a professor of migration history at Northumbria University, said the survey was ""completely invalid and must never be used as evidence to inform policy"". She said she had urged the Home Office and the committee to scrap it or disregard it. ""Initially, I thought it must be some sort of fake thing - because of the nature of the questions,"" she said. It asked students to assess whether the impact of international students on their course was negative, positive or neutral. It also asked if students lived with any international students or studied with any on their course. The survey was being posted by universities, who were encouraging students to fill it in and was due to close at the end of May. It was also being shared on Twitter, by vice-chancellors from the Universities UK group, which later announced that it would no longer be sharing it. Allow Twitter content?

A Universities UK spokesman said: ""Due to legitimate concerns raised about a Migration Advisory Committee survey on international students, we will not be sharing it further. ""While it's important that policy-makers hear from students about international students' positive impact, views must be sought appropriately."" UUK vice-chancellors will also be deleting all tweets of the survey. Prof Bueltmann said: ""In principle there's nothing wrong with a survey on the impact of international students, but say you look Asian and you're actually British, but the student standing next to you thinks you're Asian?"" This could mean the person is basing their views on the wrong information, she suggested. An online message replaced the survey after it had been closed Her view was mirrored by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which questioned whether the survey was ""encouraging baseless speculation about those who seem different?"". The National Union of Students called the survey ""inherently flawed"". The Union's international students' officer, Yinbo Yu, said asking students to gauge international student numbers ""seemingly based on appearance"" was ""not only shockingly insensitive, but it does not reflect the reality of our diverse yet cohesive university communities"". Prof Bueltmannâ also suggested that those who had a view that immigration was a bad thing would have been more likely to fill it in. ""It's a bit like with Tripadvisor, you're more likely to fill it in if you've had a bad experience,"" she said. ""The survey unquestionably contains loaded/leading questions that force respondents to problematise international students in a way that they may never have naturally done. ""If I had done this as a research project, I'd be in trouble with my ethics committee now."" She added that the whole design of the survey was flawed because anyone could fill it in, and repeatedly if they used different computers. Posting on Twitter, Matthias Eberl, engagement lead at Cardiff University's Systems Immunity Research Institute, said: ""A student survey that's openly accessible to anyone and can be filled in multiple times. Whatever the results from this survey, they are utterly meaningless."" A lawyer, Ewan Kennedyâ, also completed the survey, saying he found it ""very odd"". He said he ""went through it as an experiment and it shot off at the end without needing any identifier - oops!"" The survey was part of work commissioned by former Home Secretary Amber Rudd, after the government came under pressure to remove international students from net migration targets. In her commissioning letter of August 2017, she said the committee had never undertaken a full assessment of the impact of international students. ""We would like to have an objective assessment of the impact of international students which includes consideration of both EU and non-EU students at all levels of education,"" the letter said. ""This assessment should go beyond the direct impact of students in the form of tuition fees and spending, including consideration of their impact on the labour market and the provision and quality of education provided to domestic students. ""This should give the government an improved evidence base for any future decisions whilst the ONS goes through the process of reviewing the contribution it thinks students are making to net migration."" Before the survey was decommissioned, a spokesman for the Mac had said it was part of its ongoing work looking at the impact of international students in the UK.

Explosive eruption at Hawaii volcano,"This video can not be played Hawaii volcano sends 30,000ft plume into the air An explosive eruption at Hawaiiâs Kilauea volcano has sent ash 30,000ft (9,100m) into the sky. The eruption took place at 04:15 local time (14:15 GMT) on Thursday, and scientists say further activity is likely in the near future. Staff at the volcano observatory and the national park had been evacuated. Since a new zone of Kilauea began erupting almost two weeks ago, lava has wrecked dozens of homes and forced hundreds of people to be evacuated. National Guard soldiers in Hawaii sought protection from ash and volcanic gases A red aviation code had already been issued, warning pilots to avoid the potentially damaging ash cloud. How volcanoes work The US Geological Survey had warned that an explosive eruption at Kilauea was becoming more likely as the volcano's lava lake was lowering. This increases the risk of steam-powered explosions as the magma meets underground water. ""We may have additional larger, powerful events,"" USGS geologist Michelle Coombs told reporters after Thursday's eruption. Hawaii's emergency management agency advised people in the area affected by ash to stay in their homes if possible. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Kilauea is one of five volcanoes on the island of Hawaii - three of them active. It is one of the most active in the world and has been erupting continuously, though not explosively, for more than 30 years. Its last explosive eruption took place in 1924. Even before Thursday morning's explosive eruption, the ash plume from the volcano could be seen from the International Space Station. Allow Twitter content?

But Prince Harry's newest nephew, Prince Louis, who will be three weeks old at the time, will not be there. Who is Meghan Markle? Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are not on the guest listafter it was decided there would not be an ""official list of political leaders"". Kensington Palace said that decision, which means US President Donald Trump will not attend, was taken in consultation with the government and reflects the fact Prince Harry is only sixth in line to the throne. It has also been confirmed that Barack and Michelle Obama, who are friends of the prince, have not received an invitation. More than1,000 members of the public have been invitedto the grounds of Windsor Castle and will be able to watch the arrival and departure of the bride and groom. Twelve-year-old Amelia Thompson, who was injured in the Manchester Arena attack, is among them. Cliveden House, where Ms Markle will stay on the eve of the wedding, was linked to a 1960s political scandal Ms Markle, 36, spent the last night before the wedding with her mother, Doria Ragland,at the luxury Cliveden House Hotel,in Buckinghamshire, about nine miles north of Windsor Castle. Prince Harry, 33, stayed 15 miles away at the Dorchester Collection's Coworth Park in Ascot, with his brother, the Duke of Cambridge. Prince Harry will stay with his brother, Prince William, at Coworth Park in Ascot Ms Markle will arrive at the chapel by car with her mother. The princes will also travel together. The couple will travel through Windsor in this Ascot Landau carriage which is used in official and ceremonial state events The dress code listed on the royal invitation requests a ""morning suit or lounge suit"" for men, and a ""day dress with hat"" for women. That means shirts, suits and ties with the possibility of top hats and waistcoats for men. Women will be expected to opt for knee-length dresses, with hat choices similar to those found at Royal Ascot. The details of Ms Markle's wedding dress remain a secret. Which celebs might be at the royal wedding? Are you the ultimate Royal Wedding fan? Meghan: 'I'm proud of where I come from' All of Ms Markle's bridesmaids and pageboys will be children. Princess Charlotte will be among six bridesmaidsand her brother Prince George will be one of four page boys. Other bridesmaids include Prince Harry's goddaughters, Zalie Warren and Florence van Cutsem, Ms Markle's goddaughters, sisters Remi and Rylan Litt, and Ivy Mulroney. The other pageboys are Harry's godson, Jasper Dyer and twin brothers Brian and John Mulroney. Ms Markle will not have a maid of honour,Kensington Palace has said. The palace's communications secretary, Jason Knauf, said Ms Markle ""has a very close-knit group of friends and she did not want to choose one over the other"". ""They're all going to be there in Windsor with her, in the days before in London,"" he added. ""She's very pleased to have their support on the day."" Prince William will return the favour after Prince Harry was best man at his wedding in 2011 As expected, Prince Harryhas asked his brother, Prince William, to be his best man. Prince Harry was the Duke of Cambridge's best man at his wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011. Kensington Palace said Prince William was ""honoured to have been asked"" and was looking forward to supporting his brother. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will marry the prince and Ms Markle. The Rt Rev David Conner, Dean of Windsor, will conduct the service at St George's Chapel. Meanwhile, an American pastor will give the address - the Most Reverend Michael Curry is the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, a US branch of the Church of England. Following the service, a carriage procession will travel along a route including Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road, Long Walk and back to Windsor Castle. The couple have chosen a selection of choirs, soloists and musicians to perform at their wedding. They include the Choir of St George's Chapel, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason - who won the 2016 BBC's Young Musician, and gospel group Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir. An orchestra - fronted by Welsh soprano Elin Manahan Thomas - will also perform. She will be accompanied by trumpet player David Blackadder, organ player Luke Bond and state trumpeters from the Band of the Household Cavalry. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement photos were shot by Alexi Lubomirski at Frogmore House All 600 guests will attend a lunchtime reception at St George's Hall, which is being given by Her Majesty The Queen. Ms Markle is reportedly planning to break with the tradition for royal bridesby making a speech. Later in the evening, the newlyweds will celebrate with 200 guests at a private reception less than a mile from Windsor Castle at Frogmore House, hosted by Prince Charles. The 17th Century country house and gardens - a former home to numerous royals throughout history - was the back-drop for the pair's engagement photos. The Royal Family will pay for the wedding, including the service, music, flowers and reception. Kensington Palace said the couple were ""very much looking forward to sharing"" the cake with their wedding guests Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have chosen an organic lemon and elderflower cake. In keeping with the transatlantic nature of the occasion,the couple have enlisted Californian pastry chef and food writer Claire Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in east London, to bake the cake. Philippa Craddock, a self-taught London-based florist, will create the wedding floral displays White garden roses, foxgloves and peonies - Ms Markle's favourite flower - will surround the couple on their wedding day. London-based florist Philippa Craddock has been chosen to create the floral displays for St George's Chapel and St George's Hall and locally sourced foliage will be used. Soon after the couple started dating, Ms Markle posted a picture of a bouquet of pink and white peonies on her now-deleted Instagram account and on another picture of peonies she said the flower made her ""endlessly happy"". Alexi Lubomirski will be the official wedding photographer. Hetook the photographs to mark the couple's engagementand says he is honoured to have the opportunity to capture the ""next chapter in this wonderful love story"". Mr Lubomirski, who was born in the UK but lives in New York, is known for his fashion magazine images of Beyonce, Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia Roberts and Scarlett Johansson. A statement from Kensington Palace said Ms Markle and Prince Harry wanted ""members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too"". Pubs and bars across England and Wales will beallowed to stay open two hours later than usual- serving until 01:00 BST on the morning of the wedding day, and again after the couple are married. The date and location of the honeymoon have not been released yet - but Kensington Palace said it would not start immediately.

"Could you, like Meghan, halt your career for love?","Rachel gave up her pilates business so her husband could become a football manager in Sweden Agreeing to marry Prince Harry prompted Meghan Markle to end her acting career - so what is it like to turn your back on your job for your partner? If you are married to a football manager it can come with the territory - as Rachel Potter discovered. Her husband Graham - an ex-professional player - was coaching football and studying at Leeds Metropolitan University when he was offered his first job in management in 2011. The only problem: it was in Ostersund, Sweden. His time at Ostersunds FKhas turned out to be a remarkable success story- but what of his wife, who has been alongside him every step of the way? Graham has taken minnows Ostersunds FK from the fourth tier of Swedish football to the top flight - and a Europa League tie with Arsenal this season She was living in York running a pilates business, which had been 12 years in the making, when Graham was asked to move to the remote town, 240 miles from the Arctic Circle. So did Rachel want to go? ""No,"" she says. ""But I could see that my husband really wanted to do it - and I felt like I couldn't not go."" It wasn't just the two of them - they had an 11-month old baby, Charlie, as well. ""We were moving him away from family and everything else,"" she says. ""Knowing that you've got to start all over again, it was tough. ""When I first moved here people didn't even know what Pilates was."" Then there was the cold. When they arrived in February 2011 it was -25C. ""I didn't want to get out of bed or go anywhere,"" she says. ""I just wanted to shut out the world. ""I remember having a chat with my husband saying I really don't want to be here. He said: 'Give it until the summer and if you still feel the same, then you can go home and I'll finish the year and come back.' ""I felt like I had a weight lifted off my shoulders as I had a get-out clause. It changed my mind-set."" The turnaround was gradual. She started learning Swedish, making friends, and, very slowly, introducing Ostersund to pilates. Rachel says Charlie, who is now eight, is ""more Swedish than English"" Now into her eighth year, Sweden has become home. Her twins Sam and Theo were born in Ostersund, she has made lifelong friendships, and her pilates business has taken off. ""If I hadn't done this, I could kind of see what my life would look like, whereas now I have no idea,"" she says. It's not just her husband who recognises the sacrifices she has made. The football club's fans expressed their gratitude to her in an open letter - and made a banner. Rachel says the fans' support made her cry: ""I was like wow, this is so nice."" Yet being married to a football manager means another upheaval could be just around the corner - asGraham's success means he is being eyed up by prospective suitors.,external Rachel, 41, says: ""We're both up for a new challenge. We like to take risks. ""For some other people it might totally freak them out, but for us it's just a bit exciting."" Dan Hiscocks had also spent over a decade building up a business, in publishing, when he found himself putting his career on hold for his partner. The US came calling for his wife Fiona in 2008, and the opportunity to study at Harvard University was too good to turn down. So Dan went too, to be primary carer to their one-year-old son Joshua. Dan looking after Joshua when they moved to the States ""My mates were astonished,"" he says. They asked him how he could spend 10-12 years building up a business and just walk away from it. His wife was also surprised, as well as a little nervous, he admits, in case everything went wrong. ""I was feeling that it would be another adventure,"" says Dan. ""I was excited. The reality was completely different."" After 18 months in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Fiona's work led her to Washington to help to build leaders at the top level of the US Government, working with President Obama. It was a sharp contrast to Dan's world as a house husband. 'Why I walked myself down the aisle' Find out: How popular is your wedding date? 'My lovely dad tried to kill me' 'Laurel' or 'Yanny'? People can't decide It got harder when their second child - Teddy - was born prematurely and Fiona had to quickly return to work. ""He had an illness which was really difficult,"" says Dan. Loneliness was also a problem. ""There weren't many men doing what I was doing,"" he says. ""But it's what a lot of people have to do. What I kept on trying to tell myself is that actually it didn't matter whether I was male or female. How lucky are we that we are in a position able to do this? ""I didn't focus on what I'd given up."" Dan, with his wife and two children, says he's proud they didn't take an easier path They returned to the UK in 2013 - and Dan, 47, now juggles his publishing business, Eye Books, with childcare. He says he loved the experience, but admits questions remain. ""Here I am, closer to 50 than 40,"" he says. ""Perhaps you could argue - and certainly some friends of mine do - that I wasted the best career years of my life by following my wife to achieve her dream."" But he doesn't agree. ""I think my dream was about the whole rather than the individual parts,"" he says. Part of that was being a father. ""I feel I have the most amazing relationship with my kids,"" he adds. Esme Benjamin also found her other half being lured across the pond - in her case to the bright lights and buzz of New York City. But giving up her job as a writer wasn't voluntary - it was an unwelcome side-effect of joining her soon-to-be husband Sid. ""I'd really established myself in London with a good job and a social circle and so on, and now I was going to have to start over at 27,"" she says. Tearful discussions followed, yet there was never any question she wouldn't go. Esme and Sid had been together since they were 16 ""Once we had committed to it I was excited about the prospect,"" says Esme. ""It's an incredible city, but I was also aware it was going to be very difficult for me to work."" And so it transpired. Not many companies are willing to pay the thousands of dollars required for a visa, and then hang around for months waiting for it. ""Saying goodbye to my career, and not knowing if I'd be able to continue on that career path, was really difficult,"" she says. ""But there are other things that give your life meaning."" She tried to fill her time. There was yoga teacher training, studying, blogging, reading, writing a novel - since discarded - and exploring the city. ""In some ways, what a privilege to spend your days like that,"" she says. But the fact it could go on ""indefinitely"" made it difficult. She also didn't enjoy being financially dependent on her husband, who worked in advertising. At her lowest point, she felt she didn't have any money or friends and convinced herself she was ill. ""But it was just in my head,"" she says. ""I became hyper-focused on everything to do with health and very obsessive about it."" One doctor thought she might have parasites and suggested eating nothing but organic pineapple and pumpkin seeds. ""It's completely bonkers,"" she says. ""That was all I ate for three days and I felt truly horrendous - as you can imagine."" Did the move affect her relationship with Sid? ""I carried some resentment over it,"" says Esme. ""But he was nothing but calm and supportive. He always had faith it would work out."" It was three years before Sid managed to get his hands on a visa which allowed spouses to be employed. Esme and Sid have lived in New York for five years and are planning on applying for green cards this year ""I do feel that it set my career back. But all the greatest learning experiences come out of challenges"", says the 33-year-old, who is now wellness editor at online website Culture Trip. ""I'm so glad I did it. These have been some of the most exciting years of our lives, so even though it's been difficult at times, I would never take that back."" So what's in store for Prince Harry's new wife? Esme says: ""It's going to be hard, there's going to be an adjustment period, but you'll have so many adventures and, ultimately, it'll be worth it."" Find out: How popular is your wedding date?

Reality Check: Can the royal wedding cost be calculated?,"From choosing the cake to the flowers and even the chair-covers, anyone who's ever planned a wedding knows it can be eye-wateringly expensive. But when it comes to royal weddings - with all the VIPs, security and extra extravagance - the bill runs into millions. So what do we know about the expected cost of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, and how much will the taxpayer be paying towards it? The wedding will be held in Windsor. And crowds in excess of 100,000 people are expected to descend on the town. Invitations have been sent to 600 guests, with a further 200 invited to the couple's evening reception On top of that, 1,200 members of the public will attend the grounds of Windsor Castle. Managing these sorts of numbers requires substantial planning. And security will almost certainly be the biggest single cost. In 2011, Â£6.35m was spent on security for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding The Home Office wouldn't comment when Reality Check contacted it, saying revealing policing costs could compromise ""national security"". Likewise, when we rang Thames Valley Police, it said: ""We aren't going to give you any data I'm afraid - even though we know you love numbers."" However, we do know Â£6.35m was spent by the Metropolitan Police (ie the taxpayer) on security for Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding. That's based on aFreedom of Information request released to the Press Association.,external But it's difficult to draw a direct comparison with Prince Harry and Ms Markle's wedding - the location and guest numbers are different. Kensington Palace hasn't released any details of what it plans to spend on the wedding. That's not really a surprise given that the official cost of Prince William and Catherine's wedding has never been revealed. That leaves us with unofficial estimates and as such they need to be treated with some caution. Bridebook.co.uk, a wedding planning service, saysthe total cost of the wedding could be Â£32m,external- including the cost of security. It put the cost of the cake at Â£50,000, the florist at Â£110,000, the catering at Â£286,000, and so on and so on. Reality Check contacted the company's owner, Hamish Shephard, to ask about the methodology used to arrive at the estimate. He said the Â£32m figure had been based on the assumption that the Royal Family had paid for everything at market rate. But in the absence of any official data, this is still guesswork - however well informed. For example, we don't know if suppliers would offer a substantial discount for the privilege of providing their services for a royal wedding. Ms Markle will walk down the aisle of St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle The cost of security for the wedding will be met by the taxpayer. Initially, Thames Valley Police will have to absorb the cost itself. But the force will be eligible to apply for special grant funding from the Home Office after the event in order to claim back some of the costs. Special grant funding is a separate pool of money forces can apply for if they have to police events outside their usual remit. Royal wedding 2018: all you need to know Queen to receive Â£6m pay increase from public funds Reality Check: What does the Queen cost us? As for the rest of the total, the Royal Family has said it will be paying for the private elements of the wedding. Every year the Royal Family gets a chunk of money from theannual Sovereign Grant,external, paid directly by the Treasury. The grant is calculated on a percentage of the profits from theCrown Estate portfolio,external, which includes much of London's West End. This year it's worth Â£82m. Some members of the Royal Family benefit from additional income. For example, Prince Charles gets money from the Duchy of Cornwall estate, a portfolio of land, property and financial investments. But it's not clear which ""pots"" the palace will choose to fund the wedding from. Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, and claims the overall cost of the monarchyis far higher than Â£82m,external, hassubmitted a petition,externalagainst taxpayers' money being spent on the wedding.

Find out: How popular is your wedding date?,"Your wedding day may hold a special place in your heart, but how many others do you share it with? As the royal wedding approaches, we've delved into the data on millions of marriages across 20 years to find the day of the year with the most love. Use the calculator below to find out how popular your wedding day was, or be savvy and find the best day to beat the crowd. Your browser does not support this lookup. The most popular wedding day wasSaturday 2 September 1995, when 7,750 couples got married. The least popular day wasChristmas Day 1999, when only three couples got married. Figures cover marriages in Britain from 1995-2015 including leap years. If you cannot see the interactive calendar,click here,external. Clearly the summer is a hot time to marry, and the royal wedding is not on an especially popular day, but what else is there to know? There are some obvious spikes in wedding day popularity. Valentine's Day is way above average for February and is the seventh most popular day in the year, in spite of the weather. Also significantly above the February average is 29 February, which only occurs in leap years. As the chart below shows, the 13th of any month is a very unpopular day. The 13th is unpopular if it falls on any day of the week, but when it falls on a Friday there are half the number of marriages compared with other Fridays, on average. The most noticeable shift over the years has been the decline in the number of people getting married (there were 38,463 fewer weddings in 2015 than in 1995), but the timing of weddings has also changed. While weekends remain the most popular time to wed, only 58% of weddings took place on the weekend in 2015 compared with 67% in 1995. Sundays are surprisingly unpopular. While most people have the day off, they will usually have to be up early on the Monday morning. Design and development by Prina Shah and Joe Reed.

Eight different ways to spend royal wedding day,"For some, Saturday will be spent preparing for street parties, wearing the union jack as a cape, and praying that the weather behaves itself. But for others it can be a reminder of a hatred of crowds, bunting and the pomp and ceremony that goes with a royal wedding. If you're in the latter camp, here are some different ways to spend the day. For those who want to be glued to the TV, but don't want to watch the royal wedding, the FA Cup offers a brilliant alternative. Sports lovers can revel in the grudge match between Chelsea and Man Utd. But with a 17:15 BST (10:15 ET) kick-off, it will be hard to avoid the royal wedding altogether as the nuptials commence at midday. The royal wedding has also caused havoc with the Duke of Cambridge's schedule. As president of the Football Association, Prince William usually hands out the FA Cup to the winning side. But he will miss this year's match at Wembley in favour of his brother's wedding. And for those who follow Scottish football, the Scottish Cup final between Celtic and Motherwell will kick-off at 15:00. Gough's cave in the Cheddar Gorge is a perfect place to get away from social media Wherever you go on royal wedding day, you may be unable to escape the nuptials because of news updates and photos posted to your mobile phone by friends on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. One option might be to go underground - literally. The lack of phone signal in the cave systems around Cheddar Gorge in Somerset provide the perfect location for those trying to avoid posts about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It's also a fun and educational day out for the whole family. If you're unable to get to Somerset, White Scar Cave in North Yorkshire offers a suitable alternative. If you're in the US, Mammoth Cave in Kentucky has more than 400 miles of passageways, and no phone signal. A non-Brit's guide to the royal wedding Royal wedding: All you need to know If you don't have a set of subterranean caves to peruse, maybe the cinema is the best way to go. You can sit in the darkened room for two hours, safe in the knowledge that the audience shouldn't be following events in Windsor. In the UK and US weekend releases include Deadpool 2, the drama On Chesil Beach and a family comedy about a canine police dog called Show Dogs. News of Meghan Markle's marriage to Prince Harry has piqued America's interest in the Royal Family. Coverage of the events in Windsor on the main TV networks has even surpassed the UK's offerings, making it increasingly difficult for Royal-sceptics in the USA to avoid the nuptials. Luckily basketball offers a welcome distraction for some, as the Boston Celtics take on the Cleveland Cavaliers in the east conference play-offs. The Celtics lead in the series 2-0, but the Cavs have reached the final the last three years, and have NBA All-Star LeBron James at their disposal. The game starts at 20:30 ET. One of the best ways to avoid coverage of the royal wedding is to hunker down under your duvet, and indulge in a bit of extra sleep. For US readers this will be a piece of cake as the wedding begins at 07:00 ET, but people in the UK using this method might want to invest in an eye mask as the ceremony will start at midday. Channel 4 sitcom The Windsors will be spoofing Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding If your blood boiled at the thought of the royal wedding, you might be able to take some solace in the fact that it's being mocked on national television. Channel 4 comedy The Windsors, a parody soap opera of the royal family, will return for a one-off special to commemorate Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's special day. It was already broadcast on Tuesday, but there will be a re-run of the sitcom at midnight on Saturday. This video can not be played Josh Warrington has no respect for 'cocky' IBF champion Lee Selby If matrimonial harmony is not your thing, watching two men slug it out in a boxing match might be a viable alternative. Lee Selby, otherwise known as The Barry Boy Assassin, will be defending his IBF world featherweight title against Josh Warrington. The fight is taking place on Saturday night at Elland Road in Leeds. If you want to be around others who don't want anything to do with the royal wedding, Republic, who campaign for the abolition of the monarchy, are hosting an international convention on the future of republican movements across Europe.

Girl of two dies after migrant van chase,"Authorities will hold a post mortem examination to find out what led to the girl's death (file pic) A two-year-old girl was found with fatal injuries after a van carrying 30 Kurdish migrants was chased by police for an hour in southern Belgium. Police say the girl died soon afterwards and have revealed that there was a scuffle and shots were fired. The chase began on the E42 motorway outside the town of Namur. The van drove west for several kilometres, evading police. Eventually it collided with another vehicle near Mons and the girl was found. It took 15 police cars and some 30 police to bring the incident to an end at around 03:00 (01:00 GMT) on Thursday. Belgian media have reported that the girl, who was with her mother, had been held out of a van window apparently to keep the police at a distance. Local prosecutors told the BBC they could not confirm the reports. When the van finally stopped police said people emerged from the vehicle and moved towards them. After a struggle, officials said that police fired shots but stressed the girl was not hit by gunfire. At least 30 people were inside the van, including children, they said. Police in France say people smugglers were involved, but that was not confirmed by local officials. Hours after the incident in the early hours of Thursday, a group of some 60 migrants reacted by blocking a motorway near Dunkirk, south of the Belgian border in France. Migrants staying at the nearby Grande-Synthe camp had known the girl who had died as she was part of a family who had been staying in the gym, said French police. Allow Twitter content?

Twenty people were detained and the migrants then returned to Grande-Synthe, where some were searched by French CRS riot police. Belgian authorities said a post mortem examination would take place to find out what had caused her death. It was not clear whether the driver had got away but a number of the passengers would be interviewed, they said. A police patrol had tried to stop the van because it was being driven in a strange manner. A police check then indicated it was carrying false number plates, reports said. A minister in the French-speaking Wallonia-Brussels government, AndrÃ© Flahaut, sent his condolences to the girl's family. ""The politics of chasing migrants is bound to end in drama,"" he said on Twitter. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Trump bids to ease North Korean concerns,"This video can not be played Trump on Kim meeting: 'North Korea would be very rich' President Donald Trump has said the US is not pursuing the ""Libya model"" for the denuclearisation of North Korea. Mr Trump said Kim Jong-un would stay in power if he made a deal, and hinted he could be deposed if he refused. Libya's Muammar Gaddafi agreed to give up nuclear weapons in 2003. He was later killed by Western-backed rebels. Most analysts say North Korea was angered by the prospect of a Libya scenario precisely because of what happened to Gaddafi. The comparison was made by Mr Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton. Analysis: This is Kim's warning shot to the White House North Korea crisis in 300 words It led the North to threaten to pull out of the summit with Mr Trump in Singapore on 12 June. As Mr Bolton looked on, the US president said: ""The Libyan model isn't a model that we have at all when we're thinking of North Korea. ""The model, if you look at that model with Gaddafi, that was a total decimation. We went in there to beat him. Now that model would take place if we don't make a deal, most likely. But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy,"" Mr Trump said. ""He'd be there, he'd be in his country, he'd be running his country, his country would be very rich."" What Kim wants On the planned summit, Mr Trump said: ""Nothing has changed on North Korea that we know of. We have not been told anything. ""And if it does that's fine and if it doesn't I think we'll probably have a very successful meeting."" John Bolton looked on as President Trump made his feelings clear North Korea's suggestion that it might pull out of the US summit pointed the finger squarely at Mr Bolton. ""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him,"" said Wednesday's statement, which was written by Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan. North Korea was apparently referencing an interview Mr Bolton gave comparing it to ""the Libya model"" of denuclearisation. In 2003, Libya's Colonel Muammar Gaddafi agreed to give up his country's programmes of weapons of mass destruction in an announcement that surprised the world. Most US sanctions on Libya were lifted within a few months and diplomatic ties between the countries restored. The North African country came in from the cold. But in 2011 the authoritarian leader was toppled by rebels and militiamen backed by Nato. He was later captured and killed by rebel forces. The Muammar Gaddafi story Also on Thursday, North Korea said it would not resume talks with the South until issues between the two are resolved. Pyongyang has been angered by continuing US-South Korea joint military exercises which it sees as a rehearsal for invasion. It cancelled planned high-level talks with South Korea earlier this week.

In a statement, chief negotiator Ri Son-gwon reverted to the angry language the North has used before, describing South Korean authorities as incompetent and senseless in comments reported by state news agency KCNA. He also criticised South Korea for allowing ""human scum"" (a reference to a North Korean defector) to speak at the Seoul National Assembly. This video can not be played Why North Korea is angry at this man Thursday's criticism of South Korea marks yet another shift in tone from Pyongyang just weeks before the planned US summit, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says. Pyongyang appears to be putting pressure on both the US and South Korea and refusing to talk until some concessions are made, she adds. At the summit between the leaders of North and South Korea on 27 April both sides agreed to work to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. But Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told MPs on Thursdaythere was a gap between North Korea and the US on ""how to pull off denuclearisation"",,externalaccording to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. North Korea said last week it would begin dismantling its nuclear test site at Punggye-ri between 23-25 May, but there was no mention of allowing foreign experts access to the site. On a recent visit to North Korea, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stressed that any claim of denuclearisation by the North would require a ""robust verification"" programme by the US and other nations. US offers to help rebuild N Korea economy if it denuclearises North Korea's nuclear programme explained Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

We're off to the royal wedding," County Antrim Philip has a plan. The day before the wedding his barber will give him a trim and a wet shave. He'll wear his blue three-piece suit - only worn once before at a friend's wedding - with brown shoes, a regimental red-and-green striped tie and his medals. It will be the first time Philip, 30, has worn them since he was discharged from the Army in 2013. Leaving was one of the hardest things he's done. More so, perhaps, than what came before, he says. Philip - or Barney to friends - was on his third tour of Afghanistan. It had been the best so far - the infrastructure in a country torn apart by war was improving and there'd been less fighting than in previous years. But on 9 January 2011, while on foot patrol in Helmand province, he stepped on a roadside bomb. It blew off his right leg and caused multiple fractures to his left. He stayed conscious while medics worked on him, before being taken by helicopter to an army hospital. There's little emotion in Philip's voice as he recounts the life-changing moment. “I find it quite easy to talk about it,” he says. “I accepted it within the first few months and moved past it.” “The Taliban took a leg, I wouldn't want them to take my life,” he explains. “If I stopped living my life, they might as well have taken it.” There were painful, emotional times in the weeks that followed for Philip and his loved ones. The knock on his dad's door to tell him his son had lost a leg, and a bedside reunion at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital. “You don't want to cry in front of your father so you hold it all back,” says Philip. But there were surprisingly good times too. Like the time he met his returning comrades off the bus. It was less than two months since the bomb went off but he'd been fitted with a prosthetic leg and was able to stand using crutches. “They got a huge surprise. The last time they'd seen me, I was lying in the dust with my leg blown off.” He says he clung to the hope that he'd recover sufficiently to return to the Army, but that wasn't the case. It was as much about losing part of his identity as losing a job, he says. That's when he first came into contact with the soldiers' charity, ABF. They paid for his girlfriend, Kirsty Crawford, to visit him in hospital. They also laid slabs on his driveway at home in Ballymena - and installed a shower room with a seat. These things won't make the front pages of newspapers, he says, but they are small things that make a big difference. The charity helped him until he was discharged from the Army in 2013 - since then, he has been helping them as an ambassador. We do some sums and work out he's raised at least £50,000 in five years with black-tie dinners, a Five Peaks Challenge and climbing Kilimanjaro. Keeping fit has been part of his approach to life out of the Army. He's worked as an outdoor instructor and recently started volunteering with the Army cadet force. “I can't run 15 miles any more but I can do a little bit,” he says. With that “little bit”, he hopes to get himself a place on the British team to compete in archery and rowing at the Invictus Games in Sydney this October. “It would be really nice to represent my country, to don the Union Jack colours,” he says. There is a quiet patriotism that comes across as we talk. “I've got a lot of time for the Royal Family,” he says. “You sign an oath to the Queen when you join the Army.” He knows soldiers who've met Prince Harry who say he's down to earth and genuine. “He likes to look after the veterans. He's a good guy in my book.” While Philip has a plan, his girlfriend Kirsty is still formulating hers. With little more than a fortnight to go, she's looked around the shops and has a shortlist of dresses. The couple will travel to the wedding with friends who've also been invited. The four will share a picnic and a couple of glasses of prosecco. Harry and Meghan will tie the knot after less than two years together, so it begs the question will Philip and Kirsty, together for nine years, be following them down the aisle any time soon? Philip laughs. “I get asked that a lot. It is something we'll be talking about in the near future.” Cambridgeshire Twelve-year-old Jorja is back home from school. She tugs off her school tie and slumps on the sofa. Budgerigars squawk and the family's six dogs bark and yap as Jorja recalls the moment her mum sat her down and told her she was invited to the royal wedding. “I think I may have woken the neighbours up with my screaming,” she says. “I wasn't allowed to tell anyone for five days but I did tell my best friend,” she confesses. Her first thought was the dress. After 10 hours searching online, she found The One, her mum, Gabrielle, jokes. Jorja will wear a black dress with a sweetheart neckline, one sparkly mid-heel shoe and a deep pink-coloured blade. An amputee from birth, Jorja has been in and out of hospital ever since, averaging about two operations a year. “It's probably not something to be proud of but I sort of am,” she says. Amniotic band syndrome is a rare condition in which strands of tissue wrap around the unborn baby's limbs and cut off blood flow. At her 20-week pregnancy scan, Gabrielle was told Jorja was missing a leg. It was not until she was born that they saw some of her fingers and toes were twisted or stumps. At the age of one, Jorja was fitted with her first prosthetic leg and quickly learned to walk. But, as she grew older, some of the usual milestones of childhood were never reached. “She can't run,” says Gabrielle. “And children's prosthetic feet don't bend. There's no riding a bike.” There are times when the pain around her stump is so bad she needs morphine every day. And she has been tormented by bullies, young and old. “Muttering under their breath. People calling me things. It's hard,” she says. Her ballet teacher told her she'd never pirouette because she couldn't point her foot. “Is it bad that I once threw my leg at her?” asks Jorja, mischievously. A couple of years ago, Gabrielle and Jorja met a family whose dad was an amputee at their local park. They began talking about how unusual it was to meet other amputees. Out of that meeting, a germ of an idea formed which led to the creation of a support group for amputees and their families. Steel Bones was born. And Jorja became its youth ambassador. Her role involves lending an ear to new amputees and giving advice. Recently, she helped a 15-year-old boy and his mum who were worried he'd be bullied when he returned to school after an amputation. She told him bluntly he probably would. “Someone is going to say something to try to bring you down,” she said, but followed it up with advice on how to handle the bullies. “I try my best to help,” she says, explaining that talking to other amputees and their families “feels like it makes you a better person”. “I don't know where she gets her compassion from,” says Gabrielle. “If it were me, I would feel ‘Why me?’ - Jorja thinks ‘Why not me?’” Jorja's other role is fundraising. Steel Bones is the chosen charity for her house at school. On a sunny day in May, Soham Village College swaps morning assembly for a fundraiser on the tennis courts. Cheers go up as students hear they've raised £574.06 for Jorja's charity by saving their loose change. With it, they spell out Steel Bones on the courts, send a drone into the blue sky and film their endeavours. Jorja, an aspiring actor, is chatty and funny with a natural confidence not usually found in 12-year-olds. She's determined that in the future we should see a more realistic portrayal of disabled people on our screens. As we chat at her home in Isleham village, near Cambridge, her mum brings in an official-looking envelope addressed to Jorja which arrived that morning. It's a cheque from Cambridgeshire's Lord Lieutenant's Office for £150 to help Jorja and Gabrielle enjoy the big day. Gabrielle suggests Jorja buys some birthstone earrings she's fallen for. But Jorja has other ideas - she wants to get something for her Nanny and a toy for her little brother. As Lucian, five, playfights with his big sister, German TV are on the phone trying to get an interview with Jorja. There's been interest from French TV, Good Morning America and CNN too. Is she feeling famous? Maybe, she replies, midway through a make-up rehearsal. Gabby predicts Jorja will be up at 3am on the day of the wedding to perfect her look. They joke about preparing a picnic of cucumber sandwiches - “If it's not posh enough, security won't let us in.” Jorja's favourite royal is Prince Harry and she's looking forward to seeing what Meghan will be wearing. “I think it's good that they're not just inviting politicians, and I get to go and Donald Trump doesn't,” she says, twirling around the lounge in her wedding make-up and dress. Worcestershire Laura and her mum, Helen, are on a shopping trip in London's West End in search of the perfect outfit. With a TV crew in tow, they pore over the rails - their stylist for the day casting aside anything that's not “autumn” colours. Laura, who will turn 31 in the days before the royal wedding, is adamant she won't wear a dress. “I want trousers. I've always been a tomboy.” She's given the matter a lot of thought as she has weddings on her mind - and not just Harry and Meghan's. Laura and her boyfriend, Ray, have been dating for six months and recently got engaged. They plan to marry next year. “The only day I'll wear a dress is on the day of my wedding,” she says. “Then it'll be leggings with a [detachable] skirt that I'll whip off after the first dance.” Finding an outfit will not be the only challenge for Laura who has autism and learning disabilities. In a London square, she squints against the bright sunshine at a bank of grass dotted with daisies. “I see a different picture,” she explains. “When I look at loads of flowers, I will take twice as long to realise what they are.” The wedding, she admits, will be difficult but her mum will be by her side. New things are scary for her but Helen says she'll do all she can to reduce Laura's anxiety by travelling to Berkshire the day before and having the journey well-planned. Both worry how Laura will cope with the queues - she's not good in queues. However, Laura is looking forward to celebrity-spotting and chatting with the “other commoners” in the castle grounds. They'll take their own picnic (chicken and mayo for Laura, and a celebratory chocolate bar), a rug and some comfy shoes. “It's a nice feeling that they've invited us,” she reflects, looking across at her mum. “It was hard to believe - it's the first time I've been to a royal wedding.” She was chosen, she says, because of all her charity work - “I'm non-stop”. For six years, Laura has made sure young people with learning disabilities in Worcester have a safe but buzzing place to get together, make friends and have fun. The Monday Night Club was launched in the years after Laura left college when she found her social life slipping away, like many others with learning disabilities. It's not a problem she has any more. Now, on Monday nights 100 or more clubbers pack out the venue to “sing like Elvis and dance like Michael Jackson”. Laura, who often DJs, keeps regulars on the dancefloor with pop, RnB and even the Neighbours theme tune, if that's their thing. She's also chair of Worcestershire's People's Parliament, which presses for change to improve the lives of people with learning disabilities. The group has introduced a travel wallet, with space for a bus pass and cards saying “Speak slowly” and “Can you tell me when I arrive at my stop?” They are looking to get tenancy agreements printed in Easy Read, which would cut down long, complex documents into plain English with helpful illustrations. Laura also squeezes football coaching into her busy weeks. Again, it's about giving people with learning and physical disabilities something they can't get anywhere else. “They're allowed to break the rules, shout, have a paddy - we don't mind,” says Helen. It's now 18 months since Laura moved into a place of her own. She's also bringing up Prince, a Cockapoo puppy, who's being trained to become a learning assistance dog. The other day someone said to me “This girl's got it going on”, says Laura. Her mum puts it another way. “She works so hard and so many people benefit from what she does,” says Helen. It's an unseasonably hot day in April when Laura and Helen are given VIP treatment at one of Oxford Street's biggest department stores. Laura tries on a sequinned fascinator, drawing oohs from her small retinue. “Is this it, Mum?” she asks. It's handmade and costs £300. “No,” says Helen firmly. The stylist holds up an orange tropical print jumpsuit. “It's too much,” says Laura. “I don't want to take attention away from Meghan.” Built with Shorthand"
Man jailed for Finsbury Park barmaid murder,"Kasim Lewis pleaded guilty to murdering 22-year-old Iuliana Tudos A man has been jailed for 29 years for killing a barmaid whose naked body was found in a park after she went missing on Christmas Eve. Iuliana Tudos, 22, was discovered dead in a disused building in Finsbury Park, north London, three days later. Ms Tudos, who was born in Moldova, had been slashed with a broken bottle in the neck, abdomen and wrists. Kasim Lewis, 31, of Friern Barnet, north London, pleaded guilty to her murder at the Old Bailey on Thursday. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 29 years. Judge Richard Marks QC said he observed that no evidence suggested Ms Tudos had been sexually assaulted. But said the fact that Lewis had cable ties with him, suggested there was ""sadism"" involved, and that he planned to attack someone. ""She must have died a terrible death. What you did to her was wicked beyond belief"", he said. During the attack, Lewis extracted her PIN number and later withdrew cash from her account. Iuliana Tudos went missing on Christmas Eve The court heard Ms Tudos lived in Cyprus, where her parents are from, before moving to London in 2013. She worked in the World's End pub in Camden High Street. She had finished her shift at the pub and was planning to spend Christmas with friends after going home to collect her things. She was picked up on CCTV at 20:33 heading towards the entrance of Finsbury Park. When she failed to turn up, her friends posted messages on social media, contacted the pub, hospitals and distributed fliers. Her body was found in a burnt-out shed by her friends, the court heard. Paramedics described a wound to her chest as looking like the logo for Batman or the letter M, and she had been bound with cable ties, the court heard. CCTV footage was retrieved of Kasim Lewis using Iuliana's bank card A search of Lewis's phone revealed a trailer for a pornographic film featuring a young woman being chased into an alleyway and then bound with cable ties. In a statement read to the court, Ms Tudos's stepfather Costas Vassiliou said his daughter was murdered in the most ""inhumane way"". He described his ""beloved daughter"" as ""full of energy"" and ""loved and cherished by all of her friends and family"". ""As parents our dream was for Iuliana to get back to Cyprus after her graduation, get a job, get married and have children, our grandchildren,"" he said. ""All of these now are gone. ""As a family we will never get through this."" The public gallery was packed as friends and family came to see Iuliana's killer face justice. Friends wept and held hands to their mouths as the prosecution described her naked body being found with horrific injuries. Her mother sobbed as her husband read the family impact statement - saying they and Iuliana's two brothers would never get past their grief. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Vassiliou said the outcome of the sentencing was ""very good"" and he trusted the judge had made the right decision. Many of Iuliana's friends who came to court were too upset to speak. One told me she missed her friend ""so much"". She added: ""He desecrated the body afterwards which is maybe even more disgusting than the actual killing."" She and another friend said they had been to Cyprus for Iuliana's funeral and that the family support there was ""amazing"". ""The family have been there for all of us as well,"" he said, and added that people like Lewis should be sentenced ""to die in prison"". Lewis, who was born in Montserrat, entered his plea over a video link from HMP Belmarsh. He had previously been jailed for an earlier sex attack. In September 2005, he was handed two years for sexual assault and exposure on a bus and placed on the sex offenders register. In 2011, he received a further eight months in jail for failing to comply with the sex offender notification requirements and a community order.

Ariana Grande: 'It's the worst of humanity',"Ariana Grande has spoken in detail for the first time about theManchester Arena bomb attacklast year. Speaking to Time,external, she said: ""There are so many people who have suffered such loss and pain. The processing part is going to take forever."" Last May, 22 people were killed and hundreds were injured in the bombing after Grande's concert at the city centre venue. The US singer described the bombing as ""the absolute worst of humanity"". ""Music is supposed to be the safest thing in the world,"" she told the magazine, for its Next Generation Leaders edition. ""I think that's why it's still so heavy on my heart every single day. I wish there was more that I could fix."" The attack on 22 May 2017 alsoleft more than 800 people with physical and psychological injuries.

The star has also met survivors of the Parkland, Florida shooting ""You think with time it'll become easier to talk about,"" she continued. ""Or you'll make peace with it.

Cladding ban considered after Grenfell,"There will be a consultation on banning inflammable cladding on high-rise buildings, the government says, despite a review into the Grenfell tragedy not recommending such a move. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire announced the consultation ""having listened carefully"" to concerns. Earlier, a government-commissioned building regulations review stopped short of proposing a ban - a move criticised by some Grenfell survivors. Labour MPs called for an immediate ban. Architects, building firms and Grenfell survivors had backed laws forbidding the use of combustible materials in tower blocks. Inflammable cladding is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in west London's Grenfell Tower last June. A total of 72 people died as a result of the blaze, the judge-led inquiry has said. This includes Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, who died in January. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor. Will the building regulations review work? A subsequent survey identifiedhundreds of other buildings where cladding failed safety tests. The Royal Institute of British Architects called for a ban on inflammable cladding, as well as a requirement for sprinklers to be fitted, and a second means of escape for high-rise residential buildings. Announcing the consultation, Mr Brokenshire said: ""We must create a culture that truly puts people and their safety first, that inspires confidence and, yes, rebuilds public trust."" He said the building regulations review, and the changes that will come from it, were ""important first steps, helping us ensure that when we say 'never again', we mean it"". Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey responded, saying: ""Don't consult on it, do it."" Shahin Sadafi, chairman of Grenfell United, which represents survivors and the bereaved, said he was ""disappointed"" there was no immediate ban. Earlier, a government-commissioned independent report into building regulations called for a ""radical rethink"" of the safety system, but stopped short of recommending an outright ban on inflammable cladding. This video can not be played Dame Judith Hackitt tells Today that the building regulation system is broken The report's author, Dame Judith Hackitt, said indifference and ignorance had led to cost being prioritised over safety and called  for regulators to ""come together"" to ensure building safety. She also recommended incentives for the right behaviour and tougher penalties for those who breach the rules. Appearing before the Housing, Communities and Local Government select committee, Dame Judith said she supported Mr Brokenshire's announcement and it was ""complementary"" to her review, ""but on its own it will be insufficient"". ""Simply banning something from happening is no guarantee of compliance,"" she said. ""If people attach too much reliance upon banning activities and particular materials as being a solution to this problem it will create a false sense of security."" She told MPs that she had not known Mr Brokenshire had planned to announce a consultation. The prime minister's spokesman said the current regulatory system was not ""fit for purpose"" and the government was committed to making the necessary changes. Grenfell United and opposition MPs criticised the review's recommendations. Mr Sadafi said his group was ""disappointed and saddened that she (Dame Judith) she didn't listen to us and she didn't listen to other experts"". This video can not be played Diane Abbott: ""The 71 people who died were not a 'technical issue' and you need to step up."" Shadow housing minister Sarah Jones told the BBC that the report was a ""huge wasted opportunity"" and that the recommendations did not go far enough. Labour MP and Grenfell campaigner David Lammy said it was ""unfathomable"" that the review had not recommended a ban on combustible materials. Survivors in emergency housing 12 months on Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell: Inside the 21st floor The independent review,externallooked into regulations around the design, construction and management of buildings in relation to fire safety. The final 156-page report found that: Roles and responsibilities for building safety are unclear Regulations and guidance are ""ambiguous and inconsistent"" and are ""misunderstood and misinterpreted"" There is ignorance about the rules governing the industry The process that drives compliance with the regulations are ""weak and complex"" Competence (of people in the system) is ""patchy"" The process for testing and certifying products is ""disjointed, confusing, unhelpful and lacking any sort of transparency"" Product testing and marketing is ""opaque and insufficient"" Residents' voices go unheard Dame Judith - a senior engineer who used to chair the Health and Safety Executive - said these issues ""have helped to create a cultural issue across the sector, which can be described as a 'race to the bottom', caused either through indifference, or because the system does not facilitate good practice"". Her appointment to lead the reviewhad been met with some criticismdue to her former role as director of the Energy Saving Trust. The organisation promotes insulation containing a foam known as polyisocyanurate (PIR), blamed for fuelling the fire at Grenfell.

North Korea turns on 'incompetent' South,"This video can not be played Trump on Kim meeting: 'North Korea would be very rich' President Donald Trump has said the US is not pursuing the ""Libya model"" for the denuclearisation of North Korea. Mr Trump said Kim Jong-un would stay in power if he made a deal, and hinted he could be deposed if he refused. Libya's Muammar Gaddafi agreed to give up nuclear weapons in 2003. He was later killed by Western-backed rebels. Most analysts say North Korea was angered by the prospect of a Libya scenario precisely because of what happened to Gaddafi. The comparison was made by Mr Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton. Analysis: This is Kim's warning shot to the White House North Korea crisis in 300 words It led the North to threaten to pull out of the summit with Mr Trump in Singapore on 12 June. As Mr Bolton looked on, the US president said: ""The Libyan model isn't a model that we have at all when we're thinking of North Korea. ""The model, if you look at that model with Gaddafi, that was a total decimation. We went in there to beat him. Now that model would take place if we don't make a deal, most likely. But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy,"" Mr Trump said. ""He'd be there, he'd be in his country, he'd be running his country, his country would be very rich."" What Kim wants On the planned summit, Mr Trump said: ""Nothing has changed on North Korea that we know of. We have not been told anything. ""And if it does that's fine and if it doesn't I think we'll probably have a very successful meeting."" John Bolton looked on as President Trump made his feelings clear North Korea's suggestion that it might pull out of the US summit pointed the finger squarely at Mr Bolton. ""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him,"" said Wednesday's statement, which was written by Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan. North Korea was apparently referencing an interview Mr Bolton gave comparing it to ""the Libya model"" of denuclearisation. In 2003, Libya's Colonel Muammar Gaddafi agreed to give up his country's programmes of weapons of mass destruction in an announcement that surprised the world. Most US sanctions on Libya were lifted within a few months and diplomatic ties between the countries restored. The North African country came in from the cold. But in 2011 the authoritarian leader was toppled by rebels and militiamen backed by Nato. He was later captured and killed by rebel forces. The Muammar Gaddafi story Also on Thursday, North Korea said it would not resume talks with the South until issues between the two are resolved. Pyongyang has been angered by continuing US-South Korea joint military exercises which it sees as a rehearsal for invasion. It cancelled planned high-level talks with South Korea earlier this week.

In a statement, chief negotiator Ri Son-gwon reverted to the angry language the North has used before, describing South Korean authorities as incompetent and senseless in comments reported by state news agency KCNA.

This video can not be played Why North Korea is angry at this man Thursday's criticism of South Korea marks yet another shift in tone from Pyongyang just weeks before the planned US summit, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says. Pyongyang appears to be putting pressure on both the US and South Korea and refusing to talk until some concessions are made, she adds. At the summit between the leaders of North and South Korea on 27 April both sides agreed to work to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. But Pyongyang's professed commitment to ""denuclearisation"" is likely to differ from Washington's demand for ""comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible"" nuclear disarmament. South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told MPs on Thursdaythere was a gap between North Korea and the US on ""how to pull off denuclearisation"",,externalaccording to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. North Korea said last week it would begin dismantling its nuclear test site at Punggye-ri between 23-25 May, but there was no mention of allowing foreign experts access to the site.

Cabinet agrees Brexit customs 'backstop'The UK would be willing to match EU tariffs after 2020 if needed to avoid a hard N Ireland border.4h4 hours agoUK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? A customs proposal aimed at preventing a hard border in Ireland after Brexit has been agreed by cabinet. Ministers signed off on the ""backstop"" that would see the UK match EU tariffs after 2020, if there is no deal on their preferred customs arrangements. Brexiteers fear the proposal amounts to staying in the customs union longer. No 10 says the UK would still be able to sign and implement trade deals, and the measure would only last for a matter of months. The UK is due to leave the European Union in March 2019, after which a 21-month transition period is due to begin, which aims to smooth the way to a post-Brexit relationship between the UK and EU. Government sources have told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, that the newly-agreed proposal was very unlikely to be needed - as they are confident a customs deal that avoids bringing back a hard border can be agreed with the EU. Reality Check: The government's customs options UK-EU customs partnership 'still on table' Why is the customs union so important? A 'longer fudge' on customs union? Earlier, Irish PM Leo Varadkar said ensuring there was no hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland was ""an absolute red line"" for the Irish government. ""We need that [backstop] to be part of the withdrawal agreement, and if it's not, then there will be no withdrawal agreement and no transition period."" After meeting Mrs May at an EU summit in Bulgaria on Thursday, he said he expected the UK to table new proposals within weeks but warned: ""Resolving the issue of avoiding a hard border requires more than customs."" Mrs May said they had held a ""very constructive"" meeting, adding: ""The commission published a fallback option which was not acceptable to us and we will be bringing forward our own proposal for that fallback option in due course."" She also met European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and European Council President Donald Tusk. The government's new proposal is expected to be discussed formally in Brussels next week. Leo Varadkar will meet Theresa May at an EU summit in Bulgaria on Thursday Ministers are yet to settle on what permanent model they want to see replace the customs union when the UK leaves the EU. They are under pressure to decide on their policy before a key EU summit in June. Labour Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer called the situation ""farcical"", saying: ""The government is fighting over two options, neither of which are going to work, neither of which are acceptable to the EU, and neither of which would have the support of the majority in parliament."" He added: ""We need certainty and the right approach is to stay in a customs union with the EU as the long-term objective."" The UK is due to officially leave the EU on 29 March 2019, with a transition period until the end of 2020 intended to smooth the way to the permanent new relationship. But the two sides have just five months to get an agreement on post-Brexit trade, so it can be ratified before Britain leaves in March next year. Key to this is how the UK and EU's customs systems will work together in years to come. Currently, the UK is in the EU's customs union, which means member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals. The UK government has said it wants to leave the EU customs union in order to strike its own trade deals with other countries, promising trade will still be as ""frictionless"" as possible. Please upgrade your browser But ministers do not agree on how to replace it. Brexiteers are against Mrs May's preferred option of a ""customs partnership"", under which the UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. The alternative proposal would rely on technology and advance checks to minimise, rather than remove, customs checks. The EU has expressed doubts about whether either option would work. On Wednesday, senior ministers acknowledged there has been ""serious criticism"" of both proposed models.

Cabinet agrees Brexit customs 'backstop',"This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? A customs proposal aimed at preventing a hard border in Ireland after Brexit has been agreed by cabinet. Ministers signed off on the ""backstop"" that would see the UK match EU tariffs after 2020, if there is no deal on their preferred customs arrangements. Brexiteers fear the proposal amounts to staying in the customs union longer. No 10 says the UK would still be able to sign and implement trade deals, and the measure would only last for a matter of months. The UK is due to leave the European Union in March 2019, after which a 21-month transition period is due to begin, which aims to smooth the way to a post-Brexit relationship between the UK and EU. Government sources have told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, that the newly-agreed proposal was very unlikely to be needed - as they are confident a customs deal that avoids bringing back a hard border can be agreed with the EU. Reality Check: The government's customs options UK-EU customs partnership 'still on table' Why is the customs union so important? A 'longer fudge' on customs union? Earlier, Irish PM Leo Varadkar said ensuring there was no hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland was ""an absolute red line"" for the Irish government. ""We need that [backstop] to be part of the withdrawal agreement, and if it's not, then there will be no withdrawal agreement and no transition period."" After meeting Mrs May at an EU summit in Bulgaria on Thursday, he said he expected the UK to table new proposals within weeks but warned: ""Resolving the issue of avoiding a hard border requires more than customs."" Mrs May said they had held a ""very constructive"" meeting, adding: ""The commission published a fallback option which was not acceptable to us and we will be bringing forward our own proposal for that fallback option in due course."" She also met European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, and European Council President Donald Tusk. The government's new proposal is expected to be discussed formally in Brussels next week. Leo Varadkar will meet Theresa May at an EU summit in Bulgaria on Thursday Ministers are yet to settle on what permanent model they want to see replace the customs union when the UK leaves the EU. They are under pressure to decide on their policy before a key EU summit in June. Labour Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer called the situation ""farcical"", saying: ""The government is fighting over two options, neither of which are going to work, neither of which are acceptable to the EU, and neither of which would have the support of the majority in parliament."" He added: ""We need certainty and the right approach is to stay in a customs union with the EU as the long-term objective."" The UK is due to officially leave the EU on 29 March 2019, with a transition period until the end of 2020 intended to smooth the way to the permanent new relationship. But the two sides have just five months to get an agreement on post-Brexit trade, so it can be ratified before Britain leaves in March next year. Key to this is how the UK and EU's customs systems will work together in years to come. Currently, the UK is in the EU's customs union, which means member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals. The UK government has said it wants to leave the EU customs union in order to strike its own trade deals with other countries, promising trade will still be as ""frictionless"" as possible. Please upgrade your browser But ministers do not agree on how to replace it. Brexiteers are against Mrs May's preferred option of a ""customs partnership"", under which the UK would collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods coming into the UK on behalf of the EU. The alternative proposal would rely on technology and advance checks to minimise, rather than remove, customs checks. The EU has expressed doubts about whether either option would work. On Wednesday, senior ministers acknowledged there has been ""serious criticism"" of both proposed models.

US birth rates drop to lowest since 1987,"The US still has a high fertility rate and the slowdown does not mean the population will shrink Births in the US have dropped to their lowest rate in 30 years, marking a cultural shift as women delay motherhood, experts say. Some 3.85 million babies were born in the US in 2017, the fewest since 1987, as births among women in their teens and 20s decreased. Both the birth rate - the number of births per thousand - and fertility - a lifetime average forecast - fell. Declining birth rates are common as countries become more developed. The US fertility rate is lower than the UK's but the US still has a higher fertility rate than many other countries. While births decreased among younger women in the US last year, it rose in women aged between 40 and 44. South Korea birth rate hits record low Russians debate declining birth rate They are similar terms that mean slightly different things. The birth rate is the number of live births per 1,000 people per year. The total fertility rate, on the other hand, looks at the average number of children women will have over their lifetimes - how many children a 19-year-old will have, rather than how many she had this year. Thefertility rate has dropped to 1.76 births per woman - the lowest since 1978, the National Centre for Health Statistics said,externalin a report. Donna Strobino of Johns Hopkins University put the change down to women choosing to delay motherhood in favour of work. She told AFP news agency: ""Women are becoming more educated, they are in the workforce, they are pursuing their careers. ""And in the absence of policies that really help women who are working to really take some time off post-partum you are probably going to see a continuation of this delay."" The US is the only developed nation in the world that does not provide some type of national paid family leave plan to new parents. Will Trump bring paid maternity leave to the US? Other possible explanations could include changing societal expectations, increased access to contraception, limited provision for parental leave from work, and increased expectations of romantic love. This video can not be played Advert urges Poles to 'breed like rabbits' to fight falling birth rates The rate has been dropped since the post-World War Two ""baby boomer"" generation was born, and suffered another dip in the recession that started in 2008. It could mean there are fewer young people in the workforce in the future, at the same time as life spans increase and more elderly people need care and resources into later life. But it does not mean the population will shrink. It may grow at a slower rate, but there will continue to be more and more people in the US. William Frey of the Brookings Institute called for some perspective on the figures. ""The country isn't going to run out of people,"" he said. Can pregnancy rates predict a recession?

Hawaii volcano spews 'ballistic blocks',"The volcano is sending ""ballistic blocks"" out hundreds of metres - and they could reach several tonnes in weight A Hawaiian volcano is blasting out ""ballistic blocks"" the size of kitchen appliances and the authorities are warning it could get worse. Since a new zone of Kilauea began erupting almost two weeks ago, lava has wrecked dozens of homes and forced hundreds of people to be evacuated. An ash plume rising up to two miles (more than 3,000m) prompted officials to warn pilots to avoid the area. Quakes as strong as magnitude 4.4 have been felt on the largest island. The floor of the volcano's caldera (the bowl where lava erupts) is deflating, causing stress at the volcano's base. This is causing earthquakes and new fissures to open in the ground, and creating the risk of new, highly explosive steam-powered eruptions as the magma meets underground water. What stops eruptions of lava? The ash plume can be seen from the International Space Station. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Boulders of up to 60cm (2ft) were found a few hundred yards from the crater, reported the US Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. Butit warned things could get much more dangerous,external. ""During steam-driven explosions, ballistic blocks up to 2m across could be thrown in all directions to a distance of 1km (0.6 miles) or more,"" it said. ""These blocks could weigh a few kilograms to several tons. Smaller (pebble-size) rocks could be sent several kilometers... mostly in a downwind direction."" Lava, earthquakes and projectiles are not the islanders' only concerns: Vog- volcanic air pollution - contains sulphur dioxide which can cause breathing problems and irritate the eyes Ash- the area is already dusted with volcanic ash but authorities say this could get worse, posing risks to human and animal health, agriculture and power and water supplies Disrupted transportlinks - a red aviation code has been issued, a warning to pilots to avoid the potentially damaging ash cloud.

"Whitney 'sexually abused', film claims","Houston died at the age of 48 in 2012 A new documentary about late singer Whitney Houston alleges that her cousin, Dee Dee Warwick, sexually abused her. Houston's half-brother Gary Garland-Houston and her assistant, Mary Jones, both made the claims against Dee Dee, who died in 2008. The film, Whitney, is directed by Scottish filmmaker Kevin Macdonald. Dee Dee Warwick is the younger sister of soul singer Dionne Warwick and was the niece of Houston's mother. Whitney debuted in Cannes on Wednesday night. The Warwick family has been contacted for comment by the BBC. Kevin Macdonald with Whitney's niece Rayah Houston and the film's producer, Whitney's sister in-law Pat Houston Houston, who sold millions of records and had hits with songs like I Will Always Love You and I Wanna Dance With Somebody, died in 2012 at the age of 48. She drowned in a bath in a hotel andthe coroner ruled that cocaine use and heart disease were factors in her death. Houston ended her volatile 15-year marriage to singer Bobby Brown in 2007. Their daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, died at a hospice in 2015 at the age of 22, six months after she was found unresponsive in a bath. Film writer and producer Kaleem Aftab was among those to praise the film. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

School delay 'does not help summer-born'Putting summer-born children's school start back a year boosts attainment by less than one mark.1han hour agoFamily & Education,"Delaying a summer-born child's entry to primary school has little impact on attainment, research suggests. Children born in England between April and August, whose start in Reception was put back a year, did only marginally better in Year 1 tests, according to a government study. The number of applications to councils for delayed entry has risen sharply. Head teachers' unions want clearer guidance on whether delayed school entry for summer-born children works. Department for Education researchers looked at results achieved in the Phonics Screening Check, taken by pupils at the end of Year 1. Pupils whose school start was delayed a year in 2014 and 2015 scored on average 0.7 marks higher than other summer-born children. The researchers say the difference is not statistically significant. Pupils who were not summer-born outperformed both the delayed and normal admission summer-born pupils. Times table check trialled ahead of roll-out Summer-born pupils' late start wins MPs' backing The analysis also found parents with higher incomes were significantly more likely to request a delayed school start for their child. It also found the majority of applications, 74%, were from white British families. Children in England usually start school in the September after they turn four but parents of children born between 1 April and 31 August can request to delay entry for a year. Typically, this would mean a child starting school in Year 1, forfeiting Reception year. If a parent wishes to delay their child's admission to school until compulsory school age, at five, and be admitted into Reception, a request needs to be made to their local authority, for their child to be admitted out of their normal age group. Councils are required to make a decision in the child's best interests, taking account of parents' views and information about the child's development. Pauline Hull, of the Summer Born Campaign which has called for more flexible admissions, welcomed the report but said ""the most important comparison is how much better these children are faring having started school at age five, rather than age four, and the DfE research does not address this. ""The focus on phonics testing doesn't consider social and emotional benefits of delayed entry which is of significant importance to parents."" Anne Frank's 'dirty jokes' uncovered Row over World Cup 'flirting manual' How long are you going to live? The Department for Education surveyed 152 local authorities in England about their admissions policy. Of the 92 who responded, 1,750 requests were made to delay school entry in 2016-17, up 84% on the previous year. Overall, 75% of requests were granted. Ten of the local authorities said they had a policy of automatically agreeing all requests made to delay entry while 23 said they only agreed requests where parents presented strong evidence. The majority said they still expected parents to make a case as to why their child should start Reception late. Some councils said they were concerned that parents would delay entry for their child because it might benefit them in other ways, rather than because there was a genuine need. ""When a parent does not get a place at their preferred school they will delay their child's entry simply to get another chance to get a place at a particular school,"" said one. In a separate survey of parents from Liverpool, Hertfordshire, Devon, and Lewisham, who had all delayed their child's entry into Reception, 79% had a household income of Â£25,000 or more. Almost half earned more than Â£50,000 annually. 97% feared their child was not ready for school 38% cited a medical condition or developmental delay 13% said a lack of places in their preferred school was a factor Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""It's about taking a sensible and human approach based on the individual needs of the child in question. ""The flexibility required in order to accommodate the needs of some children born between April and August each year can cause some organisational and financial issues for schools but they are not insurmountable and more guidance from the government has certainly helped."" Julie McCulloch, Director of Policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, called for ""a consistent approach across the country"" and urged the DfE to ""review this matter to develop a policy based on emerging evidence over the impact of delayed entry to school and what works best for children"". A DfE spokeswoman said ""the phonics check measures a specific skill and doesn't tell us anything about a child's development more widely"". ""We know the Reception year is an important part of school life and we want to make sure no child misses that year of their education because they have summer birthdays.""

UK faces European court over dirty air,"Persistent high levels of air pollution have seen the UK referred to the European Court of Justice The UK is being taken to court by the European Commission over its long-standing failure to meet EU limits for nitrogen dioxide (NOâ). Germany, France, Italy, Romania, and Hungary have also been referred to the court for breaching pollution levels. The European Environment Commissioner, Karmenu Vella, said the EU ""owed it to its citizens,"" to take legal action. The UK has promised a comprehensive air pollution package shortly. But Britain could face fines totalling millions of pounds, on-going until the problem is solved The government has already lost a series of battles in the UK courts on air pollution. Commissioner Vella said it was the Commission's responsibility to ensure people could breathe clean air. He said the member states being taken to court had been repeatedly warned to clean up pollution as soon as possible. ""We can't possibly wait any longer. It's high time to intensify efforts and end exceedances (of pollution levels)."" Environmentalists say by taking the UK to the European Court of Justice, the EU has demonstrated what will be lost after Brexit. The Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, previously promised that governance of the environment would not be diluted when the UK leaves the EU. But he revealed last week that theUK environmental watchdog he proposes after Brexitwould not have the automatic power to take the government to court. The Green MEP Keith Taylor welcomed the EC's decision. He said: ""The Commission is being forced to take legal action against the UK because the government remains steadfastly apathetic in the face of a public health crisis that is linked to the deaths of 50,000 British citizens every year."" Diesel cars are one of the key reasons behind the UK's air pollution problems ""Post-Brexit, this is exactly the kind of scrutiny and oversight the Tories plan to escape. Proposals for a so-called environment watchdog that is nothing but a lame lapdog without the legal teeth to take the government to court put this reality in sharp relief. ""This is particularly concerning as legal action by the Commission and environmental lawyers, on the basis of EU law, has been the only way to force the UK government to take any action on air pollution at all."" Margherita Tolotto from the green group European Environment Bureau said: ""European air quality laws are being broken on a continental scale. ""Everyone in Europe has the same right to clean air, and when national governments fail to deliver EU protections, it's right that the European Commission steps in to protect us from the air we breathe. ""Today's announcement should surprise no-one. The countries being sent to court have had too many final warnings."" As the announcement was being made, lawyers for Paris, Madrid and Brussels were in front of the European Court of Justice asking that the three cities be allowed to challenge vehicle emissions regulations set by the European Commissions and agreed by national governments. They are trying to annul the Commission regulation that allows diesel vehicles to exceed emissions limits during road tests, in the wake of the ""dieselgate"" scandal. A Defra spokesperson said: ""We continue to meet EU air quality limits for all pollutants apart from nitrogen dioxide, and data shows we are improving thanks to our efforts to bring levels of NOâ down. ""We will shortly build on our Â£3.5bn plan to tackle roadside emissions with a comprehensive Clean Air Strategy, setting out a wide range of actions to reduce pollution from all sources.""

Political prisoners 'revolt' in Venezuela,"Relatives gathered outside the headquarters of the secret service, where inmates have staged an uprising Relatives of political prisoners held in one of Venezuela's most notorious prisons say the inmates have staged an uprising. Inmates held at El Helicoide, the headquarters of Venezuela's secret service, say they took over part of its cell blocks. They say they did so after a political prisoner was beaten. More than 300 political prisoners are being held in Venezuela, according to pressure group Foro Penal. There is no official information about what happened at the Helicoide, the massive former shopping centre in central Caracas which houses Venezuela's secret service (Sebin). The prison is inside the headquarters of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service But people with close links to the political prisoners held there said the uprising had started after Gregory Sanabria was beaten up, allegedly by a non-political prisoner. Venezuela 'political prisoners' held hostage in jail riot Venezuela prison 'massacre' kills 37 Venezuela fire: Relatives want answers after 68 die The Sebin cells hold more than 300 inmates, with political prisoners and people accused of ordinary crimes locked up alongside each other. Many of the jailed opposition leaders have been accused of incitement to violence and vandalism, which the government argues are not politically motivated. Photos on social media show the swollen face of Mr Sanabria, a student held in El Helicoide pending trial ever since he took part in mass anti-government protest in 2014. Patricia Ceballos's husband Daniel is inside the jail According to Patricia Ceballos, whose husband Daniel is one of the political prisoners inside El Helicoide, the beating triggered a protest which was met with tear gas by the National Guard and riot police. Mr Ceballos, the former opposition mayor of the western city of San CristÃ³bal, said the inmates had taken control of parts of the jail. Venezuela opposition leader Daniel Ceballos sent to prison again ""We're demanding that all political prisoner be freed, all of us who have been held here, kidnapped for years without justice or due process,"" he told CNN via telephone from inside the jail. Joshua Holt, a US citizen held at the jail for two years pending trial, pleaded for help in a video message sent as the uprising was apparently going on. Mr Holt, a former Mormon missionary from Utah, travelled to Caracas in June 2016 to marry his Venezuelan girlfriend. While waiting for their US visas, Mr Holt and his wife were detained in her family's house in Caracas and accused of hiding weapons. Mr Holt said he was fearing for his life. ""They're outside, they're trying to break in, they're saying they're going to kill me,"" the 26-year-old said as shouts could be heard. In a second video he addressed his compatriots directly, asking them to help free him. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Betting machine stakes cut to Â£2,"This video can not be played What are fixed-odds betting terminals? The maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) will be reduced to Â£2 under new rules unveiled by the government. Currently, people can bet up to Â£100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock called the machines ""a very serious social blight"" that ""needs to be tackled"". But bookmakers have warned the cut could lead to thousands of outlets closing. FOBTs generate Â£1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry,according to the Gambling Commission,external, and taxes of Â£400m for the government. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said that in order to ""cover any negative impact on the public finances"" it would increase the Remote Gaming Duty, which is levied against online casino-type games such as blackjack. The current rate operators must pay is 15% compared with a 25% tax on FOBTs. The government will announce the rise in the Budget. William Hill, which generates just over half its retail revenues from FOBTs, described the Â£2 stake limit  as ""unprecedented"" and warned that 900 of its shops could become loss-making, potentially leading to job losses. It said its full-year operating profit could fall by between Â£70m and Â£100m. High stakes for fixed-odds betting machines Racing 'should not be funded on misery' A good bet? The fixed-odds controversy ""Twenty seconds and your wages are gone"" ""I lost Â£5,000 in 48 hours"" Mr Hancock said: ""Sometimes in politics you have the chance to really do something to help people and, in particular, this case to help some very vulnerable people - hundreds of thousands of people who lose thousands of pounds on these machines."" But Betfred's managing director Mark Stebbings claimed the government had ""played politics with people's jobs"" and the move was ""clearly not evidence based but a political decision"". ""This decision will result in unintended consequences including direct and indirect job losses, empty shops on the High Street, and a massive funding hit for the horseracing industry."" Sports Minister Tracey Crouch said: ""We respect and understand that this may have an impact on jobs in bookmakersâ¦ we are working closely with the industry [for them] to be able to grow and contribute to the economy."" The government said the stake limit would come into effect some time next year, but would not set an exact timetable. Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, told the BBC: ""The great tragedy of this is [that] for five years now pretty much everyone in Westminster, Whitehall and in the country has known that these machines have had a very detrimental effect in communities up and down the land."" by Amol Rajan, BBC media editor In taking the most drastic of the options available to them on FOBTs, the government has indicated that gambling is on a journey much like nicotine a generation ago. Many addictive behaviours chart the same course. First, they are commonly accepted, then victims speak out and a campaign is launched. Finally, new laws catch up with a shift in public sentiment. Industry figures argue that what is at stake is not only jobs and revenues for the Exchequer, but the principle that in a free society fully informed adults should be free to spend their money as they choose, so long as it doesn't harm others. Campaigners have successfully argued that the harm to communities and individuals is severe enough to warrant a major change. It's vital to remember that, while FOBTs understandably grab the headlines, this review also looks at the radical shift of the industry online. There many addicts who find there is no respite, and children with smartphones are potentially exposed. Tighter regulation of online gambling is the next battle campaigners intend to win. The government's consultation into gambling machines found consistently high rates of problem gamblers among players of FOBTs ""and a high proportion of those seeking treatment for gambling addiction identify these machines as their main form of gambling"". Anti-gambling campaigners have condemned the machines, saying they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems. This video can not be played Terry White lost up to Â£15,000 per day on fixed-odds betting terminals Matt Zarb-Cousin is now a spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling but was previously addicted to FOBTs. ""It's no exaggeration to call FOBTs the crack cocaine of gambling,"" he has told the BBC. ""If we had a gambling product classification, similar to that of drugs, FOBTs would be class A."" William Hill chief executive Philip Bowcock, said: ""The government has handed us a tough challenge today and it will take some time for the full impact to be understood."" GVC Holdings, which owns Ladbrokes, said it expected profit to be cut by about Â£160m in the first full year that the Â£2 limit is in force. However, Peter Jackson, chief executive at Paddy Power Betfair, welcomed the government intervention, saying his company had been concerned that FOBTs were damaging the reputation of the gambling industry. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA), which receives millions of pounds from bookmakers through a levy, said it would work closely with the government to respond the decision. FOBTs are not the only culprits when it comes to problem gambling. A survey conducted by social research agency NatCen found the top five activities with the highest proportions of problem gamblers were: Spread betting, where bets are placed on whether an outcome will be above or below an offered range (20.1%) Betting exchanges, where your bet on the outcome of an event is matched with someone with the opposing bet (16.2%) Playing poker in pubs or clubs (15.9%) Betting on events with a bookmaker, not online (15.5%) Playing machines in bookmakers, including FOBTs (11.5%) The most popular types of gambling in the country - National Lottery draws, other lotteries and scratchcards  - are associated with the lowest levels of problem gambling.

Pupils find spellchecker 'cheat' in testSchools are given advice after an online glitch allowed pupils to see the correct answer in a spelling test.,"Schools are to be given advice on how to disable a glitch that allows pupils sitting online spelling tests to right-click their mouse and find the answer. It follows the discovery by teachers that children familiar with traditional computer spellcheckers were simply applying it to the tests. The Scottish National Standardised Assessments were introduced to assess progress in four different age groups. The government said the issue had only affected a ""small number"" of questions. A spokesman said the issue was not with the Scottish National Standardised Assessments (SNSA) but with browser or device settings on some machines. Former head teacher George Gilchrist tweeted about the issue after it emerged primary seven pupils were using the online spellchecker on the test. He wrote: ""SNSA P7 spelling. Pupils asked to correct spelling of words. P7 pupils worked out if you right click on your answer, the computer tells you if it is correct! Brilliant! ð"" Allow Twitter content?

Introduced in 2017, the spelling test asks children to identify misspelt words. However, on some school computers the words were highlighted with a red line. Pupils who right-clicked on the words were then able to access the correct spelling. No league tables from new school assessments The web-based SNSA tool enables teachers to administer online literacy and numeracy tests for pupils in P1, P4, P7 and S3, which are marked and scored automatically. Education Secretary John Swinney said they would give teachers ""objective and comparable information"" to help them identify pupils' specific needs. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""A small number of questions in the P4, P7 and S3 writing assessment were affected by this issue.

Mothercare confirms 50 store closures,"This video can not be played Mothers at this shopping centre say other stores are better at catering for young children Mothercare has confirmed it is closing 50 stores as part of a rescue plan, a move that will put 800 jobs at risk. The baby products retailer said it was in a ""perilous"" financial position. The store closures will leave it with 78 outlets in the UK by 2020. The retailer has already nearly halved its store numbers over the past five years. It had intended have 92 outlets by 2023, but has now accelerated its closure plans and will have just 73 by that year. What's gone wrong at Mothercare? Five things to do with empty retail stores Six shops defying the High Street crisis The company plunged to a Â£72.8m loss in its most recent financial year, as it took hefty charges to pay for closing stores and reorganising the business. Mothercare saw falling numbers of shoppers in the second half of the financial year and had to discount to try to stimulate sales. However, over the year as a whole, like-for-like sales fell 1.3%. by Emma Simpson, business correspondent You just have to speak to shoppers to understand what's gone wrong at Mothercare. The mums I met yesterday bought their baby stuff in the likes of Primark and the supermarkets. Mothercare, they told me, was too pricey. Truth is, this chain has been struggling for a long time. Its UK business hasn't made a profit since 2012. It's yet another High Street chain that hasn't kept up with changing shopping habits and increasing competition. The tough conditions on the high street have finally brought things to a head. Will this restructuring be enough to secure long term survival? The shenanigans over its management changes don't exactly instil confidence and raise questions about the leadership of a business which needs a compete reboot. The plan to close stores and cut rents at 21 of its stores is being carried out through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). The CVA, as is standard, will need the support of its creditors. One of these, the Pension Protection Fund, has already said it will vote in favour. The company also said it would reappoint the chief executive who left in April following poor Christmas trading and a profits warning. Mark Newton-Jones was sacked by the then chairman Alan Parker - who has himself subsequently stepped down. Former Tesco executive David Wood who had taken on the chief executive role and is just over a month into the job, will become group managing director. In a statement, Mothercare said:,external""Recent financial performance, impacted in particular by a large number of legacy loss making stores within the UK estate, has resulted in a perilous financial condition for the group."" As part of its restructuring, Mothercare has also arranged a refinancing package worth up to Â£113.5m, which includes Â£28m raised through issuing new shares, and an extension of its existing debt arrangements. Mothercare chairman Clive Whiley said: ""These measures provide a solid platform from which to reposition the group and begin to focus on growth, both in the UK and internationally."" CVAs have become widespread this year as a sheaf of major High Street names have had to undergo deep changes in the way they operate. Earlier this year, toy store chain Toys R Us collapsed into administration, as did electronics retailer Maplin. Carpetright has entered into a CVA and announced store closures, as has fashion chain New Look. High Street crisis forces hundreds of store closures Six things behind the High Street crisis A number of reasons have been cited for failures on the High Street, including a squeeze on consumers' income, the growth of online shopping and the rising costs of staff, rents and business rates. Richard Hyman, retail adviser and consultant, told the BBC's Today programme that Mothercare's problems went back years. ""I think Mothercare has not really delivered on the promise implicit in the name, in trading terms, for generations really,"" he said. ""Nothing can sum it up quite as well as the fact you can't get a pram round the store."" He added that this has become more of an issue as the trading climate is now ""so much more unforgiving"".

Government will consult on cladding ban,"There will be a consultation on banning inflammable cladding on high-rise buildings, the government says, despite a review into the Grenfell tragedy not recommending such a move. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire announced the consultation ""having listened carefully"" to concerns. Earlier, a government-commissioned building regulations review stopped short of proposing a ban - a move criticised by some Grenfell survivors. Labour MPs called for an immediate ban. Architects, building firms and Grenfell survivors had backed laws forbidding the use of combustible materials in tower blocks. Inflammable cladding is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in west London's Grenfell Tower last June. A total of 72 people died as a result of the blaze, the judge-led inquiry has said. This includes Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, who died in January. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor. Will the building regulations review work? A subsequent survey identifiedhundreds of other buildings where cladding failed safety tests. The Royal Institute of British Architects called for a ban on inflammable cladding, as well as a requirement for sprinklers to be fitted, and a second means of escape for high-rise residential buildings. Announcing the consultation, Mr Brokenshire said: ""We must create a culture that truly puts people and their safety first, that inspires confidence and, yes, rebuilds public trust."" He said the building regulations review, and the changes that will come from it, were ""important first steps, helping us ensure that when we say 'never again', we mean it"". Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey responded, saying: ""Don't consult on it, do it."" Shahin Sadafi, chairman of Grenfell United, which represents survivors and the bereaved, said he was ""disappointed"" there was no immediate ban. Earlier, a government-commissioned independent report into building regulations called for a ""radical rethink"" of the safety system, but stopped short of recommending an outright ban on inflammable cladding. This video can not be played Dame Judith Hackitt tells Today that the building regulation system is broken The report's author, Dame Judith Hackitt, said indifference and ignorance had led to cost being prioritised over safety and called  for regulators to ""come together"" to ensure building safety. She also recommended incentives for the right behaviour and tougher penalties for those who breach the rules. Appearing before the Housing, Communities and Local Government select committee, Dame Judith said she supported Mr Brokenshire's announcement and it was ""complementary"" to her review, ""but on its own it will be insufficient"". ""Simply banning something from happening is no guarantee of compliance,"" she said. ""If people attach too much reliance upon banning activities and particular materials as being a solution to this problem it will create a false sense of security."" She told MPs that she had not known Mr Brokenshire had planned to announce a consultation. The prime minister's spokesman said the current regulatory system was not ""fit for purpose"" and the government was committed to making the necessary changes. Grenfell United and opposition MPs criticised the review's recommendations. Mr Sadafi said his group was ""disappointed and saddened that she (Dame Judith) she didn't listen to us and she didn't listen to other experts"". This video can not be played Diane Abbott: ""The 71 people who died were not a 'technical issue' and you need to step up."" Shadow housing minister Sarah Jones told the BBC that the report was a ""huge wasted opportunity"" and that the recommendations did not go far enough. Labour MP and Grenfell campaigner David Lammy said it was ""unfathomable"" that the review had not recommended a ban on combustible materials. Survivors in emergency housing 12 months on Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell: Inside the 21st floor The independent review,externallooked into regulations around the design, construction and management of buildings in relation to fire safety. The final 156-page report found that: Roles and responsibilities for building safety are unclear Regulations and guidance are ""ambiguous and inconsistent"" and are ""misunderstood and misinterpreted"" There is ignorance about the rules governing the industry The process that drives compliance with the regulations are ""weak and complex"" Competence (of people in the system) is ""patchy"" The process for testing and certifying products is ""disjointed, confusing, unhelpful and lacking any sort of transparency"" Product testing and marketing is ""opaque and insufficient"" Residents' voices go unheard Dame Judith - a senior engineer who used to chair the Health and Safety Executive - said these issues ""have helped to create a cultural issue across the sector, which can be described as a 'race to the bottom', caused either through indifference, or because the system does not facilitate good practice"". Her appointment to lead the reviewhad been met with some criticismdue to her former role as director of the Energy Saving Trust. The organisation promotes insulation containing a foam known as polyisocyanurate (PIR), blamed for fuelling the fire at Grenfell.

"Trump discloses 'Stormy Daniels' paymentAn ethics watchdog says Mr Trump should have revealed the payment, which he earlier denied, sooner.10h10 hours agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played Was Trump's Stormy Daniels payment legal? US President Donald Trump has officially disclosed his reimbursement to his lawyer, who paid a porn star to hush up her claims of an affair. The Office of Government Ethics found on Wednesday that Mr Trump ought to have revealed the payment in his previous financial disclosure. The filing shows he paid Michael Cohen between $100,001 (Â£75,000) and $250,000 for expenses incurred in 2016. Mr Trump previously denied knowing of the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. The conflicting statements in the Stormy Daniels saga The president and the porn star: Why this matters The big question at heart of Stormy Daniels saga This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: ""I was threatened"" The White House stated in a footnote to the filing that it was listing the payment ""in the interest of transparency"", and contended it did not have to make the disclosure. However, the head of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE)wrote in a letter,externalthat ""the payment made by Mr Cohen is required to be reported"" in the liabilities section of the statement. In his letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the OGE acting director said: ""You may find the disclosure relevant to any inquiry you may be pursuing."" The deputy attorney general is overseeing the Department of Justice investigation into whether Trump aides colluded with alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. The Stormy Daniels payment is a potential legal problem for the president because it could be seen as an illegal campaign contribution. Mr Cohen, whose records relating to the settlement were seized in an FBI raid last month, is now reportedly under criminal investigation. Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges that she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada, in 2006. Mr Trump's lawyer said his client ""vehemently denies"" the claim. If the actress's account is true, the tryst would have happened just a few months after Melania Trump gave birth to her son, Barron, whose father is Mr Trump. Stormy Daniels says she had sex with Mr Trump at a Lake Tahoe hotel in 2006 In April, Mr Trump said he was unaware Mr Cohen had paid Ms Daniels just before the 2016 election. Mr Trump's payment to Mr Cohen was first confirmed a fortnight ago by Rudy Giuliani, another of the president's attorneys, in a television interview. Mr Giuliani said the transaction was to keep Ms Daniels quiet about her ""false and extortionist accusation"" that she had sex with Mr Trump, suggesting her claim could have damaged his candidacy. Later that week, the president said the newly hired Mr Giuliani needed time to ""get his facts straight"". Also on Wednesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee backed up the American intelligence community's findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 US election to help Mr Trump. The panel's assessment contradictsa conclusion in March by the House Intelligence Committeerejecting allegations that the Kremlin had aimed to boost the Republican candidate's chances. Mr Trump earned $100,000-$1m in royalties from The Art of the Deal in 2017 The disclosure,externalshows millions in 2017 income from rents, licences, book and television royalties, company shares, hotel management fees and golf courses, with interests from India to Dubai. What happened to worries about Trump's business? His Washington hotel in a former Post Office building brought in more than $40m in 2017, its first full year in operation. His golf courses, including the president's Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, did not appear to see major gains, despite frequent visits from the president. Mar-a-Lago contributed $25m in income, compared with about $37m on the previous report. The president reported royalties from his 1987 book The Art of the Deal in the same $100,000-$1m range as he did last year - and sales for some of his lesser titles picked up. Many of his shareholdings are in mutual and index funds, rather than the cross-section of American companies he once owned. What else did we learn from the disclosure?

Woman cleared over acid death,"This video can not be played Acid attack: Mark van Dongen ex-partner cleared of murder A woman has been cleared of murdering her former partner in an acid attack which led him to end his life. Berlinah Wallace, 48, hurled the corrosive fluid at Dutch engineer Mark van Dongen in Bristol in 2015. Fifteen months later he ended his life by euthanasia in a Belgian hospital. He was paralysed from the neck down and had lost a leg, ear and eye. At Bristol Crown Court, Wallace was found guilty of throwing a corrosive substance with intent. 'I realised his skin was melting' The fashion student, originally from South Africa, was cleared by the jury of both murder and manslaughter. During the three-week trial Wallace told the jury Mr van Dongen, 29, had put the acid in a glass for her to drink. The pair had met five years earlier on a dating website for people with HIV, as both had the condition. This video can not be played Audio clips of Berlinah Wallace's police interview Mr van Dongen had returned to her flat in Ladysmith Road, Westbury Park, on the night of 22 September 2015 to reiterate that their turbulent relationship was over but decided to stay the night. The trial heard Wallace threw a glass of acid over him as he lay in his boxer shorts on their bed, and shouted: ""If I can't have you no-one will."" Screaming in agony, he staggered out on to the street where he was found by alarmed neighbours who dialled 999. The bed where Mark van Dongen was lying when Wallace threw the acid at him Harrowing recordings of his suffering as they attempted to help him were played to the court during the trial. Meanwhile, instead of calling an ambulance, Wallace sat on the sofa in her flat and called another ex-boyfriend. She will be sentenced on Wednesday. This video can not be played Mark van Dongen's family talk about the impact of an acid attack Speaking through an interpreter outside court, Mark's father Cornelius van Dongen described his son as his ""best friend"" and ""a loving brother"" who had made the family proud with the good results he achieved as a civil engineer. ""Mark was so brave when confronted with the hellish pain and disabilities inflicted on him but eventually it all became too much for him to bear,"" he said. ""He died in dignity and will live on in the hearts of his family and friends."" He said the court process had been ""a difficult and emotional experience"". Mr van Dongen added: ""I am very disappointed in the outcome of this trial. There are only losers in this case. I hope that Mark can now rest in peace."" Speaking outside Bristol Crown Court, Cornelius van Dongen said there were ""only losers in this case"" Det Insp Paul Catton, who led the investigation for Avon and Somerset Police, said the attack was borne out of jealousy, resulting in Mr van Dongen suffering ""the most inconceivable pain imaginable"". ""He went from being a healthy young man with his whole life ahead of him to having extensive and repeated surgery on the most hideous injuries just to keep him alive. ""In the end, his pain was so devastating, so catastrophic, he sought the assistance of doctors to help him die."" The force has announced a Domestic Homicide Review will take place to examine the circumstances which led up to Mr van Dongen's death. Wallace said she thought the substance she threw was water Prosecutor Adam Vaitilingam acknowledged this was not a typical murder case but said it needed to be tried because Mr van Dongen's suffering had led him to end his own life. Euthanasia is legal in Belgium, where his family live. Mr Vaitilingam said: ""It was exactly why she did it, to scar him for life, to make him less of a man and unable to have a relationship with another woman. ""It's the first time a jury has had to decide if an attacker is guilty of the murder where the victim has chosen to end his own life by euthanasia because of the terrible condition he was left in by the attack. ""Murder is made out if the attacker intended to kill them or cause them really serious harm. ""The doctors in Belgium granted euthanasia because of his unbearable physical and psychological suffering."" What was the basis of bringing a murder charge in this extraordinary case? The answer lies in the way the law of murder applies the concept of causation. If an accused person attacks a victim, intending to kill or cause serious harm, their actions alone may not result in death. However, they can be convicted of murder if their acts can fairly be said to have made a ""significant"" contribution to the victim's death. For example if someone stabs a person in a shop and they run across the road to escape, but are hit and killed by an oncoming car, the attacker can be found guilty of murder. The intentional stabbing is a ""significant"" cause of death even though it is the car driver that ends the victim's life. If the jury had found Berlinah Wallace had thrown the acid intending to kill or seriously harm Mark Van Dongen, and that her act was a significant cause of his death, it would have been open to them to find her guilty of murder. Clearly they did not find this to be the case. 'I realised his skin was melting' Acid victim's agony heard in 999 call.

Trump discloses 'Stormy Daniels' payment,"This video can not be played Was Trump's Stormy Daniels payment legal? US President Donald Trump has officially disclosed his reimbursement to his lawyer, who paid a porn star to hush up her claims of an affair. The Office of Government Ethics found on Wednesday that Mr Trump ought to have revealed the payment in his previous financial disclosure. The filing shows he paid Michael Cohen between $100,001 (Â£75,000) and $250,000 for expenses incurred in 2016. Mr Trump previously denied knowing of the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.

The deputy attorney general is overseeing the Department of Justice investigation into whether Trump aides colluded with alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. The Stormy Daniels payment is a potential legal problem for the president because it could be seen as an illegal campaign contribution.

Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges that she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada, in 2006.

Stormy Daniels says she had sex with Mr Trump at a Lake Tahoe hotel in 2006 In April, Mr Trump said he was unaware Mr Cohen had paid Ms Daniels just before the 2016 election. Mr Trump's payment to Mr Cohen was first confirmed a fortnight ago by Rudy Giuliani, another of the president's attorneys, in a television interview.

Rural police 'could routinely carry guns',"Armed police are on patrol in Windsor ahead of the Royal Wedding Front-line officers in remote, rural communities could be routinely armed in order to deal with terror threats, police chiefs have said. The move is being considered by the National Police Chiefs' Council because of a lack of specialist counter-terrorist firearms officers. It comes after a drive to recruit these officers in England and Wales fell short by about 100. Police said arming officers in remote areas would be a last resort. Counter-terrorist specialist firearms officers (CTSFOs) are trained with special forces to deal with a raft of situations, including hostage rescues and terror attacks. Plans were put in place to bolster the UK's capacity for armed responses in the wake of the Paris terror attacks in 2015, in which 130 people died. Over the past two years, the Home Office has funded an extra 874 armed officers in England and Wales - bringing the total to more than 6,400 in April 2017. But on a practical level, police chiefs have estimated that in rural communities, such as Devon and Cornwall, a firearms unit could be between 30-70 miles away in the event of a major incident. By Danny Shaw, BBC News home affairs correspondent Two years ago, police warned that ""unarmed and vulnerable""officers in rural communities would be ""sitting ducks"" in the event of a terror attack. Since then, huge investment and effort has gone into improving armed police capacity and capability, as the latest announcement shows - but gaps remain. Armed response vehicles (ARVs), which are intended to be first on the scene of a firearms incident, are an expensive asset, with 13 officers required to double-crew a vehicle 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That's why police chiefs are looking at alternatives to deploying ARVs in areas where there's a low risk of a terror attack, such as allowing front-line officers to carry guns. It goes against the grain of British policing for officers to be routinely armed, but there'sincreasing support for it among those polled in a Federation surveyand it remains firmly on the table as an option. Simon Chesterman, National Police Chiefs' Council lead for armed policing, said: ""Of course there are communities within England and Wales where an attack is highly unlikely. ""But ultimately, if something does happen, we have got to be able to provide an armed response."" Mr Chesterman said the training and demands of being a CTSFO meant there was a high turnover rate, and some officers were put off by the level of scrutiny that police face when police open fire in the line of duty. He explained that police chiefs had conducted ""many layers of the analysis... to understand where is best to place these officers"". There remains a shortfall in the number of counter-terrorist marksmen ""We can't put an armed police officer on every street corner everywhere across the whole of the United Kingdom, so what we've had to do is analyse the threat."" He said discussions were ongoing in a ""handful"" of police forces over how to improve response times - and whether some form of routine arming might be appropriate. Mr Chesterman was clear that arming rural police forces ""does not need to happen at the moment"". ""This is not, if you like, a favoured option,"" he told the BBC's Danny Shaw. ""But I can't rule it out at this stage, in terms of making sure that all communities get the right level of protection from armed police."" Around 90% of British police officers are currently unarmed. Any decision on arming officers is a matter for the chief constable of each of the 43 local forces covering England and Wales, as well as the national British Transport Police.

Pupils find spellchecker 'cheat' in test,"Schools are to be given advice on how to disable a glitch that allows pupils sitting online spelling tests to right-click their mouse and find the answer. It follows the discovery by teachers that children familiar with traditional computer spellcheckers were simply applying it to the tests. The Scottish National Standardised Assessments were introduced to assess progress in four different age groups. The government said the issue had only affected a ""small number"" of questions. A spokesman said the issue was not with the Scottish National Standardised Assessments (SNSA) but with browser or device settings on some machines. Former head teacher George Gilchrist tweeted about the issue after it emerged primary seven pupils were using the online spellchecker on the test. He wrote: ""SNSA P7 spelling. Pupils asked to correct spelling of words. P7 pupils worked out if you right click on your answer, the computer tells you if it is correct! Brilliant! ð"" Allow Twitter content?

Introduced in 2017, the spelling test asks children to identify misspelt words. However, on some school computers the words were highlighted with a red line. Pupils who right-clicked on the words were then able to access the correct spelling. No league tables from new school assessments The web-based SNSA tool enables teachers to administer online literacy and numeracy tests for pupils in P1, P4, P7 and S3, which are marked and scored automatically. Education Secretary John Swinney said they would give teachers ""objective and comparable information"" to help them identify pupils' specific needs. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""A small number of questions in the P4, P7 and S3 writing assessment were affected by this issue.

US man killed by exploding vape pen,"Two pieces of the vape pen were in Tallmadge D'Elia's cranium A US man died when a vape pen blew up and projected fragments into his skull, a post-mortem examination has found. Tallmadge D'Elia also suffered burns over 80% of his body in a fire on 5 May caused by the exploding e-cigarette, according to forensic officials. The 38-year-old's body was discovered by firefighters in the burning bedroom of his family home in the beach resort of St Petersburg, Florida. It is believed to be the first US death from a vape pen explosion. The television producer's death has been ruled an accident. Regular vapers falling, suggests US study The Pinellas-Pasco Medical Examiner said the official cause of death was ""projectile wound of head"",external, reports the Tampa Bay Times. Two pieces of the vape pen were found in his cranium, according to the autopsy. This video can not be played Could vaping help smokers stub out cigarettes for good? The report said emergency crews encountered ""extensive"" fire damage to the bedroom where the body was found, but minimal smoke. The electronic cigarette was manufactured by Smok-E Mountain, said the medical examiner. Christopher D'Elia, the dead man's father, told ABC Action News it was a ""terrible shock"",external. ""Anybody who has lost a son doesn't want anybody else to lose a child to something like this,"" he said. It's not entirely clear and is not written in the post-mortem examination report. The vape pen that Mr D'Elia was using was a so-called mechanical mod, meaning it drew power directly from the battery and did not regulate the voltage in the same way as other e-cigarettes. The president of the American Vaping Association told the New York Times that mostother e-cigarettes have more safety features than mechanical mods,external. Such safety features can include computer chips. A representative ofthe manufacturer, Smok-E Mountain, blamed the device's battery for the explosion,externalwhen speaking to ABC Action News. They also said it might have been down to the mouthpiece. Vape pens use lithium-ion batteries, favoured in smartphones and other portable electronic devices because they can provide high amounts of electricity using little space. They are used throughout the world with few incidents, but in 2016 Samsung halted sales of the Galaxy Note 7 phone because some were catching fire when the batteries short-circuited. Why do lithium batteries explode? According to the US Fire Administration,between 2009-16 there were 195 separate incidents of explosions and fires involving an e-cigarette,external, resulting in 133 acute injuries, 38 of them severe. In 2015, an e-cigarette exploded in the face of a 29-year-old Colorado man, breaking his neck and shattering his teeth. A fire in January this year at Denver International Airport was blamed on a vape pen's lithium-ion battery. For safety, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US recommends: using vapes with safety features, like protection against overcharging keeping your vape covered and away from loose coins and batteries using only the approved charger that came with the vape pen to charge it replacing batteries if they get damaged or wet not charging your vape overnight Why do lithium batteries explode?

Who else could walk Meghan Markle down the aisle?,"It's one of the last things a bride needs on the week of her wedding: you find out your dadwon't be able to attend. Meghan Markle has confirmed that her father Thomas won't make her and Prince Harry's big day on Saturday. He's in Mexico recovering from heart surgery. Meghan said in statement: ""I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health"". Thomas was due to walk Meghan down the aisle. So who could do the job in his place? Meghan Markle and her mum Doria Ragland at the Invcitus Games 2017 The bride's mum Doria Ragland will be staying with her daughter atCliveden House Hotelthe night before the wedding and is accompanying her daughter to the church on the morning of Saturday 19 May. Could she go one step further and walk her down the aisle? It's an option that many brides-to-be are opting for out of choice. Traditionally, a father walking his daughter down the aisle is a symbol of her being ""given away"" to her future husband and some say the idea implies that the bride is her dad's property. The tradition comes from a time when marriage was as much a financial contract between two families as a symbol of commitment and love between two people, and although that's rarely the case now, some women are opting to reject the association.

Doria is close to Harry and Meghan - Prince Harry said she was ""amazing"" during a BBC interview on the occasion of their engagement - and Meghan has spoken fondly of their close bond during previous interviews. Meghan's mum also joined the couple for the Invictus Games closing ceremony in September 2017. Although it would be a break from tradition, a mum has walked the bride down the aisle at a royal wedding before - and not just any mum. Queen Victoria fulfilled the traditionally male role for two of her daughters - Princess Helena in 1866 and Princess Beatrice in 1885 - following the death of her husband Prince Albert. And if Britain's self-proclaimed etiquette expert and former butler to Prince Charles thinks it's okay, then it's probably an option worth considering. Allow Twitter content?

Another way for brides to break from tradition is to walk down the aisle with a man who isn't their father - namely, their future husband. Some couples see it as their way of showing a united front from the outset and a way to sidestep any potentially awkward symbolism. Meghan Markle has previously referred to her and her future husband as a ""team"" and walking down the aisle together could be a further declaration of their commitment to presenting a united front.

Wendell Pierce with Will Smith and Laurence Fishburne in 2015 Meghan Markle has already walked down the aisle this year -on our television screens,external. In the season seven finale of American TV show Suits, Meghan's character Rachel Zane squeezed in a wedding at short-notice to her long-term boyfriend Mike Ross before the couple moved to Seattle. Rachel's father Robert Zane walked her down the aisle, so actor Wendell Pierce has had some practice. Robert Zane has been a key figure in Suits. As a powerful lawyer at one of New York's biggest law firms, Rachel made every effort to carve out her own role outside of his shadow. However in later series, the pair worked together and he walked her down the aisle for her on-screen wedding. It's unknown whether Wendell is among the Suits stars invited to the wedding. But if he's already in London, we're sure he could be persuaded to stand in at short notice. A cardboard cutout of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Meghan Markle'slove for her dogsis well documented and it's a passion she shares with her grandmother-in-law to be - the Queen. Could she decide to take her beagle rescue dog Guy for a walk down the aisle on Saturday? Including dogs in your wedding day is part of a wider trend,according to Inside Weddings,external, and photos that Meghan previously posted online show Guy in a knitted union flag jumper, so he might be persuaded to wear a themed outfit and be on his best behaviour. Let's face it, weddings are supposed to be the happiest day of the bride and groom's lives, but they are often stressful affairs, filled with anxiety about everything from wilting flowers to drunken relatives. So why doesn't Meghan remove another element of stress - and scrutiny - and just walk down the aisle herself?

'Why I walked myself down the aisle',"Zoe Carter-Mackay walked herself down the aisle when she married James Dumbell Kensington Palace described the news thatMeghan Markle's father may not walk her down the aisleas a ""deeply personal moment"" for the actress. But while Ms Markle may not have opted for this break with tradition, an increasing number of women are choosing not to be ""given away"" by their parents. Zoe Carter-Mackay, who walked herself down the aisle, says that before getting married she and her husband-to-be asked themselves which traditions ""felt right"" and which felt ""weird"". ""That was the starting point for thinking whether - as a 35-year-old - I should be given away by my dad to another man,"" she says. ""My parents divorced when I was 14 - I have a great relationship with my dad but I also have four parents now, as both remarried. ""I think a lot of women who have divorced parents think whether their mum or their brother might walk them down the aisle. ""For me it just felt right that I would walk myself - I wasn't being given away. When I came to end of the aisle I gave my dad a kiss, which was acknowledging my respect for him."" Royal wedding: Meghan's father may not attend ceremony 'I walked my heart donor's daughter down the aisle' A recent YouGov poll showed that 69% of Britons remain in favour of fathers walking their daughters down the aisle - though that figure is down from 82% in 2014. Sarah George, of Bride magazine, argues the principles behind the tradition are ""outdated and old fashioned"". ""Nowadays, we see more variations,"" she says, ""with some opting to go it alone or with a pet by their side, walking arm-in-arm with their mother or a sibling, or most unconventionally of all - arriving at the altar with their husband- or wife-to-be."" Fathers traditionally walked their daughters down the aisle as a symbolic gesture stemming from the idea that daughters were considered the property of their fathers. Daughters were exchanged for a dowry or bride price, after which they became the property and financial responsibility of their husband. In England, the idea that women were property began to be eroded in the 14th Century following a series of laws introduced by King Richard II establishing both men and women's individual employment rights. The Married Women's Property Act 1882 formally ended the concept by enshrining in law married women's ability to independently own and control property in the UK. Dr Kathleen Puech was accompanied down the aisle by both parents when she married her husband 20 years ago - and feels it is time to ""move past the point when a woman is given by one man to another man"". ""I don't agree with the system of a man giving away a woman to another man,"" she says. ""It's fundamentally wrong and we need to change it. ""Women need to realise it is wrong and we need to stand up for ourselves. ""Ideally, I think a woman should give herself away. She's making this step, not her parents, but if you want to keep a bit of tradition you can have both parents."" This video can not be played Arthur Thomas describes feelings after walking his heart donor's daughter down the aisle The change in attitudes towards weddings is not limited to ceremony entrances, either. Multiple best men and maid of honour speeches are not uncommon while many women are opting to keep their own names. ""I actually grew up in India,"" says Dr Puech. ""Lots of my Indian friends haven't changed their names and yet all of my female British and Irish friends have - it's odd, as India is meant to be far less progressive."" ""It's not even just weddings,"" adds Ms Carter-Mackay. ""I think there's a lot of questioning the way things have always been.  I think a lot of them are based around stereotypes and gender roles. ""I don't think there's anything wrong with traditions but I'm a mix of traditional and modern and it's fine to cherry-pick what feels right to you.""

How to watch the events,"So you weren't invited. Don't despair. Royal weddings are a global phenomenon. And hundreds of millions of people are expected to witness Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, whether on television or online, or by listening to proceedings on the radio. The streets of Windsor, Berkshire, will also be lined with thousands of well-wishers hoping to catch a glimpse of the happy couple in person. So whether you're watching from your sofa, a community street party or a far-flung location, here's how to ensure the perfect view. Royal wedding: All you need to know Remember the previous royal weddings Nice day for a royal white wedding? A non-Brits guide to the royal wedding All the main UK broadcasters are devoting much of Saturday to the occasion. While the ceremony doesn't begin until 12:00 BST, there will be several hours of commentary beforehand - and that's even before the guests start to arrive. Special programmes begin onBBC Oneand the BBC News Channel and onSky,external(on Sky News and Sky One), starting at 09:00 BST.  The full coverage onITV,externalkicks off at 09:25. The coverage will be streamed live on theBBC News websiteor onBBC iPlayer. It is worth noting that cameras inside the chapel will provide the same pictures to all the networks, so once the ceremony starts, the footage will be identical across the channels, although they will keep their separate commentaries. The BBC haswaived the TV licence fee, meaning street parties and other special eventscan screen the wedding livewithout buying a licence. The wedding will also be covered on the BBC NewsFacebook page,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,externalaccounts throughout the day. On radio, Claire Balding will host live commentary from Windsor Castle onBBC Radio 4from 11:30 BST andRadio 5 livefrom 10:00 BST. Outside the UK, BBC America, BBC Canada and BBC World News will be broadcasting coverage. Or you can tune in on BBC World Service radio. In Windsor, viewing areas will be created along the procession route. There will be live entertainment in the town centre, which will be decorated with bunting and banners. Big screens showing live footage of the wedding will be shown on the Long Walk and in Alexandra Gardens in Windsor. At 13:00 BST, the newlyweds will travel through the town in the Ascot Landau carriage, which is used in official and ceremonial state events. The carriage will leave Castle Hill, travel through Windsor and then proceed up the Long Walk, all the way back to St George's Hall by Windsor Castle. Rail bosses advise that trains will be ""extremely busy"". Queuing systems will be introduced at several stations - most likely London Waterloo, Slough, Staines and the two stations in Windsor - to avoid overcrowding on platforms. Services between Windsor and Slough will run every 20 minutes, with trains increased from two carriages to four - the maximum that can operate on the local line. South Western Railway will double its direct Windsor services from London Waterloo to four per hour and use 10-carriage trains. Make sure you get there early, though - Thames Valley Police may order trains not to stop at Windsor if visitor numbers become a safety issue, and the wedding route could be closed off to latecomers. Passengers are also being asked to keep baggage to a minimum as security checks on excess luggage could delay journeys. People planning to travel by car are being warned by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead tobook parking in advance,,externalas spaces are limited. Motorists should also be aware ofroad closures,externalalong the procession route which started at 22:00 BST on Friday.

Ebola outbreak spreads to DR Congo city,"Twenty-three people are known to have died The Ebola outbreak in DR Congo has spread from the countryside into a city, prompting fears that the disease will be increasingly hard to control. Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga confirmed a case in Mbandaka, a city of a million about 130km (80 miles) from where the first cases were confirmed. The city is a major transportation hub with routes to the capital Kinshasa. At least 44 people are thought to have been infected with ebola and 23 deaths are being investigated. Ebola is a serious infectious illness that causes internal bleeding and often proves fatal. It can spread rapidly through contact with small amounts of bodily fluid and its early flu-like symptoms are not always obvious. Why Ebola keeps coming back Why Ebola is so dangerous How not to catch Ebola The World Health Organization (WHO) has called an emergency meeting of experts to talk about the risk that Ebola might spread beyond DR Congo. It will meet on Friday to decide whether to declare an international public health emergency which would trigger a larger global response, like in the case of the 2014-16 Western African Ebola outbreak and the 2016 Zika virus in Latin America. The 2014-16 West Africa outbreak, which killed 11,300 people, was particularly deadly because it spread to the capital cities of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Senior WHO official Peter Salama said the spread to Mbandaka meant there was the potential for an ""explosive increase"" in cases. ""This is a major development in the outbreak,"" he told the BBC. ""We have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola. The potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there."" Mr Salama, the WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said Mbandaka's location on the Congo river, widely used for transportation, raised the prospect of Ebola spreading to surrounding countries such as Congo-Brazzaville and the Central African Republic as well as downstream to Kinshasa, a city of 10 million people. ""This puts a whole different lens on this outbreak and gives us increased urgency to move very quickly into Mbandaka to stop this new first sign of transmission,"" he said. Mapping the West Africa Ebola outbreak So far only three of the 44 cases have been confirmed as Ebola and involve people who are still alive, the WHO says. There are a further 20 probable cases and 21 suspected cases. The cases were recorded in three health zones of Congo's Equateur province. Isolation and rudimentary Ebola case management facilities had been set up in Mbandaka to cope with cases, Mr Salama said. The disease may have been brought there, he said, by two or three people who had attended the funeral of an Ebola victim in Bikoro to the south of Mbandaka before travelling to the city. On Wednesday more than 4,000 doses of an experimental vaccine sent by the WHO arrived in Kinshasa with another batch expected soon. These would be given as a priority to people in Mbandaka who had been in contact with those suspected of carrying the Ebola virus before people in any other affected area, in order to stop Ebola spreading in the urban region and beyond, Mr Salama said. This video can not be played Watch this short video explaining how the virus attacks human cells The vaccine from pharmaceutical firm Merck is unlicensed but was effective in limited trials during the West Africa Ebola Outbreak. It needs to be stored at a temperature of between -60 and -80 C. Electricity supplies in Congo are unreliable. Health workers had identified 430 people who may have had contact with the disease and were working to trace more than 4,000 contacts of Ebola patients, who had spread across north-west DR Congo, the WHO said. Many of these people were in areas only reachable by motorbike, Mr Salama said. By Jacques Matand', BBC Afrique Mbandaka is a poor city on the banks of the River Congo. Those of its residents who can afford to pay for electricity only get it for three to four hours a day, otherwise people use generators or solar panels. The city has two hospitals, which have received money for renovations. But even they do not have a regular electricity supply and have to rely on generators. For water, Mbandaka's residents use wells or the river. Many people also use the river as a toilet, meaning there is a high risk of diseases, not just Ebola, spreading. Passenger boats used to operate along the river to Kinshasa but these are no longer working. However, traders still use wooden canoes to reach the capital to buy and sell their goods - and this is how it is feared Ebola could spread. The WHO said it was not recommending any trade or travel restrictions either within DR Congo, for example between Mbandaka and Kinshasa, or internationally. But Mr Salama said that 13 countries in the region were boosting border screening measures and said DR Congo itself was increasing exit screening measures. ""The good news is that the DR Congo population is very used to Ebola outbreaks,"" he added. ""They know to protect themselves by avoiding mass gatherings and mass funerals. They know as well that traditional healers can amplify the outbreak."" An experimental vaccine has arrived in the country Observers described the international response so far as ""remarkable and very rapid"". ""The logistic issues... will also be considerable on the ground to identify who should be vaccinated and to get out in this vast and very difficult area and provide vaccination in an appropriate way,"" New York-based Ebola expert Dr Laurie Garrett told the BBC. ""It's never been done before in the midst of an exploding outbreak so we'll watch it very closely."" There have been three outbreaks in DR Congo since the 2014-16 epidemic. Ebola is thought to be spread over long distances by fruit bats and is often transmitted to humans via contaminated bushmeat. It can also be introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. These can include chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, antelope and porcupines. The disease is endemic to the area and it is not possible to eradicate all the animals who might be a host for Ebola. As long as humans come in contact with them, there is always a possibility that Ebola could return. Was bushmeat behind the 2014 Ebola outbreak?

How physics gender gap starts in class,"Some progress has been made in encouraging girls to study physics at A-level, according to a report by the Institute of Physics (IoP). In 2016, 1.9% of girls chose A-level physics, up from 1.6% in 2011. But that compared with 6.5% for boys in 2016 and 44% of schools in England still send no girls at all to study the subject. The IoP said physics-based skills were essential for many future careers, from artificial intelligence to aerospace. However, the gender balance at physics A-level in England's schools has changed little in decades, with only 20% being female. ""There is no evidence to suggest any intrinsic differences in ability or interest to explain why girls and boys choose technical subjects differently,"" said IoP President, Prof Dame Julia Higgins. ""The consequences of girls' choices at school are that many rewarding and fulfilling routes are closed off to them."" The report, Why Not Physics? - A Snapshot of Girls' Uptake at A-level, found only 1.9% of girls chose A-level physics in 2016, compared with 6.5% of boys. In 2011, 1.6% of girls chose the subject, compared with 6.1% of boys. In contrast, 8% of girls and 12.3% of boys progressed to maths A-level. In subjects such as English and psychology, the trend is reversed, with far more girls than boys choosing the subjects. The report makes a number of recommendations: Schools should routinely monitor by gender the numbers of students progressing to physics A-level They must make serious efforts to address problems where they exist and challenge gender stereotypes and unconscious biases The IoP is hosting a summit on Thursday to tackle gender inequality in the classroom and to debate new ways to close the gender gap in the take-up of physics A-level. ""An ill-judged quip that girls 'can't do maths', or 'physics is too hard', can lead to girls making life-changing decisions that alter the subjects they study or the career they pursue,"" said Prof Higgins in a foreword to the report. ""Women in physics are still in the minority, and this lack of visibility preserves the myth and cements the fact that physics is simply not a subject for girls."" The lack of girls studying physics to a higher level also had consequences for the UK economy, the report said. Physics-based skills are required in many growth areas, from aerospace to artificial intelligence, and thousands more workers need to be trained every year to keep the UK economy competitive. A recentstudyfound that closing the gender gap in physics would take hundreds of years, given the current rate of progress. Research analysing the names of authors listed on millions of scientific papers found physics, computer science, maths and chemistry had the fewest women, while nursing and midwifery had the most. Without further interventions, the gender gap was likely to persist for generations, said scientists from the University of Melbourne. Forecasts suggest it will take a very long time to close the gender gap in some fields, with predictions of 320 years for nursing, 280 years for computer science, 258 years for physics and 60 years for mathematics.

"Trump discloses 'Stormy Daniels' paymentAn ethics watchdog says Mr Trump should have revealed the payment, which he earlier denied, sooner.8h8 hours agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played Was Trump's Stormy Daniels payment legal? US President Donald Trump has officially disclosed his reimbursement to his lawyer, who paid a porn star to hush up her claims of an affair. The Office of Government Ethics found on Wednesday that Mr Trump ought to have revealed the payment in his previous financial disclosure. The filing shows he paid Michael Cohen between $100,001 (Â£75,000) and $250,000 for expenses incurred in 2016. Mr Trump previously denied knowing of the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. The conflicting statements in the Stormy Daniels saga The president and the porn star: Why this matters The big question at heart of Stormy Daniels saga This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: ""I was threatened"" The White House stated in a footnote to the filing that it was listing the payment ""in the interest of transparency"", and contended it did not have to make the disclosure. However, the head of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE)wrote in a letter,externalthat ""the payment made by Mr Cohen is required to be reported"" in the liabilities section of the statement. In his letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the OGE acting director said: ""You may find the disclosure relevant to any inquiry you may be pursuing."" The deputy attorney general is overseeing the Department of Justice investigation into whether Trump aides colluded with alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. The Stormy Daniels payment is a potential legal problem for the president because it could be seen as an illegal campaign contribution. Mr Cohen, whose records relating to the settlement were seized in an FBI raid last month, is now reportedly under criminal investigation. Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges that she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada, in 2006. Mr Trump's lawyer said his client ""vehemently denies"" the claim. If the actress's account is true, the tryst would have happened just a few months after Melania Trump gave birth to her son, Barron, whose father is Mr Trump. Stormy Daniels says she had sex with Mr Trump at a Lake Tahoe hotel in 2006 In April, Mr Trump said he was unaware Mr Cohen had paid Ms Daniels just before the 2016 election. Mr Trump's payment to Mr Cohen was first confirmed a fortnight ago by Rudy Giuliani, another of the president's attorneys, in a television interview. Mr Giuliani said the transaction was to keep Ms Daniels quiet about her ""false and extortionist accusation"" that she had sex with Mr Trump, suggesting her claim could have damaged his candidacy. Later that week, the president said the newly hired Mr Giuliani needed time to ""get his facts straight"". Also on Wednesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee backed up the American intelligence community's findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 US election to help Mr Trump. The panel's assessment contradictsa conclusion in March by the House Intelligence Committeerejecting allegations that the Kremlin had aimed to boost the Republican candidate's chances. Mr Trump earned $100,000-$1m in royalties from The Art of the Deal in 2017 The disclosure,externalshows millions in 2017 income from rents, licences, book and television royalties, company shares, hotel management fees and golf courses, with interests from India to Dubai. What happened to worries about Trump's business? His Washington hotel in a former Post Office building brought in more than $40m in 2017, its first full year in operation. His golf courses, including the president's Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, did not appear to see major gains, despite frequent visits from the president. Mar-a-Lago contributed $25m in income, compared with about $37m on the previous report. The president reported royalties from his 1987 book The Art of the Deal in the same $100,000-$1m range as he did last year - and sales for some of his lesser titles picked up.

Japan train leaves seconds early - again,"A Japanese rail company has apologised after a train left a station 25 seconds early, the second such case in months. The operator said the ""great inconvenience we placed upon our customers was truly inexcusable"". If the details are anything to go by, customers are faced with slipping standards: a train last November left 20 seconds early while this time it was a full 25 seconds premature. As was to be expected, social media has been making the most of the story. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

According to Japan Today, the train conductor thought his train was scheduled to leave Notogawa Station at 07:11 instead of the actual scheduled time of 07:12 on Friday. After closing the doors to the commuter train one minute early he realised his mistake and still could have averted the looming embarrassment. But as he couldn't spot any waiting passengers on the platform, he decided to go head and leave early - rolling out of the station 25 seconds ahead of time. Allow Twitter content?

Racing 'should not be funded on misery',"This video can not be played What are fixed-odds betting terminals? Culture secretary Matt Hancock says horse racing should not be funded by ""misery"" as he announced new rules on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). The maximum stake on the machines, dubbed the ""crack cocaine of gambling"" as people can bet up to Â£100 every 20 seconds, will be reduced to Â£2 under the proposals. Bookmakers say the move could lead to hundreds of shops closing. Research has suggested it could cost British racing up to Â£60m annually. Bookmakers support horse racing through an industry levy, and by paying for media rights and sponsoring races. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) says Hancock has asked officials to investigate the potential of expanding the levy to include global racing bets placed in Britain. Betting machine stakes cut to Â£2 Roaring Lion wins Dante Stakes at York Hancock, the Conservative MP for West Suffolk, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: ""I represent Newmarket, which is the home of horse racing. I love horse racing and there is an interaction between the sport and the gambling industry. ""We are working with the British Horseracing Authority on a package of measures to mitigate the impact on horse racing. ""But I would say this to people in the horse racing industry, and who love that sport: Horse racing should not be financed on the back of this misery."" He added: ""Horse racing is a wonderful sport that can, and will, pay for itself and be financially successful without having to ruin the lives of people using these machines. ""Horse racing is glorious. It doesn't have to be based on these machines, which are designed by their algorithms, to ensure people cannot win."" The government's consultation into electronic casino games, such as roulette, found consistently high rates of problem gamblers among players of FOBTs. Hancock said he had spoken to people in his constituency who had lost thousands of pounds and pleaded for changes. BHA chief executive said British racing had ""a strong social conscience"" and supported the government measures. ""It is too early to say what the financial impact for racing will be,"" he said. ""Our estimates before today's decision ranged from Â£40 to Â£60 million per year, once the impact of the changes has filtered through into racing. ""These estimates did not take into account the Secretary of State's suggestion that the levy could be extended to bets on global racing, which could partially offset any reduction. ""We are also encouraged by the Secretary of State's reference to a period of transition which will allow time for racing and betting to adjust.""

The terminals 'ruined my life',"Fixed-odds betting terminals currently allow people in the UK to bet Â£100 every 20 seconds.A 12-week consultation is underwaywhich could potentially cut the maximum stake to Â£2 per game. 53-year-old Terry White, from Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, has lost hundreds of thousands of pounds on fixed-odds machines and is calling for a cap on the number of terminals on the high street. He shares his story: I am a gambler. I've been a gambler all my life. I started 35 years ago and the majority of bets were on horses and sport. There was a skill element to it - that horse is going to win or Liverpool are going to win tonight. You could do your research and become good at it. And I was good at it. I won about Â£250,000 over 25 years. But it was soft, recreational gambling. Then one day I walked into a betting shop and there were these machines there. They looked like the sort of machines you would find in arcades or at the seaside - they looked fun. In the early days, just after the millennium, the machines had a limit of Â£5 or Â£10 and it was Â£1 per spin. It would take about 10 minutes to play Â£10. Over the next few years they increased it to Â£100 per spin, which only took 20 seconds. Effectively, you could lose Â£300 in a minute. Even if you were winning you could lose several thousand pounds in an hour. Gamblers need help to beat problem, says addict Fixed-odds betting machines have games similar to fruit machines, as well as roulette and blackjack The adrenaline is completely different because it is all happening live, in front of you. I was bored gambling on sport and I sought a fresh buzz. But you leave yourself at the behest of a random number generator and soon I realised I was losing between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000 per week. One week I lost Â£40,000 of profit and it left me stunned and shocked and ashamed of myself for blowing all my money in one afternoon in a betting shop. I have lost about a quarter of a million in total. I take responsibility for my actions but my addiction is overwhelming. I have suffered bereavements over the last few years and when my depression was getting worse I would go into a betting shop. It became a crutch but also a burden. I lost my house, I've stolen, I've lied to people. To this day I'm Â£40,000 in debt. I'm moving into council accommodation soon, otherwise I would have been homeless. I could be declared bankrupt soon. The low point was a suicide attempt in December. I was in hospital for three days. The pain of the addiction hits you from the moment you wake up and I've got nothing left to live for. The fact this is all on the high street is a nightmare for an addict. I would not go to a casino because of the effort of getting dressed up and going to a venue, but there are at least seven on the high street in Barry and you cannot go into a betting shop without seeing a machine. I'll go weeks without food and neglect my health. I haven't left the house for 15 days as I try to force myself to go cold turkey. I am scared of going grocery shopping in case I end up in a betting shop and I am getting no help or therapy for my illness. I still have a compulsion to go into betting shops. Now my body is used to Â£60 spins I could not go back to playing with Â£5 because I'll always be thinking ""why didn't I bet more?"" The limits on winnings are also a problem. As a gambler there's a compulsion to win your money back but you need to win twice to win back 10 spins. Gamble Aware,externalhave a motto: ""When the fun stops - stop"". But gambling is not fun. When you're gambling your wages, your benefits or your life savings it cannot possibly be fun. But the moment the credit is in the machine in front of me I am relaxed. When it is gone I am just thinking about where my next amount of money is coming from. I hope people realise this can happen to anybody. I like to think I'm an intelligent person but this compulsion has ruined my life. My message is to stop going into these places, because you cannot beat them.

Rural police 'could routinely carry guns'Police in remote communities in England and Wales could be armed in order to deal with terror threats.2h2 hours agoUK,"Armed police are on patrol in Windsor ahead of the Royal Wedding Front-line officers in remote, rural communities could be routinely armed in order to deal with terror threats, police chiefs have said. The move is being considered by the National Police Chiefs' Council because of a lack of specialist counter-terrorist firearms officers. It comes after a drive to recruit these officers in England and Wales fell short by about 100. Police said arming officers in remote areas would be a last resort. Counter-terrorist specialist firearms officers (CTSFOs) are trained with special forces to deal with a raft of situations, including hostage rescues and terror attacks. Plans were put in place to bolster the UK's capacity for armed responses in the wake of the Paris terror attacks in 2015, in which 130 people died. Over the past two years, the Home Office has funded an extra 874 armed officers in England and Wales - bringing the total to more than 6,400 in April 2017. But on a practical level, police chiefs have estimated that in rural communities, such as Devon and Cornwall, a firearms unit could be between 30-70 miles away in the event of a major incident. By Danny Shaw, BBC News home affairs correspondent Two years ago, police warned that ""unarmed and vulnerable""officers in rural communities would be ""sitting ducks"" in the event of a terror attack. Since then, huge investment and effort has gone into improving armed police capacity and capability, as the latest announcement shows - but gaps remain. Armed response vehicles (ARVs), which are intended to be first on the scene of a firearms incident, are an expensive asset, with 13 officers required to double-crew a vehicle 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That's why police chiefs are looking at alternatives to deploying ARVs in areas where there's a low risk of a terror attack, such as allowing front-line officers to carry guns. It goes against the grain of British policing for officers to be routinely armed, but there'sincreasing support for it among those polled in a Federation surveyand it remains firmly on the table as an option. Simon Chesterman, National Police Chiefs' Council lead for armed policing, said: ""Of course there are communities within England and Wales where an attack is highly unlikely. ""But ultimately, if something does happen, we have got to be able to provide an armed response."" Mr Chesterman said the training and demands of being a CTSFO meant there was a high turnover rate, and some officers were put off by the level of scrutiny that police face when police open fire in the line of duty. He explained that police chiefs had conducted ""many layers of the analysis... to understand where is best to place these officers"". There remains a shortfall in the number of counter-terrorist marksmen ""We can't put an armed police officer on every street corner everywhere across the whole of the United Kingdom, so what we've had to do is analyse the threat."" He said discussions were ongoing in a ""handful"" of police forces over how to improve response times - and whether some form of routine arming might be appropriate. Mr Chesterman was clear that arming rural police forces ""does not need to happen at the moment"". ""This is not, if you like, a favoured option,"" he told the BBC's Danny Shaw. ""But I can't rule it out at this stage, in terms of making sure that all communities get the right level of protection from armed police."" Around 90% of British police officers are currently unarmed. Any decision on arming officers is a matter for the chief constable of each of the 43 local forces covering England and Wales, as well as the national British Transport Police.

Windsor set for royal wedding rehearsal,"Four Windsor Grey horses will pull the newlyweds in the Ascot Landau carriage A rehearsal of the carriage procession through Windsor for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle is under way. More than 250 members of the armed forces are taking part in the rehearsal - along with the couple's carriage. After tying the knot on Saturday, Harry and Ms Markle will travel through Windsor in the Ascot Landau carriage. Used in official and ceremonial state events, the carriage will be pulled by Windsor grey horses. Royal wedding: All you need to know How to watch the events Princess Charlotte to be bridesmaid Meghan's dad may miss wedding over surgery On Saturday the procession will take place at 13:00 BST, after the hour-long service at St George's Chapel. Members of both families will gather on the steps of the chapel to wave off the newlyweds on their carriage procession, which is expected to last about 25 minutes. The carriage will leave Castle Hill, travel through Windsor and then it will proceed up the Long Walk all the way back to St George's Hall by Windsor Castle. Kensington Palace revealed on Wednesday that Prince Harry's niece, three-year-old Princess Charlotte, will be one of six bridesmaids at the wedding. Her elder brother, Prince George, aged four, will be a pageboy alongside three other young boys. Media tactics unravel in run-up to big day Who is Meghan Markle? What titles might Harry and Meghan get? The 10 children who have been chosen are all aged seven or under. So far, the details of the bridesmaids' dresses and the pageboys' uniforms remain under wraps. Princess Charlotte was a bridesmaid at her aunt's wedding Prince George also comes to the role with experience Ms Markle, 36, will not have a maid of honour because she wanted to avoid choosing between her closest friends. It is still unclear who will walk her down the aisle after it was reported that her father was due to have heart surgery. Thomas Markle had told US website TMZ he would not go to the wedding amid a row over paparazzi photographs; then that he would; then that he could not because of a planned heart procedure. Kensington Palace has declined to comment. Meanwhile, a petition organised by campaign group Republic has been handed to MPs. Signed by 32,000 people, the petition calls on MPs to make the Royal Family pay for the security and policing surrounding Saturday's wedding and for the government to publish a report of all costs to taxpayers. This video can not be played ""The royals should be paying for this wedding"" - Republic Republic chief executive Graham Smith said: ""There is nothing inevitable about the public spending on a royal wedding.

High stakes for betting machines,"The government is set to unveil a shake-up of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) shortly, gaming machines that exist in thousands of bookmakers across the UK. Critics call them the ""crack cocaine"" of the betting world. The industry says they are a vital - and perfectly legal - part of the sector that create jobs, profits and tax revenue for the government. But with punters able to wager up to Â£100 every 20 seconds, there is concern about the social, mental and financial cost. Cutting the bet-per-spin to about Â£30 had been suggested. But now, it seems, the government is considering a limit of Â£2,with reports that the Treasury backs the idea. Here, four voices from both sides outline their arguments. Philip Bowcock is chief executive of William Hill, which makes just over half its retail revenues from gaming machines. He says a Â£2 FOBT limit will have a devastating impact on the High Street betting industry, with up to half of Britain's betting shops facing threat of closure and about 20,000 jobs going"". The 8,000 bookies in the UK employ 50,000 people, pay Â£1bn in tax, and Â£80m to local authorities in rates. ""And when you also consider the knock-on impact on suppliers and horseracing, then the jobs picture is even worse,"" Mr Bowcock adds. Bookmakers contribute about Â£270m to the racing industry. Research by KPMG estimates a Â£2 limit would cut revenue for the Treasury by Â£1.1bn over three years, an annual loss of Â£45m to local authorities and Â£50m to British racing. A big concern for the industry is that a Â£2 limit is being considered despite the government's own advisers pointing to a ""more proportionate response"". That is a reference to reports from the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board and the Gambling Commission. ""Government cannot avoid the loss of High Street jobs where businesses are failing. But they can avoid a decision - not based on evidence - that will put thousands of people out of work."" Matt Zarb-Cousin is now a spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, but at one time was consumed by FOBTs. He skipped college to visit betting shops, and sold possessions on eBay to fund his addiction. And he came close to killing himself. ""It's no exaggeration to call FOBTs the crack cocaine of gambling,"" he says. ""If we had a gambling product classification, similar to that of drugs, FOBTs would be class A."" The speed with which gamblers can lay a bet - every 20 seconds - and the maximum size of the stake - Â£100 - make FOBTs dangerously attractive, he says. ""In the midst of my addiction, I deluded myself that I was one big win away from solving the problems the addiction had caused, which only perpetuated the harmful behaviour. ""I tried to self-exclude from betting shops, but the high staff turnover meant there was no chance I would be recognised and asked to leave,"" Mr Zarb-Cousin says. Drug addiction is neurologically similar to gambling addition, he says. And like some drugs, some types of gambling are more addictive than others. Research by Landman Economics found that there were more than 230,000 FOBT sessions in one year where an individual lost more than Â£1,000, he says. And with the average FOBT user losing Â£192 a month, only by cutting the maximum stake to Â£2 will the government eliminate large-scale losses of more than Â£100 a session. Cutting FOBTs stakes from Â£100 to Â£2 is not only ""disproportionate"", argues Malcolm George, chief executive of the Association of British Bookmakers, but could also ""create a variety of unintended and potentially harmful consequences"". He cites the Gambling Commission's own advice that ""the underlying causes of gambling-related harm are many and complex in nature"" and that a very low FOBT stake limit would make it a ""softer"" form of gambling than is available in arcades, bingo halls and pubs. The latter, he says, are less tightly regulated than betting shops. ""A Â£2 stake on a FOBT doesn't bring the machine into line with other gaming machines on the High Street,"" insists Mr George. ""What it means is that the most you could bet would be Â£6 per minute on a FOBT, but you could bet four times as much per minute on a pub fruit machine (Â£24) or eight times as much on an arcade machine (Â£48)."" A Â£2 stake limit means ""customers will simply go to other venues with fewer controls and move online"". There are other ways to control machine betting, including better use of technology such as algorithmic-based warnings and new ways to block debit card use. He also supports tougher rules on advertising, which he says is more of a concern to the public than gaming machines: ""Parents are far more worried about their children seeing online gambling ads during football matches."" Millionaire Derek Webb was a professional poker player for decades and knows the gambling industry from the inside. He's also the founder and funder of Stop the FOBTs and the Campaign for Fairer Gambling. He says the ""once-a-problem-gambler, always-a-problem-gambler"" attitude ignores that some forms of gambling are more addictive than others. ""Every day, vulnerable persons entering betting offices for the first time are being exposed to the evidentially proven most addictive form of gambling - FOBTs."" He's not anti-gambling, but Mr Webb says the ""only purpose of legalising gambling is to ensure it's taxed and properly regulated. In order to do the latter, regulation has to take into account the impact of stake, speed of play and game design in inducing and exacerbating gambling related harm and crime."" Bookmakers introduced FOBTs on a false pretence, he says, claiming it was akin to betting on a horse race. ""But they're nothing to do with betting - they're gaming machines that facilitate high stakes roulette in easily accessible premises."" Under the 2005 Gambling Act, Britain became the first - and still is the only - country to permit this form of gambling in High Street venues, he says. The Act says gambling must be fair and open, not associated with crime, and not harm the young or vulnerable. ""FOBTs are irreconcilable with the licensing objectives. That evidence is now overwhelming.""

Grenfell review does not urge cladding ban,"There will be a consultation on banning inflammable cladding on high-rise buildings, the government says, despite a review into the Grenfell tragedy not recommending such a move. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire announced the consultation ""having listened carefully"" to concerns. Earlier, a government-commissioned building regulations review stopped short of proposing a ban - a move criticised by some Grenfell survivors. Labour MPs called for an immediate ban. Architects, building firms and Grenfell survivors had backed laws forbidding the use of combustible materials in tower blocks. Inflammable cladding is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in west London's Grenfell Tower last June. A total of 72 people died as a result of the blaze, the judge-led inquiry has said. This includes Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, who died in January. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor. Will the building regulations review work? A subsequent survey identifiedhundreds of other buildings where cladding failed safety tests. The Royal Institute of British Architects called for a ban on inflammable cladding, as well as a requirement for sprinklers to be fitted, and a second means of escape for high-rise residential buildings. Announcing the consultation, Mr Brokenshire said: ""We must create a culture that truly puts people and their safety first, that inspires confidence and, yes, rebuilds public trust."" He said the building regulations review, and the changes that will come from it, were ""important first steps, helping us ensure that when we say 'never again', we mean it"". Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey responded, saying: ""Don't consult on it, do it."" Shahin Sadafi, chairman of Grenfell United, which represents survivors and the bereaved, said he was ""disappointed"" there was no immediate ban. Earlier, a government-commissioned independent report into building regulations called for a ""radical rethink"" of the safety system, but stopped short of recommending an outright ban on inflammable cladding. This video can not be played Dame Judith Hackitt tells Today that the building regulation system is broken The report's author, Dame Judith Hackitt, said indifference and ignorance had led to cost being prioritised over safety and called  for regulators to ""come together"" to ensure building safety. She also recommended incentives for the right behaviour and tougher penalties for those who breach the rules. Appearing before the Housing, Communities and Local Government select committee, Dame Judith said she supported Mr Brokenshire's announcement and it was ""complementary"" to her review, ""but on its own it will be insufficient"". ""Simply banning something from happening is no guarantee of compliance,"" she said. ""If people attach too much reliance upon banning activities and particular materials as being a solution to this problem it will create a false sense of security."" She told MPs that she had not known Mr Brokenshire had planned to announce a consultation. The prime minister's spokesman said the current regulatory system was not ""fit for purpose"" and the government was committed to making the necessary changes. Grenfell United and opposition MPs criticised the review's recommendations. Mr Sadafi said his group was ""disappointed and saddened that she (Dame Judith) she didn't listen to us and she didn't listen to other experts"". This video can not be played Diane Abbott: ""The 71 people who died were not a 'technical issue' and you need to step up."" Shadow housing minister Sarah Jones told the BBC that the report was a ""huge wasted opportunity"" and that the recommendations did not go far enough. Labour MP and Grenfell campaigner David Lammy said it was ""unfathomable"" that the review had not recommended a ban on combustible materials. Survivors in emergency housing 12 months on Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell: Inside the 21st floor The independent review,externallooked into regulations around the design, construction and management of buildings in relation to fire safety. The final 156-page report found that: Roles and responsibilities for building safety are unclear Regulations and guidance are ""ambiguous and inconsistent"" and are ""misunderstood and misinterpreted"" There is ignorance about the rules governing the industry The process that drives compliance with the regulations are ""weak and complex"" Competence (of people in the system) is ""patchy"" The process for testing and certifying products is ""disjointed, confusing, unhelpful and lacking any sort of transparency"" Product testing and marketing is ""opaque and insufficient"" Residents' voices go unheard Dame Judith - a senior engineer who used to chair the Health and Safety Executive - said these issues ""have helped to create a cultural issue across the sector, which can be described as a 'race to the bottom', caused either through indifference, or because the system does not facilitate good practice"". Her appointment to lead the reviewhad been met with some criticismdue to her former role as director of the Energy Saving Trust.

Dementia exercise programmes 'don't work',"People with mild to moderate dementia took part in strength exercises Exercise programmes for people with mild to moderate dementia ""don't work"", according to researchers writing in the British Medical Journal. They found no improvements in thinking skills or behaviour in more than 300 people in their 70s who did aerobic and strength exercises over four months. On the plus side, their physical fitness did improve, the study said. The Oxford researchers said future trials should explore other forms of exercise. Gentle, regular exercise was a good thing, they added, and there was no reason for anyone to stop exercising. Dementia patients 'abandoned' by system But at present, structured NHS exercise programmes for dementia patients did not appear to be a good investment. Inthe study,,external329 dementia patients took part in gym sessions lasting 60-90 minutes twice a week for four months. They spent at least 20 minutes on a fixed cycle and lifted weights while getting out of a chair. They were encouraged to do exercises at home for another hour each week. The exercise group was then assessed and compared with a group of 165 people with dementia who received their usual care. Prof Sallie Lamb, lead study author and professor of rehabilitation at Oxford University, said the results showed that people who had had dementia for two or three years could follow simple exercise instructions and improve their fitness and muscle strength. ""But these benefits do not, however, translate into improvements in cognitive impairment, activities in daily living, behaviour, or health-related quality of life,"" she said. After 12 months, researchers found that cognitive impairment had declined in both groups, with the exercise group slightly worse off - but the difference was small. Prof Martin Rossor, professor of clinical neurology at University College London, said the results weren't surprising given degeneration of brain cells started many years before symptoms began in Alzheimer's disease, for example. ""So, the message remains that exercise is good, but to start an exercise regime once the disease is well established may be of limited value,"" he added. Dr Sara Imarisio, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said other forms of exercise could have different effects and this should be explored in future research. She said there were many benefits to physical exercise, apart from simply health ones. ""For many people, exercise can be a source of enjoyment and provide valuable opportunities for social interaction,"" she said.

NHS outsourcing 'could have caused harm',"Patients could have been put at risk of serious harm after NHS services in England were outsourced, a report says. Nearly 90 women were wrongly told they were no longer part of the cervical screening programme after Capita started running back-office services in 2015, the National Audit Office said. It said services had been ""way below"" acceptable standards, although no harm to patients had been found. NHS England acknowledged ""difficulties"" but said the change had saved Â£60m. NHS England agreed a seven-year Â£330m deal with Capita in 2015 to run back-office functions for primary care providers such as GPs, dentists and pharmacists in a bid to reduce costs and modernise services, the public spending watchdog said. Duties transferred to Capita included sending out test results, moving patients' medical records, processing patient registrations and paying GP practices. The report found patients could potentially have been put at risk because of problems with the ""performers list"" - a list of GPs, dentists and opticians practising in the NHS - including whether they were suitably qualified and had passed other relevant checks. ""The failure to update performers lists may have compromised patient safety in cases where practitioners should have been removed,"" the authors of the report said. Pharmacists are among the care providers Capita have run back-office services for Other issues reported by the NAO included: Delays in processing new applications for the performers list in 2016 resulted in about 1,000 GPs, dentists and opticians being unable to work Capita carried out an ""aggressive"" office closure programme that it continued despite the fact it was having a harmful impact on services However, the NAO acknowledged that NHS England had made savings of Â£60m in the first two years of the contract, and said Capita's self-reported performance against the contract had improved. But Sir Amyas Morse, the head of the watchdog, added that value for money was ""about more than just cost reduction"". ""It is deeply unsatisfactory that, two and a half years into the contract, NHS England and Capita have not yet reached the level of partnership working required to make a contract like this work effectively."" The NAO added that NHS England should consider whether the services should be taken back in-house. Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said trying to cut costs while modernising the service was ""over-ambitious, disruptive for thousands of doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists and potentially put patients at risk of serious harm"". Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said it was asking NHS England how it planned to resolve the ""shambles"" of Capita running the primary care support services. An NHS England spokesman said the transition, ""while not without its difficulties"", had saved Â£60m which had been reinvested into front-line care, funding the equivalent of an extra 30,000 operations. A Capita spokeswoman added: ""The report notes that several organisations and legacy issues all contributed to underperformance. ""It has been acknowledged that performance has improved and Capita will continue to work with all parties to address the small number of remaining service issues."" Separately, earlier this month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt saidup to 270 women in England may have died because they did not receive invitationsto a final routine breast cancer screening. He said IT problems were to blame for the errors. NHS care contract 'wasted millions' NHS plans: Privatisation or progress?

William Hill warns PM over FOBTs threat,"The chairman of bookmaker William Hill has warned the prime minister his firm risks being bought by a foreign rival if it is weakened by new betting rules. In a letter to Theresa May, Roger Devlin said changes to the amount that can be bet on High Street gambling machines could hit jobs and profits. The government is expected to announce imminently a final decision on its review fixed-odds betting terminals. He proposed tougher rules on adverts and a levy to help problem gamblers. Currently, fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) allow players to stake up to Â£100 every 20 seconds. A review's interim findings suggested cutting the maximum stakes to Â£30, but there have been reports that the amount could be cut to just Â£2. Anti-gambling campaigners, who have dubbed the fixed-odds machines the ""crack cocaine"" of gambling, support the move. Bookies, however, have warned that such a cut would result in the closure of thousands of outlets, a big reduction in tax paid to the Treasury, and would have knock-on effects on the horse racing industry. Bookmakers support horse racing through an industry levy and offering prize money. Mr Devlin's letter, first reported by Sky News and seen by the BBC, said UK gambling was ""extremely well regulated"". He wrote: ""Sadly, I fear that your government is about to make a decision that is unnecessary and lacking in evidence - a decision that will also be catastrophic for a retail betting industry employing over 40,000 people."" ""Consolidation within our sector continues and I would also not want to see the impact of a disproportionateâ¦ outcome being a factor in the name of William Hill being added to the list of companies now in foreign ownership,"" he said. High stakes for fixed-odds betting machines Bookmakers hit by tougher wager limit fears Betting machine wagers set for Â£30 limit Mr Devlin said William Hill supported a ban on gambling advertising on television before the watershed, and a levy on the industry to pay for education and treatment of problem gamblers. Mr Devlin, who was appointed chairman of the bookmaker earlier this year, is also chairman of the housebuilder Persimmon, which has been racked with controversy over a generous executive pay scheme. Shares in William Hill have been hit hard by fears that fixed-odds stakes would be cut, falling sharply last month on reports that the chancellor, Philip Hammond, would not oppose the move. On Monday, though. William Hill shares jumped after the US Supreme Court handed down a ruling that would allow states to legalise sports betting, opening up a big potential new market to gambling companies.

How popular is your wedding day?,"Your wedding day may hold a special place in your heart, but how many others do you share it with? As the royal wedding approaches, we've delved into the data on millions of marriages across 20 years to find the day of the year with the most love. Use the calculator below to find out how popular your wedding day was, or be savvy and find the best day to beat the crowd. Your browser does not support this lookup. The most popular wedding day wasSaturday 2 September 1995, when 7,750 couples got married. The least popular day wasChristmas Day 1999, when only three couples got married. Figures cover marriages in Britain from 1995-2015 including leap years. If you cannot see the interactive calendar,click here,external. Clearly the summer is a hot time to marry, and the royal wedding is not on an especially popular day, but what else is there to know? There are some obvious spikes in wedding day popularity. Valentine's Day is way above average for February and is the seventh most popular day in the year, in spite of the weather. Also significantly above the February average is 29 February, which only occurs in leap years. As the chart below shows, the 13th of any month is a very unpopular day. The 13th is unpopular if it falls on any day of the week, but when it falls on a Friday there are half the number of marriages compared with other Fridays, on average. The most noticeable shift over the years has been the decline in the number of people getting married (there were 38,463 fewer weddings in 2015 than in 1995), but the timing of weddings has also changed. While weekends remain the most popular time to wed, only 58% of weddings took place on the weekend in 2015 compared with 67% in 1995. Sundays are surprisingly unpopular. While most people have the day off, they will usually have to be up early on the Monday morning. Design and development by Prina Shah and Joe Reed.

Mothercare 'set to rehire replaced boss',"This video can not be played Mothers at this shopping centre say other stores are better at catering for young children Mothercare has confirmed it is closing 50 stores as part of a rescue plan, a move that will put 800 jobs at risk. The baby products retailer said it was in a ""perilous"" financial position. The store closures will leave it with 78 outlets in the UK by 2020. The retailer has already nearly halved its store numbers over the past five years. It had intended have 92 outlets by 2023, but has now accelerated its closure plans and will have just 73 by that year. What's gone wrong at Mothercare? Five things to do with empty retail stores Six shops defying the High Street crisis The company plunged to a Â£72.8m loss in its most recent financial year, as it took hefty charges to pay for closing stores and reorganising the business. Mothercare saw falling numbers of shoppers in the second half of the financial year and had to discount to try to stimulate sales. However, over the year as a whole, like-for-like sales fell 1.3%. by Emma Simpson, business correspondent You just have to speak to shoppers to understand what's gone wrong at Mothercare. The mums I met yesterday bought their baby stuff in the likes of Primark and the supermarkets. Mothercare, they told me, was too pricey. Truth is, this chain has been struggling for a long time. Its UK business hasn't made a profit since 2012. It's yet another High Street chain that hasn't kept up with changing shopping habits and increasing competition. The tough conditions on the high street have finally brought things to a head. Will this restructuring be enough to secure long term survival? The shenanigans over its management changes don't exactly instil confidence and raise questions about the leadership of a business which needs a compete reboot. The plan to close stores and cut rents at 21 of its stores is being carried out through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). The CVA, as is standard, will need the support of its creditors. One of these, the Pension Protection Fund, has already said it will vote in favour. The company also said it would reappoint the chief executive who left in April following poor Christmas trading and a profits warning. Mark Newton-Jones was sacked by the then chairman Alan Parker - who has himself subsequently stepped down. Former Tesco executive David Wood who had taken on the chief executive role and is just over a month into the job, will become group managing director. In a statement, Mothercare said:,external""Recent financial performance, impacted in particular by a large number of legacy loss making stores within the UK estate, has resulted in a perilous financial condition for the group."" As part of its restructuring, Mothercare has also arranged a refinancing package worth up to Â£113.5m, which includes Â£28m raised through issuing new shares, and an extension of its existing debt arrangements. Mothercare chairman Clive Whiley said: ""These measures provide a solid platform from which to reposition the group and begin to focus on growth, both in the UK and internationally."" CVAs have become widespread this year as a sheaf of major High Street names have had to undergo deep changes in the way they operate. Earlier this year, toy store chain Toys R Us collapsed into administration, as did electronics retailer Maplin. Carpetright has entered into a CVA and announced store closures, as has fashion chain New Look. High Street crisis forces hundreds of store closures Six things behind the High Street crisis A number of reasons have been cited for failures on the High Street, including a squeeze on consumers' income, the growth of online shopping and the rising costs of staff, rents and business rates. Richard Hyman, retail adviser and consultant, told the BBC's Today programme that Mothercare's problems went back years. ""I think Mothercare has not really delivered on the promise implicit in the name, in trading terms, for generations really,"" he said. ""Nothing can sum it up quite as well as the fact you can't get a pram round the store."" He added that this has become more of an issue as the trading climate is now ""so much more unforgiving"".

Grenfell review 'won't urge cladding ban',"There will be a consultation on banning inflammable cladding on high-rise buildings, the government says, despite a review into the Grenfell tragedy not recommending such a move. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire announced the consultation ""having listened carefully"" to concerns. Earlier, a government-commissioned building regulations review stopped short of proposing a ban - a move criticised by some Grenfell survivors. Labour MPs called for an immediate ban. Architects, building firms and Grenfell survivors had backed laws forbidding the use of combustible materials in tower blocks. Inflammable cladding is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in west London's Grenfell Tower last June. A total of 72 people died as a result of the blaze, the judge-led inquiry has said. This includes Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, who died in January. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor. Will the building regulations review work? A subsequent survey identifiedhundreds of other buildings where cladding failed safety tests. The Royal Institute of British Architects called for a ban on inflammable cladding, as well as a requirement for sprinklers to be fitted, and a second means of escape for high-rise residential buildings. Announcing the consultation, Mr Brokenshire said: ""We must create a culture that truly puts people and their safety first, that inspires confidence and, yes, rebuilds public trust."" He said the building regulations review, and the changes that will come from it, were ""important first steps, helping us ensure that when we say 'never again', we mean it"". Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey responded, saying: ""Don't consult on it, do it."" Shahin Sadafi, chairman of Grenfell United, which represents survivors and the bereaved, said he was ""disappointed"" there was no immediate ban. Earlier, a government-commissioned independent report into building regulations called for a ""radical rethink"" of the safety system, but stopped short of recommending an outright ban on inflammable cladding. This video can not be played Dame Judith Hackitt tells Today that the building regulation system is broken The report's author, Dame Judith Hackitt, said indifference and ignorance had led to cost being prioritised over safety and called  for regulators to ""come together"" to ensure building safety. She also recommended incentives for the right behaviour and tougher penalties for those who breach the rules. Appearing before the Housing, Communities and Local Government select committee, Dame Judith said she supported Mr Brokenshire's announcement and it was ""complementary"" to her review, ""but on its own it will be insufficient"". ""Simply banning something from happening is no guarantee of compliance,"" she said. ""If people attach too much reliance upon banning activities and particular materials as being a solution to this problem it will create a false sense of security."" She told MPs that she had not known Mr Brokenshire had planned to announce a consultation. The prime minister's spokesman said the current regulatory system was not ""fit for purpose"" and the government was committed to making the necessary changes. Grenfell United and opposition MPs criticised the review's recommendations. Mr Sadafi said his group was ""disappointed and saddened that she (Dame Judith) she didn't listen to us and she didn't listen to other experts"". This video can not be played Diane Abbott: ""The 71 people who died were not a 'technical issue' and you need to step up."" Shadow housing minister Sarah Jones told the BBC that the report was a ""huge wasted opportunity"" and that the recommendations did not go far enough. Labour MP and Grenfell campaigner David Lammy said it was ""unfathomable"" that the review had not recommended a ban on combustible materials. Survivors in emergency housing 12 months on Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell: Inside the 21st floor The independent review,externallooked into regulations around the design, construction and management of buildings in relation to fire safety. The final 156-page report found that: Roles and responsibilities for building safety are unclear Regulations and guidance are ""ambiguous and inconsistent"" and are ""misunderstood and misinterpreted"" There is ignorance about the rules governing the industry The process that drives compliance with the regulations are ""weak and complex"" Competence (of people in the system) is ""patchy"" The process for testing and certifying products is ""disjointed, confusing, unhelpful and lacking any sort of transparency"" Product testing and marketing is ""opaque and insufficient"" Residents' voices go unheard Dame Judith - a senior engineer who used to chair the Health and Safety Executive - said these issues ""have helped to create a cultural issue across the sector, which can be described as a 'race to the bottom', caused either through indifference, or because the system does not facilitate good practice"". Her appointment to lead the reviewhad been met with some criticismdue to her former role as director of the Energy Saving Trust. The organisation promotes insulation containing a foam known as polyisocyanurate (PIR), blamed for fuelling the fire at Grenfell.

We're off to the wedding," County Antrim Philip has a plan. The day before the wedding his barber will give him a trim and a wet shave. He'll wear his blue three-piece suit - only worn once before at a friend's wedding - with brown shoes, a regimental red-and-green striped tie and his medals. It will be the first time Philip, 30, has worn them since he was discharged from the Army in 2013. Leaving was one of the hardest things he's done. More so, perhaps, than what came before, he says. Philip - or Barney to friends - was on his third tour of Afghanistan. It had been the best so far - the infrastructure in a country torn apart by war was improving and there'd been less fighting than in previous years. But on 9 January 2011, while on foot patrol in Helmand province, he stepped on a roadside bomb. It blew off his right leg and caused multiple fractures to his left. He stayed conscious while medics worked on him, before being taken by helicopter to an army hospital. There's little emotion in Philip's voice as he recounts the life-changing moment. “I find it quite easy to talk about it,” he says. “I accepted it within the first few months and moved past it.” “The Taliban took a leg, I wouldn't want them to take my life,” he explains. “If I stopped living my life, they might as well have taken it.” There were painful, emotional times in the weeks that followed for Philip and his loved ones. The knock on his dad's door to tell him his son had lost a leg, and a bedside reunion at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital. “You don't want to cry in front of your father so you hold it all back,” says Philip. But there were surprisingly good times too. Like the time he met his returning comrades off the bus. It was less than two months since the bomb went off but he'd been fitted with a prosthetic leg and was able to stand using crutches. “They got a huge surprise. The last time they'd seen me, I was lying in the dust with my leg blown off.” He says he clung to the hope that he'd recover sufficiently to return to the Army, but that wasn't the case. It was as much about losing part of his identity as losing a job, he says. That's when he first came into contact with the soldiers' charity, ABF. They paid for his girlfriend, Kirsty Crawford, to visit him in hospital. They also laid slabs on his driveway at home in Ballymena - and installed a shower room with a seat. These things won't make the front pages of newspapers, he says, but they are small things that make a big difference. The charity helped him until he was discharged from the Army in 2013 - since then, he has been helping them as an ambassador. We do some sums and work out he's raised at least £50,000 in five years with black-tie dinners, a Five Peaks Challenge and climbing Kilimanjaro. Keeping fit has been part of his approach to life out of the Army. He's worked as an outdoor instructor and recently started volunteering with the Army cadet force. “I can't run 15 miles any more but I can do a little bit,” he says. With that “little bit”, he hopes to get himself a place on the British team to compete in archery and rowing at the Invictus Games in Sydney this October. “It would be really nice to represent my country, to don the Union Jack colours,” he says. There is a quiet patriotism that comes across as we talk. “I've got a lot of time for the Royal Family,” he says. “You sign an oath to the Queen when you join the Army.” He knows soldiers who've met Prince Harry who say he's down to earth and genuine. “He likes to look after the veterans. He's a good guy in my book.” While Philip has a plan, his girlfriend Kirsty is still formulating hers. With little more than a fortnight to go, she's looked around the shops and has a shortlist of dresses. The couple will travel to the wedding with friends who've also been invited. The four will share a picnic and a couple of glasses of prosecco. Harry and Meghan will tie the knot after less than two years together, so it begs the question will Philip and Kirsty, together for nine years, be following them down the aisle any time soon? Philip laughs. “I get asked that a lot. It is something we'll be talking about in the near future.” Cambridgeshire Twelve-year-old Jorja is back home from school. She tugs off her school tie and slumps on the sofa. Budgerigars squawk and the family's six dogs bark and yap as Jorja recalls the moment her mum sat her down and told her she was invited to the royal wedding. “I think I may have woken the neighbours up with my screaming,” she says. “I wasn't allowed to tell anyone for five days but I did tell my best friend,” she confesses. Her first thought was the dress. After 10 hours searching online, she found The One, her mum, Gabrielle, jokes. Jorja will wear a black dress with a sweetheart neckline, one sparkly mid-heel shoe and a deep pink-coloured blade. An amputee from birth, Jorja has been in and out of hospital ever since, averaging about two operations a year. “It's probably not something to be proud of but I sort of am,” she says. Amniotic band syndrome is a rare condition in which strands of tissue wrap around the unborn baby's limbs and cut off blood flow. At her 20-week pregnancy scan, Gabrielle was told Jorja was missing a leg. It was not until she was born that they saw some of her fingers and toes were twisted or stumps. At the age of one, Jorja was fitted with her first prosthetic leg and quickly learned to walk. But, as she grew older, some of the usual milestones of childhood were never reached. “She can't run,” says Gabrielle. “And children's prosthetic feet don't bend. There's no riding a bike.” There are times when the pain around her stump is so bad she needs morphine every day. And she has been tormented by bullies, young and old. “Muttering under their breath. People calling me things. It's hard,” she says. Her ballet teacher told her she'd never pirouette because she couldn't point her foot. “Is it bad that I once threw my leg at her?” asks Jorja, mischievously. A couple of years ago, Gabrielle and Jorja met a family whose dad was an amputee at their local park. They began talking about how unusual it was to meet other amputees. Out of that meeting, a germ of an idea formed which led to the creation of a support group for amputees and their families. Steel Bones was born. And Jorja became its youth ambassador. Her role involves lending an ear to new amputees and giving advice. Recently, she helped a 15-year-old boy and his mum who were worried he'd be bullied when he returned to school after an amputation. She told him bluntly he probably would. “Someone is going to say something to try to bring you down,” she said, but followed it up with advice on how to handle the bullies. “I try my best to help,” she says, explaining that talking to other amputees and their families “feels like it makes you a better person”. “I don't know where she gets her compassion from,” says Gabrielle. “If it were me, I would feel ‘Why me?’ - Jorja thinks ‘Why not me?’” Jorja's other role is fundraising. Steel Bones is the chosen charity for her house at school. On a sunny day in May, Soham Village College swaps morning assembly for a fundraiser on the tennis courts. Cheers go up as students hear they've raised £574.06 for Jorja's charity by saving their loose change. With it, they spell out Steel Bones on the courts, send a drone into the blue sky and film their endeavours. Jorja, an aspiring actor, is chatty and funny with a natural confidence not usually found in 12-year-olds. She's determined that in the future we should see a more realistic portrayal of disabled people on our screens. As we chat at her home in Isleham village, near Cambridge, her mum brings in an official-looking envelope addressed to Jorja which arrived that morning. It's a cheque from Cambridgeshire's Lord Lieutenant's Office for £150 to help Jorja and Gabrielle enjoy the big day. Gabrielle suggests Jorja buys some birthstone earrings she's fallen for. But Jorja has other ideas - she wants to get something for her Nanny and a toy for her little brother. As Lucian, five, playfights with his big sister, German TV are on the phone trying to get an interview with Jorja. There's been interest from French TV, Good Morning America and CNN too. Is she feeling famous? Maybe, she replies, midway through a make-up rehearsal. Gabby predicts Jorja will be up at 3am on the day of the wedding to perfect her look. They joke about preparing a picnic of cucumber sandwiches - “If it's not posh enough, security won't let us in.” Jorja's favourite royal is Prince Harry and she's looking forward to seeing what Meghan will be wearing. “I think it's good that they're not just inviting politicians, and I get to go and Donald Trump doesn't,” she says, twirling around the lounge in her wedding make-up and dress. Worcestershire Laura and her mum, Helen, are on a shopping trip in London's West End in search of the perfect outfit. With a TV crew in tow, they pore over the rails - their stylist for the day casting aside anything that's not “autumn” colours. Laura, who will turn 31 in the days before the royal wedding, is adamant she won't wear a dress. “I want trousers. I've always been a tomboy.” She's given the matter a lot of thought as she has weddings on her mind - and not just Harry and Meghan's. Laura and her boyfriend, Ray, have been dating for six months and recently got engaged. They plan to marry next year. “The only day I'll wear a dress is on the day of my wedding,” she says. “Then it'll be leggings with a [detachable] skirt that I'll whip off after the first dance.” Finding an outfit will not be the only challenge for Laura who has autism and learning disabilities. In a London square, she squints against the bright sunshine at a bank of grass dotted with daisies. “I see a different picture,” she explains. “When I look at loads of flowers, I will take twice as long to realise what they are.” The wedding, she admits, will be difficult but her mum will be by her side. New things are scary for her but Helen says she'll do all she can to reduce Laura's anxiety by travelling to Berkshire the day before and having the journey well-planned. Both worry how Laura will cope with the queues - she's not good in queues. However, Laura is looking forward to celebrity-spotting and chatting with the “other commoners” in the castle grounds. They'll take their own picnic (chicken and mayo for Laura, and a celebratory chocolate bar), a rug and some comfy shoes. “It's a nice feeling that they've invited us,” she reflects, looking across at her mum. “It was hard to believe - it's the first time I've been to a royal wedding.” She was chosen, she says, because of all her charity work - “I'm non-stop”. For six years, Laura has made sure young people with learning disabilities in Worcester have a safe but buzzing place to get together, make friends and have fun. The Monday Night Club was launched in the years after Laura left college when she found her social life slipping away, like many others with learning disabilities. It's not a problem she has any more. Now, on Monday nights 100 or more clubbers pack out the venue to “sing like Elvis and dance like Michael Jackson”. Laura, who often DJs, keeps regulars on the dancefloor with pop, RnB and even the Neighbours theme tune, if that's their thing. She's also chair of Worcestershire's People's Parliament, which presses for change to improve the lives of people with learning disabilities. The group has introduced a travel wallet, with space for a bus pass and cards saying “Speak slowly” and “Can you tell me when I arrive at my stop?” They are looking to get tenancy agreements printed in Easy Read, which would cut down long, complex documents into plain English with helpful illustrations. Laura also squeezes football coaching into her busy weeks. Again, it's about giving people with learning and physical disabilities something they can't get anywhere else. “They're allowed to break the rules, shout, have a paddy - we don't mind,” says Helen. It's now 18 months since Laura moved into a place of her own. She's also bringing up Prince, a Cockapoo puppy, who's being trained to become a learning assistance dog. The other day someone said to me “This girl's got it going on”, says Laura. Her mum puts it another way. “She works so hard and so many people benefit from what she does,” says Helen. It's an unseasonably hot day in April when Laura and Helen are given VIP treatment at one of Oxford Street's biggest department stores. Laura tries on a sequinned fascinator, drawing oohs from her small retinue. “Is this it, Mum?” she asks. It's handmade and costs £300. “No,” says Helen firmly. The stylist holds up an orange tropical print jumpsuit. “It's too much,” says Laura. “I don't want to take attention away from Meghan.” Built with Shorthand"
Comic legend Stan Lee sues old firm Pow!,"Stan Lee is the co-creator of Spiderman and numerous other Marvel characters Stan Lee is suing the entertainment company he co-founded for $1bn (Â£742m), according tolegal documents,external. The comic book legend alleges he was coerced into a fraudulent sales agreement when he was in an emotionally and physically fragile state. The complaint, filed in LA on Tuesday, claims Pow! Entertainment made Lee, 95, sign over his name and image rights. Pow! later issued a statement insisting that Lee had ""clearly understood"" the terms of the agreement. ""The allegations are completely without merit,""a company representative told the Hollywood Reporter,external. ""In particular, the notion that Mr Lee did not knowingly grant Pow! exclusive rights to his creative works or his identity is so preposterous that we have to wonder whether Mr Lee is personally behind this lawsuit.""

Stan Lee on how to create a super-hero Pow!'s parent company, Hong Kong-based Camsing International Holding, said it was seeking legal advice. Pow! Entertainment has previously expressed ""concern"" over Lee's wellbeing. Lee is the co-creative force behind many superhero characters, including Black Panther and Spider-Man. The lawsuit alleges Pow! chief executive Shane Duffy and co-founder Gill Champion ""conspired and agreed to broker a sham deal to sell Pow! to a company in China and fraudulently steal Stan Lee's identity, name, image, and likeness as part of a nefarious scheme to benefit financially at Lee's expense"". The complaint, lodged at Los Angeles County Superior Court, states Lee does not recall signing sale documents, nor having them read to him. Joan Lee, Stan's wife of almost 70 years, died last July aged 95 The suit draws attention to thedeath of Lee's wife last July, and his degenerative eye condition which has caused his poor eyesight, suggesting he could not have read the documents.

US 'still hopeful' about N Korea summit,"This video can not be played Why North Korea is angry at this man The Trump administration is hopeful its summit with North Korea will go ahead, despite threats of cancellation. A White House spokesperson said the US president remained ready. Hours earlier, North Korea released an angry statement saying it might pull out of the meeting if the US insisted it gave up its nuclear weapons unilaterally. The highly anticipated meeting between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un is due to take place on 12 June. ""The president is ready if the meeting takes place,"" said White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders. ""If it doesn't, we'll continue the maximum pressure campaign that's been ongoing."" When asked if it would go ahead, Mr Trump later said: ""We'll have to see"". He reiterated that the US would still insist on denuclearisation. Analysis: This is Kim's warning shot to the White House North Korea crisis in 300 words The groundbreaking agreement for Mr Kim and Mr Trump to meet came about as North Korea said it was committed to denuclearising the Korean peninsula. Exactly what that would entail has remained unclear but North Korea has invited foreign media to witness the dismantling of its main nuclear test site later this month. North Korea's statement, carried by state media, said the country had had high expectations from the summit, but it was ""totally disappointed"" by recent reckless remarks from the US. What Kim wants Read North Korea's statement in full It pointed the finger squarely at US National Security Adviser John Bolton. ""We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him,"" said the statement, which was written by Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan. The words of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un are being closely followed on South Korean television In a television interview at the weekend, Mr Bolton said North Korea could follow a ""Libya model"" of verifiable denuclearisation, but this alarms Pyongyang, which watched Libya's Colonel Gaddafi give up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. After the North Korean outburst, Mr Bolton told Fox News Radio that the odds are still in favour of the meeting going ahead. ""We are trying to be both optimistic and realistic at the same time,"" he said. By Laura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul Nuclear weapons have been central to North Korean ideology for its entire history The whole reason the North Korean state has spent years building up a nuclear arsenal, at such a great cost, is for survival. So to compare denuclearisation in North Korea with Libya or indeed Iraq as John Bolton did on Sunday is not going to offer much comfort.Both regimes collapsed. This is also a warning shot to the Trump administration. They will be aware how much Mr Trump wants this summit and how it is being spun as a success brought about by his maximum pressure strategy. There were signs this boasting irritated Pyongyang, but now it has decided to speak out through someone in a position of power. The release of three Americans from prison was a major concession by North Korea North Korea wants the world to know that it is coming to the negotiating table from a position of strength, and they may feel that they are making all the concessions. They've suspended all missile tests,released the three US detainees, Kim Jong-un met President Moonand the pair signed a declaration, and they're about to dismantle a nuclear test site in front of international media. So to hear the Trump administration claiming credit for a deal they don't like has been a step too far. These statements more than hint that North Korea is prepared to walk away from President Trump's summit in Singapore until it does hear a deal it does like. Kim Kye-gwan said:  ""If the US is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue."" The vice-foreign minister is known to be highly respected in the North Korean leadership and has taken part in negotiations with the US before. There is very little chance his comments were not personally endorsed by Kim Jong-un. Will historic Koreas summit lead to peace? Hours before the announcement, in a sign of growing problems,North Korea had also pulled out of a meeting scheduled with South Korea on Wednesdaybecause of anger over the start of US-South Korea joint military drills. A Chinese government spokesman urged North Korea and the US to ""meet each other halfway"" ahead of negotiations. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies The hawkish conservative is a firm defender of US power and a confrontational advocate for wielding that strength abroad. He has previously said it would be ""perfectly legitimate"" to carry out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea. In media interviews over the weekend, he said North Korea could follow a Libyan model of nuclear disarmament - Libya gave up its weapons' programmes in the early 2000s and only then secured economic aid and normalised relations with the US. However during the 2011 uprising against Colonel Gaddafi's regime, Western powers intervened in Libya in favour of the rebels, and Gaddafi was captured and killed.

Trump discloses Stormy Daniels settlement,"This video can not be played Was Trump's Stormy Daniels payment legal? US President Donald Trump has officially disclosed his reimbursement to his lawyer, who paid a porn star to hush up her claims of an affair. The Office of Government Ethics found on Wednesday that Mr Trump ought to have revealed the payment in his previous financial disclosure. The filing shows he paid Michael Cohen between $100,001 (Â£75,000) and $250,000 for expenses incurred in 2016. Mr Trump previously denied knowing of the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. The conflicting statements in the Stormy Daniels saga The president and the porn star: Why this matters The big question at heart of Stormy Daniels saga This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: ""I was threatened"" The White House stated in a footnote to the filing that it was listing the payment ""in the interest of transparency"", and contended it did not have to make the disclosure. However, the head of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE)wrote in a letter,externalthat ""the payment made by Mr Cohen is required to be reported"" in the liabilities section of the statement. In his letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the OGE acting director said: ""You may find the disclosure relevant to any inquiry you may be pursuing."" The deputy attorney general is overseeing the Department of Justice investigation into whether Trump aides colluded with alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. The Stormy Daniels payment is a potential legal problem for the president because it could be seen as an illegal campaign contribution. Mr Cohen, whose records relating to the settlement were seized in an FBI raid last month, is now reportedly under criminal investigation. Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges that she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada, in 2006. Mr Trump's lawyer said his client ""vehemently denies"" the claim. If the actress's account is true, the tryst would have happened just a few months after Melania Trump gave birth to her son, Barron, whose father is Mr Trump. Stormy Daniels says she had sex with Mr Trump at a Lake Tahoe hotel in 2006 In April, Mr Trump said he was unaware Mr Cohen had paid Ms Daniels just before the 2016 election. Mr Trump's payment to Mr Cohen was first confirmed a fortnight ago by Rudy Giuliani, another of the president's attorneys, in a television interview. Mr Giuliani said the transaction was to keep Ms Daniels quiet about her ""false and extortionist accusation"" that she had sex with Mr Trump, suggesting her claim could have damaged his candidacy. Later that week, the president said the newly hired Mr Giuliani needed time to ""get his facts straight"". Also on Wednesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee backed up the American intelligence community's findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 US election to help Mr Trump. The panel's assessment contradictsa conclusion in March by the House Intelligence Committeerejecting allegations that the Kremlin had aimed to boost the Republican candidate's chances. Mr Trump earned $100,000-$1m in royalties from The Art of the Deal in 2017 The disclosure,externalshows millions in 2017 income from rents, licences, book and television royalties, company shares, hotel management fees and golf courses, with interests from India to Dubai. What happened to worries about Trump's business? His Washington hotel in a former Post Office building brought in more than $40m in 2017, its first full year in operation. His golf courses, including the president's Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, did not appear to see major gains, despite frequent visits from the president. Mar-a-Lago contributed $25m in income, compared with about $37m on the previous report. The president reported royalties from his 1987 book The Art of the Deal in the same $100,000-$1m range as he did last year - and sales for some of his lesser titles picked up. Many of his shareholdings are in mutual and index funds, rather than the cross-section of American companies he once owned. What else did we learn from the disclosure?

"Windsor set for royal wedding rehearsalMore than 250 members of the armed forces will be involved, as well as the Ascot Landau carriage.1han hour agoUK","Four Windsor Grey horses will pull the newlyweds in the Ascot Landau carriage A rehearsal of the carriage procession through Windsor for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle is under way. More than 250 members of the armed forces are taking part in the rehearsal - along with the couple's carriage. After tying the knot on Saturday, Harry and Ms Markle will travel through Windsor in the Ascot Landau carriage. Used in official and ceremonial state events, the carriage will be pulled by Windsor grey horses. Royal wedding: All you need to know How to watch the events Princess Charlotte to be bridesmaid Meghan's dad may miss wedding over surgery On Saturday the procession will take place at 13:00 BST, after the hour-long service at St George's Chapel. Members of both families will gather on the steps of the chapel to wave off the newlyweds on their carriage procession, which is expected to last about 25 minutes. The carriage will leave Castle Hill, travel through Windsor and then it will proceed up the Long Walk all the way back to St George's Hall by Windsor Castle. Kensington Palace revealed on Wednesday that Prince Harry's niece, three-year-old Princess Charlotte, will be one of six bridesmaids at the wedding. Her elder brother, Prince George, aged four, will be a pageboy alongside three other young boys. Media tactics unravel in run-up to big day Who is Meghan Markle? What titles might Harry and Meghan get? The 10 children who have been chosen are all aged seven or under. So far, the details of the bridesmaids' dresses and the pageboys' uniforms remain under wraps. Princess Charlotte was a bridesmaid at her aunt's wedding Prince George also comes to the role with experience Ms Markle, 36, will not have a maid of honour because she wanted to avoid choosing between her closest friends. It is still unclear who will walk her down the aisle after it was reported that her father was due to have heart surgery. Thomas Markle had told US website TMZ he would not go to the wedding amid a row over paparazzi photographs; then that he would; then that he could not because of a planned heart procedure. Kensington Palace has declined to comment. Meanwhile, a petition organised by campaign group Republic has been handed to MPs. Signed by 32,000 people, the petition calls on MPs to make the Royal Family pay for the security and policing surrounding Saturday's wedding and for the government to publish a report of all costs to taxpayers. This video can not be played ""The royals should be paying for this wedding"" - Republic Republic chief executive Graham Smith said: ""There is nothing inevitable about the public spending on a royal wedding.

State takeover for failed rail franchise,"This video can not be played Chris Grayling says talk of nationalising the whole rail network was ""missing the point"" Rail services on the East Coast Main Line are being brought back under government control, following the failure of the current franchise. Operators Stagecoach and Virgin Trains will hand over control from 24 June. The Department for Transport will run the service until a new public-private partnership can be appointed in 2020. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said it would smooth the transition to a new operator, but critics said it was evidence of private sector failure. Mr Grayling said the franchise had failed because Stagecoach and Virgin Trains had ""got their bid wrong"", overestimating the profitability of the line. It is the third time in a just over a decade that the government has called a halt to the East Coast franchise. Why East Coast Mainline has hit the buffers Should the UK renationalise the railways? Rail firm changes time of every train The London to Edinburgh line has been run by a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin, since 2015. The companies promised to pay Â£3.3bn to run the franchise until 2023, but at the end of last year it become clear they were running into trouble. In February it was announced that the franchise would end early, leading to accusations the government was bailing them out. This is the third time a franchise on the East Coast Main Line has failed. In 2005, GNER signed a Â£1.35bn, 10-year deal in what was then the biggest contract in European railway history. One year later it was stripped of the route. In August 2007, National Express agreed a Â£1.4bn deal, but then handed it back to the government in 2009 amid the financial crisis. It was then government-run until Stagecoach and Virgin's Â£3.3bn bid in 2015. Read more:What went wrong at the East Coast Main Line? Analysis: By Theo Leggett, business correspondent To have one rail company fail to fulfil its contract may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose three looks like carelessness. The government insists that the East Coast service is not failing, and will continue to generate revenue for the public purse. It says Stagecoach and Virgin have only themselves to blame for their inability to make enough money from the line. That may be true. But critics say that if operators keep over-bidding, then that suggests a problem with the tender process. The assumptions made by the DfT when inviting bids have also been widely questioned. Now the DfT wants to use the line as a model for a new type of franchise, based on a public-private partnership. That may help to solve some issues - for example, reducing the friction between the track operator, Network Rail and the train operator. But whether it will help to make the line viable for the new operator is open to question. Mr Grayling said the companies had overestimated growth in passenger numbers and revenues and were having to reach into their own pockets to fulfil the terms of the franchise. He told the Commons that Stagecoach and Virgin have lost almost Â£200m, but there had not been a loss to taxpayers ""at this time"". The rail companies have blamed their problems on Network Rail, saying it had failed to upgrade the line which would have allowed them to run more frequent services. Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell tweeted that he welcomed the move, which he said was implementing Labour's Manifesto promise to renationalise the railways. Allow Twitter content?

For the next two years the operator of last resort, overseen by the Department of Transport will operate the East Coast Main Line. It will be advised by the engineering firm Arup. In 2020 there will be another tender process for operating the franchise. Mr Grayling would like to see closer co-operation between the state-owned Network Rail which owns the track infrastructure and the private train operators. Despite their failure on the East Coast Main Line, Virgin and Stagecoach will be allowed to bid for future rail franchises. Analysis: By Norman Smith, assistant political editor For a government wedded to the benefits of the private sector and to leaving the railways in the hands of private companies, today's decision is a significant blow. It's also further ammunition for a Corbyn Labour Party committed to renationalising the railways. Mr Grayling may protest that this is only a temporary measure - but it is still the third time in just over a decade that a private company has had to be stripped of the East Coast Main Line contract. There are also likely to be raised eyebrows that despite their failure, Virgin Stagecoach will still be able to bid to run the line again after it is transferred back into public private ownership in 2020. And while memories of British Rail's stale sandwiches may have faded - strikes, costly commuter fares, cramped carriages and failing companies are hardly likely to endear passengers to the current crop of private rail operators. After looking into problems with the service, Mr Grayling said he was advised ""that there is no suggestion of either malpractice or malicious intent in what has happened"". He added that the firms have paid a ""high financial and reputational price"" in relation to the East Coast route. Stagecoach said it had attempted to negotiate a new contract with the Department for Transport, without success. Mr Grayling said passengers and staff would not be affected by the change to the franchise arrangement. He said season tickets, timetables and employment conditions would remain unchanged.

Fixed-odds betting stakes 'to be cut to Â£2',"This video can not be played What are fixed-odds betting terminals? The maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) will be reduced to Â£2 under new rules unveiled by the government. Currently, people can bet up to Â£100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock called the machines ""a very serious social blight"" that ""needs to be tackled"". But bookmakers have warned the cut could lead to thousands of outlets closing. FOBTs generate Â£1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry,according to the Gambling Commission,external, and taxes of Â£400m for the government. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said that in order to ""cover any negative impact on the public finances"" it would increase the Remote Gaming Duty, which is levied against online casino-type games such as blackjack. The current rate operators must pay is 15% compared with a 25% tax on FOBTs. The government will announce the rise in the Budget. William Hill, which generates just over half its retail revenues from FOBTs, described the Â£2 stake limit  as ""unprecedented"" and warned that 900 of its shops could become loss-making, potentially leading to job losses. It said its full-year operating profit could fall by between Â£70m and Â£100m. High stakes for fixed-odds betting machines Racing 'should not be funded on misery' A good bet? The fixed-odds controversy ""Twenty seconds and your wages are gone"" ""I lost Â£5,000 in 48 hours"" Mr Hancock said: ""Sometimes in politics you have the chance to really do something to help people and, in particular, this case to help some very vulnerable people - hundreds of thousands of people who lose thousands of pounds on these machines."" But Betfred's managing director Mark Stebbings claimed the government had ""played politics with people's jobs"" and the move was ""clearly not evidence based but a political decision"". ""This decision will result in unintended consequences including direct and indirect job losses, empty shops on the High Street, and a massive funding hit for the horseracing industry."" Sports Minister Tracey Crouch said: ""We respect and understand that this may have an impact on jobs in bookmakersâ¦ we are working closely with the industry [for them] to be able to grow and contribute to the economy."" The government said the stake limit would come into effect some time next year, but would not set an exact timetable. Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, told the BBC: ""The great tragedy of this is [that] for five years now pretty much everyone in Westminster, Whitehall and in the country has known that these machines have had a very detrimental effect in communities up and down the land."" by Amol Rajan, BBC media editor In taking the most drastic of the options available to them on FOBTs, the government has indicated that gambling is on a journey much like nicotine a generation ago. Many addictive behaviours chart the same course. First, they are commonly accepted, then victims speak out and a campaign is launched. Finally, new laws catch up with a shift in public sentiment. Industry figures argue that what is at stake is not only jobs and revenues for the Exchequer, but the principle that in a free society fully informed adults should be free to spend their money as they choose, so long as it doesn't harm others. Campaigners have successfully argued that the harm to communities and individuals is severe enough to warrant a major change. It's vital to remember that, while FOBTs understandably grab the headlines, this review also looks at the radical shift of the industry online. There many addicts who find there is no respite, and children with smartphones are potentially exposed. Tighter regulation of online gambling is the next battle campaigners intend to win. The government's consultation into gambling machines found consistently high rates of problem gamblers among players of FOBTs ""and a high proportion of those seeking treatment for gambling addiction identify these machines as their main form of gambling"". Anti-gambling campaigners have condemned the machines, saying they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems. This video can not be played Terry White lost up to Â£15,000 per day on fixed-odds betting terminals Matt Zarb-Cousin is now a spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling but was previously addicted to FOBTs. ""It's no exaggeration to call FOBTs the crack cocaine of gambling,"" he has told the BBC. ""If we had a gambling product classification, similar to that of drugs, FOBTs would be class A."" William Hill chief executive Philip Bowcock, said: ""The government has handed us a tough challenge today and it will take some time for the full impact to be understood."" GVC Holdings, which owns Ladbrokes, said it expected profit to be cut by about Â£160m in the first full year that the Â£2 limit is in force. However, Peter Jackson, chief executive at Paddy Power Betfair, welcomed the government intervention, saying his company had been concerned that FOBTs were damaging the reputation of the gambling industry. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA), which receives millions of pounds from bookmakers through a levy, said it would work closely with the government to respond the decision. FOBTs are not the only culprits when it comes to problem gambling. A survey conducted by social research agency NatCen found the top five activities with the highest proportions of problem gamblers were: Spread betting, where bets are placed on whether an outcome will be above or below an offered range (20.1%) Betting exchanges, where your bet on the outcome of an event is matched with someone with the opposing bet (16.2%) Playing poker in pubs or clubs (15.9%) Betting on events with a bookmaker, not online (15.5%) Playing machines in bookmakers, including FOBTs (11.5%) The most popular types of gambling in the country - National Lottery draws, other lotteries and scratchcards  - are associated with the lowest levels of problem gambling.

Why East Coast hit the buffers,"Sir Richard Branson and team on East Coast For the third time in just over a decade the government has called a halt to the East Coast Main Line rail franchise. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling says it will be run by his department until 2020 after which it will be in the hands of a public-private partnership. So what led to the decision to ditch the current franchise arrangement? The London to Edinburgh line had been run by a joint venture between Stagecoach, which owns 90% of the franchise, and Virgin, which owns 10% since 2015. The firms agreed to pay Â£3.3bn for the right to run the line, to be paid in instalments over the course of the franchise until 2023. In return for paying those premiums, Stagecoach and Virgin operated trains on the line which runs from London's Kings Cross station, up through Peterborough and passes through York and Newcastle on its way to Edinburgh. Three years into its eight-year franchise, Virgin and Stagecoach made it clear the arrangement was unsustainable: they weren't making enough money. The government says the firms were over-optimistic about an expected increase in passenger numbers when they made their initial bid. The firms themselves and Sir Richard Branson, boss of Virgin in particular, said the two companies had been promised a huge upgrade of the tracks by Network Rail, which would have improved reliability and allowed more services to run, carrying more passengers. Sir Richard said delays to the upgrade had ""torpedoed"" the assumptions behind the original bid. In February Mr Grayling said the franchise would be replaced with an alternative arrangement and began looking at options. On the face of it, the government will lose the remaining Â£2.3bn of the Â£3.3bn promised by the franchise. However, the amount it will lose or gain ultimately will depend on what sort of money the replacement service can generate. The East Coast mainline was government-run until Stagecoach and Virgin's bid Because Stagecoach and Virgin are escaping some of their scheduled payments, critics said halting the franchise early amounted to ""a bail-out"" by the taxpayer of the private sector operators. Both the firms and the government reject that suggestion. Stagecoach and Virgin Trains have lost in the region of Â£200m to keep up their franchise payments. Although the line is profitable, it isn't bringing in enough revenues to cover those commitments. Mr Grayling said Stagecoach and Virgin, as well as the financial losses, had suffered reputational damage. But he added they wouldn't be excluded from bidding to run other parts of the network in future. For two years the line will be state-run, by an operator of last resort, set up and overseen by the department of transport but involving private sector firms including engineering firm Arup. Passengers and staff shouldn't see any disruption to day-to-day services, according to the transport secretary. After 2020 the aim is that there will be much closer cooperation between state-owned Network Rail, which owns the track infrastructure, and whoever is operating the train service. The East Coast Mainline, which is being renamed London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), a brand that has been resurrected from the 1940s, will then be run by a public-private partnership. This is the third franchise on this route to run into trouble. In 2005, GNER signed a Â£1.35bn, 10-year deal in what was then the biggest contract in European railway history. One year later it was stripped of the route. In August 2007, National Express agreed a Â£1.4bn deal, but then handed it back to the government in 2009 against the particularly challenging background of the financial crisis. It was then government-run until Stagecoach and Virgin's Â£3.3bn bid in 2015. What would you like to know about the future of East Coast Mainline rail franchise?

High stakes for fixed-odds betting machines,"The government is set to unveil a shake-up of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) shortly, gaming machines that exist in thousands of bookmakers across the UK. Critics call them the ""crack cocaine"" of the betting world. The industry says they are a vital - and perfectly legal - part of the sector that create jobs, profits and tax revenue for the government. But with punters able to wager up to Â£100 every 20 seconds, there is concern about the social, mental and financial cost. Cutting the bet-per-spin to about Â£30 had been suggested. But now, it seems, the government is considering a limit of Â£2,with reports that the Treasury backs the idea. Here, four voices from both sides outline their arguments. Philip Bowcock is chief executive of William Hill, which makes just over half its retail revenues from gaming machines. He says a Â£2 FOBT limit will have a devastating impact on the High Street betting industry, with up to half of Britain's betting shops facing threat of closure and about 20,000 jobs going"". The 8,000 bookies in the UK employ 50,000 people, pay Â£1bn in tax, and Â£80m to local authorities in rates. ""And when you also consider the knock-on impact on suppliers and horseracing, then the jobs picture is even worse,"" Mr Bowcock adds. Bookmakers contribute about Â£270m to the racing industry. Research by KPMG estimates a Â£2 limit would cut revenue for the Treasury by Â£1.1bn over three years, an annual loss of Â£45m to local authorities and Â£50m to British racing. A big concern for the industry is that a Â£2 limit is being considered despite the government's own advisers pointing to a ""more proportionate response"". That is a reference to reports from the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board and the Gambling Commission. ""Government cannot avoid the loss of High Street jobs where businesses are failing. But they can avoid a decision - not based on evidence - that will put thousands of people out of work."" Matt Zarb-Cousin is now a spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, but at one time was consumed by FOBTs. He skipped college to visit betting shops, and sold possessions on eBay to fund his addiction. And he came close to killing himself. ""It's no exaggeration to call FOBTs the crack cocaine of gambling,"" he says. ""If we had a gambling product classification, similar to that of drugs, FOBTs would be class A."" The speed with which gamblers can lay a bet - every 20 seconds - and the maximum size of the stake - Â£100 - make FOBTs dangerously attractive, he says. ""In the midst of my addiction, I deluded myself that I was one big win away from solving the problems the addiction had caused, which only perpetuated the harmful behaviour. ""I tried to self-exclude from betting shops, but the high staff turnover meant there was no chance I would be recognised and asked to leave,"" Mr Zarb-Cousin says. Drug addiction is neurologically similar to gambling addition, he says. And like some drugs, some types of gambling are more addictive than others. Research by Landman Economics found that there were more than 230,000 FOBT sessions in one year where an individual lost more than Â£1,000, he says. And with the average FOBT user losing Â£192 a month, only by cutting the maximum stake to Â£2 will the government eliminate large-scale losses of more than Â£100 a session. Cutting FOBTs stakes from Â£100 to Â£2 is not only ""disproportionate"", argues Malcolm George, chief executive of the Association of British Bookmakers, but could also ""create a variety of unintended and potentially harmful consequences"". He cites the Gambling Commission's own advice that ""the underlying causes of gambling-related harm are many and complex in nature"" and that a very low FOBT stake limit would make it a ""softer"" form of gambling than is available in arcades, bingo halls and pubs. The latter, he says, are less tightly regulated than betting shops. ""A Â£2 stake on a FOBT doesn't bring the machine into line with other gaming machines on the High Street,"" insists Mr George. ""What it means is that the most you could bet would be Â£6 per minute on a FOBT, but you could bet four times as much per minute on a pub fruit machine (Â£24) or eight times as much on an arcade machine (Â£48)."" A Â£2 stake limit means ""customers will simply go to other venues with fewer controls and move online"". There are other ways to control machine betting, including better use of technology such as algorithmic-based warnings and new ways to block debit card use. He also supports tougher rules on advertising, which he says is more of a concern to the public than gaming machines: ""Parents are far more worried about their children seeing online gambling ads during football matches."" Millionaire Derek Webb was a professional poker player for decades and knows the gambling industry from the inside. He's also the founder and funder of Stop the FOBTs and the Campaign for Fairer Gambling. He says the ""once-a-problem-gambler, always-a-problem-gambler"" attitude ignores that some forms of gambling are more addictive than others. ""Every day, vulnerable persons entering betting offices for the first time are being exposed to the evidentially proven most addictive form of gambling - FOBTs."" He's not anti-gambling, but Mr Webb says the ""only purpose of legalising gambling is to ensure it's taxed and properly regulated. In order to do the latter, regulation has to take into account the impact of stake, speed of play and game design in inducing and exacerbating gambling related harm and crime."" Bookmakers introduced FOBTs on a false pretence, he says, claiming it was akin to betting on a horse race. ""But they're nothing to do with betting - they're gaming machines that facilitate high stakes roulette in easily accessible premises."" Under the 2005 Gambling Act, Britain became the first - and still is the only - country to permit this form of gambling in High Street venues, he says. The Act says gambling must be fair and open, not associated with crime, and not harm the young or vulnerable. ""FOBTs are irreconcilable with the licensing objectives. That evidence is now overwhelming.""

Fixed-odds machines 'ruined my life',"Fixed-odds betting terminals currently allow people in the UK to bet Â£100 every 20 seconds.A 12-week consultation is underwaywhich could potentially cut the maximum stake to Â£2 per game. 53-year-old Terry White, from Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, has lost hundreds of thousands of pounds on fixed-odds machines and is calling for a cap on the number of terminals on the high street. He shares his story: I am a gambler. I've been a gambler all my life. I started 35 years ago and the majority of bets were on horses and sport. There was a skill element to it - that horse is going to win or Liverpool are going to win tonight. You could do your research and become good at it. And I was good at it. I won about Â£250,000 over 25 years. But it was soft, recreational gambling. Then one day I walked into a betting shop and there were these machines there. They looked like the sort of machines you would find in arcades or at the seaside - they looked fun. In the early days, just after the millennium, the machines had a limit of Â£5 or Â£10 and it was Â£1 per spin. It would take about 10 minutes to play Â£10. Over the next few years they increased it to Â£100 per spin, which only took 20 seconds. Effectively, you could lose Â£300 in a minute. Even if you were winning you could lose several thousand pounds in an hour. Gamblers need help to beat problem, says addict Fixed-odds betting machines have games similar to fruit machines, as well as roulette and blackjack The adrenaline is completely different because it is all happening live, in front of you. I was bored gambling on sport and I sought a fresh buzz. But you leave yourself at the behest of a random number generator and soon I realised I was losing between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000 per week. One week I lost Â£40,000 of profit and it left me stunned and shocked and ashamed of myself for blowing all my money in one afternoon in a betting shop. I have lost about a quarter of a million in total. I take responsibility for my actions but my addiction is overwhelming. I have suffered bereavements over the last few years and when my depression was getting worse I would go into a betting shop. It became a crutch but also a burden. I lost my house, I've stolen, I've lied to people. To this day I'm Â£40,000 in debt. I'm moving into council accommodation soon, otherwise I would have been homeless. I could be declared bankrupt soon. The low point was a suicide attempt in December. I was in hospital for three days. The pain of the addiction hits you from the moment you wake up and I've got nothing left to live for. The fact this is all on the high street is a nightmare for an addict. I would not go to a casino because of the effort of getting dressed up and going to a venue, but there are at least seven on the high street in Barry and you cannot go into a betting shop without seeing a machine. I'll go weeks without food and neglect my health. I haven't left the house for 15 days as I try to force myself to go cold turkey. I am scared of going grocery shopping in case I end up in a betting shop and I am getting no help or therapy for my illness. I still have a compulsion to go into betting shops. Now my body is used to Â£60 spins I could not go back to playing with Â£5 because I'll always be thinking ""why didn't I bet more?"" The limits on winnings are also a problem. As a gambler there's a compulsion to win your money back but you need to win twice to win back 10 spins. Gamble Aware,externalhave a motto: ""When the fun stops - stop"". But gambling is not fun. When you're gambling your wages, your benefits or your life savings it cannot possibly be fun. But the moment the credit is in the machine in front of me I am relaxed. When it is gone I am just thinking about where my next amount of money is coming from. I hope people realise this can happen to anybody. I like to think I'm an intelligent person but this compulsion has ruined my life. My message is to stop going into these places, because you cannot beat them.

Brexit bill suffers 15th Lords defeat,"The government's flagship Brexit bill is to return to the House of Commons having suffered a total of 15 defeats in the Lords. Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said he had ""a tremendous sigh of relief"" as he wound up proceedings. Labour urged Theresa May to take a ""pragmatic view"" of all the changes proposed by peers. The 15th defeat came on the issue of environmental protection standards after Brexit. Peers voted by a majority of 50 to say the government should set up a body to maintain EU standards. Other defeats inflicted in the House of Lords - where the government does not have a majority - came on the customs union, the Irish border and removing the precise date of Brexit - 29 March 2019 - from the legislation. Government defeated on Brexit deal vote Fresh Lords defeat for Brexit bill MPs will now debate the amendments when the bill returns to the Commons, with no date officially set so far. ""No one can be in any doubt that we have listened,"" Lord Callanan told peers. ""The government has suffered defeats on 15 issues. ""Although I regret the number of defeats I am grateful to those many Lords who I think have worked constructively to improve the bill. ""This House has done its duty as a revising chamber. The bill has been scrutinised."" Labour's Lords Leader Baroness Smith said the bill was now ""in better shape"". ""I hope Mrs May will take a pragmatic view of how best to proceed rather than follow a purely ideological route that rejects sensible amendments,"" she added. The bill's 15 defeat came over environmental standards Earlier, peers backed a cross-party amendment designed to ensure EU environmental principles continue to have a basis in domestic law at the end of the post-Brexit transition period in December 2020. It requires the environment secretary to bring forward proposals for primary legislation to create a duty on public authorities to apply these principles, and to establish an independent public body to ensure compliance. Lord Krebs, who instigated the move, argued that while EU rules would be carried over into UK law, environmental principles underpinning them would not. Ministers had promised a consultation on the issue but lost by 294 to 244. Lord Krebs, the former chair of the Food Standards Agency, said he was ""not satisfied"" with the idea of a consultation and wanted guarantees that existing principles will continue to apply and be enforced. ""We have heard many times that the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that everything is the same the day after Brexit as it was the day before,"" he said. ""Yet for environmental protection things will not be the same. We're talking about the protection of our air quality, our water quality, rivers, oceans, habitats and biodiversity."" Lord Callanan argued the proposed change was ""premature"" in that it prejudged a period of consultation and would ""ultimately be detrimental to the future protection of environmental law"".

Nassar abuse victims get $500m settlementMore than 300 women and girls who accuse the ex-sports doctor of sexual assault will receive $500m.5h5 hours agoUS & Canada,"Three of Nassar's victims (L-R) - Jade Capua, Kyle Stephens, Alexis Moore - confronted Nassar in court earlier this year Michigan State University has agreed to pay $500m (Â£371m) to gymnasts who were abused by ex-team doctor Larry Nassar. The deal was announced by a California law firm representing 332 victims of Nassar, who assaulted women and girls under the guise of medical treatment. The deal does not include any non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements, according to a statement from lawyers and the university. It does not address allegations against other groups for which Nassar worked. It does not address claims against USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee, or the owners of the Texas facility where gymnasts trained, according to a statement from the California law firm of Manly, Stewart & Finaldi in Los Angeles. According to the lawyers, $425m will be paid to the claimants, and another $75m would be set aside for any future allegations against Nassar, 54, and the university. The lawyers' statement does not address how the money will be allocated to each of Nassar's accusers. The 156 women who confronted a predator Why are some US prison sentences so long? ""This historic settlement came about through the bravery of more than 300 women and girls who had the courage to stand up and refuse to be silenced,"" attorney John Manly said in the statement on Wednesday. He added that it is their ""hope"" that ""the legacy of this settlement"" will serve to eradicate abuse in US sport. The university's board chairman Brian Breslin also issued a written statement saying: ""We are truly sorry to all the survivors and their families for what they have been through, and we admire the courage it has taken to tell their stories."" This video can not be played What it was like to testify against Larry Nassar ""We recognise the need for change on our campus and in our community around sexual assault awareness and prevention"" he continued. Analysis by Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Washington Many of the young women who survived Larry Nassar's sexual abuse weren't just angry at what he had done to them, but at the institutions they felt had enabled him. Michigan State University was where he worked for decades, and many of the young gymnasts felt their complaints to staff there went ignored. This settlement is an acknowledgement from the university that they could have done things so very differently. But for some survivors, like Rachel Denhollander, the first woman to go public with her story, there is a long way to go. She says she is grateful for the settlement, but disappointed at the ""missed opportunity for reform"" at the university. For so many of the women I watched in court throughout the harrowing sentencing earlier this year, speaking out wasn't just about getting justice for themselves - but about changing attitudes and processes so other survivors of abuse have a voice too. The president of USA Gymnastics, which oversees the US Olympic team, as well as the entire board of directors resigned after at least 156 women came forward to testify against the disgraced ex-doctor. Earlier this year, the university's president and director of athletics resigned amid claims that school officials had been told of allegations against Nassar years ago but failed to act. Michigan police apologise to Nassar victim Former president Lou Anna Simon denied claims of a university cover-up as she stepped down on the same day that Nassar was sentenced for his crimes. The settlement surpasses the $109m that Penn State University agree to pay in 2017 to settle claims by at least 35 people against American football coach Jerry Sandusky. Nassar, 54, was sentenced to more than 100 years in prison for abusing female athletes he was supposed to be treating Nassar is currently being held in federal jail and will likely remain there for the rest of his life. He is serving a 60-year sentence for child pornography. If he is ever released he faces up to 175 years in state jail for sexual assault.

US man killed by exploding vape penThe Florida man's death is is believed to be the first in the US caused by a vape pen.8m8 minutes agoUS & Canada,"Two pieces of the vape pen were in Tallmadge D'Elia's cranium A US man died when a vape pen blew up and projected fragments into his skull, a post-mortem examination has found. Tallmadge D'Elia also suffered burns over 80% of his body in a fire on 5 May caused by the exploding e-cigarette, according to forensic officials. The 38-year-old's body was discovered by firefighters in the burning bedroom of his family home in the beach resort of St Petersburg, Florida. It is believed to be the first US death from a vape pen explosion. The television producer's death has been ruled an accident. Regular vapers falling, suggests US study The Pinellas-Pasco Medical Examiner said the official cause of death was ""projectile wound of head"",external, reports the Tampa Bay Times. Two pieces of the vape pen were found in his cranium, according to the autopsy. This video can not be played Could vaping help smokers stub out cigarettes for good? The report said emergency crews encountered ""extensive"" fire damage to the bedroom where the body was found, but minimal smoke. The electronic cigarette was manufactured by Smok-E Mountain, said the medical examiner. Christopher D'Elia, the dead man's father, told ABC Action News it was a ""terrible shock"",external. ""Anybody who has lost a son doesn't want anybody else to lose a child to something like this,"" he said. It's not entirely clear and is not written in the post-mortem examination report. The vape pen that Mr D'Elia was using was a so-called mechanical mod, meaning it drew power directly from the battery and did not regulate the voltage in the same way as other e-cigarettes. The president of the American Vaping Association told the New York Times that mostother e-cigarettes have more safety features than mechanical mods,external. Such safety features can include computer chips. A representative ofthe manufacturer, Smok-E Mountain, blamed the device's battery for the explosion,externalwhen speaking to ABC Action News. They also said it might have been down to the mouthpiece. Vape pens use lithium-ion batteries, favoured in smartphones and other portable electronic devices because they can provide high amounts of electricity using little space. They are used throughout the world with few incidents, but in 2016 Samsung halted sales of the Galaxy Note 7 phone because some were catching fire when the batteries short-circuited. Why do lithium batteries explode? According to the US Fire Administration,between 2009-16 there were 195 separate incidents of explosions and fires involving an e-cigarette,external, resulting in 133 acute injuries, 38 of them severe. In 2015, an e-cigarette exploded in the face of a 29-year-old Colorado man, breaking his neck and shattering his teeth. A fire in January this year at Denver International Airport was blamed on a vape pen's lithium-ion battery. For safety, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US recommends: using vapes with safety features, like protection against overcharging keeping your vape covered and away from loose coins and batteries using only the approved charger that came with the vape pen to charge it replacing batteries if they get damaged or wet not charging your vape overnight Why do lithium batteries explode?

Dementia patients 'abandoned' by system,"Vulnerable people struggling with dementia have been abandoned by the care system in England, a charity says. The Alzheimer's Society said people had been left to ""fend for themselves"" because of inadequate community care from the NHS and councils. To make its case, the charity published data showing there had been a 73% rise in potentially unnecessary hospital admissions among dementia patients. It comes as ministers draw up plans to reform the council social care system. A Green Paper is being promised by the summer. The Alzheimer's Society said this was desperately needed given the findings of its report. The charity compiled data from 65 hospital trusts - nearly half of the total - on admissions for so-called preventable conditions. These included falls, dehydration and urinary tract infections. With better care and support in the community, admissions for these sort of conditions can be avoided. Between 2012 and 2017 the number of admissions recorded by the trusts rose from just over 31,000 to nearly 55,000. The charity accepts some of the rise could be down to better recording, but said that could not account for the full increase. Leslie was admitted twice to hospital after falls One of those caught up in the problem was Helen Jebson King's father, Leslie. He ended up in hospital twice last year after falls. The first time, he spent months in hospital before being discharged. And then, after his second admission, he died. ""It's so sad because it was so avoidable,"" Helen says. ""It made me realise dementia care is totally broken. ""People with dementia should be protected and supported in their homes, not ending up in hospital. ""It's not the place for them to be, stuck on a ward with no specialist support, feeling restless and confused."" The charity also gathered evidence from paramedics. One said it was ""utterly depressing"" taking people with dementia to hospital for conditions that could have been spotted and treated much earlier. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""No-one with dementia should have to go into hospital unnecessarily, and we're determined to continue drive up standards of care.""
