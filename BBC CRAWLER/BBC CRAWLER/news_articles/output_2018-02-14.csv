Zimbabwe opposition leader Tsvangirai dies,"This video can not be played Morgan Tsvangirai was best known for challenging Robert Mugabe Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has died in South Africa, a senior official in his MDC party has said. Mr Tsvangirai, 65, a former prime minister, had reportedly been suffering from colon cancer. ""He died this evening. The family communicated this to me,"" MDC vice president Elias Mudzuri told Reuters. Mr Tsvangirai's career was marked by a long political struggle against former President Robert Mugabe. He had been beaten and imprisoned numerous times. Obituary: Morgan Tsvangirai Announcing Mr Tsvangirai's death, Mr Mudzuri said on Twitter that the MDC had ""lost our icon and fighter for democracy"". Mr Tsvangirai founded the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) in 2000, repeatedly challenging Mr Mugabe during the ex-president's long grip on power. By Joseph Winter, BBC News online Africa Editor Morgan Tsvangirai was an incredibly brave man who risked his life to stand up to the authoritarian rule of Robert Mugabe. He did not succeed in ousting Mr Mugabe - due to the intimidation of his supporters and some blatant rigging - but he did at least live to see the downfall of his long-time rival. Although he was obviously very sick, he even travelled home from South Africa, where he was being treated, for the occasion. But in purely political terms, Mr Mugabe always managed to get the better of the charismatic former union leader - especially when he was prime minister and they were supposedly sharing power. Some of his ex-comrades in the MDC, which he founded, accused him of dictatorial tendencies and the party split several times. Now, the MDC will have the formidable task of trying to unite and mount a credible challenge to Mr Mugabe's successor Emmerson Mnangagwa in this year's elections. In the 2008 election, Mr Tsvangirai gained the most votes in the first round but not enough to win outright. Before the second round of voting, Mr Mugabe's security forces carried out a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, and Mr Tsvangirai withdrew. Mr Mugabe was declared the winner, but an international outcry over allegations of violence and vote-rigging led to a power sharing agreement in which Mr Tsvangirai would serve as prime minister. Mr Tsvangirai ran against Mr Mugabe again in 2013 but lost by a landslide. The MDC is said to be divided over who should lead it into elections later this year against the governing Zanu-PF party, led by Mr Mugabe's successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa.

Remains of missing French girl found,"MaÃ«lys de Araujo attended the wedding with her parents The remains of a nine-year-old girl who disappeared in the French Alps last August have been found, officials say. Ex-soldier Nordahl Lelandais, 34, admitted killing MaÃ«lys de Araujo ""involuntarily"", without giving details. Both were guests at a wedding. He agreed to co-operate with the police after tiny traces of her blood were found in the boot of his Audi car. The girl went missing in Pont-de-Beauvoisin, north of Grenoble. Her remains were found near the village. Nordahl Lelandais said he ""got rid of the body"" and offered his apologies to the girl's parents, said Grenoble prosecutor Jean-Yves Coquillat. He had previously admitted that MaÃ«lys was in his car on the night she disappeared. The girl's mother, Jennifer Cleyet Marrel, addressed a bitter Facebook message to Mr Lelandais.,external ""We had to wait five and a half months for this monster to finally speak... MaÃ«lys will haunt you nights and days in your prison,"" she wrote in French. ""My little angel, I couldn't protect you from this predator, and this guilt will continue for a long time."" MaÃ«lys was last seen in the early hours of 27 August in the children's area at the wedding venue. On Wednesday Mr Lelandais led investigators to an area near his parents' home at Domessin, not far from Pont-de-Beauvoisin. The search for her remains took police an entire day, involving sniffer dogs working in the mountain snow. French police block off a road near the Chartreuse regional park during Wednesday's search After her disappearance, police questioned all 180 guests, and identified inconsistencies in Mr Lelandais' statements. He was charged a week later, after police discovered DNA belonging to MaÃ«lys on the dashboard of his car. Since then, Mr Lelandais has maintained his innocence, claiming that although the girl may have been in his car, that did not prove his guilt. He was also reported to have spent hours cleaning his car the next day with powerful detergents - something he said he was doing to prepare it for sale. According to French media reports, Mr Lelandais made a confession in prison on Tuesday, after traces of MaÃ«lys' blood were found in his car. France'sLe Parisien newspaper reports that Mr Lelandais refused to provide details,externalabout the girl's death, beyond his insistence it was accidental. A prosecutor, quoted in the French press, said that after MaÃ«lys' death, her body was taken to a location near Mr Lelandais' home. He apparently returned to the wedding for some time, before later recovering the remains and burying them in the Chartreuse mountains. The police investigation included mining his computer and phone for information. Those trawls revealed that, after the disappearance of 23-year-old soldier Arthur Noyer in April 2017, Mr Lelandais searched the internet for ""human body decomposition"". Mr Noyer's skull was found by a walker on 7 September in Montmelian, 16km (10 miles) from ChambÃ©ry. Mr Lelandais lived with his parents, 30km from ChambÃ©ry. He admitted being in the area where Mr Noyer disappeared but denied any involvement in the killing. He was charged in that case in December. Mr Lelandais has been questioned about a number of other missing persons in the region.

Power-sharing talks collapse at Stormont,"This video can not be played DUP had agreed a deal in the talks, says Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill There is ""no current prospect"" of a deal to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader has said. Arlene Foster said the talks failed due to disagreements with Sinn FÃ©in about legislation for the Irish language. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill accused the DUP of having ""collapsed"" the talks process. Both parties have been locked in negotiations in a bid to end the 13-month stalemate at Stormont. Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide NI Assembly divided by Irish language This video can not be played Theresa May's visit distracted from Stormont talks, says the DUP's Simon Hamilton Mrs O'Neill, Sinn FÃ©in's leader at Stormont, said her party had ""reached an accommodation with the leadership of the DUP"" but claimed that the DUP then ""failed to close"" on it. She added that Sinn FÃ©in was in contact with both the UK and Irish governments and would set out its ""considered position"" on Thursday. In her statement, Mrs Foster called on the UK government to set a budget and start making policy decisions for Northern Ireland. The DUP leader said that ""significant gaps"" remained in the discussions between the region's two biggest parties. Talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in had not resulted in a ""balanced package"", said Arlene Foster ""We do not have a fair and balanced package,"" she added, saying that Sinn FÃ©in's demand for legislation to give the Irish language official status in Northern Ireland was a key dividing issue. ""I respect the Irish language and those who speak it but in a shared society this cannot be a one-way street,"" she added. ""Respect for the unionist and British identity has not been reciprocated."" The DUP would continue to aim for a restoration of devolution, she said, but it would ""not accept a one-sided deal"". Karen Bradley said the UK government would have to take decisions for Northern Ireland After the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in blamed each other for the failure of the talks, the Northern Ireland secretary signalled that a deal remained possible. ""I believe the basis for an accommodation still exists,"" said Karen Bradley. ""We will continue to work with everyone to make sure we deliver this."" But Mrs Bradley added that the UK government would ""need to consider practical steps"" in the ""continued absence"" of devolution. She said ""challenging decisions"" would have to be taken and added that she intends to update MPs in Parliament next week. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar tweeted that he regretted the DUP's statement and that ""power sharing and working together are the only way forward"". Allow Twitter content?

Analysis:BBC News NI political correspondent Enda McClafferty At Stormont on Wednesday, you could sense that things were not going well behind the scenes. There was a great sense of optimism last week. But it became pretty clear there was a standoff developing after Tuesday. Arlene Foster had appeared before the cameras and said thata stand-alone Irish language act was not something the DUP could accept. Sinn FÃ©in came out and said there would be no deal unless it included one of those. We understand both parties met on Wednesday morning and quickly realised there was going to be no middle ground on an Irish language act. Then it was a matter of who was going to pull the plug first. Reporters were waiting in Stormont's Great Hall and we all thought we would hear from Sinn FÃ©in first. Then the statement from Mrs Foster popped up on Twitter, making it very clear that this phase of negotiations was over. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was ""disappointed"" and ""angry"" at the failure of the talks, and claimed it had left the Good Friday Agreement ""in peril"". He said the Stormont parties must resist a return to direct rule from Westminster, with ""the DUP having the whip hand"". Under an agreement struck last summer, the Conservative government relies on the DUP's support to stay in power at Westminster. Colum Eastwood said the SDLP would resist a return to direct rule from Westminster Mr Eastwood said the parties must ""not allow this moment to be the destruction of all that we have achieved"". ""We can't allow this British government, or this DUP to think that they're going to govern Northern Ireland on their own - that cannot be allowed to happen,"" the SDLP leader said. Robin Swann, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), described the talks process as a ""shambles"". He said: ""What I think we need to know, and what Northern Ireland clearly needs to know, is the door to devolution now firmly closed?"" Mr Swann called on the Northern Ireland secretary to provide clarity on whether it was the end of the talks or whether more negotiations were planned. Robin Swann questioned whether the talks breakdown meant devolution was finished The leader of Alliance Party, Naomi Long, said there was ""no prospect of a deal and no process in place that could lead to a deal"". ""We are in a very precarious situation at this point in time, we are essentially in uncharted territory,"" she added. Hopes of an imminent deal had been ""falsely raised"" over the weekend, she said, and ""now we have seen them dashed yet again"". Speculation of a breakthrough mounted over the weekend, as both the UK and Irish leaders prepared to travel to Stormont to help seal a deal. But Prime Minister Theresa May and Mr Varadkarleft Belfast on Monday with no sign of agreement. The visits by the UK and Irish PMs on Monday failed to secure a breakthrough Former DUP minister Simon Hamilton described their visit as ""a bit of a distraction"". ""I don't think it was entirely helpful in getting us to a successful conclusion,"" he told a press conference on Wednesday. Northern Ireland has been run by civil servants since the power-sharing executive made up of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed in January last year. The then deputy first minister Martin McGuinness pulled Sinn FÃ©in out of the coalition after a bitter split between the governing parties. Londonderry Chamber of Commerce President, Jennifer McKeever said the lack of a deal was ""disappointing and frustrating"". ""The collapse of the latest round of talks will come as another body blow for businesses in the North West which are facing the greatest economic challenge of our generation,"" she said. ""Thirteen months is too long to be without devolved government and the lack of leadership from Stormont in the Brexit negotiations has been particularly frustrating for the business community,"" she added.

"Catholic charity sacks former Oxfam workerCafod said it was unaware of abuse allegations, while Oxfam loses another celebrity ambassador.10m11 minutes agoUK","The sacked worker had been among the Oxfam staff in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake A Catholic charity has sacked a worker after it emerged he had been accused of sexually exploiting vulnerable people in Haiti while working for Oxfam. Cafod said it was ""unaware"" of the claims until contacted this week by the Times, which broke the Oxfam story. Meanwhile, Sengalese singer Baaba Maal has told BBC Newsnight he is standing down from his role as a global ambassador to Oxfam after six years. The star said he found the sex abuse claims ""disgusting and heartbreaking"". Describing the allegations as ""very sad"", Maal said he was ""disassociating"" himself from Oxfam ""immediately"". Maal was one of 14 global ambassadors for Oxfam International. Others include singer Annie Lennox, the band Coldplay, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and the model Helena Christensen. However, Glastonbury festival founder Michael Eavis defended Oxfam, calling it a ""wonderful"" charity. Speaking at the NME Awards, he said the festival had raised Â£6m for the charity, and planned to continue its support. Mr Eavis added that ""a few dodgy people"" should not discredit its good work. Earlier, actressMinnie Driver stood down from her ambassador rolewith Oxfam, saying she was ""nothing short of horrified"" by the allegations. Baaba Maal has been an Oxfam global ambassador since 2012 Pressure on Oxfam has been growing after allegations first arose last week about its handling of allegations of sexual misconduct by its aid workers in Haiti. The charity, which denies covering up the behaviour of its staff following an earthquake in the country in 2010, is being investigated by the Charity Commission. The charities regulator said it would announce the scope of its statutory inquiry,externalinto Oxfam on Thursday. Oxfam said it would co-operate with the inquiry and recognised it was in the public interest to be ""transparent and accountable"" and that lessons are learned. Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? It comes as Cafod, an international development charity, said it has sacked an employee implicated in claims sexually exploitation in Haiti. The charity said the man had applied for the job in 2014. References were provided from his previous employers and from somebody the worker said was a former line manager from Oxfam, Cafod added. This video can not be played Sexual misconduct ""happens at every agency"",  says an ex-UN aid worker He was dismissed on Wednesday when Oxfam confirmed claims he was among its ex-workers who had been accused of sexual misconduct. Cafod said it was ""committed to a zero-tolerance approach to misconduct"" and the employee's failure to disclose the circumstances of his departure from Oxfam were in breach of its code of behaviour. The charity has also reviewed two historical cases of sexual misconduct allegations against other employees. One yielded no evidence and one saw a staff member dismissed. In other developments: International aid group Doctors Without Borders said it handled 24 cases of harassment or sexual abuse last year More than 1,000 people cancelled their regular donations to Oxfamover the weekend Organisations including Marks & Spencer and the Duke of Edinburgh's (DofE) Award say they are considering their association with the charity International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is to speak to the National Crime Agency (NCA) about the Oxfam case. Oxfam said it sacked its country director in Haiti, Damien Berrendorf, last year, following allegations of ""mismanagement"" and ""inappropriate behaviour"" which were reported through its own whistleblowing line. The charity said the dismissal was not related to sexual misconduct nor the 2011 case. Speaking to the BBC, Oxfam's regional director in Asia for the last two years, Lan Mercado, revealed she is aware ofallegations of sexual abuse against staff in the Philippines, Bangladesh and Nepalfrom 2009-2013. Lan Mercado took up her post as Oxfam's Asia regional director in 2016 Ms Mercado said the scale of misconduct was ""not comparable"" to that in Haiti and while it had been dealt with internally ""according to specified policies"", it would be wrong to say the incidents were covered up. But she said alerting the authorities and other charities about allegations was a ""practice that we need to start"".

Uncle jailed for freezer body murder,"Celine Dookhran was found dead in an empty house in Kingston, south-west London An uncle has been jailed for life for kidnapping, raping and slitting the throat of his niece before putting her body in a deep freezer. Mujahid Arshid, 33, was found guilty of murdering Celine Dookhran, 20, and the attempted murder of a second woman. Arshid, who will serve at least 40 years in prison, snatched the women in July before taking them to a house in Kingston, south west London. His co-accused, Vincent Tappu, 28, was cleared of kidnapping charges. Both defendants were cleared of possession of a firearm with intent for allegedly using a Taser during the abduction, which took place on 19 July 2017. Arshid, of Homefield Gardens, Mitcham, has also been convicted of sexual assault charges against the second woman between 2008 and 2010. Killer told police of rape plan before kidnap Members of Ms Dookhran's family shouted ""yes"" when the verdicts were read out. Arshid reacted by shouting that the surviving victim had ""killed them all"", while Mr Tappu - in tears - thanked the jury. Mujahid Arshid denied raping and murdering his niece Celine Dookhran The surviving victim took to the witness box to face Arshid and read her own victim impact statement. She said ""flashbacks and nightmares prevent me from moving on"" and physical scarring from the attack is a ""constant reminder of what Celine and I went through"". A statement from Ms Dookhran's mother Iman was read out, in which she said her daughter ""fell victim to pure evil"" and that ""coming to terms with her death is likely to be a lifelong assignment"". ""She will always be there in the darkness that surrounds us,"" the statement added. The women were put in the boot of a vehicle and driven to an empty six-bedroom house in Kingston Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC said Arshid was obsessed with his niece Ms Dookhran, who worked in a bank. Arshid spent weeks planning to abduct and kill both women in a plot that was as ""bizarre as it is terrible"", Mr Aylett said. While Mr Tappu was cleared of kidnap, Mr Justice Edis said he was ""satisfied"" a ""second man"" helped with the initial abduction. This video can not be played The surviving victim's family said the crime was not an honour killing The court heard there had been unhappiness in Ms Dookhran's family about a relationship she was in and that she had been staying at a property occupied by Mr Arshid after leaving home. The evening before the murder there had been a family meeting attended by Mr Arshid during which pressure was placed on Ms Dookhran and her boyfriend to end their association, jurors heard. At the empty six-bedroom house in Kingston, Arshid raped both women in turn before slashing Ms Dookhran's throat in the bathroom. The second woman, who cannot be identified, was badly injured but managed to escape after talking Arshid round. Speaking to police from her hospital bed, she described hearing screams and thuds as Arshid killed Ms Dookhran while she was tied to a chair downstairs. The woman fought for her life when Arshid turned on her, cutting her throat and wrists. In court, the defendants watched a police interview the surviving woman gave from her hospital bed She told officers: ""He said: 'Now you've got 10 minutes to live and your body will shut down.' I was trying to play dead. ""He molested Celine's body while she was dead and then he molested me thinking I was dead. He's such a psycho. ""I sat up and he said: 'How have you got so much energy?' I was covered in blood from head to toe. I was swimming in it. ""I started saying things he wanted to hear - 'I love you, we can run away together, we can be happy together, we can have a family'. ""He said 'I'm not good enough for you, look what I have done'."" She told the court: ""I'm not going to lie, I was scared for my life. I thought, if we get out alive, he cannot get away with this."" Celine Dookhran's phone was found in Arshid's Folkestone hotel room after the killing Arshid was arrested at a hotel in Folkestone, Kent, the morning after Ms Dookhran was killed. Det Ch Insp Sam Price described Arshid's actions as a ""sexually motivated attack of unspeakable violence and horror."" She added: ""Celine's family have been forced to sit through weeks of reliving their daughter's last hours and they have done this with absolute dignity. ""Their distress has been compounded by the fact Arshid was someone they knew and trusted."" Mujahid Arshid has been convicted on a number of counts including sexually abusing his surviving victim a decade ago - so could he have been stopped before he became a killer? His surviving victim alerted some members of her family to his behaviour in 2011, but her story was not accepted. It was two years later that Arshid came on to the police radar when he was caught in an operation aimed at trapping paedophiles. The Crown Prosecution Service wanted to bring a case, but they could not because the police failed to find Arshid's laptop. This police investigation will now form part of a review. It is only when that is complete that it will become clear whether a missed opportunity developed into a fatal chain of events.

Catholic charity sacks former Oxfam workerCafod said it was unaware of abuse allegations against the aid worker until they were exposed this week.2h2 hours agoUK,"The sacked worker had been among the Oxfam staff in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake A Catholic charity has sacked a worker after it emerged he had been accused of sexually exploiting vulnerable people in Haiti while working for Oxfam. Cafod said it was ""unaware"" of the claims until contacted this week by the Times, which broke the Oxfam story. Meanwhile, Sengalese singer Baaba Maal has told BBC Newsnight he is standing down from his role as a global ambassador to Oxfam after six years. The star said he found the sex abuse claims ""disgusting and heartbreaking"". Describing the allegations as ""very sad"", Maal said he was ""disassociating"" himself from Oxfam ""immediately"". Maal was one of 14 global ambassadors for Oxfam International. Others include singer Annie Lennox, the band Coldplay, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and the model Helena Christensen. However, Glastonbury festival founder Michael Eavis defended Oxfam, calling it a ""wonderful"" charity. Speaking at the NME Awards, he said the festival had raised Â£6m for the charity, and planned to continue its support. Mr Eavis added that ""a few dodgy people"" should not discredit its good work. Earlier, actressMinnie Driver stood down from her ambassador rolewith Oxfam, saying she was ""nothing short of horrified"" by the allegations. Baaba Maal has been an Oxfam global ambassador since 2012 Pressure on Oxfam has been growing after allegations first arose last week about its handling of allegations of sexual misconduct by its aid workers in Haiti. The charity, which denies covering up the behaviour of its staff following an earthquake in the country in 2010, is being investigated by the Charity Commission. The charities regulator said it would announce the scope of its statutory inquiry,externalinto Oxfam on Thursday. Oxfam said it would co-operate with the inquiry and recognised it was in the public interest to be ""transparent and accountable"" and that lessons are learned. Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? It comes as Cafod, an international development charity, said it has sacked an employee implicated in claims sexually exploitation in Haiti. The charity said the man had applied for the job in 2014. References were provided from his previous employers and from somebody the worker said was a former line manager from Oxfam, Cafod added. This video can not be played Sexual misconduct ""happens at every agency"",  says an ex-UN aid worker He was dismissed on Wednesday when Oxfam confirmed claims he was among its ex-workers who had been accused of sexual misconduct. Cafod said it was ""committed to a zero-tolerance approach to misconduct"" and the employee's failure to disclose the circumstances of his departure from Oxfam were in breach of its code of behaviour. The charity has also reviewed two historical cases of sexual misconduct allegations against other employees. One yielded no evidence and one saw a staff member dismissed. In other developments: International aid group Doctors Without Borders said it handled 24 cases of harassment or sexual abuse last year More than 1,000 people cancelled their regular donations to Oxfamover the weekend Organisations including Marks & Spencer and the Duke of Edinburgh's (DofE) Award say they are considering their association with the charity International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is to speak to the National Crime Agency (NCA) about the Oxfam case. Oxfam said it sacked its country director in Haiti, Damien Berrendorf, last year, following allegations of ""mismanagement"" and ""inappropriate behaviour"" which were reported through its own whistleblowing line. The charity said the dismissal was not related to sexual misconduct nor the 2011 case. Speaking to the BBC, Oxfam's regional director in Asia for the last two years, Lan Mercado, revealed she is aware ofallegations of sexual abuse against staff in the Philippines, Bangladesh and Nepalfrom 2009-2013. Lan Mercado took up her post as Oxfam's Asia regional director in 2016 Ms Mercado said the scale of misconduct was ""not comparable"" to that in Haiti and while it had been dealt with internally ""according to specified policies"", it would be wrong to say the incidents were covered up. But she said alerting the authorities and other charities about allegations was a ""practice that we need to start"".

Lynette White: A murder and a scandal," The darkened entrance to 7 James Street was about to give up a gruesome secret. The police sergeant picked his way up the narrow, carpeted stairs to the first floor landing, outside the front door of flat one. The door was locked. He shook the handle and it rattled where the lock had worked loose. Standing back he aimed a forceful kick. The lights inside were not working; the pre-payment meter card had run out ages ago. The pitch-black hallway was strewn with litter. All three doors leading off it were shut. Opening one, the officer walked into the kitchen and through to the bathroom; the light of his torch traced a number of spent matches and cigarette butts, stood up on their ends, strangely arranged in a line around the rim of the bath. Another door led to a room empty save for two mattresses propped against the wall. He flicked his torch towards the third door. There was blood on it. Inside, a bare divan was illuminated by the orange glow of a street light. On top of it an opened but unused condom. At the bottom of it, the body of a woman. Lying on her back, she was fully clothed, her t-shirt and stone-washed jeans partially covered by a black leather coat. Even in murky light it was clear; she was dead. As the officer radioed for back-up, a woman waiting on the landing outside the entrance to the flat started to cry. Minutes before she had gone to the police station; she had lent the flat keys to a friend, she explained, but the friend had not been seen for days; she was worried. Her friend, the young woman found dead above a betting shop in Flat one, 7 James Street, Cardiff, had been murdered. Her throat slit so deeply, she was virtually decapitated. Her hands, a last frantic defence, slashed; her chest mutilated, her wrists cut. Many of the 50-plus stab and slash wounds were inflicted after she had died. Her name was Lynette White, a 5ft 4ins tall 20-year-old with blonde hair and bright blue eyes. Those who knew her said she was popular, quiet, kind, friendly and unfailingly polite. To those who loved her, she was much, much more than that. ""I remember we used to fight over who would do her ringlets,"" recalls her Auntie Lyn, after whom Lynette was named. ""Lynette had fantastic skin and a fantastic personality. I used to call her my protégée. We used to say she could be a model and look after me in my old age."" In the cold, dank flat was the body of a woman whose childhood visit to Father Christmas had been lovingly cherished in a photo frame; a girl who spent time out of school looking after horses at the city farm; a daughter, grandchild, niece, sister, girlfriend. She liked music, Whitney Houston's I Wanna Dance With Somebodyand Freddie McGregor's Just Don't Want To Be Lonely and loved romantic films. Her dream was to fall in love and have a home filled with children. It was the idealised kind of family life she had never known. Her parents had split up when she was 18 months old. Her father insisted Lynette stay with him in Cardiff, while her mother moved back to Essex with Lynette's half-sister. But what she lacked in a mother, her paternal grandmother, her Nanna, with whom she lived in her early years along with her aunties, strove to make up for, lavishing their ""little gem"" with love. Lynette grew particularly close to her Auntie Lyn who she called her ""little mum"". Lynette moved a few miles away from them when her father Terry re-married. Her step-mother Carol had two other children, a girl and a boy. Then aged 12 her fragile emotional world imploded. Her beloved Nanna, her touchstone, the matriarch who had been the constant in her life from a baby, died tragically. She was only 56. The emotional agony may have rendered Lynette especially vulnerable to the heady onslaught of adolescence. She was to pay a savage price for that vulnerability all too soon. Not long before she was murdered, she spoke to a BBC reporter investigating child prostitution in the Welsh capital. She told him that aged 14 she was abducted by a gang and taken to Bristol where she was drugged and forced into sex work. She escaped and returned home but a few years later began ""working the beat"" in Cardiff's docklands. Her Auntie Lyn was horrified when she eventually found out. ""I've no idea at what point she went down that path,"" she says. ""I lie awake at night thinking 'could I have stopped her? If I'd known could I have done something?' ""But I really don't think I could have done anything to help. She was so in love with that guy. She just wanted to be loved."" Lyn had cooked Lynette Sunday roasts and helped arrange surprise birthday parties, hoping desperately to boost her ailing self-worth and keep her life on track. ""We were having a laugh in my kitchen, it was around New Year,"" her auntie says. ""I was doing her hair and we were talking about a boyfriend she'd fallen out with. I told her that one day you will see the right man, you will look in his eyes and you will know that he really loves you'. ""And she turned around and looked at me and said 'oh no, no, Auntie Lyn. No-one, no man will ever love me'."" Slowly, Lynette drifted out of reach of her Auntie Lyn. The torturous thought of her alone that night with just a candle for light, has cost her too many sleepless nights. But out of respect for the privacy of the very few remaining members of Lynette's immediate family she will not say any more. The Whites were virtually destroyed not only by what happened at 7 James Street but by what followed. Lynette's father Terry and family at her funeral They were not alone. The unrelenting aftershocks of Lynette's death were widely felt and unnecessarily ruined the lives of many others. This was only the start. The subsequent scandal surrounding the police investigation led to stigmatising innocent men in one of the most notorious travesties in British legal history and its largest police corruption trial, the final chapter of which has only just closed 30 years later. ""Stephen King couldn't write a better horror story than this,"" says 60-year-old Tony Paris whose life changed irrevocably the moment he was cast as one of its leading characters. Within weeks of the murder the BBC's newly-launched Crimewatch programme revealed a compelling early lead in the murder hunt. A photo-fit was shown of a man who had been seen by a member of the public crouched in the doorway of 7 James Street. His hand was bleeding heavily; he was crying and mumbling incoherently. ""He is very distinctive,"" said the then head of South Wales Police CID, Detective Chief Superintendent John Williams, who described the murder as ""a vicious, frenzied, sadistic attack"". ""He has got dark brown, greasy hair with lightening towards the front of it. He's about 35 to 40 years of age and between 5ft 8 and 6ft tall."" So the man police were hunting was distinctive. He was also white. Breaking news 10 months later; five men had been charged with the murder of Lynette White. They were all black. The first John Actie knew of the murder was the Monday morning of 15 February 1988. “I was coming out of the house and a guy I knew was walking up the road,” he told BBC Wales Investigates. “He said to me ‘did you hear about the murder?’ I told him no, what murder? He said it was Lynette White and I said ‘who’s Lynette White?’. “It was in the (South Wales) Echo and there was a picture of her and that’s when I realised it was Miller’s girlfriend.” Stephen Miller – known locally as Pineapple on account of his dreadlocks tied up on top of his head and a penchant for pineapple juice - had been going out with Lynette for a couple of years. He had moved down from Brixton after they met through his brother who was living in Cardiff. He had broken down at the “hammer blow” news of her death and was willing to do anything to help. Naturally he was a possible suspect but nothing suggested to police he was the killer. The 22-year-old told how he had been frantically looking for Lynette. He was worried about her but it is likely he also wanted her earnings to pay for his cocaine habit. They had argued five days before, he explained, and she had not come home to the flat they shared in the nearby Grangetown area of the city. Stephen Miller, Lynette White's boyfriend of two years He had no knowledge of the flat at 7 James Street, rented for business by Lynette’s friend and fellow sex worker Leanne Vilday. It is still not clear where Lynette was in her final days. The police had also been looking for her. She was due to be a witness at an attempted murder trial and an arrest warrant had been issued for her. That trial was halted and following forensic tests any suspicion that she had been silenced by anyone involved was discounted. There was no link between that case and Lynette White’s murder. Police investigating were unsurprisingly working on the theory that she had been murdered by a client. The inquiry had a prime suspect, a man known to the police, dubbed Mr X. But that investigation ended abruptly in September when blood tests ruled him out too. The detectives were back to square one. By then two of the force’s officers with reputations for getting results - Detective Inspector Graham Mouncher, who took over as lead officer, and Inspector Tommy Page – had been pulled in to rescue the floundering investigation. Meanwhile, uniformed officers had conducted 6,000 house-to-house inquiries asking everyone in the area, including John Actie, to fill in a questionnaire. There was no love lost between him and the police. An incident when he was 19 remains vivid in his mind. Arrested for criminal damage at a nightclub he says he had never been to, he recalls being taken to Cardiff's central police station and ""badly beaten"" by a group of 11 police officers. He was subsequently charged with assaulting them. After giving his side of the story, all charges against him were dismissed by a magistrate. But time would prove it to be a Pyrrhic victory. John Actie was a name widely known in Cardiff. He had a reputation as a ""hard man"", someone you did not want to cross. Once a promising rugby player, he had played well above his age group as a flanker or Number 8 for Cardiff Youth. His dad, Charlie Actie, a seaman and steel erector, part of a big, long-established docks family, was always there to urge him on. Schoolboys Cup victory at Cardiff Arms Park: Winning try scorer John Actie holds the captain aloft, with David Bishop crouching down (bottom left) His son easily matched the skill of his team-mates, David Bishop and Mark Ring, both of whom went onto play for Wales. But John Actie was not destined to wear the ""red jersey"". ""John was a brilliant player,"" says David Bishop, who describes him as his ""best friend, like family"". ""Let me tell you, he was certainly capable of playing rugby at the top level."" Aged 12 John was round at David's house when there was a phone call to say he had to come home right away. “My dad had died,"" says John, 56. ""He was just 42 and had lung cancer. I was devastated. We were very close and he’d always been there to keep me in line. I went completely off the rails. “I started drifting in and out of borstal, approved schools, running away, mixing with different people, doing stupid things. Then I got sent to a detention centre… you just progress. ""My mum was always there for me but she couldn’t control me like my father. She had seven kids and worked hard to provide for us.” By the age of 22 John had served a three-year term for robbery and a 12-month jail sentence for possession of cannabis. Doing security work, debt collecting and working on the door at nightclubs like the Casablanca, a well-known music venue in the docks, he aggravated the police by ""refusing to bow down to them"" and by organising illegal all-night Blues house parties held at various locations selling drink and playing reggae and soul music. John was working the door at the Casablanca nightclub on the night in question. The club was razed in the 1980s to make way for a car park In his book entitled Bloody Valentine published in the early 1990s, Cardiff-born author John Williams described John as a “bullet-headed 6ft-something guy built like the proverbial brick shit house”. “Around 1988 the Docks police figures John Actie for Butetown’s heaviest cocaine dealer, a Yardie-connected drug baron,” Williams wrote. “Talking to people more or less in the know, John Actie was not the Mr Big that the police made him out to be. Yes, he was [at one time] a drug dealer but not on a grand scale. But he did have a reputation, an image… Basically John Actie was the baddest m-f in the neighbourhood.” Violence, or the threat of it, may well at one time have been John’s stock in trade. But Lynette White? The murder horrified him. A woman stabbed over 50 times was, he says, the work of a “lunatic” and his priority was the welfare of his wife, and two daughters, a four-year-old and a new-born. “If I’d known anything, I’d have reported it the next day,” he adds. Meanwhile detectives were getting nowhere fast and the pressure on them intensified. “It was all to do with the new barrage, the regeneration,” John says. “They wanted to clean this area up and make it good for the yuppies. No one wants to live here when there’s skulduggery like that in the area.” Ten months earlier the multi-million pound Cardiff Bay Development Corporation had got under way. Its quest was to transform the city’s one time world-famous but now desolate docklands, and boost Cardiff’s economy as a world-class maritime city. Something like £2 billion was being sought from investors and Lynette White’s unsolved murder was hardly seductive. Cardiff then was virtually unrecognisable from the city it is today – one of the fastest growing in Europe. 1980s Cardiff had a smaller feeling to it. For decades it had an uneasy relationship with its dockland and its residential area known as Butetown, named after the 2nd Marquis of Bute whose family established a dock when Cardiff was an insignificant village. The industrial revolution and coal from the south Wales valleys had seen Cardiff morph into one of the busiest docklands in the world exporting 12.6 million tonnes a year at its zenith. Its Coal Exchange witnessed the signing of the first million pound cheque in 1904. “James Street, the one-time hub of dock life, pulsed with vitality,” wrote Tiger Bay poet Harry ‘Shipmate’ Cooke. “Tall buildings full of clacking typewriters, clerks, ship brokers, agents and things maritime. At street level, shops of every degree, elbowing each other for attention.” James Street, the beating heart of Cardiff docks, in the early 1900s Back then Butetown was known the world over as the legendary Tiger Bay. It had a reputation as a hotbed of raucousness, brawling sailors, prostitution and illegal gambling – it was a port after all – but there was something more distinctive about Tiger Bay. Over the years many visiting seamen settled there forging a community unparalleled in diversity and tolerance. It is said that at one time 57 different nationalities lived there. Welsh girls commonly demonised by society and ostracised by their families for falling in love with men of colour joined the coalescence. It was them against the world. Arthur Actie, John’s grandfather, a seaman from St Lucia, docked in Cardiff around the time of Britain’s first race riots in 1919. Demobbed servicemen vented their anger over unemployment at the men of Tiger Bay, many of whom had tried to join up but were rejected and as a result had jobs. John's parents Charlie and Maria Actie John’s grandmother was half-Welsh, half-Barbadian, his late mother, Maria, from Cardiff, descended from the influx of Irish workers into the city. John’s family embodied the history of the city. And in 1988, he, the latest generation, would be indelibly written into its next, more shameful chapter. For nine months police had been looking for a single white man. Suddenly an entirely different set of suspects were taken in for questioning. At 07:30 on 9 December four police officers were outside John’s front door. “I said ‘what do you want?’” he recalls. “They said the superintendent wanted me brought in, something to do with the Lynette White inquiry. I said ‘are you mad? you’re having a laugh aren’t you? I’m not going anywhere, now get away from my door’. “He said if I didn’t go he’d call back up and they didn’t want to do that with my wife and kids in the house. I told them to get back in the car and I’d get dressed. “As soon as we started the first interview and they said I was in the James Street flat I turned to my solicitor and said ‘Stuart, they’re fitting me up’. It was terrifying. “They were putting me with a group of other guys who I knew from the area but didn’t go around with. It didn’t make any sense. We didn’t bother with each other. One of them was my cousin, but even we weren’t close. “What they were coming out with was so crazy, at one stage I said ‘I’ve had enough of this I’m going back to my cell’. “They said they had statements from people who were in the flat. I’d never even heard of these people, didn’t have a clue who they were. “Two days later we were led handcuffed from our cells and lined up. There must have been about 30 or 40 of them, CID, in there all smiling and laughing. ‘John Arthur Actie, you are charged that on the 14th of February….’ I had a mint in my mouth and I nearly choked on it. It felt like the end of the world. “It was boiling hot in my cell and I remember I was pacing up and down saying ‘Me? A murderer? Me? No, no, no… I can’t believe this’. ""There were tears in my eyes. It was like my dad had died all over again. I asked if I could make a phone call and one of them said ‘in 25 years John’.” The four other men charged  alongside John on 11 December 1988 were Tony Paris, 30, Stephen Miller, 22, Ronnie Actie, 30, and Yusef Abdullahi, 26, all of whom lived in Butetown. They were later to become known as The Cardiff Five. ""I stood in the dock and the foreman was asked if they'd reached a verdict,"" Tony Paris recalls. ""He said 'guilty'. I was thinking 'what?'. My brother collapsed in shock, he went down, bang, it was terrible. I turned round and said to my sister 'Rosie, I haven't done anything'. ""I looked at the jury and some of them were crying. My hands were locked onto the wooden bar of the dock. When they tried to lead me away, my hands wouldn't come away, I couldn't move."" Tony Paris stood apart from his co-defendants. He had no history of violence; he had never been to prison. He had three previous convictions, two fines for shoplifting and one for driving without insurance. In fact, he was widely known for avoiding confrontation at all costs and for fainting at the sight of his own blood. Everyone in Butetown knew Tony Paris. He offered what could euphemistically be called a ""collect and delivery service"". Tony Paris had been collecting glasses in the Casablanca nightclub at the time of the murder ""Shoplifting in them days was easier, less security,"" he says. ""Someone would say 'ah, there's this beautiful dress Tone' and I'd say 'give me the details'. 'You know my size don't you Tone?' 'of course I do, I know everyone's size'. ""They used to call me Pockets. I'm round everybody's house in the docks. I know everyone and everyone knows me. I'm trusted."" By the 1980s, Butetown, the home of Cardiff's red-light district was a virtual 6,000-strong ghetto, just south of the city centre. Many in the rest of the city felt nervous about venturing ""under the bridge"", a railway bridge near Cardiff Central train station, its unofficial gateway. Butetown was quite literally the wrong side of the tracks. Butetown just beyond Cardiff Central rail track Loudon Square: Concrete tower blocks replaced a square of elegant houses, at one time the city's  most affluent area The name Tiger Bay had been consigned to history after a 1960s slum clearance; its historic yet dilapidated architecture replaced with a concrete council estate of maisonettes and high-rise tower blocks. Unemployment was high especially among the young who said they were discriminated against on account of their postcode. ""It might have been different outside of the docks but growing up there I didn't see racism,"" Tony says, ""because I was brought up in a community with blacks, whites, Indian, Chinese. ""Doesn't matter about your religion, your colour, we're docks boys, we stick together. We were different to other communities; it was 'all for one'. Tony, a football-mad child with his Uncle Charlie. His parents had come to Cardiff from the Caribbean island of Nevis ""I'm no trouble. I don't go to jail; I'm not a jail person. When I got caught shoplifting I held my hands up. I went to court and pleaded guilty, got fined and went home. What am I going to argue with police for? It's stupid. ""I was this little 5ft 2 black guy. I used to wear two-toned suits, with a hat, Crombie and carry a cane. I'm loving life, bubbling, buzzing, in my own little world. They took him out of that little nothing world and put him over there and totally changed his life."" The first trial of the Cardiff Five began on 17 October 1989 in Swansea's crown court, a city not known for its diversity back then. It seemed to be doomed from the start. Five months later in its final few days, the trial was abandoned. The judge had died of a heart attack. Three months later in May 1990, the second trial got under way. David Elfer QC opened for the prosecution. ""Butetown,"" he said, ""is a nocturnal, upside down, topsy-turvy world where people carry knives as part of their clothing."" It was an excoriation of the entire community. Seasoned court reporters recall a ""toxic"", febrile atmosphere of fraught security, legal aggression, public gallery outbursts and outcries from the dock. Police were on the court roof top photographing everyone who attended. The jury heard that the five accused men had killed Lynette to make an example of her over a drug debt. The police presented a scenario in which all five men had somehow come together and made their way to the flat where they took it in turns to stab her to death. Lynette's friend Leanne Vilday, one of four so-called witnesses to her murder There were four key witnesses. Two of them were sex workers, Leanne Vilday, Lynette's friend, and Angela Psaila. Both women, interviewed several times by police, said they knew nothing about the murder. Then after nine months their stories changed dramatically. Now suddenly their police statements said they had been in Psaila's flat across the road. They heard screams from 7 James Street and had run over to find out what was going on. They alleged they had run up the stairs, pushed past ""hard as nails"" doorman John Actie, not known for being easy to push past, and saw Lynette being attacked in the flat. ""She stood no chance against them,"" Psaila told the jury. ""They were standing around smirking. ""They were taking it in turns to stab her. She managed to lift herself up to the window sill. She was pawing at the window trying to attract somebody's attention."" The women said they too were forced to cut Lynette's throat and wrists, their involvement ensuring they keep quiet about what had happened. The two other witnesses were two gay men - Mark Grommek who lived in the second floor flat of 7 James Street and Paul Atkins who was with him that night. They too had changed their story to one implicating all five men. Their statements were shown to Stephen Miller when he was arrested. He insisted he knew nothing before finally cracking during five days of interrogation. By the end he agreed with the police that he was in the flat with the other men. The court heard that he had immediately withdrawn his 'confession'. This may have been given little credence at the time but before long, it would come back to haunt the detectives who had extracted it from him. The eyewitness evidence was as flimsy as it was fantastical. Their testimony was riddled with contradictions, lies and discrepancies. Their accounts were so chaotic it was not even clear who was actually at the murder scene. The judge, who at one stage was rushed to hospital with an angina attack, told the jury they were unsatisfactory witnesses whose police statements were also ""admittedly studded with lies"". All the accused men said they had alibis for that night and there was not a shred of forensic evidence linking them to the flat. In November 1990 Stephen Miller was convicted. Stephen Miller driven away from court Tony Paris is given life with a 17-year tariff Tony Paris was also found guilty - his cellmate, convicted armed robber and supergrass Ian Massey, claimed he had confessed to him. Ronnie Actie was unanimously found not guilty. ""The persons or person who killed Lynette White are out on the streets, they're walking the streets,"" he shouted. ""They are innocent men in there."" The following day Yusef Abdullahi was also convicted despite 13 people confirming he had been working 10 miles away on a boat in Barry docks that night, an alibi the prosecution sought to undermine. Yusef Abdullahi was working on board MV Coral Sea the night of the murder ""I wasn't even in Cardiff,"" he shouted, panic-stricken. ""You took my life away from me… I am innocent."" John Actie, so traumatised he was unable to walk unaided into the dock, was the last up. Unanimously not guilty. Jumping down from the public gallery, his family dragged him out of the dock and carried him outside where breaking down he pleaded: ""They're innocent! They're innocent!"" When asked how he felt, he cried: ""I am bitter and I am broke."" The other three men were sentenced to life. An exhausting and traumatic trial - at the time the longest in British history - was over. After all the sentences had been passed the jury foreman simply sat and wept. The real murderer must have thought he had got away with it. Under the bridge - a protest march leaves Butetown on the short walk to Cardiff prison where some of the Cardiff Three were being held, before walking through the city centre to Cardiff City Hall The Reverend Al Sharpton leading a protest through Cardiff, linking arms with Yusef Abdullahi's late mother Pauline The last time Stephen Miller had seen Lynette they had rowed. He says it was about her work and how it was impacting on their relationship. Vehemently denying he was the pimp police had made him out to be, he has insisted that on many occasions he tried to persuade her to stop but it was the only work she knew and the couple fell into a pattern. Yes, he admitted Lynette would give him money but he says he also had his dole money and cash from selling weed and doing odd jobs. Stephen, who says he was never violent after serving a four-month term for GBH as a teenager, recalled breaking down on being told a body had been found which officers suspected was Lynette. When asked if he would be willing to provide DNA samples, clothing, he had said: ""Anything you want you can take, anything you want."" For the next few months, Stephen said he was in a ""nightmarish daze"", constantly going back and forth to the police station seeking updates on the murder inquiry and actively responded to requests by detectives to find out if any one in the area knew anything about Lynette's death. Seven months after her murder, he returned to London to stay with his mother until he was arrested in December 1988 and succumbed to the ""terror"" of police questioning. Four years later on 7 December 1992, Stephen Miller, Tony Paris and Yusef Abdullahi – by now known as The Cardiff Three after a campaign was launched to spread the word about their wrongful conviction - had made it to the Court of Appeal. The tapes of Miller’s confession to the police – which had effectively convicted all three men – showed officers “bullying” and “beating him over the head verbally”. Streetwise he might have been, but Miller had the IQ of an 11 year old. He had been put through 19 interviews over five days of “psychological torture” the court heard. He had insisted 300 times that he knew nothing. Not once did his appointed solicitor interject on his behalf. He finally cracked under an incessant charade of good cop-bad cop and acquiesced to whatever they said. The interview tapes were played in court – they had not been heard at the original trial – to demonstrate the level of intimidation and bullying which belied the printed transcripts. In his judgement freeing the men, Lord Chief Justice Lord Taylor said he was “horrified” by the tapes which showed the “worst example of police excesses”. Yusef Abdullahi with brother Malik “The interviewing officers could not have acted in a more hostile and intimidating manner… they had made it clear to Miller that they would continue to question him until they 'got it right',” he said. The work of the Free the Cardiff Three campaign – run by brothers of two of the defendants Lloyd Paris and Malik Abdullahi – was at an end. They had travelled the country in a bid to win support, highlighting gaping holes in the police case. In the run up to the appeal, black newspaper The Voice took up the cause then broadsheet newspapers began to take notice followed by TV programmes - Channel Four’s Black Bag, BBC Wales’ Week In Week Out, and the BBC’s Panorama. Tony's brother Lloyd Paris with Yusef Abdullahi's brother Malik centre, left Also in the months leading up to the men’s release, the American civil rights activist and Baptist minister Reverend Al Sharpton arrived in Butetown to lead a protest march past Cardiff prison, through the city centre to city hall. Addressing a rally of supporters through a loud-speaker, he said: ""I'm happy to be here today to join people of all races and colour to talk about the injustice that has happened to these three brothers. ""It is clear that it is only because of their social, economic and racial status that they are in jail."" Gerry Conlon, one of the Guildford Four, had also visited the area to highlight the “ludicrous and disturbing” case. Gerry Conlon, who spent 15 years in prison after he was wrongly convicted of the IRA Guildford pub bombing, arrives in Butetown First night of freedom for four years and one day: Yusef Abdullahi and Tony Paris at a welcome home party It had all paid off. Tony Paris was now a free man but it was bitter sweet. Just weeks before, he had been handcuffed and escorted by guards from Wormwood Scrubs, to say goodbye to his dying father, Arthur. He died before seeing his son vindicated. On his conviction he insisted his wife, the mother of his young son, divorce him. The world he was returning to was a very different one. South Wales Police announced they would not re-open the investigation and no disciplinary action would be taken against any officer involved. By so doing, rumour and speculation about the men’s guilt was rife. In September 1996 Lynette’s father knocked on John Actie’s front door armed with a sawn-off shotgun. Armed police sealed off the area. “If I hadn’t looked out of the kitchen window and seen him,” John says, “I would have opened the door and I'd have been blown away.” Given a suspended jail sentence, Mr White told the court: “I’ve been abused and laughed at for the last seven years after these men were freed for my daughter’s murder which in my mind they undoubtedly committed. I had had enough and just exploded.” Mr White died in January 2001, aged 55, after falling down stairs at his home. Nine months later his son, Terence, Lynette’s brother, was found dead. He was 28. His family said his life was blighted by his sister’s murder. Neither lived to see the justice they had been denied for so long. In September 2000 police re-opened the Lynette White murder case following a cold case review. Detectives worked with a forensic science team led by world-renowned Angela Gallop. A tiny piece of bloody cellophane had been found near the body. They had the beginnings of a DNA profile. The hunt was on for Cellophane Man. But they needed more. And 7 James Street was about to give up its final secret. A skirting board was removed and under six layers of new paint, there was a spot of blood. It was Cellophane Man's. Blood on the front door was also his. The final proof was his blood on Lynette's clothing. Lynette had been dragged to where the majority of the attack probably took place. The murderer had cut his hand when it slid down the hilt of his knife and onto the blade during the ferocious attack; he then blundered out of the flat in the pitch black, down the stairs and fumbled to find the catch on the front door. But who was Cellophane Man? A mass DNA screening and searches of 140 police databases around the world yielded nothing. In what has been roundly applauded as ""outstanding"" and painstaking detective work, an officer noticed a pattern in the profiles, a rare DNA marker. He had spent months scrutinising print outs from the national database. A 14-year-old boy, who had been arrested for joyriding in Cardiff, stood out; his DNA was a partial match. They inquired about his older male relatives which included a 38-year-old uncle. He was contacted by the police and put on surveillance pending the results of forensic tests. Officers burst into his house when he had been seen buying quantities of paracetamol. He had taken an overdose of 64 tablets. ""Just for the record I did kill Lynette White,"" he said. ""I've been waiting for this for 15 years. Whatever happens I deserve it. I sincerely hope to die."" He was rushed to hospital. He survived. At the time of the murder Jeffrey Gafoor had been living above a corner shop run by his sister and her husband, in the Cathays area of Cardiff, three miles from the docks. A loner who collected knives and antiques and was prone to binge drinking, he had been working at a warehouse loading lorries. At the time of his arrest, he worked shifts as a security guard at offices in Cardiff. Described as ""intelligent"", he had no friends and had cut ties with his entire family in the years following the murder. Blanking the murder from his memory, he lived a reclusive life, renting a house in the village of Llanharan, near Bridgend, south Wales. The murder at James Street was apparently his first crime. Remarkably he had only one conviction after the murder, for assaulting a colleague in 1992. It is highly likely that Gafoor would never have been caught had it not been for his nephew's arrest. His recollection of what happened was ""dream-like, fuzzy"", he said, but he recalled he had lashed out at Lynette after changing his mind about having sex. He had asked for his £30 back and she had refused. On 4 July 2003 Gafoor pleaded guilty. He had acted alone and apologised to the Cardiff Five for their ordeal. For the first time in history a miscarriage of justice had been solved by the conviction of the real killer. That was cold comfort for Yusef Abdullahi. Speaking outside Cardiff Crown Court as Gafoor stood in the dock, he said: “I didn’t want to go in there because I’d have ripped his head off. ""Then I would have been up for a murder because I’m just really bitter towards him."" Sentenced to life, Gafoor was given a 13-year tariff - the minimum he must serve before he could apply for parole. It was less than the tariffs given to two of the Cardiff Three. Gafoor's conviction now raised serious questions about the eyewitness testimony of what happened in James Street presented at the original trial. In 2008 three of the four people who helped convict the men - Mark Grommek, Leanne Vilday and Angela Psaila - admitted they had made the whole thing up after being ""harassed into lying"" by police. Paul Atkins was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial. The three said they had been threatened with being convicted of the murder themselves. The court was told that Vilday was told her baby son would be taken away and was shown photographs of abused children in care. Psaila had an IQ of 55 and was described as one of the most vulnerable members of Cardiff society. Grommek was also vulnerable because of his sexuality as “in 1988 there was rather more intolerance of gay people than is the case now”. The judge Mr Justice Maddison said: ""It's been submitted on your behalf, accepted by the prosecution and I accept it myself... ""You were seriously hounded, bullied, threatened, abused and manipulated by the police during a period of several months leading up to late 1988, as a result of which you felt compelled to agree to false accounts they suggested to you."" The three were jailed for 18 months each. One of the most eminent barristers in the country, Lord Carlile QC, defended Leanne Vilday. ""The sheer wickedness and dishonesty of the police and remorseless systemic corruption in this case is difficult to believe, but it's true beyond a doubt and it is accepted by the prosecution,"" he said. It would be ""an utter scandal"", he said, if none of the police officers involved in the case were brought to trial themselves. Yusef Abdullahi speaking outside court after Jeffrey Gafoor is given a life term Tony Paris demanded an apology from South Wales Police just minutes after Lynette White's killer was sentenced In a series of dawn arrests, a number of serving and retired officers were pulled in for questioning. Following a six-year investigation, eight retired officers were in the dock charged with perverting the course of justice. A trial of four other officers was due to begin the following year. Graham Mouncher, Richard Powell, Thomas Page, Michael Daniels, Paul Jennings, Paul Stephen, Peter Greenwood and John Seaford denied conspiring to pervert the course of justice. In addition Mouncher denied lying under oath in court. Facing perjury charges were two civilian witnesses from the original trial, Violet Perriam, whose statement had put John Actie near 7 James Street on the night of the murder, and the discredited supergrass Ian Massey who claimed Tony Paris had confessed to him. All pleaded not guilty. The prosecution alleged the detectives had ""manipulated, moulded and even completely fabricated"" evidence, that they had acted ""corruptly together and with other police officers to manufacture a case against the five men"". ""The police had moved away from investigating a murder and they were instead busy trying to implicate people in that murder, people who were actually completely innocent of that murder,"" the jury was told. Despite the fact that Gafoor insisted he acted alone and had never met any of the five men originally accused of the murder, the police's defence would not have it - they were involved, they alleged. Under the law of court privilege which protected the defence from being sued for defamation by the innocent men, their theory was that there were two attacks - Gafoor had stabbed Lynette but not fatally and then somehow the five happened upon the scene and took over. It did not seem to matter that they had been acquitted, Lynette's real murderer convicted, that not a single shred of evidence, forensic or otherwise linked any of the men to the murder scene or that they had received public and written apologies from two chief constables. The surviving members of the Cardiff Five were called as witnesses - John Actie, Tony Paris and Stephen Miller. Perhaps most shockingly of all in the 30-year saga, they were effectively put on trial a second time during intense and prolonged cross-examination and without any defence. ""It was happening all over again,"" Tony Paris says. ""I was called as a witness and thought I'd be there for a few hours and then go home. ""Four days I was there. We were being accused and tried all over again."" During cross-examination John Actie said: ""You keep accusing me of being there. I was acquitted. It is them who fitted me up… I wasn't there… It seems like I am on trial."" Then in December 2011 after five months of evidence, the £30m trial collapsed in dramatic and controversial circumstances. It had become clear as the trial progressed that the process of disclosure was failing. Disclosure is the production and sharing by the prosecution of documents relevant to the case. This includes any information that either undermines the prosecution's case or potentially assists the defendants in their case. After several warnings by the judge, the prosecution was given one last chance, a litmus test, to prove they had handled the paper work correctly. But copies of a crucial set of four files required to prove the prosecution's competence regarding disclosure of material could not be found. Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Coutts The judge heard evidence alleging proof that one of the files had been destroyed on the orders of the officer leading the police corruption investigation Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Coutts. Following five months of evidence, the judge announced that a fair trial could not be guaranteed and abandoned the trial. All defendants were declared not guilty. Then in an extraordinary twist, the missing files were found seven weeks later in a cardboard box with other documents relating to the case in the offices of the police corruption investigation team. Calls for a full public inquiry into what went wrong were resisted. Instead the then Home Secretary Theresa May ordered an independent review led by Richard Horwell QC. Its conclusions were published in July last year. Horwell QC described the Cardiff Three convictions as ""one of the worst miscarriages of justice in our criminal justice system"". On the disclosure issues which led to the collapse of the police corruption trial, he said there had been errors amounting to ""an embarrassment on a national scale"". But, he went on, ""suspicion that the trial collapsed due to yet further police corruption has not been supported by the evidence"". ""It is human failings that brought about the collapse of the trial, not wickedness,"" he concluded. Despite criticism that South Wales Police was put in charge of investigating its own officers, it is widely acknowledged that Chris Coutts led a competent and efficient investigation in bringing the retired officers to court. But the handling of the disclosure, a complex task involving around one million pages of evidence, was wholly incompetent. ""The prosecution had predicted there would be an attack on disclosure,"" says journalist and author Satish Sekar, who has closely followed the case since 1991 and written three books about it. Satish Sekar ""If you've predicted that how do you get caught with your pants down like that? Absolutely ludicrous."" ""What stands about the Cardiff Five,"" he adds, ""is that it's very rare for so much to go wrong in the one case. ""Aspects of it you'll find in virtually every single miscarriage of justice. What is rare is that it all happened in the one case."" In 2015 the eight exonerated police officers sued South Wales Police for damages. They lost the case. To say John Actie is bitter is an understatement. His relationship with the police, he says, is as fractious as ever and he has made numerous complaints about harassment. ""My life has been ruined by what the police did,"" he says. ""I have been attacked, had people come up and call me a murderer when I'm out. I've been sent cards on Valentine's Day saying 'remember the 14th'. This will not leave me until I'm in my grave. ""My family has suffered, all our families have suffered. Our one chance of closure and they lose some papers?"" Speaking in 1990s, Yusef Abdullahi, who undertook an 18-month speaking tour on miscarriages of justice after his release, during which he met high-profile figures such as U2 front man and philanthropist Bono, told how he had collapsed from nervous exhaustion and woke up in a psychiatric bed. ""I was there for several months and people keep telling me to take it easier,"" he said. ""But the whole situation had got to me. I mean one minute I was in jail, the next I'm sitting eating with Bono. ""Until it happens to you, no one can have any idea what it's like to be convicted for a murder you didn't commit. ""We've been really messed up by what we've been though. We needed counselling but no one offered us any help. It did my head in."" He did live to see Lynette's killer jailed but died of a burst ulcer in January 2011, aged 49. Ronnie Actie died in 2007 from deep vein thrombosis also aged 49. He had been virtually living in a garden shed. ""Why the police wanted me off the streets for the rest of my life? I don't know,"" he said in an interview with BBC Wales. ""I'd love to know all those reasons. One day they'll come out."" Tony Paris has a theory. ""The police thought the community was hiding something but people aren't talking,"" he says. ""So, this is my opinion, they thought 'we'll take him and him and him'… All of us apart from Miller were from big docks families. If anybody knows anything, now they've got to talk to get these guys out. ""The entire legal system, not just the police, were involved in what happened to us. ""It changed my life. I went from being an extrovert in clubs and pubs to an introvert where I don't go out. I try to hide it when I do go out, but then I withdraw because I'm scared. I don't trust people. ""I try to find suitable words to put my feelings across. But when you think about it, there is no word, there is no word in the dictionary in any language that you can find to truly put across how you feel, it's unspeakable."" The case, estimated to have cost South Wales Police in excess of £100m, scarred the reputation of a police force which had four other recent miscarriages of justice on its record. The so-called Cardiff Newsagent Three were wrongly convicted for the murder of newsagent Phillip Saunders. They spent 11 years in jail before being released. After serving seven years for murder, the Darvell brothers were freed by the Court of Appeal in 1992 after it heard claims that detectives doctored confession statements and notes and suppressed scientific evidence. The following year Jonathan Jones was found to have been wrongly convicted of the murder of his in-laws Harry and Megan Tooze at their south Wales farm. Annette Hewins' conviction was quashed in 1999. She had been serving a 13-year sentence for arson with intent to endanger life following the death of 21-year-old Diane Jones and her daughters Shauna, two, and Sarah-Jane, 13 months. Police accepted in 2006 she had no part in the murders. She died last year aged 51. But it is without doubt the Lynette White murder inquiry that stands out as South Wales Police's, if not the UK's, most notorious case. Eligible for parole since March 2016, the prospect that Jeffrey Gafoor could be freed at any time is not an easy one for Lynette White's family or for those branded with his crime for so long. On the 30th anniversary of Lynette's murder there are calls for a change in the law so criminals who knowingly allow miscarriages of justice to unfold before they are convicted, can be dealt with more severely. ""There certainly were questions raised in a number of places about whether the sentence was proportionate to the nature of the crime and the fact that several innocent people spent time in prison as a result of Gafoor not coming forward and not admitting the case at an earlier stage,"" says South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael. South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael ""I can't answer those questions but I think they are legitimate questions and it's a challenge to the criminal justice system to ensure that all factors can be taken into account in the sentencing process in future."" But a stain remains on South Wales Police which, says newly installed Chief Constable Matt Jukes, has served to forge a determination for change. Speaking on the anniversary of Lynette White's murder, he says: ""The learning we've taken from the murder of Lynette White and the original investigation has led us to review many other historic cases and has led to convictions in several of those. ""So, the case itself has driven a change in the organisation and brought about justice for other victims. South Wales Police Chief Constable Matt Jukes ""For young officers today and many members of the community this case is something that they're aware of in the history of the organisation. ""It has truly deep resonances for all those affected by it and it's somewhat now in the DNA of the force I've got to say. ""Our determination not to fail in this way again steels my resolve every day to make sure our investigations are of the highest quality, professionally, technically, ethically, that they can possibly be. ""So I don't think even though this is an event that took place 30 years ago, it will leave the psyche of this organisation and its leadership for another generation."" On the surface at least the untidy past of Cardiff's docklands has been successfully swept away, transformed into the trendy waterfront vision conceived in the late 1980s replete with serviced apartments, bars and restaurants. It is also home to the Welsh Assembly's Senedd. 7 James Street (end building on right) close to the Wales Millennium Centre Now a smart rental above a vaping shop, 7 James Street is a stone's throw from the city's Millennium Centre, a thriving venue for opera, theatre and visiting West End shows. Once the beating heart of one of the world's most famous docks, its procession of stately buildings of ship brokers and chandlers and its exotically decorated shop fronts, is no more. The street is a ghost of its former self. The vestiges of the old Tiger Bay community are now a minority within Butetown, says Neil Sinclair, an author of three books on the history of the area. He witnessed the corrosive effect the Lynette White murder inquiry had on the community, one from which it has never fully recovered. ""Our general feeling as a community is that over the decades they wanted to eradicate us from Welsh memory and almost succeeded except for the fact that I've written down our history."" ""But,"" Neil adds, ""our ancestors, they didn't live in vain and they're going to come out, their ghosts are going to rise and our proud history will be given the recognition it deserves."" The surviving men caught up in one of the biggest scandals in recent history, never regained the peace they had taken for granted before being branded with the stigma of what happened at 7 James Street on St Valentine's Day 1988. Immediately on being freed from jail, Tony Paris had said: ""They wanted anybody for that murder. They thought we were anybodies but we were somebodies."" He may well have been speaking for the entire community of Butetown, and for Lynette White, who had been dehumanised for so long as ""the Cardiff prostitute"". The case continues to haunt Stephen Miller who has experienced depression, anxiety and agoraphobia not to mention his regret at not being there to protect the woman he said he loved very much. ""She's helped me, she's the one that's kept me strong,"" he said of Lynette. ""When I think about the case I think about her. Because this is all about her, it's not about us, it's about her."" Had she lived Lynette White would have celebrated her 50th birthday last July. She had lost her way but might well have in time, like countless other troubled 20 year olds, reached a point of maturity and confidence to turn it all around. Her appalling death meant she would never get the chance. The name of a vulnerable young woman who craved only love but was exploited by every man who paid for her youth, beauty and fragility, was fated not to be forgotten. It is not the legacy she or her loved ones would have wished for, but Lynette Debra White, born Wednesday, 5 July 1967, was destined to embody what is branded by some as ""the biggest scandal"" of recent legal history, an injustice the scale of which is never likely to be repeated in the UK, ever again.

Power-sharing talks collapse at StormontDUP says latest devolution talks have failed while Sinn FÃ©in claim the DUP 'collapsed' the process.8m8 minutes agoN. Ireland Politics,"This video can not be played DUP had agreed a deal in the talks, says Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill There is ""no current prospect"" of a deal to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader has said. Arlene Foster said the talks failed due to disagreements with Sinn FÃ©in about legislation for the Irish language. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill accused the DUP of having ""collapsed"" the talks process. Both parties have been locked in negotiations in a bid to end the 13-month stalemate at Stormont. Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide NI Assembly divided by Irish language This video can not be played Theresa May's visit distracted from Stormont talks, says the DUP's Simon Hamilton Mrs O'Neill, Sinn FÃ©in's leader at Stormont, said her party had ""reached an accommodation with the leadership of the DUP"" but claimed that the DUP then ""failed to close"" on it. She added that Sinn FÃ©in was in contact with both the UK and Irish governments and would set out its ""considered position"" on Thursday. In her statement, Mrs Foster called on the UK government to set a budget and start making policy decisions for Northern Ireland. The DUP leader said that ""significant gaps"" remained in the discussions between the region's two biggest parties. Talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in had not resulted in a ""balanced package"", said Arlene Foster ""We do not have a fair and balanced package,"" she added, saying that Sinn FÃ©in's demand for legislation to give the Irish language official status in Northern Ireland was a key dividing issue. ""I respect the Irish language and those who speak it but in a shared society this cannot be a one-way street,"" she added. ""Respect for the unionist and British identity has not been reciprocated."" The DUP would continue to aim for a restoration of devolution, she said, but it would ""not accept a one-sided deal"". Karen Bradley said the UK government would have to take decisions for Northern Ireland After the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in blamed each other for the failure of the talks, the Northern Ireland secretary signalled that a deal remained possible. ""I believe the basis for an accommodation still exists,"" said Karen Bradley. ""We will continue to work with everyone to make sure we deliver this."" But Mrs Bradley added that the UK government would ""need to consider practical steps"" in the ""continued absence"" of devolution. She said ""challenging decisions"" would have to be taken and added that she intends to update MPs in Parliament next week. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar tweeted that he regretted the DUP's statement and that ""power sharing and working together are the only way forward"". Allow Twitter content?

Analysis:BBC News NI political correspondent Enda McClafferty At Stormont on Wednesday, you could sense that things were not going well behind the scenes. There was a great sense of optimism last week. But it became pretty clear there was a standoff developing after Tuesday. Arlene Foster had appeared before the cameras and said thata stand-alone Irish language act was not something the DUP could accept. Sinn FÃ©in came out and said there would be no deal unless it included one of those. We understand both parties met on Wednesday morning and quickly realised there was going to be no middle ground on an Irish language act. Then it was a matter of who was going to pull the plug first. Reporters were waiting in Stormont's Great Hall and we all thought we would hear from Sinn FÃ©in first. Then the statement from Mrs Foster popped up on Twitter, making it very clear that this phase of negotiations was over. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was ""disappointed"" and ""angry"" at the failure of the talks, and claimed it had left the Good Friday Agreement ""in peril"". He said the Stormont parties must resist a return to direct rule from Westminster, with ""the DUP having the whip hand"". Under an agreement struck last summer, the Conservative government relies on the DUP's support to stay in power at Westminster. Colum Eastwood said the SDLP would resist a return to direct rule from Westminster Mr Eastwood said the parties must ""not allow this moment to be the destruction of all that we have achieved"". ""We can't allow this British government, or this DUP to think that they're going to govern Northern Ireland on their own - that cannot be allowed to happen,"" the SDLP leader said. Robin Swann, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), described the talks process as a ""shambles"". He said: ""What I think we need to know, and what Northern Ireland clearly needs to know, is the door to devolution now firmly closed?"" Mr Swann called on the Northern Ireland secretary to provide clarity on whether it was the end of the talks or whether more negotiations were planned. Robin Swann questioned whether the talks breakdown meant devolution was finished The leader of Alliance Party, Naomi Long, said there was ""no prospect of a deal and no process in place that could lead to a deal"". ""We are in a very precarious situation at this point in time, we are essentially in uncharted territory,"" she added. Hopes of an imminent deal had been ""falsely raised"" over the weekend, she said, and ""now we have seen them dashed yet again"". Speculation of a breakthrough mounted over the weekend, as both the UK and Irish leaders prepared to travel to Stormont to help seal a deal. But Prime Minister Theresa May and Mr Varadkarleft Belfast on Monday with no sign of agreement. The visits by the UK and Irish PMs on Monday failed to secure a breakthrough Former DUP minister Simon Hamilton described their visit as ""a bit of a distraction"". ""I don't think it was entirely helpful in getting us to a successful conclusion,"" he told a press conference on Wednesday. Northern Ireland has been run by civil servants since the power-sharing executive made up of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed in January last year. The then deputy first minister Martin McGuinness pulled Sinn FÃ©in out of the coalition after a bitter split between the governing parties. Londonderry Chamber of Commerce President, Jennifer McKeever said the lack of a deal was ""disappointing and frustrating"".

The demonstration was organised by record company executives Meg Harkins and Karen Rait, after they realised the US ceremony had no plans to show support for the movement. They assembled a group of 12 other women in music, calling themselves Voices in Entertainment, and chose the white rose because of its association with the suffragette movement.

Killer told police of rape plan before kidnap,"Celine Dookhran was killed by her uncle and her body left in a freezer Mujahid Arshid has been sentenced to at least 40 years in prison for kidnap, rape and murder. But four years before committing the crimes, he told police about his violent fantasies. They were kidnapped on a bright summer morning. Two terrified young women - tied up, gagged, wrapped in dustsheets and then driven through south London in the back of a pickup truck. At an empty suburban house both victims were raped, 20-year-old Celine Dookhran was murdered, and the second woman only narrowly survived an attempted murder. Mujahid Arshid, the killer, had been planning his crimes for weeks, if not much longer. He had already sexually abused the second woman for about a year from 2008, when she was in her early teens. She alerted some of her family in 2011 and 2016, but they neither accepted the account or informed police. ""My voice was never really heard,"" the woman later told the murder investigation. Uncle jailed for Celine Dookhran rape and killing Murder accused 'offered police victim for rape' Accused blames murder on 'rape victim' Freezer murder case co-accused 'panicked' But between these two disclosures, Arshid had also described his violent sexual fantasies about the woman to an undercover police officer. The officer had been tasked with visiting a website used by paedophiles and developing online relationships to gather intelligence about child abuse. In October 2013, he made contact with Arshid, who was using a pseudonym, and exchanged a series of messages. Arshid invited the officer to drug and rape a teenage girl and then provided a web link to ""ratchet tie-down straps"" to ""keep her down."" He even sent the officer photographs of the same woman he later tried to kill. Detectives traced the messages to Arshid's home and visited it in January 2014 but they did not make contact until an interview was arranged three months later. Arshid admitted the messages had come from his address. He told police he had given the password for his internet router to a labourer named ""Zahid"" - but he was unable to give any contact details and said the relevant computer had been sold. He faced no further action and the victim was not contacted. Following Arshid's conviction, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that in March 2014 it made a decision in principle to charge him with encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence. It did so on the understanding that he was the only one with access to his laptop and ""therefore it must have been him taking part in the conversation"". Arshid carrying out charity work. The decision was contingent on key evidence being available, meaning Arshid was never actually charged with any offence. The CPS said a review took place ""when we were informed that neither the laptop nor a key witness [Zahid] could be located by the police"". ""Without those two crucial pieces of evidence the case no longer met the evidential test and there would have been no realistic prospect of a conviction,"" it added. Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent, told the BBC the defence offered by Arshid - that someone else was using the computer - was a ""classic excuse"" used by paedophiles. He said the police could have taken measures that would have removed Arshid's ability to lie in such a way. ""I would have expected a warrant to have been obtained. I would have expected a search of the house to have been undertaken. ""I would have expected an arrest to have been made."" ""Maybe if those actions had been taken the outcome wouldn't have been as horrific as it has been,"" he added. Mr Babu said it could be a ""watershed moment"" because the public will ""think how can you have a situation where somebody talks about raping, kidnapping a child and then we wait three months before police officers go round to the address."" Scotland Yard said all aspects of the case would be subject to a review. ""At this time there has been no referral to the Directorate of Professional Standards or the Independent Office of Police Complaints,"" the force added. The successful murder investigation found no trace that Zahid ever existed. Arshid claimed that someone else was responsbile for the messages Arshid, a 33-year-old builder, who was born in Lancashire but grew up in London, thought of himself as a tech-savvy philanthropist and entrepreneur - but he was really a fantasist. A proposed biodiesel scheme he devised did not work out and, more recently, he organised a charity that purported to provide water for drought-affected communities in Africa. The charity did not file any accounts and Arshid appears to have used the role to generate publicity for himself. He also pestered public figures for their attention. Five days before the kidnapping, he tweeted billionaire inventor Elon Musk to say ""I wish to have 10 mins with you"" to explain how he could take Musk's work ""to the next level"". At least three weeks before 19 July last year, Arshid had made a series of disturbing internet searches for, among other things, ""what's the best way to dispose of a human body"". Then, two days before the kidnap he installed a large deep freezer in an unoccupied property in Kingston upon Thames. Obsessed with both women, he had decided that if he could not have them then no one else would either. Celine Dookhran, his niece, had moved in with Arshid and her aunt following a family disagreement over her selection of boyfriend. The popular Barclays worker ""wanted to make her own choice,"" according to one friend's evidence at the trial. At a family meeting the night before the kidnap, Celine and her boyfriend were told to end their relationship, which they agreed to do, although Celine was upset by the demand. She and the second woman were kidnapped the next day. Arshid wanted it to appear as if Celine had run away in response to what had happened the day before. Wearing a balaclava Arshid stuffed socks into the victims' mouths, tied their hands and feet together, and wrapped each in a builder's dustsheet. The trial judge said he was ""satisfied"" a second man had taken part in the initial kidnap with Arshid. Driving at speed and with music blaring, Arshid then took them to the empty house. ""I just looked at [Celine] and said 'don't say anything, don't scream,'"" the survivor told police in an interview from her hospital bed that was played in court. At the large detached property the women were tied to pipes in a downstairs utility room before being taken upstairs in turn to be brutally attacked and raped. The house in Kingston, where Celine's body was hidden in a freezer and another woman was attacked The women tried to persuade Arshid to let them go but, armed with a lock-knife, he took Celine back upstairs and killed her. After glimpsing Celine's body, the other woman resolved to fight for her life. ""I grabbed him, kneed him down below. He did not flinch at all. I grabbed his face. I grabbed the knife. He started to slit me everywhere. I got my neck slit, my wrists,"" she told police Arshid sat on her and then ""slit my neck again and bashed my head on the floor."" He said: ""Now you've got 10 minutes to live and your body will shut down."" ""I genuinely thought I was dying,"" the woman added. Arshid thought the woman had died, but she survived the attack and then managed to talk him out of killing her. She sat up ""covered in blood from head to toe"" and began saying ""things he wanted to hear - I love you, we can run away together, we can be happy together, we can have a family"". ""I was talking so much rubbish to him,"" she recalled. He was persuaded they could run away together and drove her to meet his brother, to whom he had been making telephone calls that afternoon. Before leaving the house, he placed Celine's body in the freezer and sealed it with a lock. The survivor had been trying to raise the alarm throughout the day using a secreted mobile phone, meaning that police were already looking for her. But, not knowing where she had been taken, she was unable to provide an accurate location to those she called and the police consequently went to the wrong address. Pakistani ID card found in the hotel room where Arshid was arrested As Arshid walked her to his truck outside the house, she made herself remember details about the surroundings that she later used to guide police to the property. When his brother saw the badly injured woman in the back of the vehicle he asked her to get into his own car before taking her to hospital. Arshid fled and was eventually arrested in the early hours of the following morning in a hotel room in the port of Folkstone, Kent. It is thought he intended to travel to Europe, before making his way to Pakistan. Investigators think his original plan was to hide the women's bodies in the freezer and flee abroad before they were found. At trial, Arshid made a futile effort to convince jurors of his innocence, claiming the women had willingly travelled to the Kingston house, where they both engaged in consensual sex with him, and the surviving woman had then killed Celine in a fit of jealousy. The jury rejected his lies and found him guilty of murder, kidnap and rape as well as the earlier sexual offences.

Power-sharing talks collapse at StormontDUP says latest devolution talks have failed while Sinn FÃ©in claim the DUP 'collapsed' the process.1h33 minutes agoN. Ireland Politics,"This video can not be played DUP had agreed a deal in the talks, says Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill There is ""no current prospect"" of a deal to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader has said. Arlene Foster said the talks failed due to disagreements with Sinn FÃ©in about legislation for the Irish language. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill accused the DUP of having ""collapsed"" the talks process. Both parties have been locked in negotiations in a bid to end the 13-month stalemate at Stormont. Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide NI Assembly divided by Irish language This video can not be played Theresa May's visit distracted from Stormont talks, says the DUP's Simon Hamilton Mrs O'Neill, Sinn FÃ©in's leader at Stormont, said her party had ""reached an accommodation with the leadership of the DUP"" but claimed that the DUP then ""failed to close"" on it. She added that Sinn FÃ©in was in contact with both the UK and Irish governments and would set out its ""considered position"" on Thursday. In her statement, Mrs Foster called on the UK government to set a budget and start making policy decisions for Northern Ireland. The DUP leader said that ""significant gaps"" remained in the discussions between the region's two biggest parties. Talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in had not resulted in a ""balanced package"", said Arlene Foster ""We do not have a fair and balanced package,"" she added, saying that Sinn FÃ©in's demand for legislation to give the Irish language official status in Northern Ireland was a key dividing issue. ""I respect the Irish language and those who speak it but in a shared society this cannot be a one-way street,"" she added. ""Respect for the unionist and British identity has not been reciprocated."" The DUP would continue to aim for a restoration of devolution, she said, but it would ""not accept a one-sided deal"". Karen Bradley said the UK government would have to take decisions for Northern Ireland After the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in blamed each other for the failure of the talks, the Northern Ireland secretary signalled that a deal remained possible. ""I believe the basis for an accommodation still exists,"" said Karen Bradley. ""We will continue to work with everyone to make sure we deliver this."" But Mrs Bradley added that the UK government would ""need to consider practical steps"" in the ""continued absence"" of devolution. She said ""challenging decisions"" would have to be taken and added that she intends to update MPs in Parliament next week. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar tweeted that he regretted the DUP's statement and that ""power sharing and working together are the only way forward"". Allow Twitter content?

Analysis:BBC News NI political correspondent Enda McClafferty At Stormont on Wednesday, you could sense that things were not going well behind the scenes. There was a great sense of optimism last week. But it became pretty clear there was a standoff developing after Tuesday. Arlene Foster had appeared before the cameras and said thata stand-alone Irish language act was not something the DUP could accept. Sinn FÃ©in came out and said there would be no deal unless it included one of those. We understand both parties met on Wednesday morning and quickly realised there was going to be no middle ground on an Irish language act. Then it was a matter of who was going to pull the plug first. Reporters were waiting in Stormont's Great Hall and we all thought we would hear from Sinn FÃ©in first. Then the statement from Mrs Foster popped up on Twitter, making it very clear that this phase of negotiations was over. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was ""disappointed"" and ""angry"" at the failure of the talks, and claimed it had left the Good Friday Agreement ""in peril"". He said the Stormont parties must resist a return to direct rule from Westminster, with ""the DUP having the whip hand"". Under an agreement struck last summer, the Conservative government relies on the DUP's support to stay in power at Westminster. Colum Eastwood said the SDLP would resist a return to direct rule from Westminster Mr Eastwood said the parties must ""not allow this moment to be the destruction of all that we have achieved"". ""We can't allow this British government, or this DUP to think that they're going to govern Northern Ireland on their own - that cannot be allowed to happen,"" the SDLP leader said. Robin Swann, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), described the talks process as a ""shambles"". He said: ""What I think we need to know, and what Northern Ireland clearly needs to know, is the door to devolution now firmly closed?"" Mr Swann called on the Northern Ireland secretary to provide clarity on whether it was the end of the talks or whether more negotiations were planned. Robin Swann questioned whether the talks breakdown meant devolution was finished The leader of Alliance Party, Naomi Long, said there was ""no prospect of a deal and no process in place that could lead to a deal"". ""We are in a very precarious situation at this point in time, we are essentially in uncharted territory,"" she added. Hopes of an imminent deal had been ""falsely raised"" over the weekend, she said, and ""now we have seen them dashed yet again"". Speculation of a breakthrough mounted over the weekend, as both the UK and Irish leaders prepared to travel to Stormont to help seal a deal. But Prime Minister Theresa May and Mr Varadkarleft Belfast on Monday with no sign of agreement. The visits by the UK and Irish PMs on Monday failed to secure a breakthrough Former DUP minister Simon Hamilton described their visit as ""a bit of a distraction"". ""I don't think it was entirely helpful in getting us to a successful conclusion,"" he told a press conference on Wednesday. Northern Ireland has been run by civil servants since the power-sharing executive made up of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed in January last year. The then deputy first minister Martin McGuinness pulled Sinn FÃ©in out of the coalition after a bitter split between the governing parties. Londonderry Chamber of Commerce President, Jennifer McKeever said the lack of a deal was ""disappointing and frustrating"". ""The collapse of the latest round of talks will come as another body blow for businesses in the North West which are facing the greatest economic challenge of our generation,"" she said. ""Thirteen months is too long to be without devolved government and the lack of leadership from Stormont in the Brexit negotiations has been particularly frustrating for the business community,"" she added.

Forced labour family preyed on workersMen were held captive by the gang and made to do mammoth shifts for little or no pay.3h3 hours agoScotland,"Clockwise from top left: James McPhee, Robert McPhee, John Miller and Steven McPhee. Three men from a Gypsy Traveller family have been found guilty of abduction, violence and intimidation against men who worked for them. Robert McPhee and his son-in-law John Miller were convicted for the crime of servitude - holding men against their will and forcing them to work for little or no money. James McPhee was found guilty of assault and abduction. Another man Steven McPhee pleaded guilty to assault earlier in the trial. The men were found guilty of more than 20 charges between them, dating from 1992 to 2016. A five-week trial heard they preyed on vulnerable men - eight in total - from troubled backgrounds. The gang operated from traveller sites including this one in Larkhall The men were promised work doing jobs such as mono-blocking driveways but were held captive and made to do mammoth shifts for little or no pay. They were brutally punished if they complained or tried to escape. One tortured victim told how he was battered and ""taught a lesson"" when he tried to get away. Another lived in a caravan with no water or toilet - before later being told he was ""owned"" by the family. Jurors heard further evidence of a worker ""left cowering like a dog"" due to the abuse. The gang denied the charges claiming they were picked on by ""overzealous"" police. They claimed the family had shown ""kindness, generosity and tolerance"" to workers. A shed at the piggery at Shotts, used by the family The group were lead by 65-year-old Robert McPhee - nicknamed The Tank Commander. Robert McPhee - known as Bobby - was convicted of 14 charges, James McPhee eight and John Miller was found guilty of two. The catalogue of crimes included abductions, assaults and holding workers against their will or in ""servitude"". Steven McPhee also stood trial, but near the end of the case he admitted to assaulting one worker. More recently the family lived on the site at the piggery in Shotts The family stayed at a number of traveller sites across Scotland including one in Bathgate, West Lothian, and another in Larkhall, South Lanarkshire. More recently they had a base at Curryside Piggery in Shotts, South Lanarkshire. James Keith was a homeless teenager when he was approached. He was ""scared"" of Robert McPhee who dished out beatings if more work was not generated. Mr Keith later fled in terror, but remembered being ""captured"". He told the trial: ""You had no option, but to go back. You did not get an option."" He ended up working for James McPhee - who said he had ""bought"" him from his father. He said he felt ""like a bit of property"" and was told it would take ""a good few grand"" to release the hold over him. James Keith got to know John Anderson - another victim who regularly suffered - and later married his sister Christina. One occasion in 1999 he escaped to her home in Paisley, Renfrewshire, but James McPhee tracked them down and told his wife: ""You are divorced now"". Ms Anderson told the court: ""I have never seen him (her husband) go so white in his life - white with fear."" On another occasion John Anderson told the court he was ""taught a lesson"" after fleeing to Cambridge. He was taken to Larkhall where Robert McPhee punched, kicked and hit him with a broom. Other victim , Kieran Williams, tried to escape before being found by Robert McPhee and John Miller. Graeme Lamb was caught at Glasgow Central train station and hauled back when he attempted to get away. He was threatened, forced in a car and taken to the Curryside Piggery. Brian McEwen was beaten so often by Robert McPhee that he was ""yelping in pain and cowering like a dog"". He was also made to eat a jar of coffee granules. William Milton told how he felt ""owned"" and was once punched so severely his ear-drum burst. Benjamin McPhilemy was assaulted by Steven McPhee while Thomas Kenny was struck by Robert McPhee. In her closing speech to the jury, the prosecutor said the victims' accounts had shown a ""culture of control and violence"" at the hands of the McPhee family. Robert McPhee was found guilty of offences against the eight men. He was convicted of assaulting all of them as well as abducting and holding Graeme Lamb and Kieran Williams in ""servitude"". James McPhee was guilty of attacks on John Anderson, James Keith, Christina Anderson as well as assaulting and abducting William Milton. John Miller was convicted of abducting and holding Kieran Williams in ""servitude"". All were remanded in custody by Lady Stacey pending sentencing next month.

Several injured as gunfire erupts at NSA,"This video can not be played Bullet holes were visible in the windows of vehicle, which appears to have crashed into a concrete barrier Three people were injured and three suspects were taken into custody after a car crashed outside the US National Security Agency's headquarters. Gunfire rang out after the black SUV approached the facility in Fort Meade, Maryland, without authorisation. There is no indication yet of any link to terrorism, FBI officials said. The driver of the car, a civilian and an NSA police officer were taken to hospital, the agency said. Fort Meade, a US Army installation, is home to the NSA FBI special agent Gordon Johnson said the injured were all taken to hospital from the US Army base, which is about 30 miles (48km) north-east of Washington DC, after Wednesday morning's incident. No injuries appeared to be related to the gunfire, he said, and it appeared the gunfire was directed at the vehicle as part of NSA security protocol. ""We believe there is no indication that anything more than an isolated incident of what happened here today this morning,"" said Mr Johnson, stressing that it was not terrorism related. The civilian and the police officer suffered non-life threatening injuries, but the condition of the driver, an unidentified male, is unknown. Allow Twitter content?

The other two people in the vehicle, both males, were taken into NSA custody. The vehicle appears to be a hire car, Mr Johnson said. He said that it was an ongoing investigation and ""we're still in the fact-collecting business right now"" when asked about the motive of the vehicle's occupants. CBS News images showed the black sports utility vehicle with what looked like bullet holes in the front windscreen and its air bags appeared deployed. The incident occurred at the checkpoint known as Canine gate It appeared to have collided into some NSA-stamped concrete barricade blocks outside the installation. NBC News said its helicopter could see police surrounding a handcuffed man sitting on the ground. The FBI said on Twitter after the incident: ""NSA police and local law enforcement are addressing an incident that took place this morning at one of NSA's secure vehicle entry gates.

In March 2015, one person was killed and another seriously wounded after driving a vehicle up to the NSA's gate, ignoring commands to stop. News reports later suggested the two occupants of the vehicle may have been under the influence of drugs after attending a party. Despite highway signage, it is not unusual for motorists to take a wrong turn and end up at one of the heavily guarded gates to the sprawling NSA complex, where armed federal officers direct them to turn around.

Forced labour family preyed on workers,"Clockwise from top left: James McPhee, Robert McPhee, John Miller and Steven McPhee. Three men from a Gypsy Traveller family have been found guilty of abduction, violence and intimidation against men who worked for them. Robert McPhee and his son-in-law John Miller were convicted for the crime of servitude - holding men against their will and forcing them to work for little or no money. James McPhee was found guilty of assault and abduction. Another man Steven McPhee pleaded guilty to assault earlier in the trial. The men were found guilty of more than 20 charges between them, dating from 1992 to 2016. A five-week trial heard they preyed on vulnerable men - eight in total - from troubled backgrounds. The gang operated from traveller sites including this one in Larkhall The men were promised work doing jobs such as mono-blocking driveways but were held captive and made to do mammoth shifts for little or no pay. They were brutally punished if they complained or tried to escape. One tortured victim told how he was battered and ""taught a lesson"" when he tried to get away. Another lived in a caravan with no water or toilet - before later being told he was ""owned"" by the family. Jurors heard further evidence of a worker ""left cowering like a dog"" due to the abuse. The gang denied the charges claiming they were picked on by ""overzealous"" police. They claimed the family had shown ""kindness, generosity and tolerance"" to workers. A shed at the piggery at Shotts, used by the family The group were lead by 65-year-old Robert McPhee - nicknamed The Tank Commander. Robert McPhee - known as Bobby - was convicted of 14 charges, James McPhee eight and John Miller was found guilty of two. The catalogue of crimes included abductions, assaults and holding workers against their will or in ""servitude"". Steven McPhee also stood trial, but near the end of the case he admitted to assaulting one worker. More recently the family lived on the site at the piggery in Shotts The family stayed at a number of traveller sites across Scotland including one in Bathgate, West Lothian, and another in Larkhall, South Lanarkshire. More recently they had a base at Curryside Piggery in Shotts, South Lanarkshire. James Keith was a homeless teenager when he was approached. He was ""scared"" of Robert McPhee who dished out beatings if more work was not generated. Mr Keith later fled in terror, but remembered being ""captured"". He told the trial: ""You had no option, but to go back. You did not get an option."" He ended up working for James McPhee - who said he had ""bought"" him from his father. He said he felt ""like a bit of property"" and was told it would take ""a good few grand"" to release the hold over him. James Keith got to know John Anderson - another victim who regularly suffered - and later married his sister Christina. One occasion in 1999 he escaped to her home in Paisley, Renfrewshire, but James McPhee tracked them down and told his wife: ""You are divorced now"". Ms Anderson told the court: ""I have never seen him (her husband) go so white in his life - white with fear."" On another occasion John Anderson told the court he was ""taught a lesson"" after fleeing to Cambridge. He was taken to Larkhall where Robert McPhee punched, kicked and hit him with a broom. Other victim , Kieran Williams, tried to escape before being found by Robert McPhee and John Miller. Graeme Lamb was caught at Glasgow Central train station and hauled back when he attempted to get away. He was threatened, forced in a car and taken to the Curryside Piggery. Brian McEwen was beaten so often by Robert McPhee that he was ""yelping in pain and cowering like a dog"". He was also made to eat a jar of coffee granules. William Milton told how he felt ""owned"" and was once punched so severely his ear-drum burst. Benjamin McPhilemy was assaulted by Steven McPhee while Thomas Kenny was struck by Robert McPhee. In her closing speech to the jury, the prosecutor said the victims' accounts had shown a ""culture of control and violence"" at the hands of the McPhee family. Robert McPhee was found guilty of offences against the eight men. He was convicted of assaulting all of them as well as abducting and holding Graeme Lamb and Kieran Williams in ""servitude"". James McPhee was guilty of attacks on John Anderson, James Keith, Christina Anderson as well as assaulting and abducting William Milton. John Miller was convicted of abducting and holding Kieran Williams in ""servitude"". All were remanded in custody by Lady Stacey pending sentencing next month.

Trump lawyer admits paying porn star,"The newspaper says Mr Cohen declined to answer why the ""private transaction"" was made An adult film star who has been embroiled in allegations of an affair with President Donald Trump is free to tell her story, her manager has said. Stormy Daniels is no longer bound by a non-disclosure contract after Mr Trump's lawyer admitted he paid her, manager Gina Rodriguez says. Mr Trump's personal lawyer confirmed in a statement to media he privately paid Ms Daniels $130,000 (Â£95,000) in 2016. Ms Rodriguez says that acknowledgement allows her client to speak freely. Porn actress Stormy Daniels alleged in 2011 that she had an affair with Mr Trump in 2006 ""Everything is off now, and Stormy is going to tell her story,"" Ms Rodriguez told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Her statement comes after Trump lawyer Michael Cohen told the New York Times he paid Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. ""Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,""Mr Cohen told the New York Times,external. He said he told the Federal Election Commission the same after a watchdog group filed a complaint about the payment, claiming that it had served as an ""in-kind"" political contribution to Mr Trump's campaign. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Donald Trump's lawyer and all-around fixer Michael Cohen has said he doesn't plan ""further comment"" on his six-figure payment to Stormy Daniels. His statements, however, raise more questions than they answer. While he said the money came from his ""personal funds"" and was not reimbursed directly or indirectly by the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign, that leaves open the possibility that he was compensated by other parties - including Mr Trump himself. Why, in his generosity, would Mr Cohen give $130,000 to Ms Daniels? The Wall Street Journal has reported that it was in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement about a decade-old affair between Mr Trump and Ms Daniels. Circumstantial evidence - that Ms Daniels had been in contact with media outlets prior to the transfer and has since gone silent - lends credence to this line. Even though the alleged affair is long since past, a story about possible hush money and an attempted cover-up just weeks before the presidential election is much more dangerous for a White House already on its heels. And if it turns out there's more to the money trail than has been disclosed, an embarrassing situation could quickly morph into a criminal inquiry. A Stormy (Daniels) situation: A porn star scandal Trump can't shake ""The payment to Ms Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone,"" Mr Cohen said. The lawyer has previously said Mr Trump ""vehemently denies"" it occurred. The revelations on Wednesday follow US media reports that the porn actress known as Ms Daniels was paid to sign an agreement stopping her discussing an alleged affair. She first said she had a relationship with Mr Trump in a 2011 interview. In a 2011 interview with InTouch magazine,the actress said she began a sexual relationship with Mr Trump in 2006,external, shortly after Melania Trump gave birth to his son Barron. The reports re-emerged in January whenthe Wall Street Journal reported that she was paid to sign a non-disclosure agreement in the run up to the 2016 election,external, which prevented her from discussing the alleged liaison. Ms Clifford was believed to be in discussion with US media about a television appearance to discuss Mr Trump at the time, the report said. Responding to questions from CNN about why the payment was made, Mr Cohen said: ""Just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it can't cause you harm or damage."" ""I will always protect Mr Trump,"" Mr Cohen added. On 30 January, Ms Daniels' publicist released a statement in her name denying having an affair with Mr Trump. But many - including Ms Daniels herself - were quick to note that the signature attached to that denial did not bear much resemblance to another copy of her autograph which had been attached to an earlier statement. That denial had been released by Mr Cohen on 10 January. Ms Daniels hosted a Super Bowl party last month She has since made several public appearances on television and at strip clubs, but has remained tight-lipped when asked directly about Mr Trump in interviews. Minutes after Mr Trump's first formal State of the Union address to Congress, she gave an interview to late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel. In it, she refused to directly answer whether she had signed a non-disclosure agreement, or if she had ""ever made love to someone whose name rhymes with Lonald Lump"".

Apple's HomePod speakers mark wood,"Pocket-lint published this image of a mark left by its Homepod test unit Apple's new smart speakers can discolour wooden surfaces, leaving a white mark where they are placed, the firm has acknowledged. The US company has suggested that owners may have to re-oil furniture if the HomePod is moved. The device went on sale last week after having been delayed from its original 2017 release date. Apple updated its help page,externalto suggest ""placing your HomePod on a different surface"" if customers were concerned. ""It is not unusual for any speaker with a vibration-dampening silicone base to leave mild marks when placed on some wooden surfaces,"" the company said. ""The marks can be caused by oils diffusing between the silicone base and the table surface, and will often go away after several days when the speaker is removed from the wooden surface. ""If not, wiping the surface gently with a soft damp or dry cloth may remove the marks. If marks persist, clean the surface with the furniture manufacturer's recommended cleaning process."" Gadget review site Pocket-Lint,externaltold the BBC it had never seen anything like this problem. The website's founder, Stuart Miles, told the BBC that a speaker left a mark on his kitchen worktop within 20 minutes. ""To clear it, I had to sand the wood down and then re-oil it,"" Mr Miles said. ""It wasn't the end of the world for us. But if you've bought an expensive Scandinavian sideboard or some beautiful piece of wooden furniture and then got a mark on it from the speaker, you can imagine the horror,"" he added. The problem has also been experienced bya New York Times review,externalandthe 9to5Mac news site,externalas well as by at least one member of the public. Allow Twitter content?

The NYT's Wirecutter site said Apple told it that ""the marks can improve over several days after the speaker is removed from the wood surface."" Apple added that if the marks did not improve then customers could ""try cleaning the surface with the manufacturer's suggested oiling method"". It is not yet clear if the problem affects all HomePod speakers or just a sample of the initial production run. The Â£319 HomePod has been praised in reviews for the quality of the bass notes that it can produce. But to do so, it needs to be placed on a flat surface. The HomePod costs more than Google, Amazon and Sonos' entry-level smart speakers but reviews suggest it offers superior sound ""Most others devices that I test have small feet that raise them off the counter ever so slightly to cause an air flow,"" commented Mr Miles. ""But the HomePod appears to need contact with the surface that it's on to resonate and create the powerful bass. ""I put it on a coaster to see if that would combat [leaving a mark] but that destroyed the bass qualities, so that's not a fix to the problem,"" he added. According to one furniture polish advice site,the most common causes of white marks,externalon wooden furniture are heat and moisture. The BBC has asked Apple for more details about the issue. One blogger who closely follows the company was surprised by the development. ""Anyone who runs into this should be outraged,""wrote Daring Fireball's John Gruber,external. ""Apple has been making products that go on shelves and tables for years... and I've never seen a report of damage to a surface. ""This seems like an issue that should have been caught during the period where HomePod was being widely tested at home by many Apple employees.""

British man charged with terror offence,"A British man who fought against the Islamic State Group in Syria has appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with a terror offence. It is the first case of its kind in the UK. James Matthews, 43, who lives in Dalston in London, is a former British soldier. He is charged with having attended a place where training was provided for purposes connected to the commission or preparation of terrorism. His defence barrister, Joel Bennathan QC, told the court the allegation he faces is of attending a training camp ""as part of a group of people struggling to assist the Kurdish groups fighting against ISIS"". Mr Matthews spoke in court to confirm his name and address and said that his plea would be ""not guilty"". The magistrate said it was a very ""unusual case"", the first time that someone who fought against IS had been charged with a terror offence in these circumstances. Mr Matthews was granted bail and will next appear in court at the Old Bailey on 1 March. By Emma Vardy, BBC News, at Westminster Magistrates' Court James 'Jim' Matthews was greeted by a crowd of supporters outside the court who turned out to voice their opposition to the charges against him. Some of them were former volunteers who have fought against IS with the Kurds in Syria There are dozens of people from Britain who have fought against IS in Iraq and Syria with the Kurds. Many have returned to the UK. Mr Matthews charge is a landmark case. His defence barrister Joel Bennathan QC said this is the first time terror legislation has been deployed to seek the conviction of someone who is assisting a group (the Kurds), who are also being assisted by the UK government.

Johnson: Let's unite around Brexit vision,"This video can not be played Johnson: We need to get positive agenda across Boris Johnson has told his fellow Brexiteers they should not ""gloat"" about the UK's departure from the EU, which he said was a cause for ""hope not fear"". The foreign secretary urged people to ""unite about what we all believe in"", an ""outward-looking, confident"" UK. Leaving the EU was not a ""great V-sign from the cliffs of Dover"", he said. Mr Johnson also said the result cannot be reversed and that Britain should not be bound by EU rules after Brexit. And he questioned the economic benefits of being in the EU single market and customs union, which the government plans to leave. Analysis: What was the aim of Johnson's speech European Union growth rate at 10-year high Kamal Ahmed: EU joins global growth bandwagon It was the first in a series of speeches by Theresa May and her ministers designed to map out ""road to Brexit"". Mr Johnson was one of the leading figures in the 2016 Leave campaign, and has previously been accused of undermining Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy. But he stuck to the government's official negotiating position during his speech in central London. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: I have to try - people's feelings matter In seeking to build bridges with the other side of the EU debate, Mr Johnson said he risked ""simply causing further irritation"" and accepted he would not ""persuade everybody"" but added: ""I have to try. In the end these are people's feelings and people's feelings matter."" ""We must accept that many [Remainers] are actuated by entirely noble sentiments, a real sense of solidarity with our European neighbours and a desire for the UK to succeed,"" he said. ""If we are to carry this project through to national success - as we must - then we must also reach out to those who still have anxieties. ""I want to try to anatomise at least some of those fears and to show... that Brexit is not grounds for fear but hope."" According to Mr Johnson, Brexit is ""not some great V-sign from the cliffs of Dover"", but ""the expression of legitimate and natural desire to self govern of the people"". ""That is surely not some reactionary Farageist concept,"" he added in a reference to former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who hit back on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Alongside his calls to Brexit supporters not to ""gloat"" and ""sit back in silent satisfaction"", Mr Johnson said holding another referendum on the UK's membership of the EU - as some campaigners are calling for - would be a ""disastrous mistake that would lead to permanent and ineradicable feelings of betrayal"". He frequently used variants of the 2016 referendum's ""take back control"" argument - on things like regulations and tariffs so businesses did not have laws affecting them ""imposed from abroad"" when they have no power to elect or remove the people making them. It would be ""intolerable and undemocratic"" if the UK was subject to EU laws after Brexit, he said. Mr Johnson said the benefits of being in the single market and customs union were ""nothing like as conspicuous or irrefutable"" as claimed by their supporters, saying other countries were able to trade with the EU without paying membership fees. However, during a transition period immediately after the UK leaves in March 2019 things would ""remain as they are"", he said. Laura Kuenssberg: The UK trade options Brexit: All you need to know Ex-Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney joined a protest outside Mr Johnson's speech Pro-EU campaigners hit back at his overtures to Remain voters - with Labour MP Chuka Umunna describing the speech as an ""exercise in hypocrisy"". Mr Umunna, of the anti ""hard Brexit"" Open Britain campaign, said: ""We are already a great country, we are already internationalist and we are already global."" Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said the speech revealed the government's intention to ""casually cast aside"" rights and protections and ignore the benefits of the EU single market. ""Nobody will be fooled or reassured by the foreign secretary's empty rhetoric,"" he said. Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston accused Mr Johnson of an ""optimism bias"" about the benefits of Brexit. The SNP's Brexit spokesman Stephen Gethins said he was not reassured by Mr Johnson's speech and said the government ""still can't really tell us what leaving the EU will mean"". And Liberal Democrat Tom Brake said the speech was mainly about ""Boris' ambitions to become the next prime minister"". Conservative MP Nigel Evans said the foreign secretary had reflected the views of many people, irrespective of how they voted in 2016, that the UK now needed to get on with the process of leaving. ""It's also about the opportunities that are now going to exist for the United Kingdom,"" he told the BBC. Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said the speech may have come as a surprise to those who, in his opinion, mistakenly believed the government was set ""to reinvent a customs union, forego an independent trade policy and accept the need to follow all new EU laws"".

For many Remainers, Boris Johnson is the bogeyman of Brexit, heartily loathed for his approach and some of his claims during the referendum campaign. This video can not be played Damon Albarn, dogs and David Davisâ¦ another classic Brexitcast episode! He set himself an ambitious aim of trying to reassure Remainers - but at times it sounded as if we were back in the campaign, which served to highlight just how divisive that debate was. I was left with the thought that perhaps the person most relieved would be Theresa May, as he repeatedly and doggedly stuck to the principles set out in her Lancaster House speech. This video can not be played Juncker: Superstate claims 'total nonsense' Asked about Mr Johnson's speech, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker hit back at suggestions from some critics he is seeking to create an EU ""superstate"". Mr Juncker replied: ""Some in the British political society are against the truth, pretending that I am a stupid, stubborn federalist, that I am in favour of a European superstate. ""I am strictly against a European superstate. We are not the United States of America, we are the European Union, which is a rich body because we have these 27, or 28, nations. ""The European Union cannot be built against the European nations, so this is total nonsense.""

Abuse claims against Oxfam Asia staff,"Lan Mercado took up her post as Oxfam's Asia regional director in 2016 A senior figure in Oxfam says she is aware of past claims of sexual abuse involving the charity's staff in Asia. Lan Mercado told the BBC the cases took place in the Philippines, Bangladesh and Nepal before she started as regional director two years ago. She said the scale of misconduct was ""not comparable"" to that in Haiti, where Oxfam faces claims staff paid vulnerable people for sex. Oxfam is meeting the Charity Commission as part of an inquiry by the regulator. Thecommission has launched a statutory inquiry,externalinto Oxfam - which denies covering up the behaviour of its staff in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake - but details of its scope have not yet been released. It is also looking into claims that Roland van Hauwermeiren - the charity worker at the centre of the sexual misconduct scandal in Haiti - was employed by Oxfam two years after he left another aid agency because of concerns about his behaviour. Ms Mercado, who oversees 14 countries, said she was aware of similar cases involving Oxfam workers in Asia between 2009 and 2013. She said they went largely unreported publicly and had been dealt with internally ""according to specified policies"", although the situation should not be defined as a ""cover up"". Actress quits Oxfam over Haiti sex claims Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Oxfam boss says charity is ashamed But in an interview with the BBC, she said: ""Haiti has taught us we need to do a lot more."" She said more effort should be made to alert the authorities and other potential employers about allegations. ""That's a practice that we need to start,"" Ms Mercado added. ""You know the funny thing about cases like this is that we always see them as reputational risks. ""But the way to manage reputational risk is not to keep silent.. we need to be thinking about the reputation of the sector as a whole."" The focus on Oxfam was sparked by allegations about its staff in Haiti Her comments come after actressMinnie Driver stood down from her role as a celebrity ambassadorfor Oxfam. In a statement the Good Will Hunting and Hope Springs star said she was ""nothing short of horrified"" by the allegations. Organisations including Marks & Spencer and the Duke of Edinburgh's (DofE) Award have also said they are considering their association with the charity. More than 1,200 Oxfam donors cancelled their direct debits on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.On average there are 600 cancellations per month. However, Oxfam said there had been an increase in one-off donations on Tuesday as well as 44 new regular gifts [direct debits] - the highest since March 2017. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt has said she would ""not hesitate"" to cut government funding to charities that failed to put robust safeguarding measures in place. At an event in Stockholm to find ways to end violence against children, she said: ""No organisation is too big, or our work with them too complex, for me to hesitate to remove funding from them if we cannot trust them to put the beneficiaries of aid first."" This video can not be played Sexual misconduct ""happens at every agency"",  says an ex-UN aid worker Ms Mordaunt, who is to speak to the National Crime Agency (NCA) about the issue, said Oxfam's failure to deal with the actions of some of its staff should be a ""wake-up call"" to the sector. The NCA said it had range of powers to investigate allegations abroad and would be considering how it can assist with ""international safeguarding considerations"". Since the allegations came to light, Oxfam's deputy chief executive,Penny Lawrence, has resignedover the charity's handling of the misconduct. In a separate blow for the charity,Oxfam's international chairman, Juan Alberto Fuentes, was arrested in Guatemalaas part of a corruption investigation relating to his time as the country's finance minister. Meanwhile, the Paris-based charity Doctors Without Borders announced it had acted on 24 cases of harassment or sexual abuse last year. It said it had fired 19 employees.

Catholic charity sacks former Oxfam worker,"The sacked worker had been among the Oxfam staff in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake A Catholic charity has sacked a worker after it emerged he had been accused of sexually exploiting vulnerable people in Haiti while working for Oxfam. Cafod said it was ""unaware"" of the claims until contacted this week by the Times, which broke the Oxfam story. Meanwhile, Sengalese singer Baaba Maal has told BBC Newsnight he is standing down from his role as a global ambassador to Oxfam after six years. The star said he found the sex abuse claims ""disgusting and heartbreaking"". Describing the allegations as ""very sad"", Maal said he was ""disassociating"" himself from Oxfam ""immediately"". Maal was one of 14 global ambassadors for Oxfam International. Others include singer Annie Lennox, the band Coldplay, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and the model Helena Christensen. However, Glastonbury festival founder Michael Eavis defended Oxfam, calling it a ""wonderful"" charity. Speaking at the NME Awards, he said the festival had raised Â£6m for the charity, and planned to continue its support. Mr Eavis added that ""a few dodgy people"" should not discredit its good work. Earlier, actressMinnie Driver stood down from her ambassador rolewith Oxfam, saying she was ""nothing short of horrified"" by the allegations. Baaba Maal has been an Oxfam global ambassador since 2012 Pressure on Oxfam has been growing after allegations first arose last week about its handling of allegations of sexual misconduct by its aid workers in Haiti. The charity, which denies covering up the behaviour of its staff following an earthquake in the country in 2010, is being investigated by the Charity Commission. The charities regulator said it would announce the scope of its statutory inquiry,externalinto Oxfam on Thursday. Oxfam said it would co-operate with the inquiry and recognised it was in the public interest to be ""transparent and accountable"" and that lessons are learned. Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? It comes as Cafod, an international development charity, said it has sacked an employee implicated in claims sexually exploitation in Haiti. The charity said the man had applied for the job in 2014. References were provided from his previous employers and from somebody the worker said was a former line manager from Oxfam, Cafod added. This video can not be played Sexual misconduct ""happens at every agency"",  says an ex-UN aid worker He was dismissed on Wednesday when Oxfam confirmed claims he was among its ex-workers who had been accused of sexual misconduct. Cafod said it was ""committed to a zero-tolerance approach to misconduct"" and the employee's failure to disclose the circumstances of his departure from Oxfam were in breach of its code of behaviour. The charity has also reviewed two historical cases of sexual misconduct allegations against other employees. One yielded no evidence and one saw a staff member dismissed. In other developments: International aid group Doctors Without Borders said it handled 24 cases of harassment or sexual abuse last year More than 1,000 people cancelled their regular donations to Oxfamover the weekend Organisations including Marks & Spencer and the Duke of Edinburgh's (DofE) Award say they are considering their association with the charity International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is to speak to the National Crime Agency (NCA) about the Oxfam case. Oxfam said it sacked its country director in Haiti, Damien Berrendorf, last year, following allegations of ""mismanagement"" and ""inappropriate behaviour"" which were reported through its own whistleblowing line. The charity said the dismissal was not related to sexual misconduct nor the 2011 case. Speaking to the BBC, Oxfam's regional director in Asia for the last two years, Lan Mercado, revealed she is aware ofallegations of sexual abuse against staff in the Philippines, Bangladesh and Nepalfrom 2009-2013. Lan Mercado took up her post as Oxfam's Asia regional director in 2016 Ms Mercado said the scale of misconduct was ""not comparable"" to that in Haiti and while it had been dealt with internally ""according to specified policies"", it would be wrong to say the incidents were covered up.

Tougher new rules for 'bet now' adverts,"New rules will target offers of free bonuses and ""bet now"" adverts Gambling firms are to face tougher new advertising rules - including a ban on telling customers to ""bet now"", the advertising watchdog has said. The new rules, which will restrict adverts during live events, aim to protect ""vulnerable"" gamblers, the Committee of Advertising Practice said. CAP, which writes advertising rules, said the new standards will also target ambiguous offers for free bets. It comes as gambling firm ElectraWorks was fined Â£350,000 for misleading ads. GVA, which owns ElectraWorks and brands including Foxy Bingo, said the adverts have been withdrawn and all its offers have since complied with the rules. Why are most problem gamblers men? Warning over gamblers' 'VIP status' Skin betting: 'Children as young as 11 introduced to gambling' Announcing thenew restrictions,external, CAP said it will restrict any adverts that encourage repetitive play or irresponsibly suggest ""risk free"" deposits. The updated rules, which will be used by the Advertising Standards Authority in its decisions on complaints, will also ban adverts that play on customers' financial concerns or self-esteem. The new standards will come into force on 2 April - except for the restrictions on free bets, which apply immediately. CAP said the majority of complaints over gambling adverts relate to consumers being forced to make deposits before they can access their free bets or withdraw their winnings. It said all free bet and bonus offers must now state the terms and conditions prominently. Any money-back offers must also be made in cash and not bonuses. Shahriar Coupal, director of CAP, said: ""We won't tolerate gambling ads that exploit people's vulnerabilities or play fast and loose with eye-catching free bet and bonus offers. ""Our new guidance takes account of the best available evidence to strengthen the protections already in place, ensuring that gambling is presented responsibly, minimising the potential for harm.""

The brand ran an advert on its betting website Bwin offering to match any deposit of up to Â£30 for free. But one consumer's complaint, which was upheld by the ASA, found they had to wager Â£102 before their matched bonus was released. A week later, the Gambling Commission discovered six similar breaches. GVC, the online gambling firm behind ElectraWorks, said it welcomed the regulator's findings. A statement said: ""When we fall short of those standards we believe the right thing to do, is to acknowledge the fact, correct the problem and then ensure that we have taken every necessary precaution to ensure there is no repetition."" Gary Gillies, Managing Director ofBig Free Bet,external, said: ""We take our position as online betting companies very seriously and we don't want to mislead anyone. ""The terms of special offers and free bets should be really clear for consumers, but we also have to be careful that the rules and regulations surrounding our industry are not completely over the top.""

Why do people like Chloe Kim get 'hangry'?,"Chloe Kim has tweeted about ice cream and churros (fried dough) during the Winter Olympics Chloe Kim was 'hangry' before winning a Winter Olympic gold medal. So why does hunger make people angry? On Tuesday morning in South Korea, a 17-year-old American sent a tweet about her breakfast. Within minutes, it had flown round the world. ""Wish I finished my breakfast sandwich but my stubborn self decided not to,"" wrote the teenage snowboarder Chloe Kim. ""And now I'm getting hangry."" Kim's admission of being hangry - hungry and angry - struck a chord. The tweet was liked 88,000 times - and counting. Being hangry, however, didn't do Kim any harm. Her next tweet, sent three hours later, showed her celebrating a gold medal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here's Dr Michael Knight, assistant professor of medicine atGeorge Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences,external. ""When we eat a meal, our body breaks down the food into nutrients such as glucose - a simple sugar that our body uses for energy,"" he says. ""Our brain is one of the largest consumers of that energy. About 20-25% of our total energy is consumed by our brain - which is only about 2% of our body weight. ""Hunger is a signal that the brain needs more fuel. It's triggered when the level of nutrients in our bloodstream begins to drop. ""When the brain runs dry of fuel, it stimulates a stress response. It's really a survival mechanism. ""Our inhibition to different emotions is lowered. And - because the brain needs fuel to function at its highest capacity - we see things like difficulty concentrating, and difficulty controlling emotions. ""One of the most common emotions is anger - and that's why, many times, when we become hungry, we become irritable."" ""If you have a full meal, with balanced nutrients, that's going to hold you over to the next meal,"" says Dr Knight. ""If you start feeling hanger coming on, something that's a little bit sweeter - something that gets you that glucose - is going to quickly reverse that feeling."" So - as the adverts suggest - a chocolate bar could do the trick? ""There's actually some science behind it,"" he says. ""If you're getting that sugar, it's increasing your glucose level, your brain is feeling the fuel, and it's decreasing that stress response."" ""It's mainly carbohydrate that we're breaking down into glucose,"" says Dr Knight. ""Our body does have a way of breaking down other foods [fats and proteins] and making more glucose - especially in those who are not eating that many carbohydrates. ""But the quickest way to get to glucose is by eating carbohydrate."" So, in short: Kim should have finished her sandwich. Would Chloe Kim have made it as a South Korean? US teenager Kim wins halfpipe gold Hangry and ransomware added to dictionary ""One individual may be able to go quite some time without feeling irritable,"" says Dr Knight. ""While some others, as soon as they stop eating, it seems they're ready to snap."" Dr Knight says ""we don't fully understand the genetics behind"" the process. But some of the important chemicals, such as Neuropeptide Y, are genetically linked to DNA. ""So it just may be that, because of your genetics, and your control of emotions, you may be predisposed to developing hanger."" Michael Knight, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences ""It's something we're still learning about,"" he says. ""But there's nothing that says women are this percentage, or that percentage, more likely to have it. ""It can really vary from person to person, as hunger does."" ""Definitely,"" says Dr Knight. ""I work in a weight management practice at George Washington University. It's very common for patients to have this feeling, and that leads to them eating a lot more. ""That's something we have to work with them to address."" The word has even been recognised by the Oxford English Dictionary. Last month, it announced that ""hangry"" was a real word,defined as ""bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger"",external. Happily for Chloe Kim, her hanger didn't last long. After winning gold, she was seen tucking into a tub of ice cream. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Swift line 'too banal' to copyright,"Taylor Swift had been sued over her hit single Shake It Off The phrase ""haters gonna hate"" is too ""banal"" to be copyrighted, a US judge has declared. Judge Michael W Fitzgerald made the comments while dismissing a copyright case againstTaylor Swift,external. Songwriters,externalSean Hall and Nathan Butler sued the star last year, arguing her single Shake It Off stole from their composition, Playas Gon' Play. They said the chorus of her song relied on their lyric, ""playas, they gonna play, and haters, they gonna hate"". Although short phrases are generally immune from copyright claims, the writers argued that combining the two thoughts was original enough to warrant protection. Fitzgerald disagreed -in quite some style,external. ""The lynchpin of this entire case is thus whether or not the lyrics 'Playas, they gonna play, and haters, they gonna hate' are eligible for protection,"" he wrote. ""In the early 2000s, popular culture was adequately suffused with the concepts of players and haters to render the phrases 'playasâ¦ gonna play' or 'hatersâ¦ gonna hate', standing on their own, no more creative than 'runners gonna run'; 'drummers gonna drum'; or 'swimmers gonna swim.' ""The concept of actors acting in accordance with their essential nature is not at all creative; it is banal. ""The allegedly infringed lyrics are short phrases that lack the modicum of originality and creativity required for copyright protection,"" Fitzgerald added. Allow YouTube content?

The judge also criticised the plaintiffs ""clunky"" legal arguments, before approving Swift's motion to dismiss the case. ""In sum, the lyrics at issue... are too brief, unoriginal, and uncreative to warrant protection under the Copyright Act,"" he wrote. However, he offered Hall and Butler one last chance to amend their argument before the case is settled on 26 February, ""just in case there are more similarities between Playas Gon' Play and Shake it Off than Plaintiffs have alleged thus far"".

Review: Taylor Swift's Reputation âââââ Playas Gon' Play was a minor hit for US girl band 3LW in 2001. Hall has subsequently written and produced for artists such as Justin Bieber and Maroon 5, while Butler has worked with artists including Backstreet Boys and Luther Vandross. Their lawyer, Gerard Fox, said he would not file an amendment to the original complaint, but planned to appeal Judge Fitzgerald's ruling. Fox said the judge should have found an expert to rule on the originality of the lyrics, rather than interpreting them himself. ""He cannot make himself an expert in the music industry,"" he said.

"No prospect of Stormont deal, says DUP","This video can not be played DUP had agreed a deal in the talks, says Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill There is ""no current prospect"" of a deal to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader has said. Arlene Foster said the talks failed due to disagreements with Sinn FÃ©in about legislation for the Irish language. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill accused the DUP of having ""collapsed"" the talks process. Both parties have been locked in negotiations in a bid to end the 13-month stalemate at Stormont. Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide NI Assembly divided by Irish language This video can not be played Theresa May's visit distracted from Stormont talks, says the DUP's Simon Hamilton Mrs O'Neill, Sinn FÃ©in's leader at Stormont, said her party had ""reached an accommodation with the leadership of the DUP"" but claimed that the DUP then ""failed to close"" on it. She added that Sinn FÃ©in was in contact with both the UK and Irish governments and would set out its ""considered position"" on Thursday. In her statement, Mrs Foster called on the UK government to set a budget and start making policy decisions for Northern Ireland. The DUP leader said that ""significant gaps"" remained in the discussions between the region's two biggest parties. Talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in had not resulted in a ""balanced package"", said Arlene Foster ""We do not have a fair and balanced package,"" she added, saying that Sinn FÃ©in's demand for legislation to give the Irish language official status in Northern Ireland was a key dividing issue. ""I respect the Irish language and those who speak it but in a shared society this cannot be a one-way street,"" she added. ""Respect for the unionist and British identity has not been reciprocated."" The DUP would continue to aim for a restoration of devolution, she said, but it would ""not accept a one-sided deal"". Karen Bradley said the UK government would have to take decisions for Northern Ireland After the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in blamed each other for the failure of the talks, the Northern Ireland secretary signalled that a deal remained possible. ""I believe the basis for an accommodation still exists,"" said Karen Bradley. ""We will continue to work with everyone to make sure we deliver this."" But Mrs Bradley added that the UK government would ""need to consider practical steps"" in the ""continued absence"" of devolution. She said ""challenging decisions"" would have to be taken and added that she intends to update MPs in Parliament next week. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar tweeted that he regretted the DUP's statement and that ""power sharing and working together are the only way forward"". Allow Twitter content?

Analysis:BBC News NI political correspondent Enda McClafferty At Stormont on Wednesday, you could sense that things were not going well behind the scenes. There was a great sense of optimism last week. But it became pretty clear there was a standoff developing after Tuesday. Arlene Foster had appeared before the cameras and said thata stand-alone Irish language act was not something the DUP could accept. Sinn FÃ©in came out and said there would be no deal unless it included one of those. We understand both parties met on Wednesday morning and quickly realised there was going to be no middle ground on an Irish language act. Then it was a matter of who was going to pull the plug first. Reporters were waiting in Stormont's Great Hall and we all thought we would hear from Sinn FÃ©in first. Then the statement from Mrs Foster popped up on Twitter, making it very clear that this phase of negotiations was over. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was ""disappointed"" and ""angry"" at the failure of the talks, and claimed it had left the Good Friday Agreement ""in peril"". He said the Stormont parties must resist a return to direct rule from Westminster, with ""the DUP having the whip hand"". Under an agreement struck last summer, the Conservative government relies on the DUP's support to stay in power at Westminster. Colum Eastwood said the SDLP would resist a return to direct rule from Westminster Mr Eastwood said the parties must ""not allow this moment to be the destruction of all that we have achieved"". ""We can't allow this British government, or this DUP to think that they're going to govern Northern Ireland on their own - that cannot be allowed to happen,"" the SDLP leader said. Robin Swann, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), described the talks process as a ""shambles"". He said: ""What I think we need to know, and what Northern Ireland clearly needs to know, is the door to devolution now firmly closed?"" Mr Swann called on the Northern Ireland secretary to provide clarity on whether it was the end of the talks or whether more negotiations were planned. Robin Swann questioned whether the talks breakdown meant devolution was finished The leader of Alliance Party, Naomi Long, said there was ""no prospect of a deal and no process in place that could lead to a deal"". ""We are in a very precarious situation at this point in time, we are essentially in uncharted territory,"" she added. Hopes of an imminent deal had been ""falsely raised"" over the weekend, she said, and ""now we have seen them dashed yet again"". Speculation of a breakthrough mounted over the weekend, as both the UK and Irish leaders prepared to travel to Stormont to help seal a deal. But Prime Minister Theresa May and Mr Varadkarleft Belfast on Monday with no sign of agreement. The visits by the UK and Irish PMs on Monday failed to secure a breakthrough Former DUP minister Simon Hamilton described their visit as ""a bit of a distraction"". ""I don't think it was entirely helpful in getting us to a successful conclusion,"" he told a press conference on Wednesday. Northern Ireland has been run by civil servants since the power-sharing executive made up of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in collapsed in January last year. The then deputy first minister Martin McGuinness pulled Sinn FÃ©in out of the coalition after a bitter split between the governing parties. Londonderry Chamber of Commerce President, Jennifer McKeever said the lack of a deal was ""disappointing and frustrating"". ""The collapse of the latest round of talks will come as another body blow for businesses in the North West which are facing the greatest economic challenge of our generation,"" she said. ""Thirteen months is too long to be without devolved government and the lack of leadership from Stormont in the Brexit negotiations has been particularly frustrating for the business community,"" she added.

'One person shot' outside NSA headquarters,"This video can not be played Bullet holes were visible in the windows of vehicle, which appears to have crashed into a concrete barrier Three people were injured and three suspects were taken into custody after a car crashed outside the US National Security Agency's headquarters. Gunfire rang out after the black SUV approached the facility in Fort Meade, Maryland, without authorisation. There is no indication yet of any link to terrorism, FBI officials said. The driver of the car, a civilian and an NSA police officer were taken to hospital, the agency said. Fort Meade, a US Army installation, is home to the NSA FBI special agent Gordon Johnson said the injured were all taken to hospital from the US Army base, which is about 30 miles (48km) north-east of Washington DC, after Wednesday morning's incident. No injuries appeared to be related to the gunfire, he said, and it appeared the gunfire was directed at the vehicle as part of NSA security protocol. ""We believe there is no indication that anything more than an isolated incident of what happened here today this morning,"" said Mr Johnson, stressing that it was not terrorism related. The civilian and the police officer suffered non-life threatening injuries, but the condition of the driver, an unidentified male, is unknown. Allow Twitter content?

The other two people in the vehicle, both males, were taken into NSA custody. The vehicle appears to be a hire car, Mr Johnson said. He said that it was an ongoing investigation and ""we're still in the fact-collecting business right now"" when asked about the motive of the vehicle's occupants. CBS News images showed the black sports utility vehicle with what looked like bullet holes in the front windscreen and its air bags appeared deployed. The incident occurred at the checkpoint known as Canine gate It appeared to have collided into some NSA-stamped concrete barricade blocks outside the installation. NBC News said its helicopter could see police surrounding a handcuffed man sitting on the ground. The FBI said on Twitter after the incident: ""NSA police and local law enforcement are addressing an incident that took place this morning at one of NSA's secure vehicle entry gates.

In March 2015, one person was killed and another seriously wounded after driving a vehicle up to the NSA's gate, ignoring commands to stop. News reports later suggested the two occupants of the vehicle may have been under the influence of drugs after attending a party. Despite highway signage, it is not unusual for motorists to take a wrong turn and end up at one of the heavily guarded gates to the sprawling NSA complex, where armed federal officers direct them to turn around.

Disability benefits system 'lacks trust',"Failings in disability benefits assessments - including claimants being asked when they had ""caught"" Down's syndrome - have led to a ""pervasive lack of trust"" in the system, MPs say. The Commons Work and Pensions Committee said reports by private contractors for the two main disability benefits, PIPs and ESA, were ""riddled with errors"". Andit said contractors ""universally missed"",externalthe set performance targets. A government spokesman said the assessments worked for the ""majority"". The committee said it had received an ""unprecedented"" number of responses from people who had claimed Personal Independence Payments (PIP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). Almost 4,000 claimants detailed ""shocking and moving, credible and consistent"" accounts, the report said. A recurrent complaint was that claimants did not believe the companies' assessors could be trusted to record evidence of their conditions accurately. Examplesgiven by the committee included,external: One claimant was said in her assessment report to walk her dog, despite not owning one and being barely able to walk at all Attempts to self harm being left out of assessment reports Another claimant, who remained in bed throughout her interview at home, was reported to have risen from a chair ""without any difficulty"" even though the only chair in the room was the one the assessor was sitting A former benefits assessor told the BBC some of her ex-colleagues ""copy and pasted"" their assessments. The unnamed woman told Victoria Derbyshire: ""The nurses (assessors) were under a lot of stress and I think it led to a lot of mistakes."" This video can not be played A former benefits assessor told Victoria Derbyshire that ex-colleagues  ""copy and pasted"" reports The MPs' report said ministers should consider taking the process back in-house from Capita, Maximus and Atos when contracts come up for renewal in 2019 and 2020. Committee chairman Labour MP Frank Field said the shortcomings were causing ""untenable"" human and financial cost. ""No-one should have any doubt the process needs urgent change,"" he said. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""As the Work and Pensions Select Committee highlights, assessments work for the majority of people, with 83% of ESA claimants and 76% of PIP claimants telling us that they're happy with their overall experience."" The DWP had already accepted more than 100 recommendations from five independent reviews of the Work Capability Assessment and commissioned two independent reviews of PIP assessments, he added. Capita said it was ""firmly committed to delivering a high-quality service"" and that its qualified healthcare professionals were ""dedicated to delivering professional and empathetic assessments for all claimants"". The Maximus-operated Centre for Health and Disability Assessments said it had achieved its quality standards in January but was ""fully committed to making further improvements"". And Independent Assessment Services - formerly known as Atos Healthcare - said its focus was on providing a ""professional and compassionate assessment service"".

"Trump lawyer admits paying porn starA private payment was made to Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had an affair with Donald Trump.2h2 hours agoUS & Canada","The newspaper says Mr Cohen declined to answer why the ""private transaction"" was made An adult film star who has been embroiled in allegations of an affair with President Donald Trump is free to tell her story, her manager has said. Stormy Daniels is no longer bound by a non-disclosure contract after Mr Trump's lawyer admitted he paid her, manager Gina Rodriguez says. Mr Trump's personal lawyer confirmed in a statement to media he privately paid Ms Daniels $130,000 (Â£95,000) in 2016. Ms Rodriguez says that acknowledgement allows her client to speak freely. Porn actress Stormy Daniels alleged in 2011 that she had an affair with Mr Trump in 2006 ""Everything is off now, and Stormy is going to tell her story,"" Ms Rodriguez told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Her statement comes after Trump lawyer Michael Cohen told the New York Times he paid Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. ""Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,""Mr Cohen told the New York Times,external. He said he told the Federal Election Commission the same after a watchdog group filed a complaint about the payment, claiming that it had served as an ""in-kind"" political contribution to Mr Trump's campaign. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Donald Trump's lawyer and all-around fixer Michael Cohen has said he doesn't plan ""further comment"" on his six-figure payment to Stormy Daniels. His statements, however, raise more questions than they answer. While he said the money came from his ""personal funds"" and was not reimbursed directly or indirectly by the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign, that leaves open the possibility that he was compensated by other parties - including Mr Trump himself. Why, in his generosity, would Mr Cohen give $130,000 to Ms Daniels? The Wall Street Journal has reported that it was in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement about a decade-old affair between Mr Trump and Ms Daniels. Circumstantial evidence - that Ms Daniels had been in contact with media outlets prior to the transfer and has since gone silent - lends credence to this line. Even though the alleged affair is long since past, a story about possible hush money and an attempted cover-up just weeks before the presidential election is much more dangerous for a White House already on its heels. And if it turns out there's more to the money trail than has been disclosed, an embarrassing situation could quickly morph into a criminal inquiry. A Stormy (Daniels) situation: A porn star scandal Trump can't shake ""The payment to Ms Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone,"" Mr Cohen said. The lawyer has previously said Mr Trump ""vehemently denies"" it occurred. The revelations on Wednesday follow US media reports that the porn actress known as Ms Daniels was paid to sign an agreement stopping her discussing an alleged affair. She first said she had a relationship with Mr Trump in a 2011 interview. In a 2011 interview with InTouch magazine,the actress said she began a sexual relationship with Mr Trump in 2006,external, shortly after Melania Trump gave birth to his son Barron. The reports re-emerged in January whenthe Wall Street Journal reported that she was paid to sign a non-disclosure agreement in the run up to the 2016 election,external, which prevented her from discussing the alleged liaison. Ms Clifford was believed to be in discussion with US media about a television appearance to discuss Mr Trump at the time, the report said. Responding to questions from CNN about why the payment was made, Mr Cohen said: ""Just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it can't cause you harm or damage."" ""I will always protect Mr Trump,"" Mr Cohen added. On 30 January, Ms Daniels' publicist released a statement in her name denying having an affair with Mr Trump. But many - including Ms Daniels herself - were quick to note that the signature attached to that denial did not bear much resemblance to another copy of her autograph which had been attached to an earlier statement. That denial had been released by Mr Cohen on 10 January. Ms Daniels hosted a Super Bowl party last month She has since made several public appearances on television and at strip clubs, but has remained tight-lipped when asked directly about Mr Trump in interviews. Minutes after Mr Trump's first formal State of the Union address to Congress, she gave an interview to late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel. In it, she refused to directly answer whether she had signed a non-disclosure agreement, or if she had ""ever made love to someone whose name rhymes with Lonald Lump"".

"Denmark's prince who wanted to be king diesFrench-born Prince Henrik, who made public his unhappiness at never being named king, dies at 83.2h2 hours agoEurope","This video can not be played Queen Margrethe married Prince Henrik in 1967 Prince Henrik of Denmark, the husband of Queen Margrethe who was famous for his public unhappiness at never being named king, has died at the age of 83. The controversial French-born prince had been diagnosed with dementia last year and was admitted to hospital in January with a lung infection. His flamboyant style was both loved and criticised by Danes. Frustrated with his royal title, he announced in 2017 thathe did not want to be buried next to his wife. The 77-year-old queen accepted her husband's decision, the Royal House said at the time, breaking a 459-year-old tradition of burying royal spouses together. The prince died ""peacefully in his sleep"" at the Fredensborg Castle, north of Copenhagen, with Queen Margrethe and their two sons - Crown Prince Frederick and Prince Joachim - at his side. Unhappy with his royal status, Prince Henrik was a controversial figure in Denmark Born Henri Marie Jean AndrÃ© de Laborde de Monpezat on 11 June 1934, Prince Henrik married the then-crown princess Margrethe in 1967. He met her while stationed in London as a diplomat. When she became queen in 1972, he was named Prince Consort - as in most monarchies, a princess traditionally becomes queen when her husband takes the throne, but a man does not become king if his wife becomes queen. But over the years, the prince - who changed his name to Henrik as a mark of respect - made no secret about his unhappiness at being denied the title of king. And many Danes disliked him for that, seeing it as a sign of an arrogant man hungry for recognition. Prince Henrik did not take it lightly when, in 2002, Crown Prince Frederik was chosen to represent Queen Margrethe at a New Year's ceremony, instead of him. Saying he had to ""reflect on life"",he dramatically fled to his chateau in southern France,external, where he would stay for three weeks. To a Danish tabloid, he said the royal staff had shunted him into ""third place in the royal hierarchy"". He had felt ""pushed aside, degraded and humiliated"", and his self-respect was being destroyed. ""For many years I have been Denmark's number two,"" he said then. ""I've been satisfied with that role, but I don't want to be relegated to number three."" Read more Call to end Danish royal hunt rights Danes 'dislike paying' for ex-princess Danish queen 'proud of her people' The world's longest-reigning monarchs Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik at the Anglo-Danish Society's Jubilee dinner in London in 1974 While the episode became a source of joke for many, it was a turning point for others, especially many young Danes, who thought his manner represented a break from the norms of cultural uniformity in Danish society. Prince Henrik was also known for his thick French accent and his love of food, wine and poetry, and several of his cookbooks and collections of poems have been published. In 2016, he retired from official duties, renouncing the title of Prince Consort. In the time since, he was often in France at his private vineyard. Prince Henrik and Queen Margrethe pictured in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in 2015 Prince Henrik did not want a state funeral, the Royal House said, adding that the ceremony would be small and private. Following his wish, he will be cremated, with half his ashes spread over Danish seas and the other half buried in the royal private garden at the Fredensborg Castle.

Uncle guilty of freezer body murder,"Celine Dookhran was found dead in an empty house in Kingston, south-west London An uncle has been jailed for life for kidnapping, raping and slitting the throat of his niece before putting her body in a deep freezer. Mujahid Arshid, 33, was found guilty of murdering Celine Dookhran, 20, and the attempted murder of a second woman. Arshid, who will serve at least 40 years in prison, snatched the women in July before taking them to a house in Kingston, south west London. His co-accused, Vincent Tappu, 28, was cleared of kidnapping charges. Both defendants were cleared of possession of a firearm with intent for allegedly using a Taser during the abduction, which took place on 19 July 2017. Arshid, of Homefield Gardens, Mitcham, has also been convicted of sexual assault charges against the second woman between 2008 and 2010. Killer told police of rape plan before kidnap Members of Ms Dookhran's family shouted ""yes"" when the verdicts were read out. Arshid reacted by shouting that the surviving victim had ""killed them all"", while Mr Tappu - in tears - thanked the jury. Mujahid Arshid denied raping and murdering his niece Celine Dookhran The surviving victim took to the witness box to face Arshid and read her own victim impact statement. She said ""flashbacks and nightmares prevent me from moving on"" and physical scarring from the attack is a ""constant reminder of what Celine and I went through"". A statement from Ms Dookhran's mother Iman was read out, in which she said her daughter ""fell victim to pure evil"" and that ""coming to terms with her death is likely to be a lifelong assignment"". ""She will always be there in the darkness that surrounds us,"" the statement added. The women were put in the boot of a vehicle and driven to an empty six-bedroom house in Kingston Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC said Arshid was obsessed with his niece Ms Dookhran, who worked in a bank. Arshid spent weeks planning to abduct and kill both women in a plot that was as ""bizarre as it is terrible"", Mr Aylett said. While Mr Tappu was cleared of kidnap, Mr Justice Edis said he was ""satisfied"" a ""second man"" helped with the initial abduction. This video can not be played The surviving victim's family said the crime was not an honour killing The court heard there had been unhappiness in Ms Dookhran's family about a relationship she was in and that she had been staying at a property occupied by Mr Arshid after leaving home. The evening before the murder there had been a family meeting attended by Mr Arshid during which pressure was placed on Ms Dookhran and her boyfriend to end their association, jurors heard. At the empty six-bedroom house in Kingston, Arshid raped both women in turn before slashing Ms Dookhran's throat in the bathroom. The second woman, who cannot be identified, was badly injured but managed to escape after talking Arshid round. Speaking to police from her hospital bed, she described hearing screams and thuds as Arshid killed Ms Dookhran while she was tied to a chair downstairs. The woman fought for her life when Arshid turned on her, cutting her throat and wrists. In court, the defendants watched a police interview the surviving woman gave from her hospital bed She told officers: ""He said: 'Now you've got 10 minutes to live and your body will shut down.' I was trying to play dead. ""He molested Celine's body while she was dead and then he molested me thinking I was dead. He's such a psycho. ""I sat up and he said: 'How have you got so much energy?' I was covered in blood from head to toe. I was swimming in it. ""I started saying things he wanted to hear - 'I love you, we can run away together, we can be happy together, we can have a family'. ""He said 'I'm not good enough for you, look what I have done'."" She told the court: ""I'm not going to lie, I was scared for my life. I thought, if we get out alive, he cannot get away with this."" Celine Dookhran's phone was found in Arshid's Folkestone hotel room after the killing Arshid was arrested at a hotel in Folkestone, Kent, the morning after Ms Dookhran was killed. Det Ch Insp Sam Price described Arshid's actions as a ""sexually motivated attack of unspeakable violence and horror."" She added: ""Celine's family have been forced to sit through weeks of reliving their daughter's last hours and they have done this with absolute dignity. ""Their distress has been compounded by the fact Arshid was someone they knew and trusted."" Mujahid Arshid has been convicted on a number of counts including sexually abusing his surviving victim a decade ago - so could he have been stopped before he became a killer? His surviving victim alerted some members of her family to his behaviour in 2011, but her story was not accepted. It was two years later that Arshid came on to the police radar when he was caught in an operation aimed at trapping paedophiles. The Crown Prosecution Service wanted to bring a case, but they could not because the police failed to find Arshid's laptop. This police investigation will now form part of a review. It is only when that is complete that it will become clear whether a missed opportunity developed into a fatal chain of events.

'Lack of trust' in benefits system,"Failings in disability benefits assessments - including claimants being asked when they had ""caught"" Down's syndrome - have led to a ""pervasive lack of trust"" in the system, MPs say. The Commons Work and Pensions Committee said reports by private contractors for the two main disability benefits, PIPs and ESA, were ""riddled with errors"". Andit said contractors ""universally missed"",externalthe set performance targets. A government spokesman said the assessments worked for the ""majority"". The committee said it had received an ""unprecedented"" number of responses from people who had claimed Personal Independence Payments (PIP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). Almost 4,000 claimants detailed ""shocking and moving, credible and consistent"" accounts, the report said. A recurrent complaint was that claimants did not believe the companies' assessors could be trusted to record evidence of their conditions accurately. Examplesgiven by the committee included,external: One claimant was said in her assessment report to walk her dog, despite not owning one and being barely able to walk at all Attempts to self harm being left out of assessment reports Another claimant, who remained in bed throughout her interview at home, was reported to have risen from a chair ""without any difficulty"" even though the only chair in the room was the one the assessor was sitting A former benefits assessor told the BBC some of her ex-colleagues ""copy and pasted"" their assessments. The unnamed woman told Victoria Derbyshire: ""The nurses (assessors) were under a lot of stress and I think it led to a lot of mistakes."" This video can not be played A former benefits assessor told Victoria Derbyshire that ex-colleagues  ""copy and pasted"" reports The MPs' report said ministers should consider taking the process back in-house from Capita, Maximus and Atos when contracts come up for renewal in 2019 and 2020. Committee chairman Labour MP Frank Field said the shortcomings were causing ""untenable"" human and financial cost. ""No-one should have any doubt the process needs urgent change,"" he said. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""As the Work and Pensions Select Committee highlights, assessments work for the majority of people, with 83% of ESA claimants and 76% of PIP claimants telling us that they're happy with their overall experience."" The DWP had already accepted more than 100 recommendations from five independent reviews of the Work Capability Assessment and commissioned two independent reviews of PIP assessments, he added. Capita said it was ""firmly committed to delivering a high-quality service"" and that its qualified healthcare professionals were ""dedicated to delivering professional and empathetic assessments for all claimants"". The Maximus-operated Centre for Health and Disability Assessments said it had achieved its quality standards in January but was ""fully committed to making further improvements"". And Independent Assessment Services - formerly known as Atos Healthcare - said its focus was on providing a ""professional and compassionate assessment service"".

Denmark's prince who wanted to be king dies,"This video can not be played Queen Margrethe married Prince Henrik in 1967 Prince Henrik of Denmark, the husband of Queen Margrethe who was famous for his public unhappiness at never being named king, has died at the age of 83. The controversial French-born prince had been diagnosed with dementia last year and was admitted to hospital in January with a lung infection. His flamboyant style was both loved and criticised by Danes. Frustrated with his royal title, he announced in 2017 thathe did not want to be buried next to his wife. The 77-year-old queen accepted her husband's decision, the Royal House said at the time, breaking a 459-year-old tradition of burying royal spouses together. The prince died ""peacefully in his sleep"" at the Fredensborg Castle, north of Copenhagen, with Queen Margrethe and their two sons - Crown Prince Frederick and Prince Joachim - at his side. Unhappy with his royal status, Prince Henrik was a controversial figure in Denmark Born Henri Marie Jean AndrÃ© de Laborde de Monpezat on 11 June 1934, Prince Henrik married the then-crown princess Margrethe in 1967. He met her while stationed in London as a diplomat. When she became queen in 1972, he was named Prince Consort - as in most monarchies, a princess traditionally becomes queen when her husband takes the throne, but a man does not become king if his wife becomes queen. But over the years, the prince - who changed his name to Henrik as a mark of respect - made no secret about his unhappiness at being denied the title of king. And many Danes disliked him for that, seeing it as a sign of an arrogant man hungry for recognition. Prince Henrik did not take it lightly when, in 2002, Crown Prince Frederik was chosen to represent Queen Margrethe at a New Year's ceremony, instead of him. Saying he had to ""reflect on life"",he dramatically fled to his chateau in southern France,external, where he would stay for three weeks. To a Danish tabloid, he said the royal staff had shunted him into ""third place in the royal hierarchy"". He had felt ""pushed aside, degraded and humiliated"", and his self-respect was being destroyed. ""For many years I have been Denmark's number two,"" he said then. ""I've been satisfied with that role, but I don't want to be relegated to number three.""

Prince Henrik was also known for his thick French accent and his love of food, wine and poetry, and several of his cookbooks and collections of poems have been published. In 2016, he retired from official duties, renouncing the title of Prince Consort. In the time since, he was often in France at his private vineyard. Prince Henrik and Queen Margrethe pictured in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in 2015 Prince Henrik did not want a state funeral, the Royal House said, adding that the ceremony would be small and private. Following his wish, he will be cremated, with half his ashes spread over Danish seas and the other half buried in the royal private garden at the Fredensborg Castle. Queen Margrethe already has a specially-built sarcophagus in a cathedral west of Copenhagen where the remains of Danish royals are buried.

Alleged rape victim 'very upset' in taxi,"Both Stuart Olding and Paddy Jackson deny raping the woman The taxi driver who drove an alleged rape victim home from the house of Ulster rugby player Paddy Jackson has told a court that she seemed ""very upset"" throughout the journey. Stephen Fisher, who was working for Fonacab at the time, said she was ""sobbing into herself"". He added: ""The young woman definitely seemed very upset. ""She was crying/sobbing throughout the journey."" He also said: ""She didn't really talk very much at all bar telling me where she needed to go to."" Rory Harrison denies charges of perverting the course of justice and withholding information Paddy Jackson and fellow Ulster and Ireland rugby player Stuart Olding deny raping the same woman in a house in south Belfast in June 2016. One of their friends, Rory Harrison, arranged a taxi home for himself and the young woman. At her house, he walked her to the front door. The driver said at one point during the journey, he heard Mr Harrison speaking on the phone to someone else. Mr Fisher told the court he heard Mr Harrison say: ""She's with me now. She's not good. I'll call in the morning."" The driver said that during the journey Mr Harrison comforted the woman, who was 19 at the time. The taxi driver told the court that after leaving off the woman, he asked Mr Harrison ""did you have a rough night?"" and one of things he said in his brief reply was ""you have no idea"". Under cross-examination, it was pointed out to Mr Fisher that he had not used that phrase in his police statement, but the taxi driver maintained that it was what he had heard. Asked in detail about how emotional the woman had been, he said she had been upset but was not crying out loud. The taxi driver said that when the police contacted him a few days later ""I knew straight away what it was in relation to"". One of the best friends of the alleged victim also gave evidence in court on Wednesday. She was the first person the young woman told about the alleged rapes. The friend read out in court a series of text messages they exchanged the day after the alleged rapes by Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding. In one of the texts, the alleged victim said: ""They are scum. It's that schoolboy rugby attitude times a million."" Blane McIlroy denies one count of exposure She later texted: ""It will be a case of my word against theirs ... and they'll all have the same fabricated story about me being some slut who was up for it."" Her friend encouraged her to go to the police and a rape crisis centre. She texted: ""You just can't deal with this on your own. This is beyond serious now."" They later went to the Brook Clinic, a sexual health service, in Belfast as they could not find a rape crisis centre. Rory Harrison, 25, of Manse Road, Belfast is charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information. He denies the charges. Paddy Jackson, 26, from Belfast's Oakleigh Park, is charged with one count of rape and one count of sexual assault. He denies the charges. Stuart Olding, 24, from Ardenlee Street, Belfast, is also charged with rape. He too denies the charge. Another man has also been charged in connection with the case. Blane McIlroy, 26, of Royal Lodge Road, Belfast, is charged with one count of exposure. He denies the charge. The 12-person jury has been told by Judge Patricia Smyth to wait until they hear all of the evidence in the case before coming to any final conclusions.

European Union growth rate at 10-year high,"The European Union economy grew at its fastest pace in a decade last year, figures from the EU statistics office Eurostat have confirmed. The 28-strong EU expanded by 2.5% in 2017, its strongest performance since 2007, when it grew by  2.7%. In the final three months both the EU and the 19-nation eurozone grew by 0.6% compared with the previous quarter. That was mirrored by growth in the EU's biggest economy, Germany, which grew by 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017. France also expanded by 0.6%, while Spanish growth was a notch stronger at 0.7%. Overall in 2017, the eurozone grew by 2.5%, Eurostat said, the fastest growth rate since a 3% rise in 2007. These latest figures confirm the flash estimates published by Eurostat at the end of January, which were based on more limited data. Investec economist Ryan Djajasaputra said much of the growth last year had been driven by the eurozone's core four economies: Germany, France, Italy and Spain. However, Eastern European economies, including Latvia and Slovakia, were growing ""particularly fast"", he added. He attributed the strength of the eurozone to the European Central Bank's (ECB) stimulus policies, which have brought down the cost of borrowing in recent years. In addition, he said confidence had been hitting record levels since the crisis years in the eurozone and unemployment was down to pre-crisis levels. Sarah Hewin, chief economist Europe at Standard Chartered, said: ""Activity is being supported by strong global growth, which is helping European exporters. ""In terms of domestic factors, rising wages, low inflation and record-level employment are driving consumer spending; meanwhile, investment is rising, helped by strong corporate profitability and buoyant confidence."" However, while she expected eurozone economic growth to stay strong, ""higher energy prices and a stronger euro may be headwinds to growth this year"". Standard Chartered is forecasting eurozone growth of 2.2% in 2018 and 2% in 2019. ""On the political front, uncertainty may build around Italy's general election next month; and if the UK leaves the EU without a transition arrangement, that could undermine euro-area exports next year,"" added Ms Hewin. This video can not be played Helene Baudchon of BNP Paribas says the whole eurozone is enjoying a similar positive growth momentum KPMG chief economist Yael Selfin said the figures confirmed the ""continuation of strong growth momentum in [the] eurozone, helped by generous support from the European Central Bank and a more pro-growth political drive in some of its main economies. ""While there is probably still significant room for the ECB before it starts tightening its monetary policy, a further pick-up in activity could see a more accelerated scale back of its quantitative easing programme,"" she added. After many false dawns, at last some sunlight has fallen on Europe's strongest economies. Growth across the European Union is at levels not seen since 2007. And the continent's powerhouse countries - Germany and France - are seeing growth at levels not experienced since the financial crisis bounce-back of 2010.

Crypto-cash craze 'hinders alien search',"If there is intelligent life out there, it might be broadcasting signals across the universe Scientists listening out for broadcasts by extra-terrestrials are struggling to get the computer hardware they need, thanks to the crypto-currency mining craze, a radio-astronomer has said. Seti (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) researchers want to expand operations at two observatories. However, they have found that key computer chips are in short supply. ""We'd like to use the latest GPUs [graphics processing units]... and we can't get 'em,"" said Dan Werthimer. Demand for GPUs has soared recently thanks to crypto-currency mining. ""That's limiting our search for extra-terrestrials, to try to answer the question, 'Are we alone? Is there anybody out there?',"" Dr Werthimer told the BBC. ""This is a new problem, it's only happened on orders we've been trying to make in the last couple of months."" Mining a currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum involves connecting computers to a global network and using them to solve complex mathematical puzzles. This forms part of the process of validating transactions made by people who use the currency. As a reward for this work, the miners receive a small crypto-currency payment, making it potentially profitable. Russian nuclear scientists arrested for 'Bitcoin mining plot' Bitcoin mining gobbles Iceland energy supplies Bitcoin falls below $6,000 GPUs are high-performance chips and aren't just used for powering video games - they may be stacked together by Bitcoin miners, radio-astronomers or others interested in processing large amounts of data for certain applications. ""At Seti we want to look at as many frequency channels as we possibly can because we don't know what frequency ET will be broadcasting on and we want to look for lots of different signal types - is it AM or FM, what communication are they using?"" explained Dr Werthimer, who is chief scientist at the Berkeley Seti Research Center. ""That takes a lot of computing power."" GPUs are an important part of the Hera radio-telescope in South Africa He added that, at some telescopes, Berkeley Seti has around 100 GPUs crunching data from large listening arrays. These arrays can pick up the faintest of radio frequencies that have been flung across our solar system from elsewhere in the universe - often from natural phenomena such as collapsing stars. The Seti scientists are currently trying to improve their capacity for analysing such data at two observatories -Green Bank in West Virginia,externalandParkes in Australia,external. But they have been hit by the GPU shortage. ""We've got the money, we've contacted the vendors, and they say, 'We just don't have them',"" said Dr Werthimer. Earlier this year, there were reports that video gamers had been hit by a sudden rise in the cost of GPUs,thanks in particular to a rise in Ethereum mining,external, which can be done with chips aimed at consumers. At the time, major chip-maker Nvidia said thatretailers should make arrangements,externalto make sure gamers' demands were met. In a conference call last week, Nvidia's chief executive told investors the company was ""working really hard"" to ""catch up with supply"" and get GPUs to the marketplace. This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC's Dave Lee visits the Green Bank Telescope Other radio-astronomers have been affected. A group looking for evidence of the earliest stars in the universe was recently shocked to see that the cost of the GPUs it wanted had doubled. ""We're in the process of expanding our telescope - we got a grant from the National Science Foundation here in the United States to do so,"" saidAaron Parsons,externalat the University of California at Berkeley. Prof Parsons' radio telescope,the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (Hera),external, is an American, British and South African project located in South Africa's western plains. Prof Parsons at the Hera radio telescope array in South Africa It has been designed to listen to low frequency radio waves emitted by the reionising hydrogen gas that permeated the universe before the first stars and galaxies formed. GPUs are needed in order to bring together data from Hera's many small radio telescopes - this synthesises a much larger array, offering an especially wide field of view peering out into the universe. Three months ago, the Hera team had budgeted for a set of GPUs that cost around $500 (Â£360) - the price has since doubled to $1,000. ""We'll be able to weather it but it is coming out of our contingency budget."" added Prof Parsons. ""We're buying a lot of these things, it's going to end up costing about $32,000 extra."" He also said he was concerned that future work could even be stopped in its tracks, should the GPU shortage worsen. Thanks in part to a recent boom in the price of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, mining crypto-currencies has never been more popular. While Bitcoin miners have largely moved on tospecialised ""Asic"" chipsthat have been designed from scratch to support mining, it's still possible to use GPUs on the Ethereum mining network to lucrative ends, according to cyber-security expert Matthew Hickey at Hacker House. GPUs are often connected together to carry out the laborious task of crytpo-currency mining ""[You can] use GPUs effectively to turn a small profit, you're not going to make millions but if you put 12 or 24 GPUs together, you'll make back the cost in six months,"" he told the BBC. GPUs are versatile, he added, pointing out that cyber-security experts sometimes use them for password-cracking experiments, in which computers make many millions of attempts at breaking into a system. But Mr Hickey has also noticed that GPUs are now being sold on sites such as Ebay at inflated prices. ""It's becoming increasingly difficult to find suppliers and cards,"" he said.

SA's Zuma defies 'unfair' calls to quit,"This video can not be played South Africa's president Jacob Zuma: 'They never provided a reason' South Africa's embattled President Jacob Zuma says he has done nothing wrong and sees no reason to stand down. Mr Zuma spoke after the ruling African National Congress (ANC) gave him an ultimatum to resign by the end of the day or face a parliamentary vote of no confidence on Thursday. The 75-year-old has come under increasing pressure to resign amid numerous allegations of corruption. But he said the ANC had failed to explain why he had been recalled. In a lengthy, unannounced, interview with national broadcaster SABC, Mr Zuma made no reference to the early morning police raids and arrests at the home of his close associates, the wealthy, Indian-born Gupta family. The Guptas have been accused of using their close friendship with the president to wield enormous political influence. Both parties deny all allegations of wrongdoing. Africa Live: Zuma vows not to resign Long read: The many trials of Jacob Zuma Mr Zuma stressed that he was not defying the ANC but he disagreed with its decision to ask him to resign. ""It was very unfair to me that this issue is raised,"" he said. ""Nobody has ever provided the reasons. Nobody is saying what I have done."" Mr Zuma's decision to cling on to power has put him at odds with South Africa's deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's new leader and his expected successor. The Gupta family's walled compound in Johannesburg was sealed off during the police raid President Zuma told SABC he had offered to go after June, but objected to the way the issue was currently being handled. He said he would make a further statement later on Wednesday. How the Guptas' brand turned toxic Profile: Jacob Zuma The ANC said it had noted Mr Zuma's televised comments but would await his promised later statement before responding further. Earlier, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu announced that a motion of no-confidence in the president would be heard on Thursday, with Mr Ramaphosa sworn in as the nation's president as soon as possible after that. A meeting of the ANC's National Executive Committee had announced its decision to recall Mr Zuma on Tuesday and gave him until the end of Wednesday to resign. Three people were arrested during the raid, with local media saying two more expected to hand themselves in. A lawyer for the family told Reuters that none of the three Gupta brothers - Atul, Rajesh and Ajay - were among those arrested. According to a statement released by the Hawks - the police's elite high-priority crimes unit - the raids were carried out in connection with the Vrede farm investigation. Who are the Guptas? That investigation relates to the Estina dairy farm near Vrede, in the Free State, a project which was originally meant to help poor black farmers but from which the Gupta family are alleged to have pocketed millions of dollars, allegations they deny. Atul Gupta shakes hands with President Zuma in 2012. Their relationship has come under scrutiny in recent years A tranche of leaked emails released last year alleged that some of the money ended up paying for the family's lavish wedding at Sun City, South Africa's upmarket holiday resort. In January, the Hawks raided the offices of the Free State premier, Ace Magashule, looking for documents linked to the project. Mr Magashule was elected secretary-general of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in December. The Gupta family own a range of business interests in South Africa, including computing, mining, air travel, energy, technology and media. The three brothers moved to the country in 1993 from India, just as white-minority rule was ending. They are known friends of President Zuma; his son, daughter and one of his wives worked for the family's firms. The brothers have been accused of wielding enormous political influence in South Africa, with critics alleging that they have tried to ""capture the state"" to advance their own business interests. The wrangle over Mr Zuma's presidency has caused political upheaval in South Africa and threatened to split the ANC. Last week's scheduled state of the nation address was postponed amid fears it would be disrupted by Mr Zuma's opponents. Mr Ramaphosa has vowed to revive the ANC's failing popularity by cracking down on corruption and cronyism. Elections are due in 2019 but the opposition is demanding they be brought forward.

"European Union growth rate at 10-year highThe EU and the eurozone both expanded at their fastest pace in a decade in 2017, figures confirm.1h31 minutes agoBusinessComments","The European Union economy grew at its fastest pace in a decade last year, figures from the EU statistics office Eurostat have confirmed. The 28-strong EU expanded by 2.5% in 2017, its strongest performance since 2007, when it grew by  2.7%. In the final three months both the EU and the 19-nation eurozone grew by 0.6% compared with the previous quarter. That was mirrored by growth in the EU's biggest economy, Germany, which grew by 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017. France also expanded by 0.6%, while Spanish growth was a notch stronger at 0.7%. Overall in 2017, the eurozone grew by 2.5%, Eurostat said, the fastest growth rate since a 3% rise in 2007. These latest figures confirm the flash estimates published by Eurostat at the end of January, which were based on more limited data. Investec economist Ryan Djajasaputra said much of the growth last year had been driven by the eurozone's core four economies: Germany, France, Italy and Spain. However, Eastern European economies, including Latvia and Slovakia, were growing ""particularly fast"", he added. He attributed the strength of the eurozone to the European Central Bank's (ECB) stimulus policies, which have brought down the cost of borrowing in recent years. In addition, he said confidence had been hitting record levels since the crisis years in the eurozone and unemployment was down to pre-crisis levels. Sarah Hewin, chief economist Europe at Standard Chartered, said: ""Activity is being supported by strong global growth, which is helping European exporters. ""In terms of domestic factors, rising wages, low inflation and record-level employment are driving consumer spending; meanwhile, investment is rising, helped by strong corporate profitability and buoyant confidence."" However, while she expected eurozone economic growth to stay strong, ""higher energy prices and a stronger euro may be headwinds to growth this year"". Standard Chartered is forecasting eurozone growth of 2.2% in 2018 and 2% in 2019. ""On the political front, uncertainty may build around Italy's general election next month; and if the UK leaves the EU without a transition arrangement, that could undermine euro-area exports next year,"" added Ms Hewin. This video can not be played Helene Baudchon of BNP Paribas says the whole eurozone is enjoying a similar positive growth momentum KPMG chief economist Yael Selfin said the figures confirmed the ""continuation of strong growth momentum in [the] eurozone, helped by generous support from the European Central Bank and a more pro-growth political drive in some of its main economies. ""While there is probably still significant room for the ECB before it starts tightening its monetary policy, a further pick-up in activity could see a more accelerated scale back of its quantitative easing programme,"" she added. After many false dawns, at last some sunlight has fallen on Europe's strongest economies. Growth across the European Union is at levels not seen since 2007. And the continent's powerhouse countries - Germany and France - are seeing growth at levels not experienced since the financial crisis bounce-back of 2010. Those were the good old days, when many believed that the worst of the financial crisis was already behind us. The bounce, sadly, was what markets describe as a ""dead cat"". That is, not going anywhere positive. After the false dawn of 2010, there followed years of economic calamity as the financial crisis morphed into a currency crisis and the economic collapse of Europe's smaller, indebted economies, led by Greece and infecting Portugal and Ireland, as well as Spain.

Anti-abortion activists target hospital,"The activists intend to take part in a ""prayer vigil"" outside the hospital for 40 days Anti-abortion activists have begun a 40-day ""vigil"" next to a Nottingham hospital - despite the trust asking them to stay away. The Christian movement, called 40 Days for Life, insists its presence at the Queen's Medical Centre is ""peaceful"". However, researchers into this type of activism have said it is a form of street harassment that is ""incredibly intimidating and distressing"". The hospital said the activists had previously caused ""distress"". John Edwards, from Nottingham 40 Days for Life, said the group was ""always peaceful"". ""40 Days for Life is a vigil of prayer, not a protest. We pray - for the unborn, and for their mothers, who are also harmed by abortion,"" he said. ""If anyone approaches us, we will talk to them, and can direct women to sources of support to help them keep their baby if that is what they wish. Many women around the country have been helped by such vigils."" The movement claims to help women by showing them an alternative to abortion, and claims many women have been grateful for their presence outside clinics. The BBC asked to speak to some of these women but 40 Days for Life has not provided any contact details. The activists took part in a ""vigil of prayer"" at the same hospital in 2016 and in 2017 (above) The action has been timed to coincide with Lent and it is the third year in a row that it has taken place in Nottingham. They intend to be there from 06:00 GMT to 18:00 every day, with different activists signing up for ""vigil hours"". Home Office review over harassment at abortion clinics Council backs move to stop anti-abortion 'harassment' Ealing abortion clinic protest ban approved In previous years they gathered outside the Circle Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre, where abortions and other medical procedures are carried out. However, this year they are by the hospital entrance on Leen Gate, which is just off NHS land. It is thought to be Nottingham City Council land, and the council is investigating what action it can take. Councillor Nick McDonald described the actions of the group as a ""protest"" and said it is ""not wanted in Nottingham"" Councillor Nick McDonald, portfolio holder for adults and health, said: ""We understand that despite a clear warning from both NUH [Nottingham University Hospitals] and from the council that this protest is not wanted in Nottingham, its organisers have pushed ahead with it. ""We will repeat, we fully support the trust's stance on this issue, and for our part we will not put up with Nottingham residents, whether staff or patients, being intimidated or harassed as has happened in previous years."" Councillor Toby Neal, portfolio holder for community and customer services, said: ""We are aware that the protest has started, and we are investigating what action we can take to ensure the protection of the public. We will not shy away from taking any action we deem necessary to do that."" Pro-Choice Nottingham activists took part in counter demonstrations last year In November, Home Secretary Amber Ruddordered an assessment of protests outside abortion clinics,externalfollowing concerns about the tactics of some ""aggressive"" protesters. Dr Pam Lowe from Aston University has been researching anti-abortion activism in public spaces for nearly three years. ""All the evidence suggests that women do find this incredibly intimidating and distressing and we think it constitutes a form of street harassment,"" she said. ""It's all very well for them to say 'we're peaceful', and that might be the case, but women approaching don't know that, they don't know who these people are. ""You have to understand that women generally are nervous about public places, or can be nervous if they see a group of strangers."" Dr Lowe said the Nottingham demonstration is unusual because it is at a hospital, while most demonstrations take place outside abortion clinics. The activists previously gathered next to the Circle Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre, which is on the Queen's Medical Centre site Before the demonstration began, Tracy Taylor, chief executive of Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ""Previous protests by this group have caused very considerable distress to patients, visitors and staff, which we are not prepared to allow to happen again. ""As such, we do not give permission for any such protest to take place on our site."" However, the activists are thought to be just off NHS land, so it is not clear what the hospital can do. The trust has said it does not support ""any protest, on any matter"" that ""impacts adversely on our patients, visitors and staff"". It has not specified what action it will take, but in a statement said: ""We are working closely with partner agencies to protect our patients and staff and have proactively explored a range of options should action be necessary from Wednesday so that we can ensure that all who need to access our services can do so and without intimidation or unnecessary distress."" Dr Pam Lowe said women having abortions can find even ""peaceful"" demonstrations intimidating and distressing Dr Lowe has analysed comments made by women who have encountered anti-abortion activists on their way into clinics. ""It is intimidating, if all you know as a woman approaching the clinic seeking an abortion is there is a group of people on the pavement who want to stop you and you don't know what they're going to be doing,"" she said. ""Also they feel it's an invasion of healthcare privacy, so it draws attention to the space and it's a shaming position. It's drawing public attention to what's happening. ""This is a very private decision, it's a healthcare decision, and we wouldn't normally expect our private decisions to be made public in the way that it is."" She said counter demonstrations can potentially have a negative effect on women too, although some are timed so they are run at times when the clinics are not seeing women. ""The more there is a public spectacle outside the clinic the more difficult it can be for women. So it would be better for everybody involved if no-one was right outside the clinic,"" she said. Rachel Strong, from Pro-Choice Nottingham, took part in counter demonstrations in 2017 Rachel Strong, an activist with Pro-Choice Nottingham, took part in counter demonstrations in 2017 and campaigned to stop 40 Days for Life from going on the hospital site again. ""A small group of us were quite horrified by what they were doing because we are aware that it's really intimidating for anybody accessing reproductive healthcare to have to walk past these kind of vigils, these kind of demonstrations,"" she said. The group had planned further counter demonstrations if 40 Days for Life returned to the entrance to Circle Nottingham, where women have abortions. However, the demonstrations have been cancelled for now as 40 Days for Life are in a different location. ""As this area is away from the treatment centre entrance and there is no sight of it from there we will not be holding a counter demo unless the situation changes,"" said Ms Strong.

South Africa police raid Zuma allies' home,"Atul Gupta (centre) shakes hands with President Jacob Zuma (right) in 2012. Their relationship has come under scrutiny in recent years South Africa's elite police unit has raided the home of a controversial business family linked to President Jacob Zuma, as pressure increases on him to stand down. Officials say three people were arrested as part of an investigation into the wealthy, Indian-born Guptas. They have been accused of using their close friendship with Mr Zuma to wield enormous political influence. Meanwhile, Mr Zuma's party has given him until the end of the day to resign. His links to the Guptas are one of the reasons he is being forced to resign before the 2019 general election. The Guptas and Mr Zuma deny all allegations of wrongdoing. Africa Live: Finance minister warns Zuma he could be voted out How the Guptas' brand turned toxic in South Africa Long read: The many trials of Jacob Zuma Pressure has been slowly increasing on Mr Zuma to stand down in recent weeks.He was expected to respond to a formal request from the African National Congress (ANC) to step downat some point on Wednesday. However, shortly after ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu announced that a motion of no-confidence in the president would be heard on Thursday, Mr Zuma appeared on television to say he was not prepared to stand down immediately ashe had not be given good reasons as to why he should resign. By Andrew Harding, BBC News, Johannesburg The timing is remarkableâ¦ So why did South Africa's elite Hawks choose to move against the Guptas now? There are four possibilities: 1: This was a genuine coincidence. The Hawks have, in recent weeks, begun to accelerate their investigation into alleged corruption at the Estina Dairy in Vrede[scroll down to read more on the allegations], with assets already seized, and prosecutions prepared, so perhaps, given the unpredictable way the political drama surrounding President Zuma is unfolding, this is just one of those serendipitous things. 2: The Hawks, with an eye on the news and the clear sense that President Zuma is losing power - and therefore any protection that the Guptas enjoyed as his friends is waning too - decided there was a risk members of the Indian-born family might flee the country. 3: The man who presumably authorised the move against the Guptas, the National Prosecuting Chief Sean Abrahams, saw the way the tide was turning against Mr Zuma (who appointed him). Mr Abrahams has been branded ""Sean The Sheep"" by South African media, following widespread claims that he has helped to protect Mr Zuma, the Guptas and others from corruption investigations. Mr Abrahams, who denies the allegations, might be looking to curry favour with any new ANC-led administration. 4: Cyril Ramaphosa, or those close to him, somehow influenced the police into launching the move in a deliberate attempt to put added pressure on President Zuma. His son, Duduzane, works for the Guptas and is being talked of as a possible target of the NPA's investigations. This would be an illegal move, but one that many South Africans now see as entirely possible, given the apparent politicisation of the justice system and the erosion of key institutions during the Zuma era. According to a statement released by the Hawks - the police's elite high-priority crimes unit - the raids were carried out in connection with the Vrede farm investigation. Three people were arrested during the raid, with two more expected to hand themselves in. According to local media, one of those arrested was a Gupta family member. Watch: President Zuma's son on his relationship with the Guptas That investigation relates to the Estina dairy farm near Vrede, in the Free State, a project which was originally meant to help poor black farmers but from which the Gupta family are alleged to have pocketed millions of dollars, allegations they deny. The family's walled Johannesburg compound was subject to an early morning search by elite police A tranche of leaked emails released last year alleged that some of the money ended up paying for the family's lavish wedding at Sun City, South Africa's upmarket holiday resort. In January, the Hawks raided the offices of the Free State Premier, Ace Magashule, looking for documents linked to the project. Mr Magashule was elected secretary-general of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in December. The embattled Gupta family own a range of business interests in South Africa, including computing, mining, air travel, energy, technology and media. The three brothers, Atul, Rajesh and Ajay, moved to the country in 1993 from India, just as white-minority rule was ending. Who are the Guptas? They are known friends of President Zuma - and his son, daughter and one of the president's wives worked for the family's firms. The brothers have been accused of wielding enormous political influence in South Africa, with critics alleging that they have tried to ""capture the state"" to advance their own business interests. Former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas made a public allegation in 2016 that he was offered 600m rand ($50m; Â£36m) by the Gupta family to be the next finance minister - as long as he did their bidding. It was followed by a damning report by a South African government ombudsman that accused the Guptas and President Zuma of colluding to win government contracts. The public backlash worsened in 2017 when more than 100,000 emails were leaked which appeared to show the extent of the family's influence. It suggested a complex web of government contracts, as well as alleged kickbacks and money laundering. It prompted marches and public protests against the family and President Zuma, dubbed the ""Zuptas"". How the Guptas' brand turned toxic Who are the Guptas?

Why do people get 'hangry' like Chloe Kim?,"Chloe Kim has tweeted about ice cream and churros (fried dough) during the Winter Olympics Chloe Kim was 'hangry' before winning a Winter Olympic gold medal. So why does hunger make people angry? On Tuesday morning in South Korea, a 17-year-old American sent a tweet about her breakfast. Within minutes, it had flown round the world. ""Wish I finished my breakfast sandwich but my stubborn self decided not to,"" wrote the teenage snowboarder Chloe Kim. ""And now I'm getting hangry."" Kim's admission of being hangry - hungry and angry - struck a chord. The tweet was liked 88,000 times - and counting. Being hangry, however, didn't do Kim any harm. Her next tweet, sent three hours later, showed her celebrating a gold medal. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here's Dr Michael Knight, assistant professor of medicine atGeorge Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences,external. ""When we eat a meal, our body breaks down the food into nutrients such as glucose - a simple sugar that our body uses for energy,"" he says. ""Our brain is one of the largest consumers of that energy. About 20-25% of our total energy is consumed by our brain - which is only about 2% of our body weight. ""Hunger is a signal that the brain needs more fuel. It's triggered when the level of nutrients in our bloodstream begins to drop. ""When the brain runs dry of fuel, it stimulates a stress response. It's really a survival mechanism. ""Our inhibition to different emotions is lowered. And - because the brain needs fuel to function at its highest capacity - we see things like difficulty concentrating, and difficulty controlling emotions. ""One of the most common emotions is anger - and that's why, many times, when we become hungry, we become irritable."" ""If you have a full meal, with balanced nutrients, that's going to hold you over to the next meal,"" says Dr Knight. ""If you start feeling hanger coming on, something that's a little bit sweeter - something that gets you that glucose - is going to quickly reverse that feeling."" So - as the adverts suggest - a chocolate bar could do the trick? ""There's actually some science behind it,"" he says. ""If you're getting that sugar, it's increasing your glucose level, your brain is feeling the fuel, and it's decreasing that stress response."" ""It's mainly carbohydrate that we're breaking down into glucose,"" says Dr Knight. ""Our body does have a way of breaking down other foods [fats and proteins] and making more glucose - especially in those who are not eating that many carbohydrates. ""But the quickest way to get to glucose is by eating carbohydrate."" So, in short: Kim should have finished her sandwich. Would Chloe Kim have made it as a South Korean? US teenager Kim wins halfpipe gold Hangry and ransomware added to dictionary ""One individual may be able to go quite some time without feeling irritable,"" says Dr Knight. ""While some others, as soon as they stop eating, it seems they're ready to snap."" Dr Knight says ""we don't fully understand the genetics behind"" the process. But some of the important chemicals, such as Neuropeptide Y, are genetically linked to DNA. ""So it just may be that, because of your genetics, and your control of emotions, you may be predisposed to developing hanger."" Michael Knight, MD, assistant professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences ""It's something we're still learning about,"" he says. ""But there's nothing that says women are this percentage, or that percentage, more likely to have it. ""It can really vary from person to person, as hunger does."" ""Definitely,"" says Dr Knight. ""I work in a weight management practice at George Washington University. It's very common for patients to have this feeling, and that leads to them eating a lot more. ""That's something we have to work with them to address."" The word has even been recognised by the Oxford English Dictionary. Last month, it announced that ""hangry"" was a real word,defined as ""bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger"",external. Happily for Chloe Kim, her hanger didn't last long. After winning gold, she was seen tucking into a tub of ice cream. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Crypto-currency craze 'hinders ET search',"If there is intelligent life out there, it might be broadcasting signals across the universe Scientists listening out for broadcasts by extra-terrestrials are struggling to get the computer hardware they need, thanks to the crypto-currency mining craze, a radio-astronomer has said. Seti (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) researchers want to expand operations at two observatories. However, they have found that key computer chips are in short supply. ""We'd like to use the latest GPUs [graphics processing units]... and we can't get 'em,"" said Dan Werthimer. Demand for GPUs has soared recently thanks to crypto-currency mining. ""That's limiting our search for extra-terrestrials, to try to answer the question, 'Are we alone? Is there anybody out there?',"" Dr Werthimer told the BBC. ""This is a new problem, it's only happened on orders we've been trying to make in the last couple of months."" Mining a currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum involves connecting computers to a global network and using them to solve complex mathematical puzzles. This forms part of the process of validating transactions made by people who use the currency. As a reward for this work, the miners receive a small crypto-currency payment, making it potentially profitable. Russian nuclear scientists arrested for 'Bitcoin mining plot' Bitcoin mining gobbles Iceland energy supplies Bitcoin falls below $6,000 GPUs are high-performance chips and aren't just used for powering video games - they may be stacked together by Bitcoin miners, radio-astronomers or others interested in processing large amounts of data for certain applications. ""At Seti we want to look at as many frequency channels as we possibly can because we don't know what frequency ET will be broadcasting on and we want to look for lots of different signal types - is it AM or FM, what communication are they using?"" explained Dr Werthimer, who is chief scientist at the Berkeley Seti Research Center. ""That takes a lot of computing power."" GPUs are an important part of the Hera radio-telescope in South Africa He added that, at some telescopes, Berkeley Seti has around 100 GPUs crunching data from large listening arrays. These arrays can pick up the faintest of radio frequencies that have been flung across our solar system from elsewhere in the universe - often from natural phenomena such as collapsing stars. The Seti scientists are currently trying to improve their capacity for analysing such data at two observatories -Green Bank in West Virginia,externalandParkes in Australia,external. But they have been hit by the GPU shortage. ""We've got the money, we've contacted the vendors, and they say, 'We just don't have them',"" said Dr Werthimer. Earlier this year, there were reports that video gamers had been hit by a sudden rise in the cost of GPUs,thanks in particular to a rise in Ethereum mining,external, which can be done with chips aimed at consumers. At the time, major chip-maker Nvidia said thatretailers should make arrangements,externalto make sure gamers' demands were met. In a conference call last week, Nvidia's chief executive told investors the company was ""working really hard"" to ""catch up with supply"" and get GPUs to the marketplace. This video can not be played WATCH: The BBC's Dave Lee visits the Green Bank Telescope Other radio-astronomers have been affected. A group looking for evidence of the earliest stars in the universe was recently shocked to see that the cost of the GPUs it wanted had doubled. ""We're in the process of expanding our telescope - we got a grant from the National Science Foundation here in the United States to do so,"" saidAaron Parsons,externalat the University of California at Berkeley. Prof Parsons' radio telescope,the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (Hera),external, is an American, British and South African project located in South Africa's western plains. Prof Parsons at the Hera radio telescope array in South Africa It has been designed to listen to low frequency radio waves emitted by the reionising hydrogen gas that permeated the universe before the first stars and galaxies formed. GPUs are needed in order to bring together data from Hera's many small radio telescopes - this synthesises a much larger array, offering an especially wide field of view peering out into the universe. Three months ago, the Hera team had budgeted for a set of GPUs that cost around $500 (Â£360) - the price has since doubled to $1,000. ""We'll be able to weather it but it is coming out of our contingency budget."" added Prof Parsons. ""We're buying a lot of these things, it's going to end up costing about $32,000 extra."" He also said he was concerned that future work could even be stopped in its tracks, should the GPU shortage worsen. Thanks in part to a recent boom in the price of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, mining crypto-currencies has never been more popular. While Bitcoin miners have largely moved on tospecialised ""Asic"" chipsthat have been designed from scratch to support mining, it's still possible to use GPUs on the Ethereum mining network to lucrative ends, according to cyber-security expert Matthew Hickey at Hacker House. GPUs are often connected together to carry out the laborious task of crytpo-currency mining ""[You can] use GPUs effectively to turn a small profit, you're not going to make millions but if you put 12 or 24 GPUs together, you'll make back the cost in six months,"" he told the BBC. GPUs are versatile, he added, pointing out that cyber-security experts sometimes use them for password-cracking experiments, in which computers make many millions of attempts at breaking into a system. But Mr Hickey has also noticed that GPUs are now being sold on sites such as Ebay at inflated prices. ""It's becoming increasingly difficult to find suppliers and cards,"" he said.

"Give tenants a right to pets, says Labour","Labour wants to strengthen the rights of tenants to keep a pet in their properties as part of a package of proposed animal welfare measures. Some rental agreements drawn up by landlords insist on no animals. Tenants can seek permission to keep pets but Labour wants a default right for them to do so unless there is evidence their pet will be a nuisance. Other Labour ideas include a ban on foie gras imports and an end to the export of live animals for slaughter. Shadow Environment Secretary Sue Hayman told the BBC that the party was promising action on issues that were ""close to people's hearts"". She rejected claims that Labour was ""playing catch-up"" with the Conservatives, saying its ""comprehensive, long-term"" plans were in contrast to the government's ""haphazard, piecemeal"" approach. In recent months, Environment Secretary Michael Gove has proposed increasing maximum sentences for serious animal cruelty to five years in jail and said a ban on pet shops and other third parties selling puppies should be explored as part of a crackdown on unscrupulous breeders. He has also published draft legislation which would commit the government to treat animals as ""sentient beings"" when it makes future laws, following a political row over the issue at the end of last year. Reality Check: Brexit and animal welfare Gove: I'll make Brexit work for animals too Ban on live animal exports considered Despite the flurry of activity from the government, Labour is insisting it remains ""the party of animal welfare"", citing its backing for the 2005 hunting ban and past steps to tighten the rules on the transport of live animals. The party is now proposing to go further by prohibiting the live export of animals for slaughter or fattening and requiring all slaughterhouses to have CCTV installed. The 50-point draft policy document - entitled Animal Welfare for the Many not the Few - also proposes: ending the badger cull closing ""loopholes"" which permit illegal fox hunting creating a new zoo inspectorate to draw up revised standards expanding affordable vet care for owners on low incomes reviewing animal testing to focus on minimising suffering and ending avoidable tests obliging motorists to report incidents where animals are injured phasing in a ban on all fur imports banning intensive rearing of game birds for shooting protecting the marine environment around the UK through ""blue belt"" zone Among the most eye-catching proposals is a plan to strengthen the right of tenants to have pets in their homes, which Labour said was a recognition of the growing number of people having to rent well into their 30s. Under the 2015 Consumer Rights Act, a landlord can only refuse permission if it is reasonable to do so, for instance on grounds of the animal's size, the damage it could cause and its impact on future rental prospects. This video can not be played Do you wish your landlord would let you have a pet? Under Labour's plans, which it says it wants to discuss with landlords and tenant bodies, there would need to be evidence that the animal was a nuisance for permission to be refused. The National Landlords Association said its members should have the right to refuse tenants with pets as long as they justified their actions, including in cases where properties were simply not geared up for animals. But the group's chief executive Richard Lambert added that ""tenants who keep pets do tend to stay for longer periods of time, and there are a few simple steps that landlords can take in order to mitigate the perceived increased risks"" - including insisting on larger deposits. Shelter said that while it was often difficult for landlords to enforce conditions relating to pets, tenants were at greater risk of eviction if they were in breach of tenancy agreements. May drops plans for fox-hunting vote UK protected coastal belt expanded Gove sets out post-Brexit farm funding Labour also envisages creating a new post of animal welfare commissioner, to ensure government policy is continually abreast of the latest scientific evidence. This would also mean animal welfare is taken into consideration in trade deals after Brexit, and in the UK's dealings with international bodies. After the UK leaves the EU, Labour says future farming subsidies must reflect the need to outlaw bad environmental practice and move away from intensive rearing techniques. Responding for the Conservatives, MP Steve Double said ""from introducing mandatory CCTV into slaughter houses to increasing the maximum sentence for animal cruelty ten-fold, the Conservatives will continue taking the action needed to ensure animals receive the proper protection they deserve."" It emerged earlier this month that the government is considering its own ban on the export of live animals for slaughter, and will launch a consultation in the spring. Theresa May, meanwhile, has ruled out a Commons vote on repealing the ban on hunting with dogs during the current Parliament, reversing a manifesto commitment for a free vote. Analysis by Reality Check Currently, motorists only have to report an accident involving an animal if they hit certain animals. The Road Traffic Act 1988 requires drivers to inform the police if ""damage is caused"" to horses, cattle, asses, mules, sheep, pigs, goats or dogs. This list excludes cats and poultry, but also wildlife such as badgers and deer. Last year,a petition was launchedto seek parity between cats and dogs in the reporting of roadside accidents, reaching 237,500 signatures. Complete statistics are not produced on the amount of animals killed by vehicles each year, butinformation released by Highways England,externalgives some indication of the animals most likely to be hit. Between January 2016 and April 2017, 611 deer, 534 badgers and 471 foxes were found dead on A-roads and motorways in England. Around 170 cats and dogs were found too; as well as one wallaby on the M1.

Key figures set out 'road to Brexit',"The PM has been under pressure from Brussels and her party to set out her vision for Britain after Brexit Theresa May will deliver a major speech within the next three weeks outlining the future relationship Britain wants to have with the EU. Before that, senior ministers are also due to give speeches in a campaign dubbed ""the road to Brexit"" by No 10. Security, the devolution of powers, workers' rights and trade are to be covered. The PM has been under pressure from Brussels and her party to set out her vision for Britain after Brexit. MPs could block May's Brexit - Soubry What is the Brexit transition phase? Brexit: All you need to know International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who was a leading Leave supporter, said: ""What the public want is, they want the vision and they want some meat on the bones."" Her comments came as Tory rebel Anna Soubry warned Mrs May pro-European Conservatives could join forces with Labour to prevent the UK from leaving the single market and customs union. Asked if there was a Commons majority to defeat ""the kind of Brexit the prime minister wants"", Ms Soubry told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""If she's not careful, yes."" David Davis and Boris Johnson will be heard from, but Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd will not Asked if she thought Brexit will definitely happen, Ms Soubry, who was appearing alongside pro-Europe Labour MP Chuka Umunna, said: ""I genuinely don't know what is going to happen."" Theresa May is set to make two key note addresses in the coming weeks, and arch Brexiteers Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox will also set out their agendas. Senior ministers are due to hold talks at the prime minister's country residence Chequers, and soon after that Mrs May is expected to set out her vision. The foreign secretary will begin the series of speeches on Wednesday and insiders say Boris Johnson will be seeking to unite Remainers and Leavers, the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said. Brexit Secretary David Davis and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will also be heard from, along with Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, who backed Remain in the referendum. But two prominent ministers who voted to remain - the chancellor and the home secretary - are not delivering speeches. No 10 said Philip Hammond spoke recently in Davos, while the prime minister herself will in effect cover Amber Rudd's brief when she gives a speech on security on Saturday. Mrs May will detail the ""security partnership"" the UK wants to maintain with the EU. Justice Secretary David Gauke rejected suggestions ministers who favoured a softer Brexit were being silenced.

"Times table check trialled ahead of rollout12 times 11 equals what? Up to 7,250 pupils in England will try out tests on how well they can multiply.1ma minute agoFamily & EducationComments","Thousands of eight and nine-year-olds in England's primary schools will take a new times tables check this spring. Some 7,250 pupils in 290 primaries, are expected to take part in the trials of the new multiplication check. The five-minute test, taken by children in Year 4, will then be fully rolled out over the next two years. Ministers say the test will identify those struggling, but teaching unions have raised concerns about its benefits. Supporters have argued that it will help to ensure all children know their tables up to 12 off by heart, but opponents say primary school children are already heavily tested. Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said it was ""hugely disappointing"" that the Department for Education was still determined to bring in a multiplication tables test. ""This test won't tell teachers and parents anything they don't already know about their children. Although school results won't be published, this government test will be scrutinised by Ofsted when they visit and will therefore become even more significant. ""A pupil's primary school years are already cluttered with tests and checks.  We want all children to succeed at school, but the answer isn't to test them more."" Mike Ellicock, chief executive of National Numeracy, said: ""While the introduction of this test is underpinned by good intentions, we need to be careful not to knock the joy out of children's early mathematical experiences or distract schools from building children's real understanding of numbers. ""Knowing your tables is valuable - we all use them in everyday life - but what is more important is having a real feel for numbers and understanding the patterns behind times tables so children can use the knowledge flexibly in the real world. ""The danger in putting so much emphasis on tables testing - effectively on rote learning - is that it becomes a box-ticking exercise, and hinders the development of practical number sense."" The former Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw, has welcomed the times table trial, saying he is sure it will ""make a difference"". ""Good head teachers and good teachers never mind youngsters being tested. Nothing is taught unless it's learnt,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I think there's a place for rote learning, but any good teacher will say that's not the beginning and end of it.  There has to be a deeper conceptual understanding."" But the Department for Education said the test would last a maximum of five minutes and would allow teachers to monitor a child's progress. Schools can take part in the multiplication check voluntarily in June 2019 and it will be compulsory from 2020. School standards minister Nick Gibb said: ""Just as the phonics screening check helps children who are learning to read, the multiplication tables check will help teachers identify those pupils who require extra support. ""This will ensure that all pupils leave primary school knowing their times tables off by heart and able to start secondary school with a secure grasp of the fundamental mathematics they need to fulfil their potential.""

South Africa police raid Zuma allies' homeOne of the three Gupta brothers linked to embattled President Zuma is reportedly arrested.4m5 minutes agoAfrica,"Atul Gupta (centre) shakes hands with President Jacob Zuma (right) in 2012. Their relationship has come under scrutiny in recent years South Africa's elite police unit has raided the home of a controversial business family linked to President Jacob Zuma, as pressure increases on him to stand down. Officials say three people were arrested as part of an investigation into the wealthy, Indian-born Guptas. They have been accused of using their close friendship with Mr Zuma to wield enormous political influence. Meanwhile, Mr Zuma's party has given him until the end of the day to resign. His links to the Guptas are one of the reasons he is being forced to resign before the 2019 general election. The Guptas and Mr Zuma deny all allegations of wrongdoing. Africa Live: Finance minister warns Zuma he could be voted out How the Guptas' brand turned toxic in South Africa Long read: The many trials of Jacob Zuma Pressure has been slowly increasing on Mr Zuma to stand down in recent weeks.He was expected to respond to a formal request from the African National Congress (ANC) to step downat some point on Wednesday. However, shortly after ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu announced that a motion of no-confidence in the president would be heard on Thursday, Mr Zuma appeared on television to say he was not prepared to stand down immediately ashe had not be given good reasons as to why he should resign. By Andrew Harding, BBC News, Johannesburg The timing is remarkableâ¦ So why did South Africa's elite Hawks choose to move against the Guptas now? There are four possibilities: 1: This was a genuine coincidence. The Hawks have, in recent weeks, begun to accelerate their investigation into alleged corruption at the Estina Dairy in Vrede[scroll down to read more on the allegations], with assets already seized, and prosecutions prepared, so perhaps, given the unpredictable way the political drama surrounding President Zuma is unfolding, this is just one of those serendipitous things. 2: The Hawks, with an eye on the news and the clear sense that President Zuma is losing power - and therefore any protection that the Guptas enjoyed as his friends is waning too - decided there was a risk members of the Indian-born family might flee the country. 3: The man who presumably authorised the move against the Guptas, the National Prosecuting Chief Sean Abrahams, saw the way the tide was turning against Mr Zuma (who appointed him). Mr Abrahams has been branded ""Sean The Sheep"" by South African media, following widespread claims that he has helped to protect Mr Zuma, the Guptas and others from corruption investigations. Mr Abrahams, who denies the allegations, might be looking to curry favour with any new ANC-led administration. 4: Cyril Ramaphosa, or those close to him, somehow influenced the police into launching the move in a deliberate attempt to put added pressure on President Zuma. His son, Duduzane, works for the Guptas and is being talked of as a possible target of the NPA's investigations. This would be an illegal move, but one that many South Africans now see as entirely possible, given the apparent politicisation of the justice system and the erosion of key institutions during the Zuma era. According to a statement released by the Hawks - the police's elite high-priority crimes unit - the raids were carried out in connection with the Vrede farm investigation. Three people were arrested during the raid, with two more expected to hand themselves in. According to local media, one of those arrested was a Gupta family member. Watch: President Zuma's son on his relationship with the Guptas That investigation relates to the Estina dairy farm near Vrede, in the Free State, a project which was originally meant to help poor black farmers but from which the Gupta family are alleged to have pocketed millions of dollars, allegations they deny. The family's walled Johannesburg compound was subject to an early morning search by elite police A tranche of leaked emails released last year alleged that some of the money ended up paying for the family's lavish wedding at Sun City, South Africa's upmarket holiday resort. In January, the Hawks raided the offices of the Free State Premier, Ace Magashule, looking for documents linked to the project. Mr Magashule was elected secretary-general of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in December. The embattled Gupta family own a range of business interests in South Africa, including computing, mining, air travel, energy, technology and media. The three brothers, Atul, Rajesh and Ajay, moved to the country in 1993 from India, just as white-minority rule was ending. Who are the Guptas? They are known friends of President Zuma - and his son, daughter and one of the president's wives worked for the family's firms. The brothers have been accused of wielding enormous political influence in South Africa, with critics alleging that they have tried to ""capture the state"" to advance their own business interests. Former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas made a public allegation in 2016 that he was offered 600m rand ($50m; Â£36m) by the Gupta family to be the next finance minister - as long as he did their bidding. It was followed by a damning report by a South African government ombudsman that accused the Guptas and President Zuma of colluding to win government contracts. The public backlash worsened in 2017 when more than 100,000 emails were leaked which appeared to show the extent of the family's influence. It suggested a complex web of government contracts, as well as alleged kickbacks and money laundering. It prompted marches and public protests against the family and President Zuma, dubbed the ""Zuptas"". How the Guptas' brand turned toxic Who are the Guptas?

The scandal of the Lynette White murder case," The darkened entrance to 7 James Street was about to give up a gruesome secret. The police sergeant picked his way up the narrow, carpeted stairs to the first floor landing, outside the front door of flat one. The door was locked. He shook the handle and it rattled where the lock had worked loose. Standing back he aimed a forceful kick. The lights inside were not working; the pre-payment meter card had run out ages ago. The pitch-black hallway was strewn with litter. All three doors leading off it were shut. Opening one, the officer walked into the kitchen and through to the bathroom; the light of his torch traced a number of spent matches and cigarette butts, stood up on their ends, strangely arranged in a line around the rim of the bath. Another door led to a room empty save for two mattresses propped against the wall. He flicked his torch towards the third door. There was blood on it. Inside, a bare divan was illuminated by the orange glow of a street light. On top of it an opened but unused condom. At the bottom of it, the body of a woman. Lying on her back, she was fully clothed, her t-shirt and stone-washed jeans partially covered by a black leather coat. Even in murky light it was clear; she was dead. As the officer radioed for back-up, a woman waiting on the landing outside the entrance to the flat started to cry. Minutes before she had gone to the police station; she had lent the flat keys to a friend, she explained, but the friend had not been seen for days; she was worried. Her friend, the young woman found dead above a betting shop in Flat one, 7 James Street, Cardiff, had been murdered. Her throat slit so deeply, she was virtually decapitated. Her hands, a last frantic defence, slashed; her chest mutilated, her wrists cut. Many of the 50-plus stab and slash wounds were inflicted after she had died. Her name was Lynette White, a 5ft 4ins tall 20-year-old with blonde hair and bright blue eyes. Those who knew her said she was popular, quiet, kind, friendly and unfailingly polite. To those who loved her, she was much, much more than that. ""I remember we used to fight over who would do her ringlets,"" recalls her Auntie Lyn, after whom Lynette was named. ""Lynette had fantastic skin and a fantastic personality. I used to call her my protégée. We used to say she could be a model and look after me in my old age."" In the cold, dank flat was the body of a woman whose childhood visit to Father Christmas had been lovingly cherished in a photo frame; a girl who spent time out of school looking after horses at the city farm; a daughter, grandchild, niece, sister, girlfriend. She liked music, Whitney Houston's I Wanna Dance With Somebodyand Freddie McGregor's Just Don't Want To Be Lonely and loved romantic films. Her dream was to fall in love and have a home filled with children. It was the idealised kind of family life she had never known. Her parents had split up when she was 18 months old. Her father insisted Lynette stay with him in Cardiff, while her mother moved back to Essex with Lynette's half-sister. But what she lacked in a mother, her paternal grandmother, her Nanna, with whom she lived in her early years along with her aunties, strove to make up for, lavishing their ""little gem"" with love. Lynette grew particularly close to her Auntie Lyn who she called her ""little mum"". Lynette moved a few miles away from them when her father Terry re-married. Her step-mother Carol had two other children, a girl and a boy. Then aged 12 her fragile emotional world imploded. Her beloved Nanna, her touchstone, the matriarch who had been the constant in her life from a baby, died tragically. She was only 56. The emotional agony may have rendered Lynette especially vulnerable to the heady onslaught of adolescence. She was to pay a savage price for that vulnerability all too soon. Not long before she was murdered, she spoke to a BBC reporter investigating child prostitution in the Welsh capital. She told him that aged 14 she was abducted by a gang and taken to Bristol where she was drugged and forced into sex work. She escaped and returned home but a few years later began ""working the beat"" in Cardiff's docklands. Her Auntie Lyn was horrified when she eventually found out. ""I've no idea at what point she went down that path,"" she says. ""I lie awake at night thinking 'could I have stopped her? If I'd known could I have done something?' ""But I really don't think I could have done anything to help. She was so in love with that guy. She just wanted to be loved."" Lyn had cooked Lynette Sunday roasts and helped arrange surprise birthday parties, hoping desperately to boost her ailing self-worth and keep her life on track. ""We were having a laugh in my kitchen, it was around New Year,"" her auntie says. ""I was doing her hair and we were talking about a boyfriend she'd fallen out with. I told her that one day you will see the right man, you will look in his eyes and you will know that he really loves you'. ""And she turned around and looked at me and said 'oh no, no, Auntie Lyn. No-one, no man will ever love me'."" Slowly, Lynette drifted out of reach of her Auntie Lyn. The torturous thought of her alone that night with just a candle for light, has cost her too many sleepless nights. But out of respect for the privacy of the very few remaining members of Lynette's immediate family she will not say any more. The Whites were virtually destroyed not only by what happened at 7 James Street but by what followed. Lynette's father Terry and family at her funeral They were not alone. The unrelenting aftershocks of Lynette's death were widely felt and unnecessarily ruined the lives of many others. This was only the start. The subsequent scandal surrounding the police investigation led to stigmatising innocent men in one of the most notorious travesties in British legal history and its largest police corruption trial, the final chapter of which has only just closed 30 years later. ""Stephen King couldn't write a better horror story than this,"" says 60-year-old Tony Paris whose life changed irrevocably the moment he was cast as one of its leading characters. Within weeks of the murder the BBC's newly-launched Crimewatch programme revealed a compelling early lead in the murder hunt. A photo-fit was shown of a man who had been seen by a member of the public crouched in the doorway of 7 James Street. His hand was bleeding heavily; he was crying and mumbling incoherently. ""He is very distinctive,"" said the then head of South Wales Police CID, Detective Chief Superintendent John Williams, who described the murder as ""a vicious, frenzied, sadistic attack"". ""He has got dark brown, greasy hair with lightening towards the front of it. He's about 35 to 40 years of age and between 5ft 8 and 6ft tall."" So the man police were hunting was distinctive. He was also white. Breaking news 10 months later; five men had been charged with the murder of Lynette White. They were all black. The first John Actie knew of the murder was the Monday morning of 15 February 1988. “I was coming out of the house and a guy I knew was walking up the road,” he told BBC Wales Investigates. “He said to me ‘did you hear about the murder?’ I told him no, what murder? He said it was Lynette White and I said ‘who’s Lynette White?’. “It was in the (South Wales) Echo and there was a picture of her and that’s when I realised it was Miller’s girlfriend.” Stephen Miller – known locally as Pineapple on account of his dreadlocks tied up on top of his head and a penchant for pineapple juice - had been going out with Lynette for a couple of years. He had moved down from Brixton after they met through his brother who was living in Cardiff. He had broken down at the “hammer blow” news of her death and was willing to do anything to help. Naturally he was a possible suspect but nothing suggested to police he was the killer. The 22-year-old told how he had been frantically looking for Lynette. He was worried about her but it is likely he also wanted her earnings to pay for his cocaine habit. They had argued five days before, he explained, and she had not come home to the flat they shared in the nearby Grangetown area of the city. Stephen Miller, Lynette White's boyfriend of two years He had no knowledge of the flat at 7 James Street, rented for business by Lynette’s friend and fellow sex worker Leanne Vilday. It is still not clear where Lynette was in her final days. The police had also been looking for her. She was due to be a witness at an attempted murder trial and an arrest warrant had been issued for her. That trial was halted and following forensic tests any suspicion that she had been silenced by anyone involved was discounted. There was no link between that case and Lynette White’s murder. Police investigating were unsurprisingly working on the theory that she had been murdered by a client. The inquiry had a prime suspect, a man known to the police, dubbed Mr X. But that investigation ended abruptly in September when blood tests ruled him out too. The detectives were back to square one. By then two of the force’s officers with reputations for getting results - Detective Inspector Graham Mouncher, who took over as lead officer, and Inspector Tommy Page – had been pulled in to rescue the floundering investigation. Meanwhile, uniformed officers had conducted 6,000 house-to-house inquiries asking everyone in the area, including John Actie, to fill in a questionnaire. There was no love lost between him and the police. An incident when he was 19 remains vivid in his mind. Arrested for criminal damage at a nightclub he says he had never been to, he recalls being taken to Cardiff's central police station and ""badly beaten"" by a group of 11 police officers. He was subsequently charged with assaulting them. After giving his side of the story, all charges against him were dismissed by a magistrate. But time would prove it to be a Pyrrhic victory. John Actie was a name widely known in Cardiff. He had a reputation as a ""hard man"", someone you did not want to cross. Once a promising rugby player, he had played well above his age group as a flanker or Number 8 for Cardiff Youth. His dad, Charlie Actie, a seaman and steel erector, part of a big, long-established docks family, was always there to urge him on. Schoolboys Cup victory at Cardiff Arms Park: Winning try scorer John Actie holds the captain aloft, with David Bishop crouching down (bottom left) His son easily matched the skill of his team-mates, David Bishop and Mark Ring, both of whom went onto play for Wales. But John Actie was not destined to wear the ""red jersey"". ""John was a brilliant player,"" says David Bishop, who describes him as his ""best friend, like family"". ""Let me tell you, he was certainly capable of playing rugby at the top level."" Aged 12 John was round at David's house when there was a phone call to say he had to come home right away. “My dad had died,"" says John, 56. ""He was just 42 and had lung cancer. I was devastated. We were very close and he’d always been there to keep me in line. I went completely off the rails. “I started drifting in and out of borstal, approved schools, running away, mixing with different people, doing stupid things. Then I got sent to a detention centre… you just progress. ""My mum was always there for me but she couldn’t control me like my father. She had seven kids and worked hard to provide for us.” By the age of 22 John had served a three-year term for robbery and a 12-month jail sentence for possession of cannabis. Doing security work, debt collecting and working on the door at nightclubs like the Casablanca, a well-known music venue in the docks, he aggravated the police by ""refusing to bow down to them"" and by organising illegal all-night Blues house parties held at various locations selling drink and playing reggae and soul music. John was working the door at the Casablanca nightclub on the night in question. The club was razed in the 1980s to make way for a car park In his book entitled Bloody Valentine published in the early 1990s, Cardiff-born author John Williams described John as a “bullet-headed 6ft-something guy built like the proverbial brick shit house”. “Around 1988 the Docks police figures John Actie for Butetown’s heaviest cocaine dealer, a Yardie-connected drug baron,” Williams wrote. “Talking to people more or less in the know, John Actie was not the Mr Big that the police made him out to be. Yes, he was [at one time] a drug dealer but not on a grand scale. But he did have a reputation, an image… Basically John Actie was the baddest m-f in the neighbourhood.” Violence, or the threat of it, may well at one time have been John’s stock in trade. But Lynette White? The murder horrified him. A woman stabbed over 50 times was, he says, the work of a “lunatic” and his priority was the welfare of his wife, and two daughters, a four-year-old and a new-born. “If I’d known anything, I’d have reported it the next day,” he adds. Meanwhile detectives were getting nowhere fast and the pressure on them intensified. “It was all to do with the new barrage, the regeneration,” John says. “They wanted to clean this area up and make it good for the yuppies. No one wants to live here when there’s skulduggery like that in the area.” Ten months earlier the multi-million pound Cardiff Bay Development Corporation had got under way. Its quest was to transform the city’s one time world-famous but now desolate docklands, and boost Cardiff’s economy as a world-class maritime city. Something like £2 billion was being sought from investors and Lynette White’s unsolved murder was hardly seductive. Cardiff then was virtually unrecognisable from the city it is today – one of the fastest growing in Europe. 1980s Cardiff had a smaller feeling to it. For decades it had an uneasy relationship with its dockland and its residential area known as Butetown, named after the 2nd Marquis of Bute whose family established a dock when Cardiff was an insignificant village. The industrial revolution and coal from the south Wales valleys had seen Cardiff morph into one of the busiest docklands in the world exporting 12.6 million tonnes a year at its zenith. Its Coal Exchange witnessed the signing of the first million pound cheque in 1904. “James Street, the one-time hub of dock life, pulsed with vitality,” wrote Tiger Bay poet Harry ‘Shipmate’ Cooke. “Tall buildings full of clacking typewriters, clerks, ship brokers, agents and things maritime. At street level, shops of every degree, elbowing each other for attention.” James Street, the beating heart of Cardiff docks, in the early 1900s Back then Butetown was known the world over as the legendary Tiger Bay. It had a reputation as a hotbed of raucousness, brawling sailors, prostitution and illegal gambling – it was a port after all – but there was something more distinctive about Tiger Bay. Over the years many visiting seamen settled there forging a community unparalleled in diversity and tolerance. It is said that at one time 57 different nationalities lived there. Welsh girls commonly demonised by society and ostracised by their families for falling in love with men of colour joined the coalescence. It was them against the world. Arthur Actie, John’s grandfather, a seaman from St Lucia, docked in Cardiff around the time of Britain’s first race riots in 1919. Demobbed servicemen vented their anger over unemployment at the men of Tiger Bay, many of whom had tried to join up but were rejected and as a result had jobs. John's parents Charlie and Maria Actie John’s grandmother was half-Welsh, half-Barbadian, his late mother, Maria, from Cardiff, descended from the influx of Irish workers into the city. John’s family embodied the history of the city. And in 1988, he, the latest generation, would be indelibly written into its next, more shameful chapter. For nine months police had been looking for a single white man. Suddenly an entirely different set of suspects were taken in for questioning. At 07:30 on 9 December four police officers were outside John’s front door. “I said ‘what do you want?’” he recalls. “They said the superintendent wanted me brought in, something to do with the Lynette White inquiry. I said ‘are you mad? you’re having a laugh aren’t you? I’m not going anywhere, now get away from my door’. “He said if I didn’t go he’d call back up and they didn’t want to do that with my wife and kids in the house. I told them to get back in the car and I’d get dressed. “As soon as we started the first interview and they said I was in the James Street flat I turned to my solicitor and said ‘Stuart, they’re fitting me up’. It was terrifying. “They were putting me with a group of other guys who I knew from the area but didn’t go around with. It didn’t make any sense. We didn’t bother with each other. One of them was my cousin, but even we weren’t close. “What they were coming out with was so crazy, at one stage I said ‘I’ve had enough of this I’m going back to my cell’. “They said they had statements from people who were in the flat. I’d never even heard of these people, didn’t have a clue who they were. “Two days later we were led handcuffed from our cells and lined up. There must have been about 30 or 40 of them, CID, in there all smiling and laughing. ‘John Arthur Actie, you are charged that on the 14th of February….’ I had a mint in my mouth and I nearly choked on it. It felt like the end of the world. “It was boiling hot in my cell and I remember I was pacing up and down saying ‘Me? A murderer? Me? No, no, no… I can’t believe this’. ""There were tears in my eyes. It was like my dad had died all over again. I asked if I could make a phone call and one of them said ‘in 25 years John’.” The four other men charged  alongside John on 11 December 1988 were Tony Paris, 30, Stephen Miller, 22, Ronnie Actie, 30, and Yusef Abdullahi, 26, all of whom lived in Butetown. They were later to become known as The Cardiff Five. ""I stood in the dock and the foreman was asked if they'd reached a verdict,"" Tony Paris recalls. ""He said 'guilty'. I was thinking 'what?'. My brother collapsed in shock, he went down, bang, it was terrible. I turned round and said to my sister 'Rosie, I haven't done anything'. ""I looked at the jury and some of them were crying. My hands were locked onto the wooden bar of the dock. When they tried to lead me away, my hands wouldn't come away, I couldn't move."" Tony Paris stood apart from his co-defendants. He had no history of violence; he had never been to prison. He had three previous convictions, two fines for shoplifting and one for driving without insurance. In fact, he was widely known for avoiding confrontation at all costs and for fainting at the sight of his own blood. Everyone in Butetown knew Tony Paris. He offered what could euphemistically be called a ""collect and delivery service"". Tony Paris had been collecting glasses in the Casablanca nightclub at the time of the murder ""Shoplifting in them days was easier, less security,"" he says. ""Someone would say 'ah, there's this beautiful dress Tone' and I'd say 'give me the details'. 'You know my size don't you Tone?' 'of course I do, I know everyone's size'. ""They used to call me Pockets. I'm round everybody's house in the docks. I know everyone and everyone knows me. I'm trusted."" By the 1980s, Butetown, the home of Cardiff's red-light district was a virtual 6,000-strong ghetto, just south of the city centre. Many in the rest of the city felt nervous about venturing ""under the bridge"", a railway bridge near Cardiff Central train station, its unofficial gateway. Butetown was quite literally the wrong side of the tracks. Butetown just beyond Cardiff Central rail track Loudon Square: Concrete tower blocks replaced a square of elegant houses, at one time the city's  most affluent area The name Tiger Bay had been consigned to history after a 1960s slum clearance; its historic yet dilapidated architecture replaced with a concrete council estate of maisonettes and high-rise tower blocks. Unemployment was high especially among the young who said they were discriminated against on account of their postcode. ""It might have been different outside of the docks but growing up there I didn't see racism,"" Tony says, ""because I was brought up in a community with blacks, whites, Indian, Chinese. ""Doesn't matter about your religion, your colour, we're docks boys, we stick together. We were different to other communities; it was 'all for one'. Tony, a football-mad child with his Uncle Charlie. His parents had come to Cardiff from the Caribbean island of Nevis ""I'm no trouble. I don't go to jail; I'm not a jail person. When I got caught shoplifting I held my hands up. I went to court and pleaded guilty, got fined and went home. What am I going to argue with police for? It's stupid. ""I was this little 5ft 2 black guy. I used to wear two-toned suits, with a hat, Crombie and carry a cane. I'm loving life, bubbling, buzzing, in my own little world. They took him out of that little nothing world and put him over there and totally changed his life."" The first trial of the Cardiff Five began on 17 October 1989 in Swansea's crown court, a city not known for its diversity back then. It seemed to be doomed from the start. Five months later in its final few days, the trial was abandoned. The judge had died of a heart attack. Three months later in May 1990, the second trial got under way. David Elfer QC opened for the prosecution. ""Butetown,"" he said, ""is a nocturnal, upside down, topsy-turvy world where people carry knives as part of their clothing."" It was an excoriation of the entire community. Seasoned court reporters recall a ""toxic"", febrile atmosphere of fraught security, legal aggression, public gallery outbursts and outcries from the dock. Police were on the court roof top photographing everyone who attended. The jury heard that the five accused men had killed Lynette to make an example of her over a drug debt. The police presented a scenario in which all five men had somehow come together and made their way to the flat where they took it in turns to stab her to death. Lynette's friend Leanne Vilday, one of four so-called witnesses to her murder There were four key witnesses. Two of them were sex workers, Leanne Vilday, Lynette's friend, and Angela Psaila. Both women, interviewed several times by police, said they knew nothing about the murder. Then after nine months their stories changed dramatically. Now suddenly their police statements said they had been in Psaila's flat across the road. They heard screams from 7 James Street and had run over to find out what was going on. They alleged they had run up the stairs, pushed past ""hard as nails"" doorman John Actie, not known for being easy to push past, and saw Lynette being attacked in the flat. ""She stood no chance against them,"" Psaila told the jury. ""They were standing around smirking. ""They were taking it in turns to stab her. She managed to lift herself up to the window sill. She was pawing at the window trying to attract somebody's attention."" The women said they too were forced to cut Lynette's throat and wrists, their involvement ensuring they keep quiet about what had happened. The two other witnesses were two gay men - Mark Grommek who lived in the second floor flat of 7 James Street and Paul Atkins who was with him that night. They too had changed their story to one implicating all five men. Their statements were shown to Stephen Miller when he was arrested. He insisted he knew nothing before finally cracking during five days of interrogation. By the end he agreed with the police that he was in the flat with the other men. The court heard that he had immediately withdrawn his 'confession'. This may have been given little credence at the time but before long, it would come back to haunt the detectives who had extracted it from him. The eyewitness evidence was as flimsy as it was fantastical. Their testimony was riddled with contradictions, lies and discrepancies. Their accounts were so chaotic it was not even clear who was actually at the murder scene. The judge, who at one stage was rushed to hospital with an angina attack, told the jury they were unsatisfactory witnesses whose police statements were also ""admittedly studded with lies"". All the accused men said they had alibis for that night and there was not a shred of forensic evidence linking them to the flat. In November 1990 Stephen Miller was convicted. Stephen Miller driven away from court Tony Paris is given life with a 17-year tariff Tony Paris was also found guilty - his cellmate, convicted armed robber and supergrass Ian Massey, claimed he had confessed to him. Ronnie Actie was unanimously found not guilty. ""The persons or person who killed Lynette White are out on the streets, they're walking the streets,"" he shouted. ""They are innocent men in there."" The following day Yusef Abdullahi was also convicted despite 13 people confirming he had been working 10 miles away on a boat in Barry docks that night, an alibi the prosecution sought to undermine. Yusef Abdullahi was working on board MV Coral Sea the night of the murder ""I wasn't even in Cardiff,"" he shouted, panic-stricken. ""You took my life away from me… I am innocent."" John Actie, so traumatised he was unable to walk unaided into the dock, was the last up. Unanimously not guilty. Jumping down from the public gallery, his family dragged him out of the dock and carried him outside where breaking down he pleaded: ""They're innocent! They're innocent!"" When asked how he felt, he cried: ""I am bitter and I am broke."" The other three men were sentenced to life. An exhausting and traumatic trial - at the time the longest in British history - was over. After all the sentences had been passed the jury foreman simply sat and wept. The real murderer must have thought he had got away with it. Under the bridge - a protest march leaves Butetown on the short walk to Cardiff prison where some of the Cardiff Three were being held, before walking through the city centre to Cardiff City Hall The Reverend Al Sharpton leading a protest through Cardiff, linking arms with Yusef Abdullahi's late mother Pauline The last time Stephen Miller had seen Lynette they had rowed. He says it was about her work and how it was impacting on their relationship. Vehemently denying he was the pimp police had made him out to be, he has insisted that on many occasions he tried to persuade her to stop but it was the only work she knew and the couple fell into a pattern. Yes, he admitted Lynette would give him money but he says he also had his dole money and cash from selling weed and doing odd jobs. Stephen, who says he was never violent after serving a four-month term for GBH as a teenager, recalled breaking down on being told a body had been found which officers suspected was Lynette. When asked if he would be willing to provide DNA samples, clothing, he had said: ""Anything you want you can take, anything you want."" For the next few months, Stephen said he was in a ""nightmarish daze"", constantly going back and forth to the police station seeking updates on the murder inquiry and actively responded to requests by detectives to find out if any one in the area knew anything about Lynette's death. Seven months after her murder, he returned to London to stay with his mother until he was arrested in December 1988 and succumbed to the ""terror"" of police questioning. Four years later on 7 December 1992, Stephen Miller, Tony Paris and Yusef Abdullahi – by now known as The Cardiff Three after a campaign was launched to spread the word about their wrongful conviction - had made it to the Court of Appeal. The tapes of Miller’s confession to the police – which had effectively convicted all three men – showed officers “bullying” and “beating him over the head verbally”. Streetwise he might have been, but Miller had the IQ of an 11 year old. He had been put through 19 interviews over five days of “psychological torture” the court heard. He had insisted 300 times that he knew nothing. Not once did his appointed solicitor interject on his behalf. He finally cracked under an incessant charade of good cop-bad cop and acquiesced to whatever they said. The interview tapes were played in court – they had not been heard at the original trial – to demonstrate the level of intimidation and bullying which belied the printed transcripts. In his judgement freeing the men, Lord Chief Justice Lord Taylor said he was “horrified” by the tapes which showed the “worst example of police excesses”. Yusef Abdullahi with brother Malik “The interviewing officers could not have acted in a more hostile and intimidating manner… they had made it clear to Miller that they would continue to question him until they 'got it right',” he said. The work of the Free the Cardiff Three campaign – run by brothers of two of the defendants Lloyd Paris and Malik Abdullahi – was at an end. They had travelled the country in a bid to win support, highlighting gaping holes in the police case. In the run up to the appeal, black newspaper The Voice took up the cause then broadsheet newspapers began to take notice followed by TV programmes - Channel Four’s Black Bag, BBC Wales’ Week In Week Out, and the BBC’s Panorama. Tony's brother Lloyd Paris with Yusef Abdullahi's brother Malik centre, left Also in the months leading up to the men’s release, the American civil rights activist and Baptist minister Reverend Al Sharpton arrived in Butetown to lead a protest march past Cardiff prison, through the city centre to city hall. Addressing a rally of supporters through a loud-speaker, he said: ""I'm happy to be here today to join people of all races and colour to talk about the injustice that has happened to these three brothers. ""It is clear that it is only because of their social, economic and racial status that they are in jail."" Gerry Conlon, one of the Guildford Four, had also visited the area to highlight the “ludicrous and disturbing” case. Gerry Conlon, who spent 15 years in prison after he was wrongly convicted of the IRA Guildford pub bombing, arrives in Butetown First night of freedom for four years and one day: Yusef Abdullahi and Tony Paris at a welcome home party It had all paid off. Tony Paris was now a free man but it was bitter sweet. Just weeks before, he had been handcuffed and escorted by guards from Wormwood Scrubs, to say goodbye to his dying father, Arthur. He died before seeing his son vindicated. On his conviction he insisted his wife, the mother of his young son, divorce him. The world he was returning to was a very different one. South Wales Police announced they would not re-open the investigation and no disciplinary action would be taken against any officer involved. By so doing, rumour and speculation about the men’s guilt was rife. In September 1996 Lynette’s father knocked on John Actie’s front door armed with a sawn-off shotgun. Armed police sealed off the area. “If I hadn’t looked out of the kitchen window and seen him,” John says, “I would have opened the door and I'd have been blown away.” Given a suspended jail sentence, Mr White told the court: “I’ve been abused and laughed at for the last seven years after these men were freed for my daughter’s murder which in my mind they undoubtedly committed. I had had enough and just exploded.” Mr White died in January 2001, aged 55, after falling down stairs at his home. Nine months later his son, Terence, Lynette’s brother, was found dead. He was 28. His family said his life was blighted by his sister’s murder. Neither lived to see the justice they had been denied for so long. In September 2000 police re-opened the Lynette White murder case following a cold case review. Detectives worked with a forensic science team led by world-renowned Angela Gallop. A tiny piece of bloody cellophane had been found near the body. They had the beginnings of a DNA profile. The hunt was on for Cellophane Man. But they needed more. And 7 James Street was about to give up its final secret. A skirting board was removed and under six layers of new paint, there was a spot of blood. It was Cellophane Man's. Blood on the front door was also his. The final proof was his blood on Lynette's clothing. Lynette had been dragged to where the majority of the attack probably took place. The murderer had cut his hand when it slid down the hilt of his knife and onto the blade during the ferocious attack; he then blundered out of the flat in the pitch black, down the stairs and fumbled to find the catch on the front door. But who was Cellophane Man? A mass DNA screening and searches of 140 police databases around the world yielded nothing. In what has been roundly applauded as ""outstanding"" and painstaking detective work, an officer noticed a pattern in the profiles, a rare DNA marker. He had spent months scrutinising print outs from the national database. A 14-year-old boy, who had been arrested for joyriding in Cardiff, stood out; his DNA was a partial match. They inquired about his older male relatives which included a 38-year-old uncle. He was contacted by the police and put on surveillance pending the results of forensic tests. Officers burst into his house when he had been seen buying quantities of paracetamol. He had taken an overdose of 64 tablets. ""Just for the record I did kill Lynette White,"" he said. ""I've been waiting for this for 15 years. Whatever happens I deserve it. I sincerely hope to die."" He was rushed to hospital. He survived. At the time of the murder Jeffrey Gafoor had been living above a corner shop run by his sister and her husband, in the Cathays area of Cardiff, three miles from the docks. A loner who collected knives and antiques and was prone to binge drinking, he had been working at a warehouse loading lorries. At the time of his arrest, he worked shifts as a security guard at offices in Cardiff. Described as ""intelligent"", he had no friends and had cut ties with his entire family in the years following the murder. Blanking the murder from his memory, he lived a reclusive life, renting a house in the village of Llanharan, near Bridgend, south Wales. The murder at James Street was apparently his first crime. Remarkably he had only one conviction after the murder, for assaulting a colleague in 1992. It is highly likely that Gafoor would never have been caught had it not been for his nephew's arrest. His recollection of what happened was ""dream-like, fuzzy"", he said, but he recalled he had lashed out at Lynette after changing his mind about having sex. He had asked for his £30 back and she had refused. On 4 July 2003 Gafoor pleaded guilty. He had acted alone and apologised to the Cardiff Five for their ordeal. For the first time in history a miscarriage of justice had been solved by the conviction of the real killer. That was cold comfort for Yusef Abdullahi. Speaking outside Cardiff Crown Court as Gafoor stood in the dock, he said: “I didn’t want to go in there because I’d have ripped his head off. ""Then I would have been up for a murder because I’m just really bitter towards him."" Sentenced to life, Gafoor was given a 13-year tariff - the minimum he must serve before he could apply for parole. It was less than the tariffs given to two of the Cardiff Three. Gafoor's conviction now raised serious questions about the eyewitness testimony of what happened in James Street presented at the original trial. In 2008 three of the four people who helped convict the men - Mark Grommek, Leanne Vilday and Angela Psaila - admitted they had made the whole thing up after being ""harassed into lying"" by police. Paul Atkins was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial. The three said they had been threatened with being convicted of the murder themselves. The court was told that Vilday was told her baby son would be taken away and was shown photographs of abused children in care. Psaila had an IQ of 55 and was described as one of the most vulnerable members of Cardiff society. Grommek was also vulnerable because of his sexuality as “in 1988 there was rather more intolerance of gay people than is the case now”. The judge Mr Justice Maddison said: ""It's been submitted on your behalf, accepted by the prosecution and I accept it myself... ""You were seriously hounded, bullied, threatened, abused and manipulated by the police during a period of several months leading up to late 1988, as a result of which you felt compelled to agree to false accounts they suggested to you."" The three were jailed for 18 months each. One of the most eminent barristers in the country, Lord Carlile QC, defended Leanne Vilday. ""The sheer wickedness and dishonesty of the police and remorseless systemic corruption in this case is difficult to believe, but it's true beyond a doubt and it is accepted by the prosecution,"" he said. It would be ""an utter scandal"", he said, if none of the police officers involved in the case were brought to trial themselves. Yusef Abdullahi speaking outside court after Jeffrey Gafoor is given a life term Tony Paris demanded an apology from South Wales Police just minutes after Lynette White's killer was sentenced In a series of dawn arrests, a number of serving and retired officers were pulled in for questioning. Following a six-year investigation, eight retired officers were in the dock charged with perverting the course of justice. A trial of four other officers was due to begin the following year. Graham Mouncher, Richard Powell, Thomas Page, Michael Daniels, Paul Jennings, Paul Stephen, Peter Greenwood and John Seaford denied conspiring to pervert the course of justice. In addition Mouncher denied lying under oath in court. Facing perjury charges were two civilian witnesses from the original trial, Violet Perriam, whose statement had put John Actie near 7 James Street on the night of the murder, and the discredited supergrass Ian Massey who claimed Tony Paris had confessed to him. All pleaded not guilty. The prosecution alleged the detectives had ""manipulated, moulded and even completely fabricated"" evidence, that they had acted ""corruptly together and with other police officers to manufacture a case against the five men"". ""The police had moved away from investigating a murder and they were instead busy trying to implicate people in that murder, people who were actually completely innocent of that murder,"" the jury was told. Despite the fact that Gafoor insisted he acted alone and had never met any of the five men originally accused of the murder, the police's defence would not have it - they were involved, they alleged. Under the law of court privilege which protected the defence from being sued for defamation by the innocent men, their theory was that there were two attacks - Gafoor had stabbed Lynette but not fatally and then somehow the five happened upon the scene and took over. It did not seem to matter that they had been acquitted, Lynette's real murderer convicted, that not a single shred of evidence, forensic or otherwise linked any of the men to the murder scene or that they had received public and written apologies from two chief constables. The surviving members of the Cardiff Five were called as witnesses - John Actie, Tony Paris and Stephen Miller. Perhaps most shockingly of all in the 30-year saga, they were effectively put on trial a second time during intense and prolonged cross-examination and without any defence. ""It was happening all over again,"" Tony Paris says. ""I was called as a witness and thought I'd be there for a few hours and then go home. ""Four days I was there. We were being accused and tried all over again."" During cross-examination John Actie said: ""You keep accusing me of being there. I was acquitted. It is them who fitted me up… I wasn't there… It seems like I am on trial."" Then in December 2011 after five months of evidence, the £30m trial collapsed in dramatic and controversial circumstances. It had become clear as the trial progressed that the process of disclosure was failing. Disclosure is the production and sharing by the prosecution of documents relevant to the case. This includes any information that either undermines the prosecution's case or potentially assists the defendants in their case. After several warnings by the judge, the prosecution was given one last chance, a litmus test, to prove they had handled the paper work correctly. But copies of a crucial set of four files required to prove the prosecution's competence regarding disclosure of material could not be found. Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Coutts The judge heard evidence alleging proof that one of the files had been destroyed on the orders of the officer leading the police corruption investigation Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Coutts. Following five months of evidence, the judge announced that a fair trial could not be guaranteed and abandoned the trial. All defendants were declared not guilty. Then in an extraordinary twist, the missing files were found seven weeks later in a cardboard box with other documents relating to the case in the offices of the police corruption investigation team. Calls for a full public inquiry into what went wrong were resisted. Instead the then Home Secretary Theresa May ordered an independent review led by Richard Horwell QC. Its conclusions were published in July last year. Horwell QC described the Cardiff Three convictions as ""one of the worst miscarriages of justice in our criminal justice system"". On the disclosure issues which led to the collapse of the police corruption trial, he said there had been errors amounting to ""an embarrassment on a national scale"". But, he went on, ""suspicion that the trial collapsed due to yet further police corruption has not been supported by the evidence"". ""It is human failings that brought about the collapse of the trial, not wickedness,"" he concluded. Despite criticism that South Wales Police was put in charge of investigating its own officers, it is widely acknowledged that Chris Coutts led a competent and efficient investigation in bringing the retired officers to court. But the handling of the disclosure, a complex task involving around one million pages of evidence, was wholly incompetent. ""The prosecution had predicted there would be an attack on disclosure,"" says journalist and author Satish Sekar, who has closely followed the case since 1991 and written three books about it. Satish Sekar ""If you've predicted that how do you get caught with your pants down like that? Absolutely ludicrous."" ""What stands about the Cardiff Five,"" he adds, ""is that it's very rare for so much to go wrong in the one case. ""Aspects of it you'll find in virtually every single miscarriage of justice. What is rare is that it all happened in the one case."" In 2015 the eight exonerated police officers sued South Wales Police for damages. They lost the case. To say John Actie is bitter is an understatement. His relationship with the police, he says, is as fractious as ever and he has made numerous complaints about harassment. ""My life has been ruined by what the police did,"" he says. ""I have been attacked, had people come up and call me a murderer when I'm out. I've been sent cards on Valentine's Day saying 'remember the 14th'. This will not leave me until I'm in my grave. ""My family has suffered, all our families have suffered. Our one chance of closure and they lose some papers?"" Speaking in 1990s, Yusef Abdullahi, who undertook an 18-month speaking tour on miscarriages of justice after his release, during which he met high-profile figures such as U2 front man and philanthropist Bono, told how he had collapsed from nervous exhaustion and woke up in a psychiatric bed. ""I was there for several months and people keep telling me to take it easier,"" he said. ""But the whole situation had got to me. I mean one minute I was in jail, the next I'm sitting eating with Bono. ""Until it happens to you, no one can have any idea what it's like to be convicted for a murder you didn't commit. ""We've been really messed up by what we've been though. We needed counselling but no one offered us any help. It did my head in."" He did live to see Lynette's killer jailed but died of a burst ulcer in January 2011, aged 49. Ronnie Actie died in 2007 from deep vein thrombosis also aged 49. He had been virtually living in a garden shed. ""Why the police wanted me off the streets for the rest of my life? I don't know,"" he said in an interview with BBC Wales. ""I'd love to know all those reasons. One day they'll come out."" Tony Paris has a theory. ""The police thought the community was hiding something but people aren't talking,"" he says. ""So, this is my opinion, they thought 'we'll take him and him and him'… All of us apart from Miller were from big docks families. If anybody knows anything, now they've got to talk to get these guys out. ""The entire legal system, not just the police, were involved in what happened to us. ""It changed my life. I went from being an extrovert in clubs and pubs to an introvert where I don't go out. I try to hide it when I do go out, but then I withdraw because I'm scared. I don't trust people. ""I try to find suitable words to put my feelings across. But when you think about it, there is no word, there is no word in the dictionary in any language that you can find to truly put across how you feel, it's unspeakable."" The case, estimated to have cost South Wales Police in excess of £100m, scarred the reputation of a police force which had four other recent miscarriages of justice on its record. The so-called Cardiff Newsagent Three were wrongly convicted for the murder of newsagent Phillip Saunders. They spent 11 years in jail before being released. After serving seven years for murder, the Darvell brothers were freed by the Court of Appeal in 1992 after it heard claims that detectives doctored confession statements and notes and suppressed scientific evidence. The following year Jonathan Jones was found to have been wrongly convicted of the murder of his in-laws Harry and Megan Tooze at their south Wales farm. Annette Hewins' conviction was quashed in 1999. She had been serving a 13-year sentence for arson with intent to endanger life following the death of 21-year-old Diane Jones and her daughters Shauna, two, and Sarah-Jane, 13 months. Police accepted in 2006 she had no part in the murders. She died last year aged 51. But it is without doubt the Lynette White murder inquiry that stands out as South Wales Police's, if not the UK's, most notorious case. Eligible for parole since March 2016, the prospect that Jeffrey Gafoor could be freed at any time is not an easy one for Lynette White's family or for those branded with his crime for so long. On the 30th anniversary of Lynette's murder there are calls for a change in the law so criminals who knowingly allow miscarriages of justice to unfold before they are convicted, can be dealt with more severely. ""There certainly were questions raised in a number of places about whether the sentence was proportionate to the nature of the crime and the fact that several innocent people spent time in prison as a result of Gafoor not coming forward and not admitting the case at an earlier stage,"" says South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael. South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael ""I can't answer those questions but I think they are legitimate questions and it's a challenge to the criminal justice system to ensure that all factors can be taken into account in the sentencing process in future."" But a stain remains on South Wales Police which, says newly installed Chief Constable Matt Jukes, has served to forge a determination for change. Speaking on the anniversary of Lynette White's murder, he says: ""The learning we've taken from the murder of Lynette White and the original investigation has led us to review many other historic cases and has led to convictions in several of those. ""So, the case itself has driven a change in the organisation and brought about justice for other victims. South Wales Police Chief Constable Matt Jukes ""For young officers today and many members of the community this case is something that they're aware of in the history of the organisation. ""It has truly deep resonances for all those affected by it and it's somewhat now in the DNA of the force I've got to say. ""Our determination not to fail in this way again steels my resolve every day to make sure our investigations are of the highest quality, professionally, technically, ethically, that they can possibly be. ""So I don't think even though this is an event that took place 30 years ago, it will leave the psyche of this organisation and its leadership for another generation."" On the surface at least the untidy past of Cardiff's docklands has been successfully swept away, transformed into the trendy waterfront vision conceived in the late 1980s replete with serviced apartments, bars and restaurants. It is also home to the Welsh Assembly's Senedd. 7 James Street (end building on right) close to the Wales Millennium Centre Now a smart rental above a vaping shop, 7 James Street is a stone's throw from the city's Millennium Centre, a thriving venue for opera, theatre and visiting West End shows. Once the beating heart of one of the world's most famous docks, its procession of stately buildings of ship brokers and chandlers and its exotically decorated shop fronts, is no more. The street is a ghost of its former self. The vestiges of the old Tiger Bay community are now a minority within Butetown, says Neil Sinclair, an author of three books on the history of the area. He witnessed the corrosive effect the Lynette White murder inquiry had on the community, one from which it has never fully recovered. ""Our general feeling as a community is that over the decades they wanted to eradicate us from Welsh memory and almost succeeded except for the fact that I've written down our history."" ""But,"" Neil adds, ""our ancestors, they didn't live in vain and they're going to come out, their ghosts are going to rise and our proud history will be given the recognition it deserves."" The surviving men caught up in one of the biggest scandals in recent history, never regained the peace they had taken for granted before being branded with the stigma of what happened at 7 James Street on St Valentine's Day 1988. Immediately on being freed from jail, Tony Paris had said: ""They wanted anybody for that murder. They thought we were anybodies but we were somebodies."" He may well have been speaking for the entire community of Butetown, and for Lynette White, who had been dehumanised for so long as ""the Cardiff prostitute"". The case continues to haunt Stephen Miller who has experienced depression, anxiety and agoraphobia not to mention his regret at not being there to protect the woman he said he loved very much. ""She's helped me, she's the one that's kept me strong,"" he said of Lynette. ""When I think about the case I think about her. Because this is all about her, it's not about us, it's about her."" Had she lived Lynette White would have celebrated her 50th birthday last July. She had lost her way but might well have in time, like countless other troubled 20 year olds, reached a point of maturity and confidence to turn it all around. Her appalling death meant she would never get the chance. The name of a vulnerable young woman who craved only love but was exploited by every man who paid for her youth, beauty and fragility, was fated not to be forgotten. It is not the legacy she or her loved ones would have wished for, but Lynette Debra White, born Wednesday, 5 July 1967, was destined to embody what is branded by some as ""the biggest scandal"" of recent legal history, an injustice the scale of which is never likely to be repeated in the UK, ever again.

Times table check trialled ahead of rollout,"Thousands of eight and nine-year-olds in England's primary schools will take a new times tables check this spring. Some 7,250 pupils in 290 primaries, are expected to take part in the trials of the new multiplication check. The five-minute test, taken by children in Year 4, will then be fully rolled out over the next two years. Ministers say the test will identify those struggling, but teaching unions have raised concerns about its benefits. Supporters have argued that it will help to ensure all children know their tables up to 12 off by heart, but opponents say primary school children are already heavily tested. Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said it was ""hugely disappointing"" that the Department for Education was still determined to bring in a multiplication tables test. ""This test won't tell teachers and parents anything they don't already know about their children. Although school results won't be published, this government test will be scrutinised by Ofsted when they visit and will therefore become even more significant. ""A pupil's primary school years are already cluttered with tests and checks.  We want all children to succeed at school, but the answer isn't to test them more."" Mike Ellicock, chief executive of National Numeracy, said: ""While the introduction of this test is underpinned by good intentions, we need to be careful not to knock the joy out of children's early mathematical experiences or distract schools from building children's real understanding of numbers. ""Knowing your tables is valuable - we all use them in everyday life - but what is more important is having a real feel for numbers and understanding the patterns behind times tables so children can use the knowledge flexibly in the real world. ""The danger in putting so much emphasis on tables testing - effectively on rote learning - is that it becomes a box-ticking exercise, and hinders the development of practical number sense."" The former Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw, has welcomed the times table trial, saying he is sure it will ""make a difference"". ""Good head teachers and good teachers never mind youngsters being tested. Nothing is taught unless it's learnt,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I think there's a place for rote learning, but any good teacher will say that's not the beginning and end of it.  There has to be a deeper conceptual understanding."" But the Department for Education said the test would last a maximum of five minutes and would allow teachers to monitor a child's progress. Schools can take part in the multiplication check voluntarily in June 2019 and it will be compulsory from 2020. School standards minister Nick Gibb said: ""Just as the phonics screening check helps children who are learning to read, the multiplication tables check will help teachers identify those pupils who require extra support. ""This will ensure that all pupils leave primary school knowing their times tables off by heart and able to start secondary school with a secure grasp of the fundamental mathematics they need to fulfil their potential.""

Teens 'buying Xanax on social media',"This video can not be played Xanax is the brand name for alprazolam, a potentially addictive tranquiliser The prescription drug Xanax is being sold illegally to children on social media sites, a BBC investigation has found. Xanax is widely prescribed in the US to treat anxiety but can only be obtained on private prescription in the UK. Drugs charity Addaction said children as young as 13 had bought it online. The Home Office said it was taking action. Instagram and Facebook said buying and selling drugs on their sites was prohibited. BBC South East discovered drugs being advertised on Instagram and Facebook and bought what dealers claimed was Xanax and diazepam. Rapper Lil Peep died from a suspected overdose One teenager from Kent said people can search on social media to find dealers. He admitted to using MDMA, cocaine and Xanax after contacting dealers online and said he spent his GCSE year trying drugs on school nights, and was on speed for most of his exams. He said: ""It is possible now to go on Instagram and find a drug dealer. ""You have to find a page which you could tell sold drugs, based on either their pictures or whatever."" He said the conversation then moves from social media to other apps which can't be tracked and are ""safer to use"". What you need to know about Xanax US rapper Lil Peep has died aged 21 The rappers who pop pills in their lyrics Several young people in Sussex needed hospital treatment after taking Xanax , and last yearup to 20 Wiltshire teenagers needed treatmentafter using the drug. It has also been known to kill - rapper Lil Peep died from a suspected overdose last November leading US hip-hop stars to ask if lyrics about drugs were going too far. London MP Bambos Charalambous said it was not known how widespread Xanax use was and called for an awareness campaign, further research and support services. Nick Hickmott, from Addaction, said: ""It's definitely part of our youth culture now. ""How many young people are using it is debatable, and obviously what's really important is we get some really good statistics around this and some really good records so we know exactly what we're dealing with, but it's enough to be showing some concern."" A spokesman for Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company which manufactures Xanax, said: ""We are alarmed by the rise of counterfeit Xanax and its growing availability on the internet and dark web. ""Counterfeits are difficult to distinguish from the real medicines and are extremely dangerous by their very nature given that they are not produced under regulated manufacturing conditions to ensure their safety. ""We have found dangerous ingredients such as boric acid, heavy metals and floor polish in counterfeit medicines. ""We will continue to work side by side with all law enforcement agencies around the world to help detect, disrupt and deter counterfeit medicines trade."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""We expect social media companies to have robust processes in place to act promptly to remove content and user accounts that do not comply with their own policies."" An Instagram spokesman said: ""Buying or selling drugs is prohibited on Instagram and these accounts have been removed."" A Facebook spokesman said the accounts had been removed, adding: ""Buying or selling drugs of any sort is not allowed on Facebook."" Both sites urged users to report such activity using the site's reporting tools.

UN asked to intervene in jailed mother case,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran when she was visiting her parents with he infant daughter A charity has asked the UN to intervene over a British-Iranian woman detained in Tehran for 22 months. Human rights organisation Redress has written to the UN, claiming Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's continued detention amounts to torture. She was arrested on spying charges in April 2016, accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government. Her husband Richard said his wife has experienced difficulty walking as well as extreme hair and weight loss. Redress has written to the UN special rapporteur on behalf of the mother's family, stating that evidence ""strongly suggests"" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's treatment amounts to torture. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle The uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Global powers defy US over Iran deal shift The letter says her treatment has had serious effects on her physical and mental health, in an attempt ""to demoralise her and put her in a situation of complete powerlessness."" Mr Ratcliffe, from Hampstead in London, said: ""It's very hard for both of us to be hopeful at this point. We were obviously very hopeful at Christmas [for her release] and it didn't happen. ""It's always good to hold on to the 'maybe', but also part of us putting in the submission now is because it feels like we're just being gamed."" Mr Ratcliffe met with Boris Johnson to discuss his wife's case in 2017 He added the family were ""waiting for the governments to deliver"" on Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release. He told the BBC he believes the charity worker is being used as a bargaining chip in political battles that have nothing to do with her. The 39-year-old was detained in Iran when visiting her parents with her daughter, Gabriella, who remains in the country. In December 2017 Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson travelled to Iran to call for the release of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcllife on humanitarian grounds. Mr Johnson had been criticised for comments he had made to a parliamentary committee in November.  He told MPs that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists in the country.  Helater apologisedfor the comments. Mr Ratcliffe said extra telephone privileges granted to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe after the foreign secretary's visit have been cut back after demonstrations against the Iranian regime in London last month. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 3 April 2016: Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is detained at an Iranian airport while travelling home to London with her young daughter. April-June 2016: According to Mr Ratcliffe, his wife was subject to ""intense interrogation"" for the first two months of her imprisonment and kept in solitary confinement September 2016: Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is sentenced to five years in prison in Tehran's Revolutionary Court January 2017: She loses an initial appeal against her sentence April 2017: Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe loses a final appeal in Iran's supreme court to overturn her sentence December 2017: An Iranian database lists her as eligible for release December 2017: Boris Johnson visits Tehran to call for the British-Iranian citizen's release Johnson raises jailed mother's case Johnson in Iran for talks on jailed Briton Protection considered for jailed Briton Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

London teacher in global award top 10,"A teacher from north London, named as a top-10 finalist in a global teaching award, has warned of the poor living conditions of her pupils. Andria Zafirakou says some pupils at her Brent secondary school have to do their homework in the bathroom, because their housing is so overcrowded. The nominations were announced by technology billionaire Bill Gates. Education is the ""master switch"" for progress in society and individual lives, said Mr Gates. The Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist revealed the top 10 teachers in the Global Teacher Prize organised by the Varkey Foundation, with the winner to receive $1m (Â£720,000). These included Mrs Zafirakou, an art and textiles teacher from Alperton Community School in north London. She has been nominated for her work with deprived pupils, working with their families at home as well as in the classroom. Andria Zafirakou with pupils from Alperton Community School, Brent ""By getting pupils to open up about their home lives, I discovered that many of my students come from crowded homes where multiple families share a single property,"" said Mrs Zafirakou. ""In fact it's often so crowded and noisy I've had students tell me they have to do their homework in the bathroom, just to grab a few moments alone so they can concentrate. ""I also found that some were being forced to play truant to cook meals in the allocated time slot they were permitted to use their shared home kitchen. ""Others could not participate in extra-curricular activities after school because they had to take on parental responsibilities like collecting their brothers and sisters from other schools,"" said Mrs Zafirakou. In response, she organised extra lessons during the day and the weekend, including giving pupils a quiet place to work. She had learned basic phrases in the 35 languages spoken by pupils at the school and helped teachers work with other services, such as local police and mental health specialists. Bill Gates said that education provided the ""master switch"" for progress in society ""I am submitting a nomination for a teacher who is a true gem, one who inspires such possibility and potential in her students, their parents, the staff, her peers, the local community, and future teachers and leaders."" ""A phenomenal teacher and leader. She is guided by a moral compass that underpins a passionate desire to give every student at her school the world - no ceilings, no limitations, no boundaries."" ""She is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to ensuring that students deserve the best education possible."" ""One lady with care and passion can make a huge difference to the lives of many. She is upbeat, full of character, highly regarded and I wish all schools were blessed with a senior leader such as her!"" The finalists have been drawn from more than 30,000 nominations in 173 countries, with the top 10 coming from schools in countries including Brazil, Australia, Colombia and South Africa, as well as the UK's representative. The competition is intended to raise the status of the teaching profession and Bill Gates pointed to the importance of their work. ""When you think about what drives progress and improvement in the world, education is like a master switch - one that opens up all sorts of opportunities for individuals and societies. ""And research has shown that having a great teacher can be the most important factor that determines whether students get a great education,"" said Mr Gates. Sunny Varkey, whose foundation set up the annual international teacher prize, said he wanted the finalists' stories to ""inspire those looking to enter the teaching profession"" and to ""shine a powerful spotlight on the incredible work teachers do"". The other nine finalists for the Global Teacher Prize 2018 are: Nurten AkkuÅ a pre-school teacher and principal, Samsun, Turkey Marjorie Brown, history teacher, Johannesburg,  South Africa Luis Gutierrez, social science teacher, Bogota, Colombia Jesus Insilada, English teacher, Iloilo, Philippines Glenn Lee, engineering and technology teacher, Hawaii, United States Diego Mahfouz Faria Lima, school director, Sao Paulo, Brazil Koen Timmers, lecturer and computer science teacher, Heusden-Zolder, Belgium Eddie Woo, maths teacher, Sydney, Australia Barbara Anna Zielonka, English teacher, Nannestad, Norway.

"Denmark's prince who wanted to be king diesFrench-born Prince Henrik, who made public his unhappiness at never being named king, has died at 83.16m16 minutes agoEurope","This video can not be played Queen Margrethe married Prince Henrik in 1967 Prince Henrik of Denmark, the husband of Queen Margrethe who was famous for his public unhappiness at never being named king, has died at the age of 83. The controversial French-born prince had been diagnosed with dementia last year and was admitted to hospital in January with a lung infection. His flamboyant style was both loved and criticised by Danes. Frustrated with his royal title, he announced in 2017 thathe did not want to be buried next to his wife. The 77-year-old queen accepted her husband's decision, the Royal House said at the time, breaking a 459-year-old tradition of burying royal spouses together. The prince died ""peacefully in his sleep"" at the Fredensborg Castle, north of Copenhagen, with Queen Margrethe and their two sons - Crown Prince Frederick and Prince Joachim - at his side. Unhappy with his royal status, Prince Henrik was a controversial figure in Denmark Born Henri Marie Jean AndrÃ© de Laborde de Monpezat on 11 June 1934, Prince Henrik married the then-crown princess Margrethe in 1967. He met her while stationed in London as a diplomat. When she became queen in 1972, he was named Prince Consort - as in most monarchies, a princess traditionally becomes queen when her husband takes the throne, but a man does not become king if his wife becomes queen. But over the years, the prince - who changed his name to Henrik as a mark of respect - made no secret about his unhappiness at being denied the title of king. And many Danes disliked him for that, seeing it as a sign of an arrogant man hungry for recognition. Prince Henrik did not take it lightly when, in 2002, Crown Prince Frederik was chosen to represent Queen Margrethe at a New Year's ceremony, instead of him. Saying he had to ""reflect on life"",he dramatically fled to his chateau in southern France,external, where he would stay for three weeks. To a Danish tabloid, he said the royal staff had shunted him into ""third place in the royal hierarchy"". He had felt ""pushed aside, degraded and humiliated"", and his self-respect was being destroyed. ""For many years I have been Denmark's number two,"" he said then.

Prince Henrik was also known for his thick French accent and his love of food, wine and poetry, and several of his cookbooks and collections of poems have been published.

"Peru prisoner used twin to escapeThe man has been recaptured, a year after he drugged his visiting brother and left him in his cell.9h9 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean","Alexander Delgado said he just wanted to see his mother Authorities in Peru have recaptured a prisoner more than a year after he escaped from jail by leaving his twin brother in his place. Alexander Delgado had been serving a 16-year sentence for child sexual abuse and robbery in a prison north of Lima. When his twin, Giancarlo, visited him last January, Alexander drugged him, changed into his clothes and walked out of jail. The suspected swap was confirmed after Giancarlo's fingerprints were taken. After 13 months on the run Alexander Delgado was arrested on Monday in the port city of Callao after the Ministry of the Interior offered a reward for information leading to his capture. He is now expected to be moved to a maximum security prison in the southern highlands. While Alexander was at large, his brother Giancarlo was arrested and investigated on suspicion of having collaborated with his twin. But he was not charged and has now been released. Speaking to local media after his arrest, Alexander Delgado said he used the ruse to escape ""because I was desperate to see my mother"".

Police seek Netanyahu corruption charges,"Mr Netanyahu is reported to have met investigators several times Israeli police say that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be charged over alleged bribery cases. A police statement said there was enough evidence to indict Mr Netanyahu for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in two separate cases. Speaking on Israeli television, Mr Netanyahu said the allegations were baseless and that he would continue as prime minister. The allegations, he said, ""will end with nothing"". One case centres on an allegation that Mr Netanyahu asked the publisher of an Israeli newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, for positive coverage in exchange for help in reining in a rival publication. Police said the editor of Yediot Aharonot, Arnon Mozes, should also face charges. Is this game over for Netanyahu? Netanyahu: The commando turned PM The second allegation centres on a claim that Mr Netanyahu, Israeli prime minister since 2009, received gifts worth at least a million shekels ($283,000; Â£204,000) from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and other supporters. The Jerusalem Post says the gifts included champagne and cigars, and were given in exchange for help getting Mr Milchan a US visa. Mr Milchan, the producer of films including Fight Club, Gone Girl and The Revenant, should face bribery charges, police said. Arnon Milchan (centre) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Spielberg The police statement said that Mr Netanyahu, after receiving gifts, pushed for the Milchan Law, which would have ensured that Israelis who return to live in Israel from abroad were exempt from paying taxes for 10 years. The proposal was eventually blocked by the finance ministry. Police say Mr Netanyahu is also suspected of fraud and breach of trust in a case involving Australian billionaire James Packer. Israel's Channel 10 reported in December that Mr Packer told investigators he gave the prime minister and his wife Sara gifts. Israeli media say Mr Netanyahu has been questioned by investigators at least seven times. A final decision on whether Mr Netanyahu should face charges will come down to the attorney general's office. A decision could take months to reach. Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said any prime minister who has been charged should not be obliged to resign. Speaking on Israeli television, Mr Netanyahu said he would continue in his role. The next legislative elections are scheduled for November 2019. Mr Netanyahu heads a fragile coalition, but on television, he appeared confident the allegations would not spur new elections. ""Over the years, I have been the subject of at least 15 enquiries and investigations,"" he said in his TV address. ""Some have ended with thunderous police recommendations like those of tonight. All of those attempts resulted in nothing, and this time again they will come to nothing."" The 68-year-old is in his second stint as prime minister, and has served in the role for a total of 12 years. He has faced a number of allegations in his time in office. After his first term as prime minister two decades ago, police recommended that he and Sara face criminal charges for keeping official gifts that should have been handed over to the state. The charges were later dropped. In July 2015, the couple were accused of charging the government for the services of a contractor who did private work for them. The charges were later dropped.

Sky and BT win Premier League rights,"The Premier League has seen a decline in the money raised from the sale of rights to broadcast matches in the UK. In total BT and Sky bid Â£4.4bn to screen the lion's share of 200 games for each season between 2019-2022. That amount falls short of the Â£5.1bn the Premier League netted in 2015. Two packages to show 20 midweek matches are still to be sold, but experts say it is unlikely they will raise enough to top the previous rights deal. ""I don't think that those two packages by themselves are going to bridge the gap between what the domestic rights were sold for last time and what they're going for this time,"" said Dan Jones, head of the sports business group at the accountancy firm Deloitte. In 2012, BT and Sky paid Â£3bn for the rights to show matches between 2013 and 2015, up from Â£1.77bn in the previous three-year cycle. In 2015, the Premier League then took a total of Â£5.1bn for the next three years. Despite the fall in the overall take for the Premier League, BT Sport will pay more to broadcast each match under its new agreement. Sky, on the other hand, will pay less. Kieran Maguire, a senior teacher in accountancy at the University of Liverpool, said that Sky and BT need to think carefully about what they charge viewers for the football packages. ""If you get the pricing right the subscribers will be there, but there's not a lot of wiggle room there to go up in terms of what they are charging per month, and that's why subscribers have been turning away,"" he says. In December,Sky and BT signed a deal to sell their channels on each other's platforms. Under the deal, BT agreed to supply its sports channels, which show Uefa Champions League and Europa League fixtures, to Sky. BT was also able to sell Sky's Now TV service, which includes Sky Sports, to its customers. Sky's broadcasting rights include its flagship Sunday afternoon slots and Saturday night games. BT will show Saturday lunchtime games. 200 games per season for three years in seven packages Sky Sports has won four packages to screen 128 matches per season It will pay a total of Â£3.5bn or Â£9.3m per game BT Sport has one package to screen 32 matches per season It will pay a total Â£885m or Â£9.2m per game Two packages of 20 games each are still up for auction BT Sport paid Â£960m to screen 42 games per season, or Â£7.6m a match Sky Sports paid Â£4.1bn to show 126 matches per season or Â£11m per game BT said it has been ""financially disciplined"" during the bidding process, and that it expects to make returns through subscription, wholesale, commercial and advertising revenues. It added that its customer base had more than doubled when it acquired EE. Despite the fall in total take for the Premier League, Mr Jones said the deal ""will still leave the Premier League as the richest league in the world by a margin"". He added: ""The Premier League still has its overseas rights to sell and the uplift in those will more than cover any shortfall in the domestic rights I expect."" In the 2015 auction, the Premier League sold the international rights to live football games for about Â£3.3bn over three years, on top of the Â£5.1bn it raised from selling the UK rights. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""There's two packages still up for grabs, but so far Sky is the big winner from the Premier League auction. ""Securing more games at a lower cost is a major coup, and with BT seemingly content to play second fiddle on the Premier League, that rivalry now looks to have thawed.""

Ex-football coach guilty of sex abuse,"Ex-football coach Barry Bennell has been found guilty of multiple sex offences against boys in the 1980s. Liverpool Crown Court heard Bennell had a ""power hold"" over aspiring players aged between eight and 15 and abused them on an ""industrial scale"". The 64-year-old was convicted of 36 charges against 10 boys, including indecent and serious sexual assaults. The jury is still considering verdicts on seven counts and will continue their deliberations on Wednesday. Prosecutors had described Bennell as a ""predatory and determined paedophile"". They compared him to the Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, while his victims described his home as a ""paradise"" for young boys, where they would play games and be given takeaway food. Boys were abused at his home - where he had arcade games and exotic pets including a puma and a monkey - on trips away, and in his car on the way to and from training. The youth scout and junior football coach was associated with a number of clubs including Crewe Alexandra, and Manchester City - where he was said to have been treated like ""God"". In his evidence to the court, one victim, Chris Unsworth, said Bennell had raped him ""about half a dozen times"". Chris Unsworth told the court he had been abused by Barry Bennell as a child He was a junior footballer playing for his local club and Bennell at the time worked as a scout for Manchester City. Bennell was convicted of all five charges against Mr Unsworth, when he was aged between eight and 14. Bennell, who is now known as Richard Jones, appeared in court via videolink due to illness. The jury deliberated for four days before returning their verdicts The jury was told Bennell had previously received three jail sentences in the UK and in the US after being convicted of abusing boys. He chose not to offer any evidence or witnesses in his defence and had told police he was suffering from cancer, which in turn had caused memory problems. His barrister accused the complainants of inventing stories about him and ""jumping on the bandwagon"". This video can not be played The BBC's Danny Savage reports on the verdicts The jury of five men and six women had spent four days deliberating after the five-week trial. They were considering a total of 48 charges against 11 complainants which Bennell had denied at the start of the proceedings. He was convicted of 36 charges relating to 10 complainants. During the trial, the judge had directed them to find him not guilty on three of the charges. Two counts he was found guilty of carried alternative charges - which the jury will no longer be dealing with. The judge has told the jury he will accept a majority verdict on the seven charges on which they have not yet reached verdicts. Four of these charges relate to an 11th complainant.

Boris Johnson: UK should not fear Brexit,"This video can not be played Johnson: We need to get positive agenda across Boris Johnson has told his fellow Brexiteers they should not ""gloat"" about the UK's departure from the EU, which he said was a cause for ""hope not fear"". The foreign secretary urged people to ""unite about what we all believe in"", an ""outward-looking, confident"" UK. Leaving the EU was not a ""great V-sign from the cliffs of Dover"", he said. Mr Johnson also said the result cannot be reversed and that Britain should not be bound by EU rules after Brexit. And he questioned the economic benefits of being in the EU single market and customs union, which the government plans to leave. Analysis: What was the aim of Johnson's speech European Union growth rate at 10-year high Kamal Ahmed: EU joins global growth bandwagon It was the first in a series of speeches by Theresa May and her ministers designed to map out ""road to Brexit"". Mr Johnson was one of the leading figures in the 2016 Leave campaign, and has previously been accused of undermining Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy. But he stuck to the government's official negotiating position during his speech in central London. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: I have to try - people's feelings matter In seeking to build bridges with the other side of the EU debate, Mr Johnson said he risked ""simply causing further irritation"" and accepted he would not ""persuade everybody"" but added: ""I have to try. In the end these are people's feelings and people's feelings matter."" ""We must accept that many [Remainers] are actuated by entirely noble sentiments, a real sense of solidarity with our European neighbours and a desire for the UK to succeed,"" he said. ""If we are to carry this project through to national success - as we must - then we must also reach out to those who still have anxieties. ""I want to try to anatomise at least some of those fears and to show... that Brexit is not grounds for fear but hope."" According to Mr Johnson, Brexit is ""not some great V-sign from the cliffs of Dover"", but ""the expression of legitimate and natural desire to self govern of the people"". ""That is surely not some reactionary Farageist concept,"" he added in a reference to former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who hit back on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Alongside his calls to Brexit supporters not to ""gloat"" and ""sit back in silent satisfaction"", Mr Johnson said holding another referendum on the UK's membership of the EU - as some campaigners are calling for - would be a ""disastrous mistake that would lead to permanent and ineradicable feelings of betrayal"". He frequently used variants of the 2016 referendum's ""take back control"" argument - on things like regulations and tariffs so businesses did not have laws affecting them ""imposed from abroad"" when they have no power to elect or remove the people making them. It would be ""intolerable and undemocratic"" if the UK was subject to EU laws after Brexit, he said. Mr Johnson said the benefits of being in the single market and customs union were ""nothing like as conspicuous or irrefutable"" as claimed by their supporters, saying other countries were able to trade with the EU without paying membership fees. However, during a transition period immediately after the UK leaves in March 2019 things would ""remain as they are"", he said. Laura Kuenssberg: The UK trade options Brexit: All you need to know Ex-Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney joined a protest outside Mr Johnson's speech Pro-EU campaigners hit back at his overtures to Remain voters - with Labour MP Chuka Umunna describing the speech as an ""exercise in hypocrisy"". Mr Umunna, of the anti ""hard Brexit"" Open Britain campaign, said: ""We are already a great country, we are already internationalist and we are already global."" Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said the speech revealed the government's intention to ""casually cast aside"" rights and protections and ignore the benefits of the EU single market. ""Nobody will be fooled or reassured by the foreign secretary's empty rhetoric,"" he said. Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston accused Mr Johnson of an ""optimism bias"" about the benefits of Brexit. The SNP's Brexit spokesman Stephen Gethins said he was not reassured by Mr Johnson's speech and said the government ""still can't really tell us what leaving the EU will mean"". And Liberal Democrat Tom Brake said the speech was mainly about ""Boris' ambitions to become the next prime minister"". Conservative MP Nigel Evans said the foreign secretary had reflected the views of many people, irrespective of how they voted in 2016, that the UK now needed to get on with the process of leaving. ""It's also about the opportunities that are now going to exist for the United Kingdom,"" he told the BBC. Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said the speech may have come as a surprise to those who, in his opinion, mistakenly believed the government was set ""to reinvent a customs union, forego an independent trade policy and accept the need to follow all new EU laws"".

""I am strictly against a European superstate. We are not the United States of America, we are the European Union, which is a rich body because we have these 27, or 28, nations.

NY bomber sentenced to life in prison,"Rahimi at a hearing in May 2017 The man who set off pressure cooker bombs in New York and New Jersey in 2016 has been sentenced to life. Ahmad Khan Rahimi injured 30 people when he set off a bomb in Manhattan. The Afghan-born US citizen,who was captured after a shootoutwith police, told the court that he does not ""harbour hate for anyone"". According to federal prosecutors, the 30-year-old has not shown remorse and has attempted to radicalise others in prison to support Islamic State. Rahimi, known to many as the ""Chelsea bomber"", was convicted in 2017 October on all eight counts brought against him in court, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a public place. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement ""justice has been served"". ""The sentencing will not heal the pain and suffering that this despicable act caused New Yorkers, but it sends a strong message that we will not tolerate those who seek to sow fear, hate and violence."" On the morning of 17 September 2016, Rahimi left his home in Elizabeth, New Jersey with several homemade bombs. The first bombing location he chose was along the route of a Marine Corps charity race in Seaside Heights, New Jersey. Who is Ahmad Khan Rahimi? Due to a last-minute change to the race schedule, no people were injured when that pipe bomb detonated. Investigators said Rahimi then planted two bombs in the Chelsea neighbourhood of New York but one failed to detonate. Other remaining devices were left in a discarded rucksack in a rubbish bin at a train station in New Jersey on the day after the weekend attack. The trial in October heard that Rahimi's fingerprints and DNA were discovered on both bombs laid in New York City. Jurors also saw CCTV footage of the suspect walking the Manhattan streets to where the bombs were placed. Rahimi was arrested two days after the attacks following a shootout with police in New Jersey, which left him in hospital for weeks. This video can not be played Footage from WABC shows the suspect being loaded into an ambulance Prosecutors said that Rahimi had started following terrorist propaganda in 2012 and had tried to influence his fellow inmates since arriving in prison, including sharing speeches from deceased al-Qaeda leaders Anwar al-Awlaki and Osama bin Laden. Rahimi had pledged silence at his trial in a letter to an ""associate"" in Germany, prosecutors said, but he did not follow through with this. ""Their hands are already drenched with Muslim Blood and how will they understand our struggle,"" Rahimi wrote, according to prosecutors. His father, who reported him to the FBI two years ago, called him a terrorist in an interview with NBC. The sentence of multiple life terms means Rahimi is likely to never leave jail.

Missing teen died from hypothermia,"Gaia Pope's body was found 11 days after she went missing on 7 November A teenager whose disappearance sparked a major search died of hypothermia, an inquest has heard. Gaia Pope, 19, from Langton Matravers, Dorset, was reported missing on 7 November. Her body was found 11 days later near the Dorset coast path. An inquest into her death heard there were no suspicious circumstances or signs of third party involvement. A family statement said there were questions which ""must still be answered"". The inquest in Bournemouth heard Miss Pope had severe epilepsy and was living in Swanage when she went missing. Her body was discovered in undergrowth on the cliff top between Dancing Ledge and Anvil Point to the west of Swanage. Scores of people attended a vigil at Swanage amphitheatre after Gaia Pope's death An initial post-mortem examination was unable to determine a cause of death but further tests showed she died from hypothermia. The coroner requested a series of reports from Dorset Police, the neurologist treating her epilepsy and from the Dorset Heathcare University NHS Trust, which had been providing care to Miss Pope. The coroner also requested an entomology report to see if more information can be gathered about the time of her death. Miss Pope's disappearance prompted a massive campaign from family and friends who spent days scouring the town and surrounding area along with police and coastguard teams. Following the inquest hearing, her cousin Marienna Pope-Weidemann issued a statement on behalf of the family praising the ""incredible grassroots efforts"" of the local community during the search. ""Every minute without Gaia feels like an hour and every hour without answers seems endless. ""We know now what took her from us but when, how and why are all questions that must still be answered, not just for our sake but for the sake of the next family who wakes up in that nightmare someday. Three people arrested on suspicion of murder while the search for Miss Pope was taking place were later released and face no action. The inquest was adjourned until 14 May.

Lochs 'important stores' of carbon,"University of St Andrews researchers studied Loch Etive Scotland's sea lochs play an important role in storing carbon which would otherwise contribute to climate change, scientists have suggested. Using samples from Loch Etive, near Oban, researchers calculated that a square metre of sediment contains more carbon than peatlands. Protecting carbon stores is important because when it is disturbed it can release greenhouse gases. The study was carried out by researchers at St Andrews University. While millions is spent on enhancing and restoring carbon-stores in peat moors, sea lochs are afforded relatively little protection from activities like dredging and the researchers said that needed to change. Research fellow Craig Smeaton said: ""Scottish sea lochs contain a large amount of carbon. ""It's mainly been forgotten about over the last decade in comparison to the Scottish peatlands. ""About a third of the carbon held in the peatlands are held in the sea lochs but when you think about it as an area difference the sea lochs contain far more carbon per metre or kilometre squared. So they are storing more carbon over a smaller area."" The Scottish government is currently finalising its Climate Change Plan which sets out how it intends to address global temperature rises over the next 15 years. But a draft version, published in January 2017, contained no policies to protect sediment deposits in sea lochs. The sediment is carried from the landscape through rivers and burns into lochs. Until recently it had been assumed the carbon then disappeared into the sea. But deep troughs in the sea lochs provide huge areas for the sediment to settle and be stored. Mr Smeaton added: ""The coastal region, and fjords and sea lochs in particular, are giving this carbon a second chance to be captured. So it's not all lost. ""There is a second reservoir of carbon that we've totally forgotten about. But it is there and it is large and important."" Previously concerns have been foucsed on drying out peatlands releasing carbon into the atmosphere About 640 million tonnes of carbon is now estimated to exist in the top 111 Scottish sea lochs. Scottish peats have been estimated to hold 1,600 million tonnes. Last year the Scottish government pledged Â£8m to restore damaged moors where peat left exposed can be dried out by the sun. This then releases carbon into the atmosphere. The biggest threat to sea lochs is thought to be from dredging, where fishing gear is dragged along the sea bed to scoop-up scallops. This practice is banned in some areas through a system of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) but only for the benefit of marine features, like reefs, and individual species. Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said: ""This is an interesting preliminary scientific paper on carbon absorption and retention in Scottish fjords. ""The potential effects of physical disturbance is mentioned but there is no attempt in this early work to define or quantify it. Before anyone can make a sensibly evidenced statement, that is now required. ""The Scottish lochs are a wonderful asset for a number of reasons, not the least of which is their contribution to sustainable food production."" Prof John Baxter, principal marine advisor for Scottish Natural Heritage, said: ""If that carbon was in the atmosphere it would be contributing to climate change, global warming. ""But also that carbon would be being absorbed by the sea again which would be contributing to another major issue that we have which is ocean acidification. ""If it is mobilised by being dredged or put back into the water column then some of that will go back into the atmosphere. ""It's really important that we recognise that these stores are there and that we do everything we can to protect them, to maintain those stores."" Prof Baxter said marine areas provided an important protection against climate change with what is called ""blue carbon"" where ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and saltmarshes soak up carbon. He added: ""It plays a huge role and it is important that we do recognise it and acknowledge it. ""But we need to find out more and do more research."" Inshore dredging has been under scrutiny since a rare flame shell reef was damaged in Loch Carron last year. Last week, BBC Scotland revealed thatillegal scallop dredging had been taking place in a Marine Protected Area in the Firth of Lorn. The Scottish government said Scotland was ""at the forefront of the global fight against climate change"". A spokeswoman added: ""Many of the key habitats and species found in sea lochs identified by research as being important for blue carbon are protected by policies under the National Marine Plan, which require decision makers to consider climate change mitigation and adaptation. ""Several are also safeguarded within Scotland's Marine Protected Area Network. This provides the potential to protect these important marine ecosystems to ensure they continue to capture and store carbon. ""We continue to invest in research to improve our understanding of blue carbon, as outlined in our forthcoming Climate Change Plan.""

Peru prisoner used twin to escape,"Alexander Delgado said he just wanted to see his mother Authorities in Peru have recaptured a prisoner more than a year after he escaped from jail by leaving his twin brother in his place. Alexander Delgado had been serving a 16-year sentence for child sexual abuse and robbery in a prison north of Lima. When his twin, Giancarlo, visited him last January, Alexander drugged him, changed into his clothes and walked out of jail. The suspected swap was confirmed after Giancarlo's fingerprints were taken. After 13 months on the run Alexander Delgado was arrested on Monday in the port city of Callao after the Ministry of the Interior offered a reward for information leading to his capture. He is now expected to be moved to a maximum security prison in the southern highlands. While Alexander was at large, his brother Giancarlo was arrested and investigated on suspicion of having collaborated with his twin. But he was not charged and has now been released. Speaking to local media after his arrest, Alexander Delgado said he used the ruse to escape ""because I was desperate to see my mother"".

Baby held for months over unpaid bill,"Baby Angel spent the first five months of her life in a private clinic A mother has spoken of her relief after a private clinic in Gabon finally released her baby, who was held for months over an unpaid medical bill. Baby Angel's mother told the BBC her milk had run dry after being separated from the child for the first five months of her life. The case shocked the country, and she gained much public support. The bill of 2 million CFA ($3,630; Â£2,610) was paid after a campaign was launched on the family's behalf. President Ali Bongo was among those who contributed towards the bill. The lifesaver that medicine nearly forgot Gabon country profile The clinic's director was arrested on Monday on baby-kidnapping charges, but the charges were dropped a day later, reports BBC Afrique's Charles Stephan Mavoungou from the capital, Libreville. Angel was finally allowed to leave the clinic, which is north of the capital, this week. The baby's mother, Sonia Okome, told the BBC of her relief, but explained it was bittersweet: ""I'm happy to have my baby back. But I'm sorry that I can't breastfeed her because after five months all my milk has gone."" She also complained that the baby had not been given any vaccines. The bill,Gabon Media Time reports [in French],external, was for the 35 days Angel spent in an incubator after she was born prematurely.
