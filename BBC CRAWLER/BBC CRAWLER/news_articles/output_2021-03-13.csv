Wales eye Grand Slam after Italy rout,"This video can not be played Six Nations 2021: Wales score seven tries to thrash Italy 48-7 in Rome Guinness Six Nations: Italy v Wales Italy: (0) 7 Try:IoaneCon:Garbisi Wales: (27) 48 Tries:Adams, Faletau, Owens 2, North, Sheedy, Rees-ZammitCons:Biggar 3, Sheedy 2Pens:Biggar Wales set up a Grand Slam encounter against France in Paris next Saturday by clinically disposing of hapless Italy 48-7 in Rome. Hooker Ken Owens crossed for two tries, with further scores from Josh Adams, Taulupe Faletau, George North, Callum Sheedy and Louis Rees-Zammit. Italy only managed a try through wing Monty Ioane in response. Wayne Pivac's side can complete the Six Nations clean sweep by winning at the Stade de France next weekend. France and Scotland will still have a match to play after their third-round game was postponed because of coronavirus cases in the French camp. But Wales have the chance to create their own 'Super Saturday' with victory in Paris, where they could secure a second Grand Slam in three tournaments. The omens are good. Wales have already won their fifth Six Nations Triple Crown since 2000 and on each of the previous occasions they have done so, they have gone on to seal the Grand Slam. It represents a remarkable turnaround from a side that finished fifth in Pivac's first tournament in charge and managed only three wins in 10 games in 2020, although we have grown used to the boom-and-bust nature of Welsh rugby. It might also be a special day for captain Alun Wyn Jones, who could become the first Welshman to celebrate four Grand Slams. Wales have now matched their record of 17 Six Nations tries in one tournament with a game remaining. This was Wales' 16th successive victory over Italy, with the last defeat coming in 2007, and also represents their longest winning run against one opponent, overtaking a run of 15 victories against France from 1908-1927. Another heavy defeat will again raise the inevitable questions about Italy's position in the Six Nations and whether there should be relegation, with the likes of Georgia being given the chance to join the tournament. The facts are damning. It was a 31st successive defeat for the Azzurri in the competition, with their last victory coming against Scotland in 2015. They have not managed a home Six Nations win for eight years, with 20 successive losses. Italy have conceded 187 points and 26 tries in four games this year. Yet events off the field this week have actually strengthened their hand. The Â£365m CVC private equity deal secures Italy's status as an equal partner for the next five years, with Six Nations boss Ben Morel saying the championship is ""precious"" and any changes ""would need to be extremely carefully studied"". Before the match Pivac had warned not to expect any ""razzle dazzle"" from his Wales side, but that is exactly what the visitors provided in the Stadio Olimpico sunshine. It was one-way traffic after Wales opened the scoring through a Dan Biggar penalty, before Italy captain Luca Bigi was yellow carded by referee Wayne Barnes for cynically stopping scrum-half Gareth Davies taking a quick tap-penalty. Davies had been one of two changes in the Wales side for injured Kieran Hardy, who had scored from a similar move against England. From the resulting scrum, Wales made their numerical advantage tell as wing Adams, who claimed a hat-trick against Italy last year, dived over from a long Biggar pass. The fly-half converted. Wales' dominance continued and searing breaks from Rees-Zammit and Adams allowed the visitors to move the ball in both directions before number eight Faletau crashed over as 12 points were scored with the extra man. As it happened & reaction: Wales cruise to win in Rome Wales also demonstrated their forward power when hooker Owens was driven over for his fourth international try from an attacking line-out. Barnes then looked at television replays about a possible illegal tackle by Biggar on Italy flanker Johan Meyer. The English barrister deemed there was no case to answer, although a later challenge by Biggar at the following ruck was not looked at. The bonus point came in the 30th minute when Owens stretched over from another line-out for his second score. Wales appeared to have scored a fifth try through Rees-Zammit but television match official Tom Foley picked up a final forward pass from Biggar as the visitors led 27-0 at half-time. The onslaught continued after the break with Jonathan Davies releasing co-centre North, who sprinted away to equal Shane Williams' Wales record of 22 Six Nations tries. Italy responded with a fine individual effort from wing Ioane that Paolo Garbisi converted, while Adams was denied a second score after failing to ground the ball in time. Wales made a raft of replacements, including Scarlets second-row Jake Ball coming on for his 50th cap, before Italy replacement prop Marco Riccion was yellow-carded for dangerous use of the elbow. Wales took advantage with a first international try for Bristol fly-half Sheedy, before Rees-Zammit sped away spectacularly following an 80-metre interception to complete the scoring. While spectacular tries were being scored, flanker Josh Navidi provided the basis for the win with a tireless performance in defence and attack Italy:Trulla, Bellini, Brex,  Canna, Ioane, Garbisi, Varney; Fischetti, Bigi (capt), Zilocchi, Cannone, Sisi, Negri, Meyer, Lamaro. Replacements:Fabiani for Ioane (7-18), Lovotti for Fischetti (65) Riccioni for Zilocchi (33), Lazzaroni for Cannone (52), Mbanda for Meyer (26-36), Violi for Varney (63), Mori for Garbisi (54) Padovani for Trulla (44).

'We have learned nobody is going to protect us',"Women ""will be worried and may well be feeling scared"" after the disappearance of Sarah Everard, the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick has said. On social media, in WhatsApp groups and in Zoom calls across the country, women have been talking about the case of the 33-year-old, who went missing in Clapham, south London, on 3 March. A Met police officer continues to be questioned on suspicion of murder and kidnap after human remains were found during the search for her. Some women are sharing their anger, frustration and fear online - reflecting each others' experiences of walking alone on the streets. Sarah Everard walked down a busy main road in Clapham before she disappeared ""I learned from a very young age that I would have to change my behaviour in order to keep myself safe,"" Grace Jessup tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""We're seeing a lot of women coming out and saying, 'we're tired of this, we're sick of this'. ""We're also kind of sick of the fact that this is a shock to men. ""This has been my reality, since I was about 14 years old, walking down the road in a school uniform and being harassed by passers-by."" Sarah Everard vigil planned as women share concerns Murder police question officer over Sarah Everard Grace says she never goes out without telling a friend to text her when they get home, or vice versa. ""If you don't, they'll follow up with you, and they'll make sure that you're safe. Because we have learned nobody is going to protect us."" Grace is 31 and says she's been ""walking down the road and holding keys in your hand"" for 18 years now Grace used to live in Clapham, close to where Sarah Everard was last seen. ""She could have been me, she could have been any of my friends,"" she says. She plans to go to a vigil planned on Saturday at Clapham Common. ""For me, it's not only a vigil, it's a space for us to just come together. This has hurt us, as young women. ""So I think it's important for us to gather, to acknowledge how that feels for us. And obviously, as a result pay tribute to her."" Daisy Edwards lives five minutes' walk from the last place Sarah Everard was seen. She moved to the area a few months ago and also plans to go to the vigil on Saturday. She saw the missing person posters around the streets last week. ""I'm really shocked at myself actually, how I didn't initially see the missing posters and take it seriously. I think maybe I've been desensitised to it."" Daisy says she's used to taking precautions if walking somewhere alone, especially at night. ""If I feel that someone's following me I turn around and look at their face, or maybe stop to take a phone call - I've faked phone calls before."" Daisy, 26, only moved to the area in the last few months from her parents' in Kent Some men are asking on social media what they can do to help women feel safe if they're walking alone. Most of the replies centre around giving women space on the street if you walk behind them or past them. But some people are also very keen to point out that it's a tiny minority of men who are attackers - using the hashtag #NotAllMen. BBC Sounds: How to Stop Men Hurting Women ""The issue with the argument is that women can't win,"" says Daisy. ""They want women to not treat all men as potential attackers, but then we also are asked to keep ourselves safe. ""Keeping ourselves safe means that we have to see everyone as potential attackers, because if we were to say, 'OK, not all men, we will treat everyone as innocent until proven guilty', that's when these things happen. ""And that's when people say, she should have been more careful. ""So it's really tough, because I think it's an attitude that's really built into society."" Shy can remember a few instances when she has felt scared walking in public on her own. Two days ago, for example, on a lunchtime walk. ""I went past a couple of guys and I had my headphones on. ""I heard them make comments and I heard them say something like, 'oi, come over here.' I just ignored it carried on walking. ""And they said it again: 'Come over here, hey, I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you.' ""That is wrong. Because if you're trying to get someone's attention, and she's not acknowledging you, she's ignoring you. You need to back off. ""If this had happened during the evening with headphones in, would someone say to me, 'oh, you shouldn't have your headphones in'? Or that I shouldn't have gone down that road?"" Shy says being the same age as Sarah - 33 - meant the story hit closer to home ""I want to make something very clear, I'm not saying every man is the problem. I do not think that at all,"" says Shy. But, she says, she's already started making precautions for when she can go out more as lockdown restrictions ease. ""I was on the phone to my friend this morning. And we were already googling different apps that we can put on our phone in case of emergencies. We've got an agreement where we will be on the phone to each other anyway."" Shy lives in Birmingham and says the case of Sarah Everard has resonated across the country. ""I travel for work, so I go all over the country pretty much. I don't think it's a London issue. I don't think it's a Birmingham issue. I think it's an overall issue.""

How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching,"Posters of Sarah Everard were shared widely ""Missing: Please Help Our dear friend Sarah Everard,"" read the posters that went up on south London streets and local social media forums in the days after the 33-year-old disappeared on her walk home in early March. It was concerning but such appeals are not exactly a rare sight, and the hope was that she would soon turn up safe and sound. But in the days that followed, as police put out a CCTV image of Sarah and gave details of her last known movements, concern grew to alarm, then dread, then fear, shock and sadness. Sarah Everard's journey from Clapham Common to Brixton had taken her through some of the capital's most populated, brightly-lit, and well-walked parts. Hundreds of people - many of them young women - tread those pavements every day and consider the streets in and around them home. As the police investigation ramped up, local women were warned to be careful about venturing out alone. When a police officer was arrested - and subsequently charged with Sarah's murder - the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick acknowledged that women in London and beyond ""will be worried and may well be feeling scared"", although she said for a woman to be abducted off the street was an ""incredibly rare"" event. Sarah Everard disappeared while walking along a busy road But the case had touched a nerve, particularly as walking is one of the few activities to have been allowed during Britain's coronavirus lockdown. Women across the country took to social media to discuss their own experiences of walking the streets and the lengths they went to to feel safe.Out poured stories of being followed, harassed, catcalled, assaulted and exposed to. Helena Wadia was one of those. She told BBC Radio 5 Live she wanted to highlight how common it was for women to feel unsafe. ""The first time I was catcalled I think I was about 12 years old,"" she said. ""I have been self-policing since then. We moderate everything - our clothing, our drinking. We get taxis where maybe we can't afford it. We hold keys between our fingers. We don't wear headphones when we're jogging. We stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting."" One tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces was liked more than 120,000 times. People even began sharing tips on what apps were out thereto help women stay safe. Flowers and messages have been lain in Clapham Common Anna Birley is one of many people in recent days to have underlined that the narrative around women's safety must change. ""What's so upsetting is it shouldn't be our problem,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's not our fault. Women aren't the reason women get attacked."" A vigil she helped plan at Clapham Common - one of several around the country - as a way of ""reclaiming our public spaces and coming together to feel a level of solidarity"" in itself became controversial when it resulted inclashes with police and women were seen being physically restrained. Several hundred people had turned up despite being told it had to be cancelled because it breached lockdown restrictions. The organisers had criticised the police for failing to ""constructively engage"" with them on efforts to make the event Covid-safe, instead of urging mourners to hold candle-lit vigils at home. The Metropolitan Police defended their actions at the Clapham vigil. They said they ""were placed in this position because of the overriding need to protect people's safety"", but have faced intense criticism from across the political spectrum. On International Women's Day every year, British MP Jess Phillips reads out the names of all the women and girls killed over the previous 12 months, where a man has been convicted or charged as the main perpetrator. This video can not be played Jess Phillips lists all women killed in the UK over the last year where a man has been convicted or charged. This year it fell on the day remains were found in the hunt for Sarah Everard, and she read out 118 names. ""Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives,"" Ms Phillips told Parliament. ""Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common."" How many attacks on UK women are there? In a separate debate in the Lords, Parliament's upper chamber, Baroness Jenny Jones of Moulescoomb called for an 18:00 curfew for men on the streets. She later told Sky News that while she hadn't been ""entirely serious"", she wanted to make the point that ""when the police victim-blame by asking women to stay home, we don't react. We just think it's normal."" So what has been the response of men? As women took to social media to tell their stories, Stuart Edwards, who lives five minutes away from where Sarah went missing,tweeted,external: ""Aside from giving as much space as possible on quieter streets and keeping face visible, is there anything else men can reasonably do to reduce the anxiety/spook factor?"" The tweet received 27,000 likes and more than 3,000 retweets. Among those who joined the conversation was food critic Jay Rayner, who also lives in south London. ""If I find myself walking behind a single woman on a quiet street I always cross the road to the other side and ideally accelerate away as quickly as possible. I am a big man and absolutely aware what my silhouette looks like in the darkness,"" he tweeted. Some however have been keen to point out that it's a tiny minority of men who are attackers - using the hashtag #NotAllMen. But the issue of violence against women is not one for the UK alone. The World Health Organization this week published a report sayingone in three women globally, around 736 million, had been subjected to physical or sexual violence in their lifetimes. WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said violence against women was ""endemic in every country and culture"", and had been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. ""Unlike Covid-19, violence against women cannot be stopped with a vaccine,"" he said, as the WHO called for more investment in services to help vulnerable women.

The sisters calling out catcalling,"Maya Tutton and her sister Gemma campaign against street harassment The case of Sarah Everard has prompted many women to share their experiences of feeling unsafe while walking the streets. As the 33-year-old was last seen walking home in the dark from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, it has sparked discussion on social media about the precautions women are taking when they go out alone - from not wearing headphones to telling friends where they are going. But how can we help women feel safer without them having to change their own behaviour? Sarah Everard vigil planned as women share concerns One in three women are subjected to violence - WHO 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' How many attacks on women are there? Maya Tutton, 22, says that her first experience of street harassment was when she was still at school, recalling: ""I remember one particular incident when I was 14 and several men pulled up next to me with two friends and they made some of the most sexually threatening comments I had heard in my life. ""And I remember just being so scared and never feeling the same way in public spaces again."" But it was her younger sister Gemma's experiences that pushed her to take action. ""At the age of 11 she was out on a summer day and a man pulled up and shouted horrible sexual comments about her body and her legs and she came back to me and she spoke to me about it,"" she says. ""And I had to explain to her firstly that this had become a normal part of being a girl - that this was unremarkable somehow and that this probably wouldn't be the only incident. And on top of that, this probably wouldn't be the worst incident."" This video can not be played Maya and Gemma want public sexual harassment to be a criminal offence Two years ago the pair, who live in south-east England, founded Our Streets Now, which campaigns for public sexual harassment to be a criminal offence as well as for the issue to be part of the secondary school curriculum. The group has also created free lesson plans and resources for teachers to educate girls - and boys - about public sexual harassment. Engaging boys and men is crucial, Maya says, adding: ""We cannot continue to place the onus on the victim's shoulders."" When women are told to change their behaviour to stay safe, perpetrators are still a danger to others, she explains. ""The onus should never be on us to change things,"" Maya says. ""We're not tackling the root and the root is male violence."" Chris Green founded White Ribbon UK, which works to end male violence against women The importance of men in tackling violence against women is also central to the work of the White Ribbon UK charity. ""It is men's responsibility to challenge other men and ourselves in our behaviours,"" says founder Chris Green. The global movement began in Canada in the 1990s and works to engage men and boys across society to make a stand on the issue. ""It is a pledge never to commit the violence, never to excuse the violence and never to remain silent about the epidemic levels of violence in our society,"" Chris, 67, explains. The charity works with organisations including schools, councils, police forces and universities to provide resources to raise awareness and educate men about violence against women. Chris noticed there was a ""groundswell"" of reaction on social media from women since the Sarah Everard case started being talked about - with some asking why more men weren't ""shouting about"" the issue of women's safety. ""It just says to me we should be doing more,"" he adds. Kerry Lindeque is campaigning for parks in Sheffield to have better lighting In Sheffield, Our Bodies Our Streets campaigns on practical ways to help women feel safer. A petition launched by the group earlier this year, calling for the council to improve lighting in the city's parks, has attracted more than 3,000 signatures. Kerry Lindeque, a member of the group who is studying at the University of Sheffield, says: ""Everybody has the right to exercise and everybody should have the right to go for a walk, especially in lockdown because it's so important and has such a big impact on our mental health. ""But as soon as it gets dark a lot of women don't feel safe on the streets because you have people stalking you, you have people catcalling you, you have cars driving slowly past you."" She said that those who decide to go into parks to avoid those slow-driving cars then don't feel the parks are particularly safe either. The group have also created anonline map,external, documenting people's experiences of harassment in Sheffield. Kerry, 20, says the aim is to ""validate"" people's experiences so they feel listened to, as well as to highlight the extent of the problem. Farah Benis founded the Catcalls of London Instagram page More than 10,000 people have also shared their experiences of harassment with theCatcalls of London Instagram page,external, which writes examples of catcalling in chalk on the streets where they happened. The movement first started in the New York and has spread to cities around the world, including London, where an account was started by Farah Benis three years ago. The 34-year-old says she was inspired by her own experiences of harassment from the age of 11 and ""the fact that every single woman I know has experienced it in some form multiple times"". ""I wanted to scream about it and I founded Catcalls of London instead."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"Mobile hairdressers 'confused about reopening'Hairdressers will reopen in Wales, but mobile stylists are unsure if they can also get back to work.Wales","Mobile hairdresser Antonia Sparkles has started a petition over the ""lack of clarity"" We can wave goodbye to our lockdown locks from Monday - but mobile stylists say they remain in the dark on whether they can pick up the scissors again. On Friday, the Welsh Government saidall hairdressers, including mobile salons, could reopen. But the Nation Hair & Beauty Federation (NHBF) said it had been told mobile stylists ""might not be able to resume"". The Welsh Government said they could work only ""where the client physically cannot leave the home"". The latest guidelines state mobile hairdressers can visit people's homes if ""leaving the home is likely to have a significant detrimental effect on their wellbeing"". But the NHBF said the guidance was not clear and it was ""seeking clarity to understand when mobile services will be able to fully resume"". Welsh hairdressers to reopen but retail stays shut Third of people in Wales have had first Covid jab How are the lockdown rules changing across the UK? Mobile hairdresser Antonia Sparkles, 32, from Pencoed, Bridgend, said she does not understand the rules. ""It should only be a yes or no, with clear instructions on what services we can do,"" she said. ""I feel a bit confused. I know three people who can't leave the house physically - that is not going to pay my bills. ""In the last hour I've had more confused clients saying I'm allowed back - it's more stress. I'm telling clients there's no answer yet, it's not clear."" Ms Sparkles said she was eager to get back to work, not only for financial reasons but also for her and her clients' mental wellbeing. ""It was emotional for me [to get back to work] because I haven't seen anybody, so for me it's such a good thing to get a routine. I had to go on antidepressants for my insomnia... because I've been worried,"" she said. ""I suffer really badly with anxiety and depression. We need to go back to work not just for the money - it's a part of our routine. ""It's good when you do someone's hair and they smile because they feel better. A lot of my clients live alone too and we can have a little chat."" This video can not be played Visiting the hairdresser and meeting friends in your garden are among lockdown rules being relaxed After the initial announcement on Friday, she spent all night doing a stock take and putting in orders, before a few hours later, her plans were halted again. In response, Ms Sparkles decided to set up a petition calling for greater clarity on the rules for mobile stylists. ""I was just sat here thinking there's so many people struggling in the pandemic anyway. Loads of people have lost their salons, so more have gone mobile, so this affects more people,"" she said. ""I don't see what the difference is between a salon and a mobile hairdresser because you've got more people in a salon than when you go to a house, you're all wearing PPE. ""What's upset me is they've divided us into two, saying a mobile hairdresser and a salon aren't the same. But we've always been classified as the same. It's just making people more frustrated."" Before visiting clients, Ms Sparkles said she takes a range of Covid precautions. ""I send them questions the night before, asking have they had a temperature, have they been abroad, if they have had a test, have they had the results back?"" she said. ""I go in with a surgical mask, I wear a visor. I wipe down the area where I'm working and have a new gown for each client. I was worried about trying to protect everybody. ""After I've gone into a house, I sweep the hair up, take the hair in a bag and then dispose of it - I pay to have that disposed of."" The Welsh Government has responded to the concerns from a legal perspective. ""There are many circumstances in which people might need to access someone's home to carry out work there,"" a spokeswoman said.

Army of volunteers restore lost photos after tsunami," By Celia Hatton By Celia Hatton After the most powerful earthquake in Japan’s history rocked its eastern coast, triggering a series of towering tsunami waves, Tomomi Shida searched the primary school she worked in, looking for her students. Tomomi was an hour away from her home in the seaside town of Ofunato. She had no way to get there - no idea if her own family had survived.“The only way to get information was over the radio. I heard that Ofunato had been obliterated. This was the first time I understood that the place where I lived no longer existed,” she remembers. She didn’t know it at the time, but almost 16,000 people were killed in the March  2011 disaster. Many of their bodies have never been found. It took the 48-year-old several days to locate her teenage boys and her elderly mother-in-law. And then she had to find her husband - a volunteer firefighter whose job it was to close the town’s tsunami gates. Miraculously, he was alive. “We hugged and we cried,” Tomomi remembers. But only a footprint of their house remained and almost everything they valued was gone. Or so they thought. Several weeks later, one precious possession re-emerged. “Someone from the fire brigade recognised my husband’s face in a photo,” Tomomi explains. It had been sticking out of a pile of waste; a sudden reminder of ordinary times amid the endless stretch of muddy debris. It was a simple photo studio portrait, taken when the boys were still young, posing with perfect bowl haircuts and chubby cheeks - in fact, a few copies of the same photo were found. Those images instantly became the family’s most valuable possession - a memory of a simpler, happier time, a time that could never be photographed again. But all of them were damaged. Tomomi’s eye was wiped off in one, her husband’s features were missing in another. As the Shida family was realising what they had lost and found, their experience was being replicated up and down Japan’s east coast. Two weeks after the tsunami, the Japanese rescuers looking for missing people received orders to also salvage photographs. At the end of each street corner, they placed all the photo albums and framed photos they could find inside plastic crates. Most were covered in mud and had been blurred by water. They had been located but they hadn’t yet been saved. Yuichi Itabashi, a chemical engineer by training, was watching the horrors of the tsunami zone safely from his house in Tokyo. But what he saw made him realise he could help. “A few weeks after the tsunami, there was a television news report that showed some people in the tsunami area trying to clean their photos. I saw they were washing them roughly,” he says with a shudder. At the time, Yuichi worked for Fujifilm, one of Japan’s oldest camera companies. He was in charge of their photo imaging division — the part of the company that had made a lot of the photographic paper he was watching survivors clean on TV. “Someone said they were gathering the photos in every town. I thought we needed to go there. Though, to be honest, we didn’t really know how to clean photos either,” he admits. But he did know that those people were in danger of destroying the things they were trying to protect. He worked with his colleagues to recreate tsunami conditions over a couple of days, applying seawater and mud to photos to mimic the damage. Then, they figured out how to make the photos whole again. They had to work quickly. Calls were coming in to Fujifilm from up and down the coast asking how to save photographs. Without telling his company, Yuichi rented an electric car, fearing he wouldn’t be able to find working petrol stations. Accompanied by two colleagues,  he drove into the tsunami zone. They wanted to track down the group of people they’d seen on TV, to show them how photos should be cleaned so they wouldn’t be ruined. “We thought the survivors needed water, food and a place to sleep, but what comes second? Not money. The survivors said they needed their photos. “Houses, cars and clothing can be bought again when we make money. But it’s impossible to buy those memories.” The clock started ticking on those memories as soon as salt water hit family homes, drenching photo albums and portraits hanging on walls. Photos can last about 72 hours if they’re wet, but after that, the gelatine that holds the image onto the photo paper starts absorbing water. Micro-organisms start eating away at the gelatine and mould grows, making the image brown and blurry. For decades, Japan has nurtured its love affair with photography. “Since the 1960s, every family has had a camera,“ says photo conservationist Yoko Shiraiwa.  “So every family probably had photograph albums in their houses.” Now, of course, photographs are usually taken on digital cameras and often instantly saved into cloud storage. But there’s an enduring power to photographic prints, to photos that take up physical space. In the tsunami, Yoko says, everything that was stored on hard disk drives, memory sticks and CDs was lost. In normal times, Yoko works for museums and private collectors, trying to extend the lives of priceless historical objects. Right after the disaster, she watched the same news reports as Yuichi which showed survivors who were cleaning muddy photographs. She too understood that there was only a small amount of time before the wet photos would disintegrate. Discarding the complicated methods she normally uses to clean photos, she also developed a simple cleaning method using water and raced to the tsunami zone to pitch in. Every town along the coast appeared to have the same idea: when there were no more bodies to pull from the wreckage, they pulled photos. Volunteers called themselves the Memory Hunters. As the communication lines were re-established, volunteers across the region realised they had all become Memory Hunters. They were bound together by the same comforting activity. “Rescuing photos, washing them, or trying to find their owners, all these activities united people,” Yoko says. At that point, Japan’s traditional appreciation for photos combined neatly with a culture that places a special importance on returning objects to their rightful owners. In Tokyo, for example, the police say that 80% of lost mobile phones are returned and more than 60% of wallets — often within the same day. At first, it was thought that the photos were being saved so that those who were missing after the tsunami could reclaim them. But as the death toll grew, and it became clear that those who were missing probably wouldn’t return, the project became a way for those left behind to hold onto the memories of those who were gone. Volunteers formed surprisingly efficient assembly lines - painstakingly cleaning the waterlogged, mud-caked photos, and pegging them up to dry inside small tents. Yuichi urged Fujifilm to make simple advertisements that would reach people across the tsunami zone, explaining that photos could be saved if they were washed in the right way. Other companies pitched in too, as corporations tried to find ways they might be able to help. A national effort was born. That effort soon included overseas volunteers too. Becci Manson, originally from northern England, was working in New York when the tsunami struck. As one of the world’s top photo retouchers, Becci had forged a career working on fashion and advertising photographs by the likes of Rankin and Annie Leibowitz. But she put that work on hold to pitch in as a volunteer with the disaster relief charity, All Hands and Hearts. Two months after the tsunami, she was on the ground in Rikuzentakata, not far from where Tomomi Shida’s house once stood. Initially she was just expecting to lend muscle as an ordinary volunteer. “We dug the mud out of people’s homes or helped clear the rubble from their land. We cleaned a factory which had fish in storage when the tsunami hit. They were just sitting there, in the dock area, rotting in the sun.” Everything changed for Becci the day she went to help clean up an onsen - a Japanese bathing house. When she arrived, she saw that it was doubling as the storage site for thousands of salvaged photographs which had been stuffed in plastic bags. They, too, were rotting. “It was one of those eye-opening moments,” Becci says, when she saw some survivors crying after seeing their photos had been damaged. Instantly, she realised that she had the perfect skill set to step in and fix them. She issued a call to other professional retouchers she knew, asking them to pitch in. Within weeks she had 500 people from Sweden to New York lined up, ready to smooth over the smeared photographs and to make them look new again. A thousand volunteers on the ground worked on site to clean the photos too. It was rewarding work, but it came with huge pressures as well. “The drivers working with the volunteers would come in and look through the photos that had been cleaned because they were local guys,” Becci says. “One guy noticed his friend in the pictures with the friend’s twin daughters. The girls were less than one year old when the tsunami hit and they lost one of the daughters. So we dug through and found as many photos as we could of the kids so they could have them.” The stories mounted. One woman lost all her relatives and was left with nothing but seven photos from a school trip. Another photo, featuring a girl’s elaborate kimono, needed to be almost entirely rebuilt. The whole process took days, with one retoucher painstakingly copying the embroidered design from a similar image so he could be certain it would be accurate. Whereas Becci’s professional career involved “making the perfect even more perfect”, her biggest challenge with the Japanese photos “was to restore the photos to how they were meant to be. You don’t want to destroy the memory for someone by ruining a picture in some way”. One day Tomomi Shida, the survivor from the obliterated town of Ofunato, came to see Becci. She brought the family portrait that had been salvaged, the one with her husband and two boys. “We used different pieces from her photos to create a whole one,” Becci says, still marvelling at what a technically difficult fix that was. “We gave the finished photo back to her on her son’s birthday and I remember she was so happy, she cried. It was the one thing her son could hold onto that wasn’t new, and had existed before the tsunami took everything.” The photo hangs in the bedroom Tomomi shares with her husband now. “I had given up,” she remembers, “I thought the complete photograph was something that was already gone but then it came back to me. “I lost all my belongings but I still have a record of my children’s growth."" Photo cleaning projects continued along the coast. In the city of Rikuzentakata, where Becci’s time in Japan was coming to an end, the cleaned photographs were beginning to pile up. That presented a new organisational hurdle: matching photos with their owners. The project was growing in scope. Unclaimed personal objects, like school backpacks and artworks, were also being salvaged and cleaned in hopes that they, too, would be reclaimed. It was clear that someone efficient needed to take control. Enter Mari Akiyama, a disaster agency worker tasked with managing the project's next phase. “Once we had washed the photographs, we put them into albums,"" she says. ""We began to show people what we had.” These first events were simple affairs: albums and individual photos were spread out on the ground on blue plastic sheets. The process continues 10 years on, and Mari still leads it. But now, the system is much more sophisticated: Mari is in charge of a well-organised library of lost things, known as the Sanriku Archive Disaster Mitigation Center. The collected objects have been carefully sorted into groups — school diplomas on one shelf, wooden sculptures on another. Some are wrapped in cellophane. It looks a bit like a shop until it becomes clear that the owners of many of the objects might have died 10 years ago. It’s also possible the object's owners are still alive and simply haven’t realised their belongings are still waiting to be reclaimed. “We don’t actually know what these photos or objects mean to people,” Mari explains. “The items only gain value when they’re returned to the people who might cherish them, who understand their original brilliance.” Once a month, the centre creates pamphlets displaying some of the orphaned photos and objects, distributing them in doctors’ offices and hair salons, hoping they’ll be identified. Sometimes Mari and her colleagues will take a slew of photos to Tokyo, where many of the survivors have relocated, and they’ll hold a mass viewing event there. “There are many people who return again and again, especially in Tokyo,” Mari says. “There are some cases where a body has never been found, so the survivors are trying to find even one or two belongings of the deceased. One woman sifted through random photos for nine years until she found a single image of her missing husband. Another family lived in a trailer beside the centre for days in hopes of finding something familiar. Another time, an 80-year-old woman spotted a tiny photograph from her school days. She lit up when she saw the photo, Mari says, and suddenly started to recall school trips, and the teachers she’d known decades before. And then, there are the people who simply can’t bear to look. Not yet. For them, Mari acts as a guardian of sorts. “Whenever we’re mentioned on the television, there are people who call in straight away to tell us they’re still struggling,” she quietly explains. “Those people say that on the surface, they’re smiling, but actually they cry every day. They’re not comfortable looking at the photographs yet, so they ask us to hold on until they’re ready.” But the centre is in danger. The city council has told them they’re probably going to lose their funding, so Mari has been forced to solicit donations to keep the Sanriku Archive open. She’s returned about 200,000 photos so far, but there are still 186,000 unclaimed pictures and more than a million objects in the library. In other cities, photo centres have already closed their doors. In keeping with Japanese tradition, all the saved photographs are taken to a shrine and burned. “They’re given back to the dead,” Yuichi, the former manager from Fujifilm, explains. Still, the drive to save photos, to clean them and to return them to their rightful owners continues. When Becci Manson returned to the US, she was asked to start photo rescue projects after several major US storms. But one thing that struck her after the tsunami project was how much the photos helped people who were suffering with mental health issues after the disaster. Family photos are different from almost everything else. They have an emotional pull that can’t be matched, especially after something terrible has suddenly taken people away. Becci says the subsequent suicides by survivors of the disaster shows how crucial it was to take mental health seriously. “People started mentioning the photographs over and over again,"" she says.  ""Having the photos helped them to get back some sense of their history and their normality.” The photographs that were carefully washed and fixed are now, in turn, helping their owners to become whole again.

Child's bid to stop plastic toys in magazines,"Skye is concerned about the impact of plastic on the environment A 10-year-old girl is campaigning to stop plastic toys being included in children's magazines amid concerns about the impact on climate change. Skye, from Gwynedd, launched a petition after becoming fed up with being sent ""cheap plastic rubbish"" with her favourite magazine. She was concerned the toys were creating a large carbon footprint and ending up in landfill. The Welsh Government said her bid could help Wales to become waste free. It comes afterBurger King stopped including plastic toys in their children's mealsand McDonald's gave children options of books with Happy Meals, after a campaign by two sisters. Skye, who often litter picks in her village near Fairbourne, wrote to publishers to urge them to stop using single-use plastic in one of her favourite magazines Horrible Histories. ""It's utter rubbish,"" she said, ""it not only comes in a plastic bag, it has plastic blister packaging and there are the free gifts."" Skye said many of the plastic toys, were ""pointless"", including a skeleton pen, which ""you can't even write with"", a rubber tongue, brain, rats, maggots or slime that breaks. Skye said many children's magazines came with toys which could not be recycled In a response to her letter, Kennedy Publishers, said they were ""working very hard to make their magazines environmentally friendly"", and the magazines were made from paper from sustainable forests, while the packaging was made using recyclable materials. It said the plastic toys were recyclable in ""some areas"" and were an important part of the magazine and not intended for single use. But Skye said she would like to see the toys removed altogether and all magazines made from paper, unwrapped or wrapped in paper, to reduce excess packaging. ""If you saw it in a toy department you wouldn't buy it,"" said Skye, who keeps the toys in a box to show people how many she is sent, rather than throwing them away. Covid-19: Single-use plastic impact 'will last forever' Climate Change: Wales could be 'first deforestation free nation' Lockdown online shopping sees recycling increase in Wales ""I've got gazillions of fake teeth and rubber maggots... they're not good for playing a prank, they don't look real. I've had three pots of slime and it's rubbish, it breaks."" Peppa Pig, LOL Dolls, My Little Pony and Mr Men are just some of the children's magazines which often come with free plastic toys. ""These toys will be made in China, wrapped in plastic, put on a pallet wrapped in more plastic, sent across the world, unwrapped, stuck on a magazine and covered in more plastic, and then shipped to houses,"" Skye said. ""The carbon footprint is big and you are putting it straight in the bin to pollute the planet."" Skye's campaign has been supported by politicians, Surfers Against Sewage and Kids Against Plastic Skye's father Dave, a postman, said he was also concerned about the amount of plastic wrapping used on magazines aimed at adults which he delivers on his rounds. ""I just remember Skye getting this [magazine] through the doors and she said ""that's it"" and then writing to the publisher,"" he said. ""We try to recycle everything we can... if we see litter we pick it up. We just want the publishers to do their bit."" This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough says the response to plastic pollution has been encouraging After her petition calling for the toys to be scrapped attracted almost 3,000 signatures, politicians have stepped in to help and her campaign has been raised in Parliament. Skye is now preparing to write to every school in Wales to highlight the issue. Welsh Government minister Eluned Morgan has written to magazine publishers, while Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville-Roberts raised the matter in the House of Commons. ""These toys are marketed at children, whose environmental future we are trying to protect,"" said Ms Morgan. ""Some plastics can last decades - if not centuries - in our environment. They should be environmentally friendly and serve an educational purpose."" This video can not be played Fairbourne residents say they could become ""climate change refugees"" Ms Morgan said the campaign was especially ""poignant"", coming from a child living in a coastal community threatened by climate change. Sea defences at Fairbourne will stop being maintained in the 2050s and Gwynedd council has said it may begin moving out villagers before then. The Welsh Government has committed to ""phasing out unnecessary single-use items, especially plastic"", in a bid to become azero waste nation by 2050. A spokesperson said: ""Young people like Skye can help to change attitudes, so we can all start making the changes needed for us to reach our goal of becoming a zero waste nation by 2050. ""We are also working alongside other administrations in the UK - including the UK government - on proposed reforms for extended producer responsibility (EPR), under which packaging producers would be required to pay net costs for managing any plastic waste they create. ""This would include plastic wrapping used to package magazines."" Kennedy Publishers were asked to comment.

'Private remembrance' on Dunblane 25th anniversary,"Floral tributes left at the memorial fountain at Dunblane Cemetery The 25th anniversary of the Dunblane tragedy is being marked privately by residents of the town this weekend. Church services in memory of the victims are being held online due to Covid lockdown restrictions. Teacher Gwen Mayor and 16 children were murdered by gunman Thomas Hamilton when he opened fire at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996. In a tribute, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the victims were ""forever in our hearts"". Rev Colin Renwick, of Dunblane Cathedral, said people in the town will remember the events ""quietly, privately and with respect for those who lost their lives"".

""As is the case every year, the people lost, and those affected most profoundly, will be remembered in prayers in churches throughout the community."" Prayers for the victims and their families will be heard during Dunblane Cathedral's online service on Sunday. The stained glassed memorial window at St Blane's church in Dunblane Dunblane's Holy Family Church is streaming an online mass in memory of the victims on Saturday evening. Canon Basil O'Sullivan said: ""My thoughts and prayers continue to be with those who suffered and lost so much 25 years ago.""

Virtual and doorstep vigils held for Sarah Everard,"People held candles on Saturday evening on Clapham Common, where an official vigil was cancelled The prime minister and the Duchess of Cambridge are among those to pay tribute to Sarah Everard as virtual and doorstep vigils are held across the UK. Boris Johnson said he and his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, will join others in lighting a candle for the 33-year-old at 21:30 GMT. Planned evening vigils were called off because of Covid restrictions, but hundreds gathered at Clapham Common. It led to confrontation with the police who tweeted that it was ""unsafe"". Lambeth police tweeted:,external""The gathering at #ClaphamCommon is unsafe. Hundreds of people are tightly packed together in breach of the regulations and risking public health. ""We are urging people to go home and we thank those who have been engaging with officers and who are leaving."" This video can not be played People gathered to pay tribute to Sarah Everard following her death in March Earlier, Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with her kidnap and murder. The organisers of a vigil in Clapham, south London, said earlier they were cancelling the event because police did not ""constructively engage"" with plans. Reclaim These Streets asked people not to gather at Clapham Common, adding that doing so might put people ""legally at risk"". They asked people to shine a light to coincide with the time Ms Everard was last seen on 3 March. However, Sisters Uncut, which campaigns to prevent violence against women, said it planned to attend the Clapham vigil despite the organisers' cancellation. Hundreds of women and men rallied at the bandstand as night fell, and there was some confrontation between them and the police. One video posted online showed officers removing and leading away those women who were stood within the bandstand. Cries of ""shame on you"" and ""let them go"" could be heard from onlookers. The video showed them being put in a police van and driven away. Sisters Uncut alleged in a tweet that ""male police officers waited for the sun to set before they started grabbing and manhandling women in the crowd"". This tweet has now been deleted. Ms Everard's death has prompted women to share their own experiences, and a public debate over their safety. Mr Johnson tweeted,externalthat he will ""be thinking of her family and friends"" when lighting a candle, adding: ""I will do everything I can to make sure the streets are safe."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted a picture of a candle in her home, which she said was ""for Sarah"", while Wales's First Minister Mark Drakeford encouraged people to ""ignite a fire for change"". A memorial to Sarah Everard has been set up at Clapham Common's bandstand Throughout the day, people gathered at its bandstand to lay flowers and pay their respects throughout the day. It is understood that the Duchess of Cambridge wanted to pay her respects to Ms Everard and her family. During a virtual event hosted by Feminists of London, Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women's Equality Party, compared violence against women and girls to ""a form of domestic terrorism"", while TV presenter Sandi Toksvig said Ms Everard's death should be ""a turning point"". Home Secretary Priti Patel said almost 20,000 people had responded in 24 hours to a consultation on how the government could tackle violence against women and girls. Meanwhile, a fundraising page set up by Reclaim These Streets for women's charitable causes has reached its Â£320,000 target. On Friday, aHigh Court judge refused to intervene in the Reclaim These Streets' legal challengeover the right to gather to protest during Covid restrictions. How many attacks on women are there? Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? Reclaim These Streetstweeted,externalthat the group had ""repeatedly tried to find a way forward for the event"", including staggering start times and splitting the event into time slots, but the Met Police had been ""unwilling to commit to anything"". Anna Birley, of Reclaim These Streets, said holding the vigil would have put the group at ""massive"" legal risk for organising it, as well as risking women receiving fixed-penalty notices. Caitlin Prowle, another organiser, said they did not want to end up in a situation where they were having to raise funds to pay fines. Commander Catherine Roper, of the Met Police, said officers ""take no joy in this event being cancelled, but it is the right thing to do given the real and present threat of Covid-19"". People gathered in Nottingham on Saturday evening - as well as in Glasgow and Bristol Organisers for vigils due to be held across the UK, including in Edinburgh, Cardiff, Birmingham, Leeds, York, Sheffield and Brighton also cancelled events - with many holding virtual events instead. Those behind a cancelled event in Glasgow asked people totie ribbons and notes to trees and fences, a move which they said would be turned into a ""manifesto for change"" for real improvements in the lives and safety of all women. Organisers have urged people to stand on their doorsteps at 21:30 GMT - the time Ms Everard was last seen The Met Police said they ""take no joy"" in the vigil being cancelled but it was the ""right thing to do"" given the pandemic A police officer lays flowers left by members of the public at a site which is being searched in Kent Flowers were also laid in tribute to Ms Everard at Pittville Park in Cheltenham For almost a year the ambiguities and omissions within the coronavirus restrictions have left both the police and public grasping for answers. Gatherings in public are generally banned but, at the same time, the rules recognise there can be reasonable excuses to be outside. The problem is that the law doesn't specify whether a demonstration on a major issue of public importance - such as this vigil - is one of those excuses or not. Police officers must enforce the lockdown laws and they have been under pressure from ministers to do more to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. But they also know that the right to protest is enshrined in the Human Rights Act, a cornerstone of our complex constitution. That means they can't just impose a blanket ban on all protests under the coronavirus restrictions - and the judge in Friday's case urged both sides to keep talking. In the absence of further legal clarity, the police maintained their position that the balance came down in favour of preventing a gathering, rather than allowing an exception to mark a very exceptional and tragic death. In the ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Holgate refused an application by Reclaim These Streets for the High Court to make ""an interim declaration"" that any ban on outdoor gatherings under Covid rules was ""subject to the right to protest"". The judge also refused to make a declaration that an alleged policy by the Met Police of ""prohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances"" was unlawful. Labour's Harriet Harman, who chairs the Joint Committee on Human Rights, said the law on freedom of association amid the coronavirus pandemic should be clarified because a ""blanket ban... was not the right way to go"". ""The relationship between the Human Rights Act and its protection of freedom of association and the new Covid regulations has not been clearly spelt out,"" she said. This video can not be played Caitlin Prowle from Reclaim These Streets says attention should turn to issues such as criminal justice and charity funding Labour MP Apsana Begum said ""our fundamental right to protest is under attack"" and the government was proposing to strengthen its powers on protests via thePolice, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill,externalon Monday. Liberal Democrats deputy leader Daisy Coopertweeted,external: ""It is the Govt's responsibility to ensure people can protest safely."" Senior Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, who had previously said she asked Home Secretary Priti Patel to ""step in"" and allow the vigil to go ahead, said she hoped people would now take the advice of organisers to gather virtually instead to ""recognise the ongoing issue there is with violence against women and girls, perpetrated by men"".

Met officer in court over Sarah Everard death,"Wayne Couzens spoke only to confirm his name and address during the brief hearing A Metropolitan Police officer has appeared in court charged with the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard. Wayne Couzens, 48, was arrested on Tuesday after the 33-year-old disappeared when walking home to Brixton from Clapham in south London last week. Ms Everard's body was found in an area of woodland in Ashford, Kent, Westminster Magistrates Court heard. Mr Couzens wore a grey tracksuit as he appeared for the brief hearing. He appeared to have a red wound on his head and spoke quietly when asked to confirm his name, date of birth and address. Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring remanded him in custody to appear again at the Old Bailey on 16 March. Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" The court heard the officer, of Deal, Kent, is accused of kidnapping Ms Everard in the Poynders Road area of Clapham. Prosecutor Zoe Martin said Ms Everard was reported missing by her boyfriend on 4 March. She had visited a friend in the Clapham Junction area on 3 March and left at around 21:00 to make what was roughly a 2.5 mile (4 km) journey home. She called her boyfriend for around 14 minutes, and was seen alone on CCTV at 21:15 GMT and again on a camera at 21:28, Ms Martin said. Her body was found on Wednesday inside a builder's bag and later identified through the use of dental records, the hearing was told. A post-mortem examination has taken place but no cause of death was given in court. A marquee has been set up as police continue their search near Great Chart, Kent Mr Couzens joined the Metropolitan Police in 2018, most recently serving in the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, an armed unit responsible for guarding the Parliamentary estate and embassies in London. His main job was uniformed patrol of diplomatic buildings and Scotland Yard said he was not on duty at the time of Ms Everard's disappearance. He was taken to hospital for a second time in 48 hours on Friday for treatment to another head injury suffered in custody, before he was discharged and returned to a police station. Wayne Couzens joined the Metropolitan Police in 2018 Mr Couzens was previously treated in hospital for a separate head wound on Thursday, also sustained in custody when he was alone in his cell. Meanwhile, police in dry suits were seen continuing to search around the area where Ms Everard's body was found near Ashford.

The young sisters standing up to call out catcalling,"Maya Tutton and her sister Gemma campaign against street harassment The case of Sarah Everard has prompted many women to share their experiences of feeling unsafe while walking the streets. As the 33-year-old was last seen walking home in the dark from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, it has sparked discussion on social media about the precautions women are taking when they go out alone - from not wearing headphones to telling friends where they are going. But how can we help women feel safer without them having to change their own behaviour? Sarah Everard vigil planned as women share concerns One in three women are subjected to violence - WHO 'We have learned nobody is going to protect us' How many attacks on women are there? Maya Tutton, 22, says that her first experience of street harassment was when she was still at school, recalling: ""I remember one particular incident when I was 14 and several men pulled up next to me with two friends and they made some of the most sexually threatening comments I had heard in my life. ""And I remember just being so scared and never feeling the same way in public spaces again."" But it was her younger sister Gemma's experiences that pushed her to take action. ""At the age of 11 she was out on a summer day and a man pulled up and shouted horrible sexual comments about her body and her legs and she came back to me and she spoke to me about it,"" she says. ""And I had to explain to her firstly that this had become a normal part of being a girl - that this was unremarkable somehow and that this probably wouldn't be the only incident. And on top of that, this probably wouldn't be the worst incident."" This video can not be played Maya and Gemma want public sexual harassment to be a criminal offence Two years ago the pair, who live in south-east England, founded Our Streets Now, which campaigns for public sexual harassment to be a criminal offence as well as for the issue to be part of the secondary school curriculum. The group has also created free lesson plans and resources for teachers to educate girls - and boys - about public sexual harassment. Engaging boys and men is crucial, Maya says, adding: ""We cannot continue to place the onus on the victim's shoulders."" When women are told to change their behaviour to stay safe, perpetrators are still a danger to others, she explains. ""The onus should never be on us to change things,"" Maya says. ""We're not tackling the root and the root is male violence."" Chris Green founded White Ribbon UK, which works to end male violence against women The importance of men in tackling violence against women is also central to the work of the White Ribbon UK charity. ""It is men's responsibility to challenge other men and ourselves in our behaviours,"" says founder Chris Green. The global movement began in Canada in the 1990s and works to engage men and boys across society to make a stand on the issue. ""It is a pledge never to commit the violence, never to excuse the violence and never to remain silent about the epidemic levels of violence in our society,"" Chris, 67, explains. The charity works with organisations including schools, councils, police forces and universities to provide resources to raise awareness and educate men about violence against women. Chris noticed there was a ""groundswell"" of reaction on social media from women since the Sarah Everard case started being talked about - with some asking why more men weren't ""shouting about"" the issue of women's safety. ""It just says to me we should be doing more,"" he adds. Kerry Lindeque is campaigning for parks in Sheffield to have better lighting In Sheffield, Our Bodies Our Streets campaigns on practical ways to help women feel safer. A petition launched by the group earlier this year, calling for the council to improve lighting in the city's parks, has attracted more than 3,000 signatures. Kerry Lindeque, a member of the group who is studying at the University of Sheffield, says: ""Everybody has the right to exercise and everybody should have the right to go for a walk, especially in lockdown because it's so important and has such a big impact on our mental health. ""But as soon as it gets dark a lot of women don't feel safe on the streets because you have people stalking you, you have people catcalling you, you have cars driving slowly past you."" She said that those who decide to go into parks to avoid those slow-driving cars then don't feel the parks are particularly safe either. The group have also created anonline map,external, documenting people's experiences of harassment in Sheffield. Kerry, 20, says the aim is to ""validate"" people's experiences so they feel listened to, as well as to highlight the extent of the problem. Farah Benis founded the Catcalls of London Instagram page More than 10,000 people have also shared their experiences of harassment with theCatcalls of London Instagram page,external, which writes examples of catcalling in chalk on the streets where they happened. The movement first started in the New York and has spread to cities around the world, including London, where an account was started by Farah Benis three years ago. The 34-year-old says she was inspired by her own experiences of harassment from the age of 11 and ""the fact that every single woman I know has experienced it in some form multiple times"". ""I wanted to scream about it and I founded Catcalls of London instead."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"Italy tightens Covid restrictions amid 'new wave'Most shops, restaurants and schools will be closed on Monday as Coronavirus infections rise.Europe","Residents in Italy's ""red-zone"" regions will be required to stay home except for work, health or other essential reasons Shops, restaurants and schools will be closed across most of Italy on Monday, with PM Mario Draghi warning of a ""new wave"" of the coronavirus outbreak. For three days over Easter, 3-5 April, there will be a total shutdown. Italy, which one year ago imposed one of the first national lockdowns, is once again struggling to contain the rapid spread of infections. The country has reported more than 100,000 Covid-related deaths, Europe's second-highest tally after the UK. Italy's vaccination campaign has been hit by delays, as has been seen elsewhere in the European Union. Anglo-Swedish drug company AstraZeneca has announced a further shortfall in the amount of its vaccine it can supply to the European Union, blaming export restrictions imposed by some countries. It did not elaborate. In January, it announced a large cut in the 100m doses it had originally expected to deliver to the EU by March, sparking a public spat with European Commission. Last week the government in Rome blocked the export of 250,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia to address shortfalls of vaccines. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? No reason to stop using AstraZeneca jab - WHO Elsewhere, Bulgaria, Denmark and Norway have all paused the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine over fears it causes blood clots. The World Health Organization said on Friday there was no indication this was true,stressing that countries should not stop using the vaccine. From Monday, schools, shops and restaurants will shut in more than half of Italy, including the two most populous regions containing Rome and Milan. Residents will be required to stay at home except for work, health or other essential reasons. Shop and restaurants owners are bracing for a new financial hit The extra restrictions would last until Easter, Mr Draghi's office said, and over the Easter weekend the whole country would be turned into the high-risk ""red zone"". ""I'm aware that today's restrictions will have consequences on the education of your children, on the economy and on everyone's mental health,"" Mr Draghi said. ""But they're necessary to avoid a worsening of the situation that would require even stricter measures."" Cases have been rising across Italy for the past six weeks, exceeding 25,000 a day.

Army of volunteers restore lost photos after tsunamiThird of people in Wales have had first Covid jabThe breakdown of people being given a first dose in Wales.," By Celia Hatton By Celia Hatton After the most powerful earthquake in Japan’s history rocked its eastern coast, triggering a series of towering tsunami waves, Tomomi Shida searched the primary school she worked in, looking for her students. Tomomi was an hour away from her home in the seaside town of Ofunato. She had no way to get there - no idea if her own family had survived.“The only way to get information was over the radio. I heard that Ofunato had been obliterated. This was the first time I understood that the place where I lived no longer existed,” she remembers. She didn’t know it at the time, but almost 16,000 people were killed in the March  2011 disaster. Many of their bodies have never been found. It took the 48-year-old several days to locate her teenage boys and her elderly mother-in-law. And then she had to find her husband - a volunteer firefighter whose job it was to close the town’s tsunami gates. Miraculously, he was alive. “We hugged and we cried,” Tomomi remembers. But only a footprint of their house remained and almost everything they valued was gone. Or so they thought. Several weeks later, one precious possession re-emerged. “Someone from the fire brigade recognised my husband’s face in a photo,” Tomomi explains. It had been sticking out of a pile of waste; a sudden reminder of ordinary times amid the endless stretch of muddy debris. It was a simple photo studio portrait, taken when the boys were still young, posing with perfect bowl haircuts and chubby cheeks - in fact, a few copies of the same photo were found. Those images instantly became the family’s most valuable possession - a memory of a simpler, happier time, a time that could never be photographed again. But all of them were damaged. Tomomi’s eye was wiped off in one, her husband’s features were missing in another. As the Shida family was realising what they had lost and found, their experience was being replicated up and down Japan’s east coast. Two weeks after the tsunami, the Japanese rescuers looking for missing people received orders to also salvage photographs. At the end of each street corner, they placed all the photo albums and framed photos they could find inside plastic crates. Most were covered in mud and had been blurred by water. They had been located but they hadn’t yet been saved. Yuichi Itabashi, a chemical engineer by training, was watching the horrors of the tsunami zone safely from his house in Tokyo. But what he saw made him realise he could help. “A few weeks after the tsunami, there was a television news report that showed some people in the tsunami area trying to clean their photos. I saw they were washing them roughly,” he says with a shudder. At the time, Yuichi worked for Fujifilm, one of Japan’s oldest camera companies. He was in charge of their photo imaging division — the part of the company that had made a lot of the photographic paper he was watching survivors clean on TV. “Someone said they were gathering the photos in every town. I thought we needed to go there. Though, to be honest, we didn’t really know how to clean photos either,” he admits. But he did know that those people were in danger of destroying the things they were trying to protect. He worked with his colleagues to recreate tsunami conditions over a couple of days, applying seawater and mud to photos to mimic the damage. Then, they figured out how to make the photos whole again. They had to work quickly. Calls were coming in to Fujifilm from up and down the coast asking how to save photographs. Without telling his company, Yuichi rented an electric car, fearing he wouldn’t be able to find working petrol stations. Accompanied by two colleagues,  he drove into the tsunami zone. They wanted to track down the group of people they’d seen on TV, to show them how photos should be cleaned so they wouldn’t be ruined. “We thought the survivors needed water, food and a place to sleep, but what comes second? Not money. The survivors said they needed their photos. “Houses, cars and clothing can be bought again when we make money. But it’s impossible to buy those memories.” The clock started ticking on those memories as soon as salt water hit family homes, drenching photo albums and portraits hanging on walls. Photos can last about 72 hours if they’re wet, but after that, the gelatine that holds the image onto the photo paper starts absorbing water. Micro-organisms start eating away at the gelatine and mould grows, making the image brown and blurry. For decades, Japan has nurtured its love affair with photography. “Since the 1960s, every family has had a camera,“ says photo conservationist Yoko Shiraiwa.  “So every family probably had photograph albums in their houses.” Now, of course, photographs are usually taken on digital cameras and often instantly saved into cloud storage. But there’s an enduring power to photographic prints, to photos that take up physical space. In the tsunami, Yoko says, everything that was stored on hard disk drives, memory sticks and CDs was lost. In normal times, Yoko works for museums and private collectors, trying to extend the lives of priceless historical objects. Right after the disaster, she watched the same news reports as Yuichi which showed survivors who were cleaning muddy photographs. She too understood that there was only a small amount of time before the wet photos would disintegrate. Discarding the complicated methods she normally uses to clean photos, she also developed a simple cleaning method using water and raced to the tsunami zone to pitch in. Every town along the coast appeared to have the same idea: when there were no more bodies to pull from the wreckage, they pulled photos. Volunteers called themselves the Memory Hunters. As the communication lines were re-established, volunteers across the region realised they had all become Memory Hunters. They were bound together by the same comforting activity. “Rescuing photos, washing them, or trying to find their owners, all these activities united people,” Yoko says. At that point, Japan’s traditional appreciation for photos combined neatly with a culture that places a special importance on returning objects to their rightful owners. In Tokyo, for example, the police say that 80% of lost mobile phones are returned and more than 60% of wallets — often within the same day. At first, it was thought that the photos were being saved so that those who were missing after the tsunami could reclaim them. But as the death toll grew, and it became clear that those who were missing probably wouldn’t return, the project became a way for those left behind to hold onto the memories of those who were gone. Volunteers formed surprisingly efficient assembly lines - painstakingly cleaning the waterlogged, mud-caked photos, and pegging them up to dry inside small tents. Yuichi urged Fujifilm to make simple advertisements that would reach people across the tsunami zone, explaining that photos could be saved if they were washed in the right way. Other companies pitched in too, as corporations tried to find ways they might be able to help. A national effort was born. That effort soon included overseas volunteers too. Becci Manson, originally from northern England, was working in New York when the tsunami struck. As one of the world’s top photo retouchers, Becci had forged a career working on fashion and advertising photographs by the likes of Rankin and Annie Leibowitz. But she put that work on hold to pitch in as a volunteer with the disaster relief charity, All Hands and Hearts. Two months after the tsunami, she was on the ground in Rikuzentakata, not far from where Tomomi Shida’s house once stood. Initially she was just expecting to lend muscle as an ordinary volunteer. “We dug the mud out of people’s homes or helped clear the rubble from their land. We cleaned a factory which had fish in storage when the tsunami hit. They were just sitting there, in the dock area, rotting in the sun.” Everything changed for Becci the day she went to help clean up an onsen - a Japanese bathing house. When she arrived, she saw that it was doubling as the storage site for thousands of salvaged photographs which had been stuffed in plastic bags. They, too, were rotting. “It was one of those eye-opening moments,” Becci says, when she saw some survivors crying after seeing their photos had been damaged. Instantly, she realised that she had the perfect skill set to step in and fix them. She issued a call to other professional retouchers she knew, asking them to pitch in. Within weeks she had 500 people from Sweden to New York lined up, ready to smooth over the smeared photographs and to make them look new again. A thousand volunteers on the ground worked on site to clean the photos too. It was rewarding work, but it came with huge pressures as well. “The drivers working with the volunteers would come in and look through the photos that had been cleaned because they were local guys,” Becci says. “One guy noticed his friend in the pictures with the friend’s twin daughters. The girls were less than one year old when the tsunami hit and they lost one of the daughters. So we dug through and found as many photos as we could of the kids so they could have them.” The stories mounted. One woman lost all her relatives and was left with nothing but seven photos from a school trip. Another photo, featuring a girl’s elaborate kimono, needed to be almost entirely rebuilt. The whole process took days, with one retoucher painstakingly copying the embroidered design from a similar image so he could be certain it would be accurate. Whereas Becci’s professional career involved “making the perfect even more perfect”, her biggest challenge with the Japanese photos “was to restore the photos to how they were meant to be. You don’t want to destroy the memory for someone by ruining a picture in some way”. One day Tomomi Shida, the survivor from the obliterated town of Ofunato, came to see Becci. She brought the family portrait that had been salvaged, the one with her husband and two boys. “We used different pieces from her photos to create a whole one,” Becci says, still marvelling at what a technically difficult fix that was. “We gave the finished photo back to her on her son’s birthday and I remember she was so happy, she cried. It was the one thing her son could hold onto that wasn’t new, and had existed before the tsunami took everything.” The photo hangs in the bedroom Tomomi shares with her husband now. “I had given up,” she remembers, “I thought the complete photograph was something that was already gone but then it came back to me. “I lost all my belongings but I still have a record of my children’s growth."" Photo cleaning projects continued along the coast. In the city of Rikuzentakata, where Becci’s time in Japan was coming to an end, the cleaned photographs were beginning to pile up. That presented a new organisational hurdle: matching photos with their owners. The project was growing in scope. Unclaimed personal objects, like school backpacks and artworks, were also being salvaged and cleaned in hopes that they, too, would be reclaimed. It was clear that someone efficient needed to take control. Enter Mari Akiyama, a disaster agency worker tasked with managing the project's next phase. “Once we had washed the photographs, we put them into albums,"" she says. ""We began to show people what we had.” These first events were simple affairs: albums and individual photos were spread out on the ground on blue plastic sheets. The process continues 10 years on, and Mari still leads it. But now, the system is much more sophisticated: Mari is in charge of a well-organised library of lost things, known as the Sanriku Archive Disaster Mitigation Center. The collected objects have been carefully sorted into groups — school diplomas on one shelf, wooden sculptures on another. Some are wrapped in cellophane. It looks a bit like a shop until it becomes clear that the owners of many of the objects might have died 10 years ago. It’s also possible the object's owners are still alive and simply haven’t realised their belongings are still waiting to be reclaimed. “We don’t actually know what these photos or objects mean to people,” Mari explains. “The items only gain value when they’re returned to the people who might cherish them, who understand their original brilliance.” Once a month, the centre creates pamphlets displaying some of the orphaned photos and objects, distributing them in doctors’ offices and hair salons, hoping they’ll be identified. Sometimes Mari and her colleagues will take a slew of photos to Tokyo, where many of the survivors have relocated, and they’ll hold a mass viewing event there. “There are many people who return again and again, especially in Tokyo,” Mari says. “There are some cases where a body has never been found, so the survivors are trying to find even one or two belongings of the deceased. One woman sifted through random photos for nine years until she found a single image of her missing husband. Another family lived in a trailer beside the centre for days in hopes of finding something familiar. Another time, an 80-year-old woman spotted a tiny photograph from her school days. She lit up when she saw the photo, Mari says, and suddenly started to recall school trips, and the teachers she’d known decades before. And then, there are the people who simply can’t bear to look. Not yet. For them, Mari acts as a guardian of sorts. “Whenever we’re mentioned on the television, there are people who call in straight away to tell us they’re still struggling,” she quietly explains. “Those people say that on the surface, they’re smiling, but actually they cry every day. They’re not comfortable looking at the photographs yet, so they ask us to hold on until they’re ready.” But the centre is in danger. The city council has told them they’re probably going to lose their funding, so Mari has been forced to solicit donations to keep the Sanriku Archive open. She’s returned about 200,000 photos so far, but there are still 186,000 unclaimed pictures and more than a million objects in the library. In other cities, photo centres have already closed their doors. In keeping with Japanese tradition, all the saved photographs are taken to a shrine and burned. “They’re given back to the dead,” Yuichi, the former manager from Fujifilm, explains. Still, the drive to save photos, to clean them and to return them to their rightful owners continues. When Becci Manson returned to the US, she was asked to start photo rescue projects after several major US storms. But one thing that struck her after the tsunami project was how much the photos helped people who were suffering with mental health issues after the disaster. Family photos are different from almost everything else. They have an emotional pull that can’t be matched, especially after something terrible has suddenly taken people away. Becci says the subsequent suicides by survivors of the disaster shows how crucial it was to take mental health seriously. “People started mentioning the photographs over and over again,"" she says.  ""Having the photos helped them to get back some sense of their history and their normality.” The photographs that were carefully washed and fixed are now, in turn, helping their owners to become whole again.

Former F1 commentator Walker dies at 97Former Formula 1 commentator Murray Walker dies at the age of 97.BBC Sport,"This video can not be played BBC Sport looks back at the career of legendary Formula One commentator Murray Walker Legendary Formula 1 commentator Murray Walker has died at the age of 97. Walker commentated on his first grand prix for the BBC at Silverstone in 1949 and became a full-time F1 commentator in 1978. He became synonymous with F1 through his commentary, first with the BBC and then ITV, before retiring in 2001. ""Murray has been with me for my whole life and I don't think anybody thought this day would come, but sadly it has,"" said 1996 F1 champion Damon Hill. Murray Walker: A legend with effervescent enthusiasm Murray Walker at 90 on James Hunt and Ayrton Senna Listen: Special podcast - remembering Murray Walker One of Walker's most famous lines was, ""I've got to stop now, because I've got a lump in my throat"" as Britain's Hill won the 1996 Japanese Grand Prix - and with it his only World Championship. Hill added: ""Maybe old soldiers never die? His legacy and his memory is so strong, and what he gave to so many Formula 1 fans and number of people he affected, he became bigger than the sport, so we have got a lot to be thankful to Murray for. ""He could emote the events that happened in our sport. The shocking moments and the dramatic moments all have Murray's reaction to them and he made those events stick in your mind forever. ""And he allowed himself not to be the know-it-all commentator, but the fan who, at times, got over excited."" Walker, who is survived by his wife of more than 60 years Elizabeth, was appointed an OBE in 1996 for his services to broadcasting and motor racing. His co-commentators included the late James Hunt, who was F1 world champion in 1976, and the pair built up a memorable partnership.

""He was the perfect gentleman, a man who had great style and great skills with the English language. ""As a racing driver, from my own point of view, Murray was always the best."" Stewart added: ""He was very good at making mistakes. He made wonderful mistakes. He so much enjoyed the realisation of his error, he was such a character. ""A mistake didn't mean anything wrong for Murray. It was something else to make a joke of. ""He was full of energy, he never sat to do a commentary. He stood up for the whole time."" Walker was famous for his high-octane commentary style and memorable phrases that became known as Murrayisms Former team owner and BBC F1 chief analyst Eddie Jordan called Walker a ""legend"".

""When he was doing the commentary, he had every single angle covered. He was brilliant at it."" BBC director general Tim Davie said: ""Over decades, no-one conveyed the excitement and passion of motorsport like Murray Walker. ""For millions, he was quite simply the voice that captured the spirit of Formula 1. Respected by drivers and fans alike, he will be hugely missed."" ""He was to so many of us fans of F1 the voice that epitomised the sport we love,"" said Stuart Pringle, Silverstone managing director.

Residents will be required to stay at home except for work, health or other essential reasons. Shop and restaurants owners are bracing for a new financial hit The extra restrictions would last until Easter, Mr Draghi's office said, and over the Easter weekend the whole country would be turned into the high-risk ""red zone"". ""I'm aware that today's restrictions will have consequences on the education of your children, on the economy and on everyone's mental health,"" Mr Draghi said.

Mobile hairdressers 'confused about reopening',"Mobile hairdresser Antonia Sparkles has started a petition over the ""lack of clarity"" We can wave goodbye to our lockdown locks from Monday - but mobile stylists say they remain in the dark on whether they can pick up the scissors again. On Friday, the Welsh Government saidall hairdressers, including mobile salons, could reopen. But the Nation Hair & Beauty Federation (NHBF) said it had been told mobile stylists ""might not be able to resume"". The Welsh Government said they could work only ""where the client physically cannot leave the home"". The latest guidelines state mobile hairdressers can visit people's homes if ""leaving the home is likely to have a significant detrimental effect on their wellbeing"". But the NHBF said the guidance was not clear and it was ""seeking clarity to understand when mobile services will be able to fully resume"". Welsh hairdressers to reopen but retail stays shut Third of people in Wales have had first Covid jab How are the lockdown rules changing across the UK? Mobile hairdresser Antonia Sparkles, 32, from Pencoed, Bridgend, said she does not understand the rules. ""It should only be a yes or no, with clear instructions on what services we can do,"" she said. ""I feel a bit confused. I know three people who can't leave the house physically - that is not going to pay my bills. ""In the last hour I've had more confused clients saying I'm allowed back - it's more stress. I'm telling clients there's no answer yet, it's not clear."" Ms Sparkles said she was eager to get back to work, not only for financial reasons but also for her and her clients' mental wellbeing. ""It was emotional for me [to get back to work] because I haven't seen anybody, so for me it's such a good thing to get a routine. I had to go on antidepressants for my insomnia... because I've been worried,"" she said. ""I suffer really badly with anxiety and depression. We need to go back to work not just for the money - it's a part of our routine. ""It's good when you do someone's hair and they smile because they feel better. A lot of my clients live alone too and we can have a little chat."" This video can not be played Visiting the hairdresser and meeting friends in your garden are among lockdown rules being relaxed After the initial announcement on Friday, she spent all night doing a stock take and putting in orders, before a few hours later, her plans were halted again. In response, Ms Sparkles decided to set up a petition calling for greater clarity on the rules for mobile stylists. ""I was just sat here thinking there's so many people struggling in the pandemic anyway. Loads of people have lost their salons, so more have gone mobile, so this affects more people,"" she said. ""I don't see what the difference is between a salon and a mobile hairdresser because you've got more people in a salon than when you go to a house, you're all wearing PPE. ""What's upset me is they've divided us into two, saying a mobile hairdresser and a salon aren't the same. But we've always been classified as the same. It's just making people more frustrated."" Before visiting clients, Ms Sparkles said she takes a range of Covid precautions. ""I send them questions the night before, asking have they had a temperature, have they been abroad, if they have had a test, have they had the results back?"" she said. ""I go in with a surgical mask, I wear a visor. I wipe down the area where I'm working and have a new gown for each client. I was worried about trying to protect everybody. ""After I've gone into a house, I sweep the hair up, take the hair in a bag and then dispose of it - I pay to have that disposed of."" The Welsh Government has responded to the concerns from a legal perspective. ""There are many circumstances in which people might need to access someone's home to carry out work there,"" a spokeswoman said.

Everard event to be replaced with doorstep vigil,"People held candles on Saturday evening on Clapham Common, where an official vigil was cancelled The prime minister and the Duchess of Cambridge are among those to pay tribute to Sarah Everard as virtual and doorstep vigils are held across the UK. Boris Johnson said he and his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, will join others in lighting a candle for the 33-year-old at 21:30 GMT. Planned evening vigils were called off because of Covid restrictions, but hundreds gathered at Clapham Common. It led to confrontation with the police who tweeted that it was ""unsafe"". Lambeth police tweeted:,external""The gathering at #ClaphamCommon is unsafe. Hundreds of people are tightly packed together in breach of the regulations and risking public health. ""We are urging people to go home and we thank those who have been engaging with officers and who are leaving."" This video can not be played People gathered to pay tribute to Sarah Everard following her death in March Earlier, Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with her kidnap and murder. The organisers of a vigil in Clapham, south London, said earlier they were cancelling the event because police did not ""constructively engage"" with plans. Reclaim These Streets asked people not to gather at Clapham Common, adding that doing so might put people ""legally at risk"". They asked people to shine a light to coincide with the time Ms Everard was last seen on 3 March. However, Sisters Uncut, which campaigns to prevent violence against women, said it planned to attend the Clapham vigil despite the organisers' cancellation. Hundreds of women and men rallied at the bandstand as night fell, and there was some confrontation between them and the police. One video posted online showed officers removing and leading away those women who were stood within the bandstand. Cries of ""shame on you"" and ""let them go"" could be heard from onlookers. The video showed them being put in a police van and driven away. Sisters Uncut alleged in a tweet that ""male police officers waited for the sun to set before they started grabbing and manhandling women in the crowd"". This tweet has now been deleted. Ms Everard's death has prompted women to share their own experiences, and a public debate over their safety. Mr Johnson tweeted,externalthat he will ""be thinking of her family and friends"" when lighting a candle, adding: ""I will do everything I can to make sure the streets are safe."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted a picture of a candle in her home, which she said was ""for Sarah"", while Wales's First Minister Mark Drakeford encouraged people to ""ignite a fire for change"". A memorial to Sarah Everard has been set up at Clapham Common's bandstand Throughout the day, people gathered at its bandstand to lay flowers and pay their respects throughout the day. It is understood that the Duchess of Cambridge wanted to pay her respects to Ms Everard and her family. During a virtual event hosted by Feminists of London, Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women's Equality Party, compared violence against women and girls to ""a form of domestic terrorism"", while TV presenter Sandi Toksvig said Ms Everard's death should be ""a turning point"". Home Secretary Priti Patel said almost 20,000 people had responded in 24 hours to a consultation on how the government could tackle violence against women and girls. Meanwhile, a fundraising page set up by Reclaim These Streets for women's charitable causes has reached its Â£320,000 target. On Friday, aHigh Court judge refused to intervene in the Reclaim These Streets' legal challengeover the right to gather to protest during Covid restrictions. How many attacks on women are there? Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? Reclaim These Streetstweeted,externalthat the group had ""repeatedly tried to find a way forward for the event"", including staggering start times and splitting the event into time slots, but the Met Police had been ""unwilling to commit to anything"". Anna Birley, of Reclaim These Streets, said holding the vigil would have put the group at ""massive"" legal risk for organising it, as well as risking women receiving fixed-penalty notices. Caitlin Prowle, another organiser, said they did not want to end up in a situation where they were having to raise funds to pay fines. Commander Catherine Roper, of the Met Police, said officers ""take no joy in this event being cancelled, but it is the right thing to do given the real and present threat of Covid-19"". People gathered in Nottingham on Saturday evening - as well as in Glasgow and Bristol Organisers for vigils due to be held across the UK, including in Edinburgh, Cardiff, Birmingham, Leeds, York, Sheffield and Brighton also cancelled events - with many holding virtual events instead. Those behind a cancelled event in Glasgow asked people totie ribbons and notes to trees and fences, a move which they said would be turned into a ""manifesto for change"" for real improvements in the lives and safety of all women. Organisers have urged people to stand on their doorsteps at 21:30 GMT - the time Ms Everard was last seen The Met Police said they ""take no joy"" in the vigil being cancelled but it was the ""right thing to do"" given the pandemic A police officer lays flowers left by members of the public at a site which is being searched in Kent Flowers were also laid in tribute to Ms Everard at Pittville Park in Cheltenham For almost a year the ambiguities and omissions within the coronavirus restrictions have left both the police and public grasping for answers. Gatherings in public are generally banned but, at the same time, the rules recognise there can be reasonable excuses to be outside. The problem is that the law doesn't specify whether a demonstration on a major issue of public importance - such as this vigil - is one of those excuses or not. Police officers must enforce the lockdown laws and they have been under pressure from ministers to do more to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. But they also know that the right to protest is enshrined in the Human Rights Act, a cornerstone of our complex constitution. That means they can't just impose a blanket ban on all protests under the coronavirus restrictions - and the judge in Friday's case urged both sides to keep talking. In the absence of further legal clarity, the police maintained their position that the balance came down in favour of preventing a gathering, rather than allowing an exception to mark a very exceptional and tragic death. In the ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Holgate refused an application by Reclaim These Streets for the High Court to make ""an interim declaration"" that any ban on outdoor gatherings under Covid rules was ""subject to the right to protest"". The judge also refused to make a declaration that an alleged policy by the Met Police of ""prohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances"" was unlawful. Labour's Harriet Harman, who chairs the Joint Committee on Human Rights, said the law on freedom of association amid the coronavirus pandemic should be clarified because a ""blanket ban... was not the right way to go"". ""The relationship between the Human Rights Act and its protection of freedom of association and the new Covid regulations has not been clearly spelt out,"" she said. This video can not be played Caitlin Prowle from Reclaim These Streets says attention should turn to issues such as criminal justice and charity funding Labour MP Apsana Begum said ""our fundamental right to protest is under attack"" and the government was proposing to strengthen its powers on protests via thePolice, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill,externalon Monday. Liberal Democrats deputy leader Daisy Coopertweeted,external: ""It is the Govt's responsibility to ensure people can protest safely."" Senior Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, who had previously said she asked Home Secretary Priti Patel to ""step in"" and allow the vigil to go ahead, said she hoped people would now take the advice of organisers to gather virtually instead to ""recognise the ongoing issue there is with violence against women and girls, perpetrated by men"". Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared Under the current lockdown rules two people can meet for recreation outside, which can include ""coffee on a bench"" From 29 March people will be allowed to meet outdoors, either with one other household or within the ""rule of six"" Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of Â£10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people During last year's restrictions, when Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown demonstrations took place,police took a hands-off approach to protests How many violent attacks on women are there?

Sarah Everard murder-accused appears in court,"Wayne Couzens spoke only to confirm his name and address during the brief hearing A Metropolitan Police officer has appeared in court charged with the kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard. Wayne Couzens, 48, was arrested on Tuesday after the 33-year-old disappeared when walking home to Brixton from Clapham in south London last week. Ms Everard's body was found in an area of woodland in Ashford, Kent, Westminster Magistrates Court heard. Mr Couzens wore a grey tracksuit as he appeared for the brief hearing. He appeared to have a red wound on his head and spoke quietly when asked to confirm his name, date of birth and address. Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring remanded him in custody to appear again at the Old Bailey on 16 March. Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" The court heard the officer, of Deal, Kent, is accused of kidnapping Ms Everard in the Poynders Road area of Clapham.

"Italy tightens restrictions amid 'new wave'Shops, restaurants and schools will be closed across most of the country on Monday.","Residents in Italy's ""red-zone"" regions will be required to stay home except for work, health or other essential reasons Shops, restaurants and schools will be closed across most of Italy on Monday, with PM Mario Draghi warning of a ""new wave"" of the coronavirus outbreak. For three days over Easter, 3-5 April, there will be a total shutdown. Italy, which one year ago imposed one of the first national lockdowns, is once again struggling to contain the rapid spread of infections. The country has reported more than 100,000 Covid-related deaths, Europe's second-highest tally after the UK. Italy's vaccination campaign has been hit by delays, as has been seen elsewhere in the European Union. Anglo-Swedish drug company AstraZeneca has announced a further shortfall in the amount of its vaccine it can supply to the European Union, blaming export restrictions imposed by some countries. It did not elaborate. In January, it announced a large cut in the 100m doses it had originally expected to deliver to the EU by March, sparking a public spat with European Commission. Last week the government in Rome blocked the export of 250,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia to address shortfalls of vaccines. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? No reason to stop using AstraZeneca jab - WHO Elsewhere, Bulgaria, Denmark and Norway have all paused the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine over fears it causes blood clots. The World Health Organization said on Friday there was no indication this was true,stressing that countries should not stop using the vaccine. From Monday, schools, shops and restaurants will shut in more than half of Italy, including the two most populous regions containing Rome and Milan. Residents will be required to stay at home except for work, health or other essential reasons. Shop and restaurants owners are bracing for a new financial hit The extra restrictions would last until Easter, Mr Draghi's office said, and over the Easter weekend the whole country would be turned into the high-risk ""red zone"". ""I'm aware that today's restrictions will have consequences on the education of your children, on the economy and on everyone's mental health,"" Mr Draghi said.

'We paid off our parents' mortgage making video games',"Ben and Matt have turned a hobby into a living When identical twins Ben and Matt Horton began making serious money from creating video games, their parents couldn't believe it. ""It was quite bizarre at first, because I was doing a paper round and they were blown away,"" says Ben. ""They said there was no way a paper round can make this much."" His brother Matt adds: ""It was a significant amount of money. They thought we were doing shady stuff online."" As it turned out, the brothers had produced their first big hit - a game called Boat Ride, launched on the online gaming platform Roblox - and they were just 13. Seven years later, Ben and Matt work full-time on gaming, with Ben specialising on the software side and Matt doing video production. Their games have been played more than 100 million times and each of them earns Â£100,000 a year. How the children's game became a $30bn bet on the Metaverse Roblox: David Baszucki worth $4.6bn as shares soar It all began as a hobby when the pair had some free time over the Christmas holidays. They were already enthusiastic gamers on Roblox and found it easy to start developing their own games. ""Anyone can learn, a 10-year-old kid can learn to make a game,"" says Ben. Now the brothers share a flat in their hometown of Crawley, having dropped out of sixth-form to concentrate full-time on game development. Their closeness as twins is important to them. ""We're not telepathic, but I kind of know what he's thinking and he knows what I'm thinking,"" says Matt. ""In our whole life, we've not spent more than two days apart from each other."" Despite their new-found wealth, the two say they are ""not big spenders"" and are ""not very materialistic"". Treating the family to a holiday and helping to pay off their parents' mortgage have been their biggest items of expenditure, with most of their income invested. ""We just want to be able to live comfortably for the rest of our lives,"" says Ben. Roblox has seen huge success built on the work of developers like Ben and Matt. It's already the world's largest user-generated games site, and its value rose 60% to $47bn after its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Versatility is one of the key reasons it's been a hit, says Candice Mudrick, head of market analysis at gaming data company Newzoo. ""The Roblox business model is more than a game - it's a platform that encourages creators to build experiences for other users. While many games have some form of user-generated content, it's more uncommon to find games whose entire business model is built upon it,"" she says. But competition is stiff among top developers on the platform. The firm recently said that more than 1,250 developers earned at least $10,000 in robux, the platform's currency which can be converted to cash, in 2020. Only about 300 earned $100,000 or more. ""This indicates that although the broader creator community is strong, the top earners are still a small group,"" said Ms Mudrick. She added that a big challenge for the firm and its army of developers will be ""maintaining its young audience as they age, while at the same time also expanding to new, older, demographics"". Quinn Byron-Dyer was an intern at Roblox's San Mateo headquarters in California while at university Quinn Byron-Dyer started playing Roblox when he was just 10 years old. A decade later, he was at intern at the company's head office in San Mateo, California, and he now supports himself through his work as a Roblox developer. Quinn, now 22, says playing and building games on the platform initially appealed to his ""creative side"". ""I got more seriously into developing stuff about 2015 onwards and from then, the money just built up from there I guess,"" he says. A recent graduate with a degree in computer games design, he believes that Roblox is popular because it's ""really easy to get into"". ""You don't need any requirements, you can start making stuff for free, you don't have to have any qualifications."" And importantly, Roblox provides the audience. ""It is so much easier to get people playing your game when there's already loads of people playing similar games out there,"" Quinn says. How much has he earned from Roblox? He says he's not sure. But as someone who has worked on hit games such as Murder Mystery 2, which has been visited 4.4 billion times, Quinn is looking forward to getting his own place once he moves out of his parents' house, post-pandemic of course. How do his parents feel about his career? ""They were obviously a bit unsure at first, about what it all means,"" he says. ""Because it was all very new, quite a new industry, it took a bit for them to understand what it was all about, but they are supportive of it."" Fiona is also known as ""xbutterflies"" on the Roblox platform Fiona, meanwhile, joined the platform in 2008. She's a developer based in Toronto who teamed up with her partner to create Super Power Fighting Simulator. The action game, in which players enter different realms and fight battles, has attracted more than 100 million users. She says that level of popularity generates about $30,000 to $40,000 per month. ""Roblox has changed my life,"" she says. ""I went from playing Roblox every day as a kid, to making a successful income from it."" ""I've seen many young developers who have been able to make millions per year from developing on Roblox,"" she adds. Fiona made the decision to buy shares in company on its stock market debut, and is keen to keep working on Roblox games. ""I'm excited to see where Roblox takes us within the next five to ten years,"" she says.

The memory hunters," By Celia Hatton By Celia Hatton After the most powerful earthquake in Japan’s history rocked its eastern coast, triggering a series of towering tsunami waves, Tomomi Shida searched the primary school she worked in, looking for her students. Tomomi was an hour away from her home in the seaside town of Ofunato. She had no way to get there - no idea if her own family had survived.“The only way to get information was over the radio. I heard that Ofunato had been obliterated. This was the first time I understood that the place where I lived no longer existed,” she remembers. She didn’t know it at the time, but almost 16,000 people were killed in the March  2011 disaster. Many of their bodies have never been found. It took the 48-year-old several days to locate her teenage boys and her elderly mother-in-law. And then she had to find her husband - a volunteer firefighter whose job it was to close the town’s tsunami gates. Miraculously, he was alive. “We hugged and we cried,” Tomomi remembers. But only a footprint of their house remained and almost everything they valued was gone. Or so they thought. Several weeks later, one precious possession re-emerged. “Someone from the fire brigade recognised my husband’s face in a photo,” Tomomi explains. It had been sticking out of a pile of waste; a sudden reminder of ordinary times amid the endless stretch of muddy debris. It was a simple photo studio portrait, taken when the boys were still young, posing with perfect bowl haircuts and chubby cheeks - in fact, a few copies of the same photo were found. Those images instantly became the family’s most valuable possession - a memory of a simpler, happier time, a time that could never be photographed again. But all of them were damaged. Tomomi’s eye was wiped off in one, her husband’s features were missing in another. As the Shida family was realising what they had lost and found, their experience was being replicated up and down Japan’s east coast. Two weeks after the tsunami, the Japanese rescuers looking for missing people received orders to also salvage photographs. At the end of each street corner, they placed all the photo albums and framed photos they could find inside plastic crates. Most were covered in mud and had been blurred by water. They had been located but they hadn’t yet been saved. Yuichi Itabashi, a chemical engineer by training, was watching the horrors of the tsunami zone safely from his house in Tokyo. But what he saw made him realise he could help. “A few weeks after the tsunami, there was a television news report that showed some people in the tsunami area trying to clean their photos. I saw they were washing them roughly,” he says with a shudder. At the time, Yuichi worked for Fujifilm, one of Japan’s oldest camera companies. He was in charge of their photo imaging division — the part of the company that had made a lot of the photographic paper he was watching survivors clean on TV. “Someone said they were gathering the photos in every town. I thought we needed to go there. Though, to be honest, we didn’t really know how to clean photos either,” he admits. But he did know that those people were in danger of destroying the things they were trying to protect. He worked with his colleagues to recreate tsunami conditions over a couple of days, applying seawater and mud to photos to mimic the damage. Then, they figured out how to make the photos whole again. They had to work quickly. Calls were coming in to Fujifilm from up and down the coast asking how to save photographs. Without telling his company, Yuichi rented an electric car, fearing he wouldn’t be able to find working petrol stations. Accompanied by two colleagues,  he drove into the tsunami zone. They wanted to track down the group of people they’d seen on TV, to show them how photos should be cleaned so they wouldn’t be ruined. “We thought the survivors needed water, food and a place to sleep, but what comes second? Not money. The survivors said they needed their photos. “Houses, cars and clothing can be bought again when we make money. But it’s impossible to buy those memories.” The clock started ticking on those memories as soon as salt water hit family homes, drenching photo albums and portraits hanging on walls. Photos can last about 72 hours if they’re wet, but after that, the gelatine that holds the image onto the photo paper starts absorbing water. Micro-organisms start eating away at the gelatine and mould grows, making the image brown and blurry. For decades, Japan has nurtured its love affair with photography. “Since the 1960s, every family has had a camera,“ says photo conservationist Yoko Shiraiwa.  “So every family probably had photograph albums in their houses.” Now, of course, photographs are usually taken on digital cameras and often instantly saved into cloud storage. But there’s an enduring power to photographic prints, to photos that take up physical space. In the tsunami, Yoko says, everything that was stored on hard disk drives, memory sticks and CDs was lost. In normal times, Yoko works for museums and private collectors, trying to extend the lives of priceless historical objects. Right after the disaster, she watched the same news reports as Yuichi which showed survivors who were cleaning muddy photographs. She too understood that there was only a small amount of time before the wet photos would disintegrate. Discarding the complicated methods she normally uses to clean photos, she also developed a simple cleaning method using water and raced to the tsunami zone to pitch in. Every town along the coast appeared to have the same idea: when there were no more bodies to pull from the wreckage, they pulled photos. Volunteers called themselves the Memory Hunters. As the communication lines were re-established, volunteers across the region realised they had all become Memory Hunters. They were bound together by the same comforting activity. “Rescuing photos, washing them, or trying to find their owners, all these activities united people,” Yoko says. At that point, Japan’s traditional appreciation for photos combined neatly with a culture that places a special importance on returning objects to their rightful owners. In Tokyo, for example, the police say that 80% of lost mobile phones are returned and more than 60% of wallets — often within the same day. At first, it was thought that the photos were being saved so that those who were missing after the tsunami could reclaim them. But as the death toll grew, and it became clear that those who were missing probably wouldn’t return, the project became a way for those left behind to hold onto the memories of those who were gone. Volunteers formed surprisingly efficient assembly lines - painstakingly cleaning the waterlogged, mud-caked photos, and pegging them up to dry inside small tents. Yuichi urged Fujifilm to make simple advertisements that would reach people across the tsunami zone, explaining that photos could be saved if they were washed in the right way. Other companies pitched in too, as corporations tried to find ways they might be able to help. A national effort was born. That effort soon included overseas volunteers too. Becci Manson, originally from northern England, was working in New York when the tsunami struck. As one of the world’s top photo retouchers, Becci had forged a career working on fashion and advertising photographs by the likes of Rankin and Annie Leibowitz. But she put that work on hold to pitch in as a volunteer with the disaster relief charity, All Hands and Hearts. Two months after the tsunami, she was on the ground in Rikuzentakata, not far from where Tomomi Shida’s house once stood. Initially she was just expecting to lend muscle as an ordinary volunteer. “We dug the mud out of people’s homes or helped clear the rubble from their land. We cleaned a factory which had fish in storage when the tsunami hit. They were just sitting there, in the dock area, rotting in the sun.” Everything changed for Becci the day she went to help clean up an onsen - a Japanese bathing house. When she arrived, she saw that it was doubling as the storage site for thousands of salvaged photographs which had been stuffed in plastic bags. They, too, were rotting. “It was one of those eye-opening moments,” Becci says, when she saw some survivors crying after seeing their photos had been damaged. Instantly, she realised that she had the perfect skill set to step in and fix them. She issued a call to other professional retouchers she knew, asking them to pitch in. Within weeks she had 500 people from Sweden to New York lined up, ready to smooth over the smeared photographs and to make them look new again. A thousand volunteers on the ground worked on site to clean the photos too. It was rewarding work, but it came with huge pressures as well. “The drivers working with the volunteers would come in and look through the photos that had been cleaned because they were local guys,” Becci says. “One guy noticed his friend in the pictures with the friend’s twin daughters. The girls were less than one year old when the tsunami hit and they lost one of the daughters. So we dug through and found as many photos as we could of the kids so they could have them.” The stories mounted. One woman lost all her relatives and was left with nothing but seven photos from a school trip. Another photo, featuring a girl’s elaborate kimono, needed to be almost entirely rebuilt. The whole process took days, with one retoucher painstakingly copying the embroidered design from a similar image so he could be certain it would be accurate. Whereas Becci’s professional career involved “making the perfect even more perfect”, her biggest challenge with the Japanese photos “was to restore the photos to how they were meant to be. You don’t want to destroy the memory for someone by ruining a picture in some way”. One day Tomomi Shida, the survivor from the obliterated town of Ofunato, came to see Becci. She brought the family portrait that had been salvaged, the one with her husband and two boys. “We used different pieces from her photos to create a whole one,” Becci says, still marvelling at what a technically difficult fix that was. “We gave the finished photo back to her on her son’s birthday and I remember she was so happy, she cried. It was the one thing her son could hold onto that wasn’t new, and had existed before the tsunami took everything.” The photo hangs in the bedroom Tomomi shares with her husband now. “I had given up,” she remembers, “I thought the complete photograph was something that was already gone but then it came back to me. “I lost all my belongings but I still have a record of my children’s growth."" Photo cleaning projects continued along the coast. In the city of Rikuzentakata, where Becci’s time in Japan was coming to an end, the cleaned photographs were beginning to pile up. That presented a new organisational hurdle: matching photos with their owners. The project was growing in scope. Unclaimed personal objects, like school backpacks and artworks, were also being salvaged and cleaned in hopes that they, too, would be reclaimed. It was clear that someone efficient needed to take control. Enter Mari Akiyama, a disaster agency worker tasked with managing the project's next phase. “Once we had washed the photographs, we put them into albums,"" she says. ""We began to show people what we had.” These first events were simple affairs: albums and individual photos were spread out on the ground on blue plastic sheets. The process continues 10 years on, and Mari still leads it. But now, the system is much more sophisticated: Mari is in charge of a well-organised library of lost things, known as the Sanriku Archive Disaster Mitigation Center. The collected objects have been carefully sorted into groups — school diplomas on one shelf, wooden sculptures on another. Some are wrapped in cellophane. It looks a bit like a shop until it becomes clear that the owners of many of the objects might have died 10 years ago. It’s also possible the object's owners are still alive and simply haven’t realised their belongings are still waiting to be reclaimed. “We don’t actually know what these photos or objects mean to people,” Mari explains. “The items only gain value when they’re returned to the people who might cherish them, who understand their original brilliance.” Once a month, the centre creates pamphlets displaying some of the orphaned photos and objects, distributing them in doctors’ offices and hair salons, hoping they’ll be identified. Sometimes Mari and her colleagues will take a slew of photos to Tokyo, where many of the survivors have relocated, and they’ll hold a mass viewing event there. “There are many people who return again and again, especially in Tokyo,” Mari says. “There are some cases where a body has never been found, so the survivors are trying to find even one or two belongings of the deceased. One woman sifted through random photos for nine years until she found a single image of her missing husband. Another family lived in a trailer beside the centre for days in hopes of finding something familiar. Another time, an 80-year-old woman spotted a tiny photograph from her school days. She lit up when she saw the photo, Mari says, and suddenly started to recall school trips, and the teachers she’d known decades before. And then, there are the people who simply can’t bear to look. Not yet. For them, Mari acts as a guardian of sorts. “Whenever we’re mentioned on the television, there are people who call in straight away to tell us they’re still struggling,” she quietly explains. “Those people say that on the surface, they’re smiling, but actually they cry every day. They’re not comfortable looking at the photographs yet, so they ask us to hold on until they’re ready.” But the centre is in danger. The city council has told them they’re probably going to lose their funding, so Mari has been forced to solicit donations to keep the Sanriku Archive open. She’s returned about 200,000 photos so far, but there are still 186,000 unclaimed pictures and more than a million objects in the library. In other cities, photo centres have already closed their doors. In keeping with Japanese tradition, all the saved photographs are taken to a shrine and burned. “They’re given back to the dead,” Yuichi, the former manager from Fujifilm, explains. Still, the drive to save photos, to clean them and to return them to their rightful owners continues. When Becci Manson returned to the US, she was asked to start photo rescue projects after several major US storms. But one thing that struck her after the tsunami project was how much the photos helped people who were suffering with mental health issues after the disaster. Family photos are different from almost everything else. They have an emotional pull that can’t be matched, especially after something terrible has suddenly taken people away. Becci says the subsequent suicides by survivors of the disaster shows how crucial it was to take mental health seriously. “People started mentioning the photographs over and over again,"" she says.  ""Having the photos helped them to get back some sense of their history and their normality.” The photographs that were carefully washed and fixed are now, in turn, helping their owners to become whole again.

Sarah Everard vigil in south London cancelled,"People held candles on Saturday evening on Clapham Common, where an official vigil was cancelled The prime minister and the Duchess of Cambridge are among those to pay tribute to Sarah Everard as virtual and doorstep vigils are held across the UK. Boris Johnson said he and his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, will join others in lighting a candle for the 33-year-old at 21:30 GMT. Planned evening vigils were called off because of Covid restrictions, but hundreds gathered at Clapham Common. It led to confrontation with the police who tweeted that it was ""unsafe"". Lambeth police tweeted:,external""The gathering at #ClaphamCommon is unsafe. Hundreds of people are tightly packed together in breach of the regulations and risking public health. ""We are urging people to go home and we thank those who have been engaging with officers and who are leaving."" This video can not be played People gathered to pay tribute to Sarah Everard following her death in March Earlier, Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with her kidnap and murder. The organisers of a vigil in Clapham, south London, said earlier they were cancelling the event because police did not ""constructively engage"" with plans. Reclaim These Streets asked people not to gather at Clapham Common, adding that doing so might put people ""legally at risk"". They asked people to shine a light to coincide with the time Ms Everard was last seen on 3 March. However, Sisters Uncut, which campaigns to prevent violence against women, said it planned to attend the Clapham vigil despite the organisers' cancellation. Hundreds of women and men rallied at the bandstand as night fell, and there was some confrontation between them and the police. One video posted online showed officers removing and leading away those women who were stood within the bandstand. Cries of ""shame on you"" and ""let them go"" could be heard from onlookers. The video showed them being put in a police van and driven away. Sisters Uncut alleged in a tweet that ""male police officers waited for the sun to set before they started grabbing and manhandling women in the crowd"". This tweet has now been deleted. Ms Everard's death has prompted women to share their own experiences, and a public debate over their safety. Mr Johnson tweeted,externalthat he will ""be thinking of her family and friends"" when lighting a candle, adding: ""I will do everything I can to make sure the streets are safe."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted a picture of a candle in her home, which she said was ""for Sarah"", while Wales's First Minister Mark Drakeford encouraged people to ""ignite a fire for change"". A memorial to Sarah Everard has been set up at Clapham Common's bandstand Throughout the day, people gathered at its bandstand to lay flowers and pay their respects throughout the day. It is understood that the Duchess of Cambridge wanted to pay her respects to Ms Everard and her family. During a virtual event hosted by Feminists of London, Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women's Equality Party, compared violence against women and girls to ""a form of domestic terrorism"", while TV presenter Sandi Toksvig said Ms Everard's death should be ""a turning point"". Home Secretary Priti Patel said almost 20,000 people had responded in 24 hours to a consultation on how the government could tackle violence against women and girls. Meanwhile, a fundraising page set up by Reclaim These Streets for women's charitable causes has reached its Â£320,000 target. On Friday, aHigh Court judge refused to intervene in the Reclaim These Streets' legal challengeover the right to gather to protest during Covid restrictions. How many attacks on women are there? Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? Reclaim These Streetstweeted,externalthat the group had ""repeatedly tried to find a way forward for the event"", including staggering start times and splitting the event into time slots, but the Met Police had been ""unwilling to commit to anything"". Anna Birley, of Reclaim These Streets, said holding the vigil would have put the group at ""massive"" legal risk for organising it, as well as risking women receiving fixed-penalty notices. Caitlin Prowle, another organiser, said they did not want to end up in a situation where they were having to raise funds to pay fines. Commander Catherine Roper, of the Met Police, said officers ""take no joy in this event being cancelled, but it is the right thing to do given the real and present threat of Covid-19"". People gathered in Nottingham on Saturday evening - as well as in Glasgow and Bristol Organisers for vigils due to be held across the UK, including in Edinburgh, Cardiff, Birmingham, Leeds, York, Sheffield and Brighton also cancelled events - with many holding virtual events instead. Those behind a cancelled event in Glasgow asked people totie ribbons and notes to trees and fences, a move which they said would be turned into a ""manifesto for change"" for real improvements in the lives and safety of all women. Organisers have urged people to stand on their doorsteps at 21:30 GMT - the time Ms Everard was last seen The Met Police said they ""take no joy"" in the vigil being cancelled but it was the ""right thing to do"" given the pandemic A police officer lays flowers left by members of the public at a site which is being searched in Kent Flowers were also laid in tribute to Ms Everard at Pittville Park in Cheltenham For almost a year the ambiguities and omissions within the coronavirus restrictions have left both the police and public grasping for answers. Gatherings in public are generally banned but, at the same time, the rules recognise there can be reasonable excuses to be outside. The problem is that the law doesn't specify whether a demonstration on a major issue of public importance - such as this vigil - is one of those excuses or not. Police officers must enforce the lockdown laws and they have been under pressure from ministers to do more to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. But they also know that the right to protest is enshrined in the Human Rights Act, a cornerstone of our complex constitution. That means they can't just impose a blanket ban on all protests under the coronavirus restrictions - and the judge in Friday's case urged both sides to keep talking. In the absence of further legal clarity, the police maintained their position that the balance came down in favour of preventing a gathering, rather than allowing an exception to mark a very exceptional and tragic death. In the ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Holgate refused an application by Reclaim These Streets for the High Court to make ""an interim declaration"" that any ban on outdoor gatherings under Covid rules was ""subject to the right to protest"". The judge also refused to make a declaration that an alleged policy by the Met Police of ""prohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances"" was unlawful. Labour's Harriet Harman, who chairs the Joint Committee on Human Rights, said the law on freedom of association amid the coronavirus pandemic should be clarified because a ""blanket ban... was not the right way to go"". ""The relationship between the Human Rights Act and its protection of freedom of association and the new Covid regulations has not been clearly spelt out,"" she said. This video can not be played Caitlin Prowle from Reclaim These Streets says attention should turn to issues such as criminal justice and charity funding Labour MP Apsana Begum said ""our fundamental right to protest is under attack"" and the government was proposing to strengthen its powers on protests via thePolice, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill,externalon Monday. Liberal Democrats deputy leader Daisy Coopertweeted,external: ""It is the Govt's responsibility to ensure people can protest safely."" Senior Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, who had previously said she asked Home Secretary Priti Patel to ""step in"" and allow the vigil to go ahead, said she hoped people would now take the advice of organisers to gather virtually instead to ""recognise the ongoing issue there is with violence against women and girls, perpetrated by men"". Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared Under the current lockdown rules two people can meet for recreation outside, which can include ""coffee on a bench"" From 29 March people will be allowed to meet outdoors, either with one other household or within the ""rule of six"" Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of Â£10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people During last year's restrictions, when Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown demonstrations took place,police took a hands-off approach to protests How many violent attacks on women are there?

School poverty cash at risk in count change,"There are warnings that school funding measures could miss rising levels of need in the pandemic Schools in England face a ""significant cash loss"" from a change in the date for counting disadvantaged pupils eligible for extra support, says the Education Policy Institute. The think tank warns using an earlier cut-off date to count free school meal pupils will miss many who have since become eligible in the pandemic. This could lower schools' allocations of ""pupil premium"" funding. The Department for Education says an earlier date helps budget planning. But head teachers have raised ""grave concerns"" that the change in timing will mean schools serving some of the poorest pupils will miss out on millions in funding, despite rising levels of need. Instead of using January as the annual point for measuring numbers of pupils eligible for free school meals, the government has used October 2020. This has prompted warnings that the earlier date will miss many families caught up in recent months of rising job losses and financial pressures. If children are not counted, schools could lose out on pupil premium funding, which is mostly based on their number of pupils eligible for free meals. Pupil premium funding is targeted to help disadvantaged children and provides schools with an extra Â£1,345 per pupil in primary and Â£955 per pupil in secondary. Poverty and Covid push families to the brink Unemployment rises to highest for five years How many children qualify for free school meals In 2020-21, more than two million children were supported with pupil premium funding worth Â£2.4bn. This is expected to rise to Â£2.5bn next year - but there are concerns the change in the date could undercount the need. ""This policy change looks to be poorly timed and is likely to have huge ramifications,"" said Natalie Perera, Education Policy Institute chief executive. ""Given that there was a likely rise in pupil premium eligibility during this period due to the recession and rises in unemployment caused by the pandemic, this could represent a significant cash loss for schools,"" she said. A spokeswoman for the National Association of Head Teachers said this was of ""grave concern to school leaders across the country"". ""We expect the consequences of this change to be significant,"" she said. The impact would not be evenly spread - as pupil premium funding is a much bigger factor in more disadvantaged areas. In parts of inner London, Birmingham, Manchester, Merseyside and Teesside more than 40% of pupils are eligible, based on deprivation. In Buckinghamshire it is about 13%. Pupil premium was worth about Â£95m to schools in Birmingham last year, compared with Â£3.6m in Windsor and Maidenhead. The Local Government Association (LGA), representing councils, has backed the warnings. ""It is imperative that no school should lose out in receiving pupil premium funding as a result of this administrative change,"" said Judith Blake, chair of the LGA's children and young people board. She said this was particularly important ""in the context of the pandemic and the need to ensure pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are supported to recover lost education"". ""There will be many schools with children who will have become eligible for pupil premium between October and January who will now not qualify for this extra funding for a whole year,"" said Cllr Blake. The Harris Federation academy trust, with 50 schools mostly in and around London, said more than 500 of its pupils became eligible for pupil premium funding in the gap between the two dates. Last month, Tony Foot, the Department for Education's director of strategic finance, told the Education Select Committee that he did ""not recognise"" claims the change in date would save Â£150m - and said: ""I do not have a figure for savings that are associated with that change."" He told MPs it would align pupil premium with core funding, which operates on an October census, and would provide certainty on funding at an earlier point. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""We are committed to ensuring all children have access to good quality education, no matter their background. ""Using the October census for pupil premium allocation means schools will know their budget earlier in the year, helping them to plan ahead and we expect pupil premium funding to increase to more than Â£2.5bn in 2021-22."" Schools will also have extra support from Â£1.7bn in catch-up funding to help recover from the disruption of the pandemic.

""Using the October census for pupil premium allocation means schools will know their budget earlier in the year, helping them to plan ahead and we expect pupil premium funding to increase to more than Â£2.5bn in 2021-22."" Schools will also have extra support from Â£1.7bn in catch-up funding to help recover from the disruption of the pandemic.

Australian set to head OECD despite climate recordCritics say former finance minister Mathias Cormann has an 'atrocious' record on climate change.Business,"Critics say Mr Cormann has an ""atrocious"" record on climate change Mathias Cormann, Australia's longtime former finance minister, is set to take over as chief of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr Cormann, a centre-right politician, had faced opposition stemming from his record on climate change. He tried to abolish Australia's renewable energy targets and has called carbon pricing a ""very expensive hoax"". Sweden's Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m was also vying to lead the group, which includes 37 of the world's biggest economies. The Paris-based OECD, which helps develop and coordinate policies among its members, is expected to finalise Mr Cormann's selection next week. He would serve a five-year term starting in June. Greenpeace International, which helped spearhead outside opposition to Mr Cormann's candidacy, called his selection a ""missed opportunity"" for the group, which includes the US, UK, Germany and Japan among others. ""We have little confidence in Mr Cormann's ability to ensure the OECD is a leader in tackling the climate crisis when he himself has an atrocious record on the issue, including opposition to carbon pricing,"" executive director Jennifer Morgan said. ""This was a missed opportunity for the OECD member states to draw a line in the sand and disqualify anyone with a history of blocking climate action from senior international appointments."" Mr Cormann has responded to the criticism, saying he was ""absolutely committed to ambitious and effective action on climate change"", but that there were different ways to achieve it. As the next leader of the Paris-based OECD, Mr Cormann is facing an agenda that includes tackling the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, addressing climate change and reaching a global deal on how to tax technology companies. A native German speaker who was born in Belgium, Mr Cormann moved to Australia in his mid-20s, working in health insurance and politics. Prospects brighter for global economy, says report OECD: No deal on digital tax risks trade war He holds the record as the country's longest-serving finance minister, serving from 2013 to 2020. He also represented western Australia as a Liberal Party senator from 2007 to 2020. Known to favour lower taxes, he pledged during his campaign for the OECD job to deploy ""every policy and analytical capability available through the OECD to help economies around the world achieve global net-zero emissions by 2050"". The group should help identify ""market-based ... solutions which maximise reduction outcomes in a way that preserves energy affordability and is economically responsible"" he added. Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison claimed the selection as a win for his country, calling it ""the most senior appointment of an Australian candidate to an international body for decades,"" in a statement to the Sydney Morning Herald. OECD insiders said that the breadth of Mr Cormann's political experience and personality played a role in his selection as did his detailed knowledge of the issues in hand. Backing from the US was also reportedly key. Insiders also told the BBC that having an Australian in charge would provide good geopolitical balance for an organisation based in the heart of Europe. The most recent country to join was Colombia, and Costa Rica is in the process of doing so. However, there has also been criticism over the lack of transparency in the selection process, which was led by the UK. One observer described it as ""cloak and daggers"" and questioned whether that was appropriate for an organisation whose members are democracies. Former EU trade commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m was the other finalist of the 10 candidates who entered the contest to succeed Mexico's Angel Gurria, who has led the group for 15 years. The possible selection of Mr Cormann prompted debate in the UK, which is set to host an important climate change summit in Glasgow later this year. In December Labour's Shadow International Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry wrote to Boris Johnson saying that supporting Mr Cormann ""would make a mockery of your own claims to leadership on climate change and would send entirely the wrong signal to the world about how seriously the UK takes the issue"".

"Freed inmate guilty of terror attack planSahayb Abu, who was freed from prison last March, is one of several extremists from the same family.London","Sahayb Abu and the kit he planned to wear in the attack A former prisoner has been convicted of planning an Islamic State-inspired sword attack. Sahayb Abu, 27, was found guilty by a jury of preparing an act of terrorism and will be sentenced on 9 April. Muhamed Abu, his 32-year-old brother, was acquitted of failing to warn police about the plan. Sahayb's preparations included buying a sword, a knife, balaclavas, fingerless gloves, and a combat vest, and paying extra to have the sword sharpened. When placing the orders, he asked if the vest could stop bullets. The defendant, from Dagenham in east London, also met an undercover police officer hoping he could provide access to firearms, the Old Bailey heard. Terror accused made pro-IS posts 'for a thrill' Terror plot accused 'wanted to be famous' Sahayb did not react as the majority verdict was delivered in his case and was remanded into custody. Muhamed, who was brought into court separately, wept and shouted out that his brother was a ""clown"". Sahayb is one of several extremist siblings from the same London family: In 2015, two younger half-brothers, Wail and Suleyman Aweys, went to Syria to join the Islamic State group and are believed to have been killed in the fighting In 2018, another half-brother Ahmed Aweys and half-sister Asma Aweys and her partner were jailed for terror offences, including sharing Islamic State material in a family chat group Also in 2018, another half-sister was stopped trying to leave the UK with several children, using another person's identification documents The youngest half brother, a teenager, was also in a group chat in which Sahayb discussed violent extremist beliefs Sahayb and Muhamed Abu were arrested in July in armed raids, hours after Sahayb had told an extremist chat group: ""We need a 9/11 2.0."" The authorities had intervened to prevent delivery of the 18-inch (46cm) sword and protective vest. Muhamed denied knowing that his brother was planning an attack. Prosecutors said Sahayb's violent mindset was expressed in a series of homemade rap recordings in which he rhymed about ""sending bombs"". Another lyric said: ""I'm trying to see many Lee Rigby's heads rolling on the ground"". Fusilier Rigby was murdered by two extremists near Woolwich barracks in May 2013. Anti-clockwise from top left - half-sister Asma Aweys, half-brother Ahmed Aweys and younger brothers Suleyman (in white) and Wail Aweys In some self-made films, Sahayb wore a mask and camouflage hat, which prosecutors said was an outfit he planned to wear to conduct his attack. In one he says he's ""just waiting on the body armour"" that ""will stop a bullet"". Sahayb told jurors he had created a rapper character called the ""masked menace"" as a joke, aspired to be a charitable figure like Captain Tom Moore, and claimed he could not have a radical Islamist mindset because he watched pornography. The counter-terror investigation that first uncovered the activities of the defendants' half-brother and sister came about after police received a tip that Sahayb and Muhamed were going to burgle a jewellery shop, the court was told. The pair, along with Ahmed Aweys, later admitted their part in the burglary conspiracy. Evidence gathered by police showed family members justifying crime against ""kuffar"" (unbelievers), for the purpose of jihad. The trial heard that Sahayb, after being released from prison in March last year, frequently accessed IS propaganda and used various social media platforms to boast about his violent beliefs. CCTV image of Sahayb Abu in the hat, with his brother Muhamed In jail, he had mixed with terrorist prisoners, including a man jailed for encouraging violence against Prince George. In one online comment, Sahayb stated: ""Islam is for war, hostage taking, killing infidels, fighting tyranny, taking war booty, taking women of the enemy as concubines."" He demonstrated particular hatred for Shia Muslims, railing against a specific UK imam, and searched online for the 2014 Camp Speicher Massacre in Iraq, when Islamic State forces killed more than 1,500 militiamen and Iraqi Army cadets, particularly targeting Shias. Sahayb also joined a small private chat group, which contained the undercover police officer,  in which members from the around the world glorified IS atrocities. Using an alias, Sahayb discussed Osama bin Laden, the hate preacher Anjem Choudry, and lionised the killer who carried out the Westminster Bridge attack in 2017. During a meeting with the undercover officer, Sahayb expressed regret at not going to Syria when he could have done, but said that two brothers had and they were martyrs. On another occasion, the court was told, a surveillance team watched Sahayb and Muhamed meet in public and look at an online listing for the sword. During message chats with Muhamed and their teenage brother, Sahayb said there was ""something called biding your time waiting for right moments"" and that Allah would make them ""action men and not chatty men"". Referring to not travelling to Syria, he wrote ""the caravan left without us"". Commander Richard Smith, head of Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command, described Sahayb as a ""very dangerous individual"". He said: ""I have no doubt in my mind of his murderous intent in preparing to carry out a terrorist attack.""
