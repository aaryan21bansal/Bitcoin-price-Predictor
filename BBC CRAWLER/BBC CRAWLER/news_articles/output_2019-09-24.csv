'Administration now inevitableâ at bus maker,"About 1,200 Wrightbus workers have been made redundant after the company entered administration. Just 50 jobs will be retained at the firm - the last UK-owned bus manufacturer - administrators said. The company had suffered cash flow problems and had sought investment or a new owner. Talks with two potential buyers of the firm, best known for building the New Routemaster, known as the ""Boris Bus"",failed to reach a conclusion last week. Reaction to Ballymena firm entering administration Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure Bus firm faces questions over religious donations Deloitte, the firm's administrator, said the lack of a buyer for Wrightbus had caused the redundancies. The Wright family, who founded Wrightbus in 1946, said ""global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK"". In a statement, the family said that it moved work from its facility in Malaysia to Ballymena in a bid to secure local jobs. ""These factors have resulted in significant losses at Wrightbus which our family have been covering for a over a year."" This video can not be played Government must 'invest in Wrightbus' - Jackie Pollock, Unite regional secretary But a statement added: ""It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support."" Read more reaction here. At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, union officials called for the immediate intervention of the British government. They said they sought meetings with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and NI Secretary Julian Smith, who they said they must ""stand up for British industry"". Jackie Pollock, Unite's regional secretary, added ""the government must intervene to save jobs and skills"". ""The administrator will need to find someone of calibre and of real standing who has the wherewithal and the skill to take this company on,"" he said. Wrightbus is best known for building the New Routemaster, or 'Boris Bus', which were ordered from the firm by Boris Johnson, the then mayor of London by BBC News NI North East reporter Sara Girvin It used to be a bustling market town - but the years have not been kind. The potential loss of so many jobs would be a blow to any town in Northern Ireland, but this isn't the first time Ballymena has been hit. The closure of big employers like JTI and Michelin in recent years have already left scars on the town. Read more about company closures in Ballymena here. This video can not be played Staff at the Ballymena bus manufacturer fear for the future as 1,200 lose their jobs. Norman Stephens has worked at Wrightbus for 30 years and said he is gutted. ""For the last five years, management has told us that they can't give us a wage rise as they were investing it in the company. ""Who is going to employ a 62-year-old man? I have nothing now. That's it. ""I'm off shift and due back in tomorrow night but I've been in since 8 o'clock hoping to find out if I've got a job."" Latest accounts show that the Wrightbus group lost Â£1.7m on a turnover of Â£227m in 2017. But its financial situation has deteriorated since then. This video can not be played 'This is a body blow for Ballymena' - DUP MP Ian Paisley It made two rounds of redundancies last year with 95 jobs going in February and June, which it said reflected continued low levels of demand for new buses in the UK market. The UK has traditionally been Wrightbus's biggest market but it has been contracting for over two years. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that in the second quarter of this year new bus and coach registrations are down 30% compared to the same period last year. That marks the tenth quarter in a row that new registrations have declined. In 2012, Wrightbus was riding high. The company launched the New Routemasters, which were ordered by the then mayor Boris Johnson - and so became known as Boris Buses. It was a triumphant time for the Ballymena business, but now it's been brought low. Read more on the firm's financial fall here. In the last six years Wrightbus has donated more than Â£15m to Green Pastures, a religious charity led by the firm's majority shareholder Jeff Wright. The donations helped it to develop plans for a huge church and village complex known as Project Gateway. Green Pastures is led by Wrightbus's majority shareholder Jeff Wright In the wake of the firm's fall into administration, questions have been asked over the use of money. Read more here. In March 2016, Wrightbus founderSir William Wright became the first major business figure in Northern Ireland to voice his support for Brexit.

Arrest in 38-year-old mystery of vanished toddler,"Katrice Lee went missing on her second birthday while out shopping with her mother An arrest has been made over the 38-year-old mystery of a toddler who went missing in Germany. Katrice Lee, from Hartlepool,disappeared from a supermarketnear a British Army base in Paderborn on her second birthday in 1981. She was with her mother at a Naafi supermarket when she vanished. Royal Military Police said an arrest was made in the Swindon area but would not comment any further. A garden has also been searched. A spokesman said: ""We can confirm that an arrest was made on 23 September by the Royal Military Police in connection with the disappearance of Katrice Lee in 1981."" Royal Military Police said this man was seen putting a child in a green saloon car near where Katrice Lee disappeared In 2012, Royal Military Police chiefs admitted mistakes were made during the initial investigation into Katrice's disappearance, and in 2017 the government agreed to review the case. A year later, the Royal Military Police undertook a forensic search on the bank of the River Alme, near to where she went missing. The river site was identified after the release of an age-progressed photo-fit of a man seen at the Naafi holding a child similar to Katrice. He was seen in a parked green car on a bridge over the river the day after she went missing. At the time, Katrice's father Richard Lee, a former sergeant major, said the news confirmed his long-held belief the toddler had been abducted. An army search of the riverbank area involved more than 100 soldiers More than 100 soldiers took part in the five-week search which unearthed bone fragments, but tests confirmed they were non-human. Following the search Mr Lee said: ""I believe what we should now be looking at a public inquiry into the treatment of the family through all of this and the way in which the case has been handled. ""If things had been done properly in 1981 we wouldn't still be going through this now.""

"Town tops list of most mispronounced place namesFrome is the most mispronounced town in England, according to a team of linguists.","Frome is the most mispronounced town in England, according to a team of linguists A market town in Somerset has topped a list of the 10 most difficult-to-pronounce place names in the UK. Frome is the most mispronounced town in England, according to a team of linguists behind a language learning app. Ballachulish in Scotland, Beaulieu in Hampshire and Woolfardisworthy in Devon also made the top 10. The list's makers said British English was ""famous for some of the most confusing pronunciations on earth"". 'How do you say?': The Top 10 'most difficult' place names Frome, Somerset, England Ballachulish, Highland, Scotland Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, England Omagh, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland Woolfardisworthy, Devon, England Beaulieu, Hampshire, England Bicester, Oxfordshire, England Ynysybwl, Cwm Clydach, RCT, Wales Rampisham, Dorset, England Quernmore, Lancashire, England Source:Babbel,external How would you pronounce these place names? See below to find out if you are correct. The name Frome is thought to come from the ancient Brythonic word ""ffraw"". It means fair, fine or brisk, and describes the flow of the river that runs through the town, which dates to the 7th Century. Paul Wynne, of Frome Town Council, said the name was most commonly mispronounced as rhyming with ""home"". He said: ""We're not a town that toes the line. Now it seems that even the way we pronounce Frome is different too. Ours is the right way, obviously. We always know who is new to the town by the way they pronounce Frome. ""But this is a good thing, as it's easy for us identify and welcome newcomers, who are then immediately part of the community."" Kent Barker, owner of Eight Stony Street wine bar and restaurant in the town, said: ""It doesn't surprise me at all. We have a lot of tourists who visit in the summer, and certainly the majority struggle with the name. ""Probably more the Mediterranean visitors and all the Americans get it wrong. ""But I love them being here and don't mind what they call it as long as they come and visit Frome."" There are two places in Devon called Woolfardisworthy - both equally difficult to pronounce Woolfardisworthy in Devon also featured on the list, but which one? There are two places in Devon called Woolfardisworthy. Woolfardisworthy West - the bigger of the two Woolfardisworthys near Bideford - has adopted the easier to say version of its name Woolsery. However post office manager Andy Fryatt said people sometimes still struggled to pronounce the shortened version. ""When you know it and you use it every day, then obviously you wonder why people can't (say it), especially with the shortened version,"" he said. ""Maybe it is just something that gets lost in translation over the telephone, or people just don't hear properly, or they think it is something that is spelt wrong and they are pronouncing it correctly."" The smaller Woolfardisworthy east near Crediton has kept the longer version of its name. The two villages are just over an hour apart, and Alison Evans, who runs two holiday rentals in the village, said people used to get the two places confused. ""Thank God for postcodes,"" she said, adding that sat navs now meant people usually navigated to the correct Woolfardisworthy. Ms Evans said she had been living there for 25 years, which was not that long in local terms. ""When we first arrived people would look at you blankly if you said Woolfarisworthy (phonetically),"" she said. Babergh District Council takes its name from the Anglo Saxon name Barberga Another place on the list, Babergh in Suffolk, is apparently so hard to pronounce that the district town council isplanning to rename it at a cost of Â£10,000. Council leader John Ward said: ""Babergh has a proud history but we know that people from further afield are often unaware of exactly where Babergh is and even struggle over its pronunciation."" The top 10 has been compiled by the creators of language app Babbel. One of its editors, Ted Mentele, said: ""British English is famous for some of the most confusing pronunciations on earth. ""The main reason that these are difficult to pronounce is that they're not spelled phonetically - there are a lot of silent letters and letters that are pronounced differently depending on where they are in the word. ""Many people in the UK, particularly locals to these areas, have grown up hearing these names and naturally don't find them so hard to get their tongues around.

Adler: How will this affect Brexit talks?,"EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says UK proposals still fall short The Supreme Court ruling thatthe prime minister's suspension of Parliament was void and his advice to the Queen unlawful, raises all sorts of questions for the EU - will their Brexit negotiating partner Boris Johnson stay in his job?

Tide turning in Labour's direction - Corbyn,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We will redesign system to supply cheaper medicines"" Jeremy Corbyn has promised to ""put the people in power"" if he becomes prime minister as he announced plans to compel drug firms to produce affordable versions of patented medicines. In his closing conference speech, he said the ""tide was turning"" for Labour ""after years of retreat and defeat"". ""We'll take on the privileged, and put the people in power,"" he said. If Labour wins power, it will set up a publicly owned firm to manufacture generic versions of leading drugs. In his closing address to the conference, brought forward by a day after the decision by the Speaker to resume Parliament, Mr Corbyn said his party was ready for a general election once the threat of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October had been averted. The Labour leader called again for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to resign after the Supreme Court declared he had acted unlawfully in suspending Parliament. Corbyn wins party backing in crunch Brexit vote Corbyn ally defends Labour Brexit vote process But he said his party would not seek to oust Mr Johnson in a vote of no confidence until a no-deal Brexit was taken off the table, suggesting the prime minister could not be trusted not take the country out of the EU during an election campaign. This video can not be played Corbyn: We must take Brexit ""out of the hands of the politicians and let the people decide"" And he defended Labour's own Brexit policy, after a week of wrangling at the conference, saying the promise of another referendum where voters would get the choice between leave and remain ""was not complicated"". Looking ahead to the prospect of an election, he said Labour would mount the biggest ""people-powered"" campaign in history to fight Boris Johnson's ""born-to-rule"" Conservatives. If Labour was elected, he said he would be a ""very different prime minister"" to those the country were used to, motivated by the desire to spread rather than hoard power, ""I want to put government on your side and power and wealth in your hands,"" he said. ""Together, we can go beyond defending the gains made by previous generations. ""It's time we started building a country fit for the next generation.

Labour, he said, would ""rebuild and transform"" a country desperate for change after nearly 10 years of austerity ""so no-one is held back and no community is left behind"". Promising a bold and radical manifesto, he said rail companies, Royal Mail and the energy grid would be brought back into public ownership and top-earners would pay more tax. He also committed a future Labour government to intervene in the pharmaceutical market to ensure drugs only currently available privately will become so on the NHS. The Labour leader said people were being denied potentially life-saving treatments because drugs firms were not willing to supply their drugs at reasonable prices. He talked about meeting a nine-year old boy, Luis Walker, a cystic fibrosis sufferer, who, he said, he was not able to get hold of the drug Orkambi. ""Luis and thousands of others are being denied medicines by a system that puts people before profits,"" he said. ""Labour will tackle this and re-design the system to serve public health, not private wealth, using compulsory licensing to secure generic versions of patented medicines."" He said Labour would make public research and development funding conditional on action by firms to ""save money in the health service and to save lives at the same time"". Labour has already pledged to abolish prescription charges in England. The Conservatives said Labour would leave the UK with ""higher taxes and fewer jobs"". And the CBI warned of a lack of respect for business, at the end of a week in which Labour vowed to intervene in the car, energy markets and delegates voted to scrap private schools. ""Firms have faced a volley of attacks, on sectors from life sciences to utilities,"" said its director Carolyn Fairbairn. ""This is desperately disappointingâ¦Jeremy Corbyn talks about the importance of listening. This must include business."" Mr Corbyn concluded his speech with what he will hope will be the rousing rhetoric to fuel his activists' enthusiasm for the election campaign ahead. ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn!"" they sang back.

PM given 14 days to explain Jennifer Arcuri links,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Everything done in the proper way"" Boris Johnson has been given 14 days to give details of his relationship with a US businesswoman, following claims he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest when he was London mayor. A committee that scrutinises the mayor's spending has asked for details ""of all contact"" with Jennifer Arcuri. The Sunday Times,externalsaid Ms Arcuri joined trade missions he led and received thousands in sponsorship grants. Mr Johnson has said everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". Ms Arcuri told the paper any grants she received and any trade missions she joined were ""were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman"". PM defends actions over conflict of interest claims Johnson 'must address conflict of interest claims' In a letter addressed to Mr Johnson and dated 23 September, Len Duvall, chairman of the London Assembly GLA (Greater London Assembly) Oversight Committee, said he wanted the ""details and a timeline of all contact"" with Ms Arcuri ""including social, personal and professional during his period of office as Mayor of London"". He also asked for ""an explanation of how that alleged personal relationship was disclosed and taken into account in any and all dealings with the GLA"". The committee has the legal power to summon Mr Johnson to appear before it for questioning and has done once before - when it quizzed him over the failed Garden Bridge project in 2018. Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 On Monday evening, when asked about the allegations, Mr Johnson told the BBC's John Pienaar: ""All I can say is I am very proud of what we did as Mayor of London... particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world."" He added: ""I can tell you that absolutely everything was done entirely in the proper way."" Technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri is believed to have moved to London seven years ago, when Mr Johnson was mayor. She joined a number of trade missions led by him while in office, and it is understood she attended events on two of these trips - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. The Sunday Times reported that one of her businesses received Â£10,000 and Â£1,500 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was mayor, as well as a Â£15,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs to build businesses in Britain. The newspaper also said Ms Arcuri received a Â£100,000 grant from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport earlier this year. The grant was intended for ""English-based"" businesses - although she had moved back to the US in June 2018. The Sunday Times said it had found the registered address on the grant application form was a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to her. The government has confirmed to the BBC it is investigating, but said the funds were awarded to a UK-registered company. The woman at the centre of this story is Jennifer Arcuri, who describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival. Ms Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers. But it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson. The network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012. Since then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses.

'Administration now inevitableâ at Wrightbus,"About 1,200 Wrightbus workers have been made redundant after the company entered administration. Just 50 jobs will be retained at the firm - the last UK-owned bus manufacturer - administrators said. The company had suffered cash flow problems and had sought investment or a new owner. Talks with two potential buyers of the firm, best known for building the New Routemaster, known as the ""Boris Bus"",failed to reach a conclusion last week. Reaction to Ballymena firm entering administration Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure Bus firm faces questions over religious donations Deloitte, the firm's administrator, said the lack of a buyer for Wrightbus had caused the redundancies. The Wright family, who founded Wrightbus in 1946, said ""global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK"". In a statement, the family said that it moved work from its facility in Malaysia to Ballymena in a bid to secure local jobs. ""These factors have resulted in significant losses at Wrightbus which our family have been covering for a over a year."" This video can not be played Government must 'invest in Wrightbus' - Jackie Pollock, Unite regional secretary But a statement added: ""It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support."" Read more reaction here. At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, union officials called for the immediate intervention of the British government. They said they sought meetings with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and NI Secretary Julian Smith, who they said they must ""stand up for British industry"". Jackie Pollock, Unite's regional secretary, added ""the government must intervene to save jobs and skills"". ""The administrator will need to find someone of calibre and of real standing who has the wherewithal and the skill to take this company on,"" he said. Wrightbus is best known for building the New Routemaster, or 'Boris Bus', which were ordered from the firm by Boris Johnson, the then mayor of London by BBC News NI North East reporter Sara Girvin It used to be a bustling market town - but the years have not been kind. The potential loss of so many jobs would be a blow to any town in Northern Ireland, but this isn't the first time Ballymena has been hit. The closure of big employers like JTI and Michelin in recent years have already left scars on the town. Read more about company closures in Ballymena here. This video can not be played Staff at the Ballymena bus manufacturer fear for the future as 1,200 lose their jobs. Norman Stephens has worked at Wrightbus for 30 years and said he is gutted. ""For the last five years, management has told us that they can't give us a wage rise as they were investing it in the company. ""Who is going to employ a 62-year-old man? I have nothing now. That's it. ""I'm off shift and due back in tomorrow night but I've been in since 8 o'clock hoping to find out if I've got a job."" Latest accounts show that the Wrightbus group lost Â£1.7m on a turnover of Â£227m in 2017. But its financial situation has deteriorated since then. This video can not be played 'This is a body blow for Ballymena' - DUP MP Ian Paisley It made two rounds of redundancies last year with 95 jobs going in February and June, which it said reflected continued low levels of demand for new buses in the UK market. The UK has traditionally been Wrightbus's biggest market but it has been contracting for over two years. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that in the second quarter of this year new bus and coach registrations are down 30% compared to the same period last year. That marks the tenth quarter in a row that new registrations have declined. In 2012, Wrightbus was riding high. The company launched the New Routemasters, which were ordered by the then mayor Boris Johnson - and so became known as Boris Buses. It was a triumphant time for the Ballymena business, but now it's been brought low. Read more on the firm's financial fall here. In the last six years Wrightbus has donated more than Â£15m to Green Pastures, a religious charity led by the firm's majority shareholder Jeff Wright. The donations helped it to develop plans for a huge church and village complex known as Project Gateway. Green Pastures is led by Wrightbus's majority shareholder Jeff Wright In the wake of the firm's fall into administration, questions have been asked over the use of money. Read more here. In March 2016, Wrightbus founderSir William Wright became the first major business figure in Northern Ireland to voice his support for Brexit.

Gina Miller: The woman who won two Brexit legal cases,"This video can not be played Campaigner Gina Miller reacts to the judgement outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday Gina Miller is the businesswoman and campaigner who has twice led legal challenges against the government and won. Her first victory came in September 2017, when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of giving MPs a say over triggering Article 50 - the legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU. Her second came on Tuesday,when the Supreme Court ruled that Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament was unlawful. Her success in the courts has come at a price - she has become a hate figure for many Brexit supporters and has had to employ round-the-clock security after threats to her life. She says she does not want to block Brexit, but is standing up for Parliamentary democracy. Speaking outside the Supreme Court after the ruling on Tuesday, she said: ""Today is not a win for any individual or cause, it's a win for Parliamentary sovereignty, the separation of powers and the independence of our British courts. ""Crucially, this ruling confirms that we are a nation governed by the rule of law."" Mrs Miller is not officially aligned to any political party, havingspurned the advances of the Liberal Democrats, who rapturously received a speech she gave at their 2018 party conference. A 54-year-old investment manager and philanthropist, Mrs Miller was born in Guyana and educated in Britain. She went first to an exclusive all-girls private boarding school, Roedean, on the outskirts of Brighton, at the age of 10, then to Moira House Girls' School, in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Afterwards, she studied law at the University of East London, but left before completing her degree. Mrs Miller went on to start a successful marketing consultancy business with clients including private medical specialists in Harley Street in London. In 2009, she used the money she had made in marketing to co-found an investment firm supporting smaller charities. ""I realised then it was my money, I could do what I wanted with it and so I used that money to get involved in social justice,"" Mrs Miller toldUnfiltered with James O'Brien,externallast year. And in 2012, the businesswoman began the True and Fair Campaign, which campaigned for greater transparency in the City of London's fund management industry. According to an interview with theFinancial Times in 2016,external, this led some in the industry to label her the ""black widow spider"". Speaking about a time she asked three men at an industry party why they were staring at her, she told the paper: ""One of them replied that I was a disgrace and that my lobbying efforts would bring down the entire City."" Mrs Miller launched her first Brexit legal case with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Tozetti Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney - a UK citizen who lives in France. Backed by a crowd-funding campaign, they argued the government could not invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - starting the formal process of the UK leaving the EU - without seeking approval from Parliament. Mrs Miller argued only Parliament could make a decision leading to the loss of her ""rights"" under EU law. But she stressed the challenge was not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are all leavers now."" In November 2016,three High Court judges ruled Parliament had to voteon when the process could begin. Speaking after her victory, Mrs Miller told the BBC the case was about scrutinising the details of Brexit, such as ""how we leave, how they're going to negotiate, the directions of travel the government will take"". And she said the legal challenge was about more than Brexit, arguing that it was ""verging on dictatorship"" for a prime minister to be able to take away people's rights without Parliament's consent. The government appealed, and the case went to the Supreme Court the following December, butthe 11 judges rejected it by a majority of eight to three. Mrs Miller after winning her High Court legal challenge in November 2016 Following the successful legal challenge, Mrs Miller suffered online abuse, including rape and death threats against her and her family. She told James O'Brien: ""It has changed the way we live our lives, and the conversations we have with the children"". ""We use humour a lot because that's the only way to get through it"", she told him. In July 2017, an aristocrat who wrote a Facebook post offering Â£5,000 to anyone who ran over Mrs Millerwas sentenced to 12 weeks in prison. Describing the businesswoman as a ""boat jumper"", Rhodri Colwyn Philipps - the 4th Viscount St Davids - wrote: ""If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles."" The peer claimed the comments were ""satire"" and a ""joke"". But the judge, who said the post effectively put a ""bounty"" on Mrs Miller's head, found him guilty of two charges of making menacing communications. Later that year,Mrs Miller was named as Britain's most influential black person. ""It's amazing to get an accolade when what I've done has solicited a huge amount of abuse,"" she said on receiving her title. ""To have somebody acknowledge me is extraordinarily kind and counters a lot of what I still get on a daily basis."" Mrs Miller arrived at the Supreme Court in 2017 flanked by security guards, having received death threats Despite the backlash, Mrs Miller went on to launch a second challenge against the government to""defend Parliamentary sovereignty"". After Mr Johnson announced in August that he would suspend Parliament for five weeks, Mrs Miller challenged the legality of the decision at the High Court. She argued thatParliament would be ""silenced""for an ""exceptional"" length of time in the critical period before the 31 October Brexit deadline. She initially lost her case, but in Scotland, a separate legal challenge succeeded, with judges taking the view thatthe suspension was unlawful. The UK government appealed to the Supreme Court against the Scottish judgement, and the two cases were then heard together. The court unanimously ruled in favour of Mrs Miller's appeal and against the government's. Gina Miller spoke to the media outside the Supreme Court after her victory Judges said it waswrong to stop MPs carrying out duties in the run-up to the Brexit deadlineon 31 October. After the ruling Mrs Miller told reporters the ruling showed the government ""will push the law, they will push the constitution and they will even bend it to get their own way"".

EU watches and waits amid UK turmoil,"EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says UK proposals still fall short The Supreme Court ruling thatthe prime minister's suspension of Parliament was void and his advice to the Queen unlawful, raises all sorts of questions for the EU - will their Brexit negotiating partner Boris Johnson stay in his job? When might the UK hold a general election? Privately the court ruling has been described to me by EU sources as ""an embarrassment"" and ""a humiliation"" for Boris Johnson but this isn't the first time the EU has found itself faced with similar questions about possibly imminent elections and Mr Johnson's longevity as prime minister. Yet then, as now, the EU has taken the decision to put its metaphorical hands over its metaphorical ears in an attempt to block out the noise. Why? Because EU leaders view the Supreme Court ruling and what follows next in the UK as an unpredictable domestic political affair. They regard themselves as onlookers to that drama - which is why German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have stayed silent, and why the European Commission refused to comment on the ruling on Tuesday, however hard UK journalists pushed. Johnson faces resignation calls over court ruling UK 'has 12 days to set out Brexit plans' 'Dose of reality needed' over Brexit deal hopes Brussels prefers to focus on where it can play a part - negotiations. And there, in the short term at least, Tuesday's ruling changes little. EU leaders still want a Brexit deal and, under EU law, their negotiating partner is Her Majesty's government, still headed by Boris Johnson. EU-UK technical talks are pressing ahead on Wednesday in Brussels, regardless of what might be going on in a parallel universe in London, when MPs are reunited with the prime minister in Parliament. But is the Supreme Court ruling a demotivating factor for the EU in engaging with the Johnson government? This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""This is a verdict that we will respect"" In fact, EU politicians say the most demotivating factor for them is the lack of a guarantee that the majority of MPs would definitely approve a new Brexit deal, even if they made big compromises. But, although EU leaders says they are ""open"" to another Brexit extension, such is the impatience with the more than three-year-long Brexit debate, they would love to agree a new deal with Boris Johnson by mid-October as he hopes to do. And yet, scepticism is rife in Brussels. One diplomat from a country traditionally very close to the UK told me: ""The prospects of an October deal already weren't good. They're now complicated further by UK domestic issues. Time, as we always say, is running out."" EU diplomats argue that the current UK ideas on how to replace the Irish backstop in a new Brexit deal may be a start. But as the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said on Tuesday in Berlin, in EU eyes the UK proposals fall far short of the ""technically detailed, legally operable, concrete solutions"" they are calling for. Pushback from journalists and/or the UK government that the EU needs to compromise, too, is rejected at this stage in Brussels. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The stock reply is that before anyone in the EU thinks of compromise, they need realistic UK proposals to negotiate over. As for assertions by UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and others that the EU always blinks at five minutes to midnight, EU contacts say this shows a misunderstanding of how the EU works. One EU diplomat from a small member state commented to me: ""We only compromise when that compromise doesn't cause us great harm."" Key lines: the judgement dissected Your questions answered Brussels believes it couldn't protect the single market, the Northern Ireland peace process or EU member state Ireland if it agreed to current UK proposals on how to replace the backstop. And EU sources claim the two sides are still too far apart for it to make sense to ""go into a tunnel"" of intense negotiations with a media blackout at this stage. EU governments admit that a new Brexit extension would be likely to take the pressure off both sides to make the compromises necessary to agree a new deal. However, the bottom line is that Europe's leaders are unsure whether Boris Johnson would be willing to make Brexit compromises anyway, if he knows that he's heading into a general election.

Democrats 'to launch Trump impeachment inquiry',"This video can not be played ""He's violated so many clauses of the constitution"" - US citizens react to impeachment inquiry The US Democratic Party has begun a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over allegations that he pressured a foreign power to damage a political rival. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi said the president ""must be held accountable"". Mr Trump has denied wrongdoing and called the efforts a ""witch hunt"". There is strong support from House Democrats for impeachment, but the proceedings would be unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate. The high-stakes move by House Speaker Ms Pelosi, prompted by allegations that Mr Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate his leading political rival Joe Biden, lays the groundwork for a potentially hugely consequential confrontation between Democrats and the president ahead of the 2020 election. What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? Why Pelosi made her move How the impeachment process works If the inquiry moves forward, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will vote on any charges. If Democrats were to remain united, the measure would be carried - and Mr Trump would become the third president in US history to be impeached. But the proceedings would be expected to stall in the Senate, where the president's Republican party holds enough seats to prevent him from being removed from office by a two-thirds majority. Ms Pelosi did not provide any timeline for how the process might play out. Senior Democrats including Ms Pelosi had previously resisted growing calls from within the party to begin impeachment proceedings. But the party's leadership united on the issue after an intelligence whistleblower lodged a formal complaint about one or more phone calls between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Trump administration has so far refused to release the whistleblower complaint to Congress but Democrats say Mr Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Mr Zelensky agreed to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Mr Trump's leading political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Mr Trump has admitted discussing Joe Biden with Mr Zelensky. He has denied that he exerted pressure on the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rival. On Tuesday, Mr Trump confirmed that military aid to Ukraine had been withheld but said he had done this to try and pressure European nations to increase their contributions to the country. Two presidents have been impeached in US history - Andrew Johnson in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. But neither were removed from office by a Senate trial. Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974 before he could be impeached. For months now, Democratic leaders have been playing a semantics game. They wanted those who supported and those who opposed a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump to both think they were getting what they wanted. This strategy suggested Nancy Pelosi and others feared that heading down the path to impeachment would put moderate Democrats facing tough 2020 re-election fights at risk. That calculation has changed after the rapid drumbeat of new revelations about Mr Trump's contacts with the Ukrainian president. Now even middle-of-the road politicians are coming out in favour of impeachment proceedings. The dam has broken. The genie is out of the bottle. Pick your metaphor. The simple fact is that Ms Pelosi - a keen judge of the political mood within her caucus - has made the decision to shift from resisting impeachment to advocating for it. The path forward is uncertain. Opinion surveys could show the latest drama is taking a toll on one party or the other, causing political will to crumble. Or, both sides could dig in for a long, gruelling battle that could drag into the darkest days of winter. More from Anthony on why Ms Pelosi has made her move In a statement on Tuesday she said Mr Trump had betrayed his oath of office and committed ""a violation of the law"". She called his actions ""a breach of his constitutional responsibilities"". ""This week the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take action that would benefit him politically,"" she said, adding: ""The president must be held accountable. No-one is above the law."" This video can not be played Pelosi: ""The president must be held accountable; no one is above the law."" Mr Biden has denied wrongdoing and no evidence has emerged to back up the claims against him. He has also said he supports impeachment proceedings unless the US president complies with investigations. Impeaching Mr Trump ""would be a tragedy"", Mr Biden said. ""But a tragedy of his making."" He is the current frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election. In a series of tweets Mr Trump said Democrats ""purposely had to ruin and demean"" his trip to the UN in New York ""with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage"". ""They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!"" he added. This video can not be played Trump confirms he withheld aid to Ukraine - but insists there was no ""quid pro quo"" He promised to release a transcript of his conversation with Ukraine's president on Wednesday to show it was ""totally appropriate"".

In his response to the Democrats' move, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said: ""Speaker Pelosi happens to be the Speaker of this House, but she does not speak for America when it comes to this issue."" ""She cannot unilaterally decide we're in an impeachment inquiry,"" he added. Meanwhile, the acting director of US national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to share the whistleblower report with Congress. He is due to testify before a public House intelligence committee hearing on Thursday. In a separate development, the unnamed whistleblower is seeking to meet directly with lawmakers. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff suggested in a tweet that this could happen later this week. Ms Pelosi's announcement gives an official go-ahead for lawmakers to investigate the US president's phone call with the Ukrainian leader and determine whether he committed an impeachable offence. In her announcement Ms Pelosi said the six congressional committees already investigating Mr Trump would continue their work, but now under the umbrella of a formal impeachment inquiry. What would impeachment take? If the process moves forward the House of Representatives will vote on one or more articles of impeachment. If any pass, the process would next move to the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is required - and where the Republicans hold sway. By Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring Commentators in Ukraine see President Volodymyr Zelensky's role in this affair as accidental, but at the same time believe it could lead to history-making consequences. Den, a daily newspaper, warns President Zelensky against taking sides in the drama unfolding in Washington. ""Ukraine is facing an unstoppable tsunami, and our president will just have to do some surfing,"" it says. Some argue that the timing could not be worse for President Zelensky, who is scheduled to meet Donald Trump in New York later on Wednesday.

Impact of Thomas Cook's collapse around the world,"Thomas Cook operated holidays to over 60 destinations worldwide The collapse of Thomas Cook could have an impact on tourism around the globe, concerned industry professionals say. The oldest tour operator in the world was famous for its package holidays to more than 60 destinations. In some of these countries â such as Spain, Greece and Turkey â there is a fear that tourist numbers could drop dramatically. Thomas Cook's Chinese, German and Nordic subsidiaries continue to trade as normal, as does Thomas Cook India. Spain was the company's main destination. So far this year, more than1.3 million passengers have travelled to Spain on Thomas Cook Airlines,external. That does not include a further 1.6 million passengers who travelled on Condor Airlines, in which Thomas Cook has a 49% stake. The airline says it is still operating. A much-loved brand with humble roots Thomas Cook customers begin flying home The tourism sector in Spain's Balearic Islands faces millions of euros in losses. Thomas Cook has a tax office in Palma with hundreds of employees, and also works with 20 hotels in the Balearic Islands and 20 in the Canary Islands. JosÃ© MarÃ­a MaÃ±aricua, from the Federation of Hospitality and Tourism Entrepreneurs of Las Palmas, told El PaÃ­s that the collapse will have a ""dramatic"" impact on the Canary tourism sector. Turkey's Hoteliers Federation (TUROFED) has warned that the country could miss out on up to 700,000 tourists a year due to the collapse of the tour operator. According to official data, about 40 million tourists travelled to Turkey in 2018, bringing in $29.5 billion (Â£23.8 billion). The chairman of TUROFED, Osman Ayik, told Reuters: ""There are a large number of small businesses whose fates depend on Thomas Cook, especially in Mugla, Dalaman and Fethiye."" He added that some small hotels in Turkey are still owed around Â£100,000 â Â£200,000 ($125,000-$250,000). Turkey's tourism ministry has said that it is working on extending a loan-based support package for the affected businesses. There are currently 45,000 tourists in Turkey from the UK who booked through Thomas Cook. Goa, a winter holiday destination, was reliant on Thomas Cook charter flights which brought in about 2,000 tourists a week during October to March. This video can not be played Thomas Cook customers react to holiday firm collapse Savio Messias, president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa said: ""Thomas Cook is a very reputed company, bringing in British tourists. ""British tourists are loved by the local Goans and the hotel industry. Thomas Cook has been operating for the last 25-30 years in Goa and losing out on Thomas Cook is a big, big, blow to the industry."" He added thatseveral hotels face an uncertain future,externalas they were entirely depending on Thomas Cook. ""It was a very good business which we are going to miss,"" Mr Messias said. About 250,000 people travel annually to Cyprus with Thomas Cook, bringing an estimated â¬18.5 million (Â£16.3m, $20m), according to Cyprus' deputy tourism minister. Savvas Perdios said that the loss for hoteliers and the wider economy is about â¬50 million. He added that hotels were owed money for July, August and even September. Christos Efstathion, general manager of the Napa Plaza hotel told AFP news agency: ""It's a big anxiety...it's not only the current guests, it's how to deal with the immediate, medium and long-term future for the hotel."" He added that the hotel had 300 room nights booked through Thomas Cook until the end of this month with an additional 700 in October. Queues for the Thomas Cook counters in Crete on Monday A further 50,000 tourists are stranded in Greece, according to the tourism minister. Grigoris Tassios told local TV that hotels were expected to make losses on payments from the past two months. He added that hotel companies would attempt to recover money from Thomas Cook in court. ""This is an earthquake on a scale of seven, now we are waiting for the tsunami,"" Michalis Vlatakis, president of the Association of Travel Agents of Crete said.

What is the Supreme Court?,"Lady Hale, the brooch-wearing judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament was unlawful, has retired from the UK Supreme Court. Who will follow her as its president and what does the Supreme Court do? Lady Hale was president of the Supreme Court from September 2017 to January 2020 and oversaw the decision on the suspension of Parliament. She is among the most well-known judges in the world. Before she became a judge, she was the architect of the UK's internationally-recognised laws on the rights of children. As the first female justice,she has been critical of the lack of female representationon the body in the past. She stood down in 2020 in line with retirement rules for judges. Lord Reed is thenew Supreme Court president,external. The senior Scottish judge also sat in the European Court of Human Rights. He led the importantSupreme Court ruling that overturned high employment tribunal feeswhich had led to claims that people were being denied access to justice. Who is the new top judge at the Supreme Court? It is the highest court in the United Kingdom. The judges, known as justices, have the final say on the biggest legal issues. They are the ultimate check and balance on the UK's laws and constitution. Their job is no different to many comparable bodies in other countries. They rule on what a law means when there is a dispute. These are cases that raise what the court considers to be genuinely important points that affect the nation. This video can not be played The BBC's Clive Coleman takes a look inside the UK's Supreme Court Their judgements set out how a law should be interpreted and applied. Only a third of the cases that it is asked to rule on are heard by the Supreme Court. The court sits opposite the Houses of Parliament. Its location symbolises the relationship between the two. Parliament makes the laws and the Supreme Court oversees their ultimate interpretation and fair and just use. Over the course of its first 10 years of work, the court has delivered many judgements that have changed the nature of the UK. But its arguably most important case was 2019's decision to rule that Prime MinisterBoris Johnson had broken the law by proroguing (suspending) Parliament for five weeksas he faced division over the Brexit process. Lady Hale, wearing her spider brooch, reads out the Supreme Court's ruling on the suspension of Parliament The justices hear cases that have been considered in lower courts in any part of the United Kingdom, other than some issues from Northern Ireland and appeals against criminal convictions from Scotland. There is always an odd number of Supreme Court justices to decide on cases, so that if they disagree on the outcome, there is a majority ruling one way or the other. Since October 2009 it has heard and decided on more than 835 cases. Here are some examples: Two 2018 judgements meant the police could be sued for compensation,after 76-year-old Elizabeth Robinson was knocked overand whendetectives botched a solvable investigation into the John Worboys serial rapist case In 2016, the justices said a law about gang murderhad been wrongly interpreted for 30 years Three years later,justices backed end-of-life decisions Only Parliament can pass or cancel laws. The Supreme Court's role is to decide on the correct interpretation of those laws when there is a dispute. If the justices think a law conflicts with human rights safeguards, it can tell Parliament it should reconsider the legislation - but the government is under no legal obligation to act on that. New justices are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of a panel of legal experts from each of the UK's nations. Applicants must have been a High Court judge for at least two years or a practising lawyer for 15. These are the other members of the Supreme Court. Lord Hodgeis the deputy president and the second Scottish judge on the panel of 12. He specialises in commercial law, in particular intellectual property and land valuation. Lord Kerrwas Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland before joining the Supreme Court at its 2009 opening. As the only Northern Irish justice, he argued forfree NHS abortions to be given to Northern Irish womenwhen they travel to England, but the Supreme Court rejected the case. Lord Wilsonis one of the UK's most experienced judges in family law, having spent 12 years ruling on those cases. Lord Carnwathis an expert in company and commercial law. He has a particular interest in environmental law. Lady Blackis another expert in family law who has taught students at university and, from 2010, also sat as a Court of Appeal judge. Lord Lloyd-Jonesis the Supreme Court's judge from Wales and a Welsh speaker. He specialises in international law He chaired the Law Commission - which advises the government on which laws need reforming - up until 2015. Lord Briggswas appointed to the Court of Appeal in 2013. Three years later he became deputy head of civil justice. Lady Ardenwas a Court of Appeal judge for 18 years and another former head of the Law Commission. Lord Kitchinis an expert in the complex branch of commercial cases that deals with intellectual property, such as patents that protect an invention from being copied by a rival. Lord Saleswas inthe original court which ruled the government must ask Parliamentbefore invoking Article 50, the part of EU law which gives any country the right to leave the EU. This led to the Daily Mail labelling him and the other two judges as ""enemies of the people."" Lord Justice Hamblenis the newest member. He's been a senior judge since 2008, specialising in commercial law. Two more new justices are in the wings waiting to be sworn in later in the year as others retire. Since Mr Johnson lost the prorogation case, there has been a drip feed of stories implying the court got the decision wrong and will face reform. Some Conservatives say judges snatched powers they never had. The Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto pledged a constitutional review which would include the courts. It did not explicitly single out the Supreme Court for reform - so what may happen is unclear. Any attempt to water down the court's powers is likely to face a rocky road. Many lawyers would see this as an act of political revenge. No. There are two unrelated European Courts. TheEuropean Court of Justice(ECJ) oversees EU laws on trade and so on that are passed by the member states. When the UK leaves the EU, it will not be part of that system, unless it were to choose to be, as part of a deal. The entirely differentEuropean Court of Human Rights(ECtHR) was set up (largely at the instigation of the UK) to protect the rights of ordinary people across the continent from undemocratic use of power. It hears very few cases against the UK government as most human rights cases are dealt with by British judges. The Supreme Court takes into account the views of the ECtHR but is entitled to reject its conclusions.

"Rainforest belongs to us, says Brazil's leader","This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change President Jair Bolsonaro has insisted that the Brazilian areas of the Amazon rainforest are sovereign territory. Conservationists blame Mr Bolsonaro and his government for turning a blind eye to farmers and loggers clearing land in the Amazon, hastening deforestation. But in an address at the United Nations in New York, he struck a defiant note. He said it was a ""fallacy"" to describe the Amazon as the heritage of humanity and a ""misconception"" that its forests were the lungs of the world. Brazil - home to more than half the Amazon rainforest - has seena significant rise in the number of fires in 2019,external, according to US space agency Nasa and others. This video can not be played ""It's extremely upsetting... to see this kind of devastation"" - the BBC's Will Grant flew over northern Rondonia state in late August 2019 Environmentalists say the far-right Mr Bolsonaro's policies have led to an increase in fires this year, and that he has encouraged cattle farmers and loggers to clear large areas of the rainforest since his election last October. Are Amazon fires as bad as they seem? Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Mr Bolsonaro criticised what he described as sensational reporting in the international media. ""Using and resorting to these fallacies, certain countries, instead of helping ... behaved in a disrespectful manner and with a colonialist spirit,"" he said. ""They even called into question that which we hold as a most sacred value, our sovereignty."" Mr Bolsonaro was speaking the day after an impassioned speech from teenage Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, who accused world leaders of betraying young people in favour of what she described as ""fairy tales of eternal economic growth"". This video can not be played ""You are failing us"" - Greta tells world leaders The Brazilian president defended his government's treatment of indigenous people, saying many backed his policies. ""Some people both inside and outside Brazil... have insisted on treating and keeping our Indians as though they were real cave men,"" he said. More than 800,000 indigenous people live in 450 demarcated indigenous territories across Brazil, about 12% of Brazil's total territory. Most are located in the Amazon region and some groups still live completely isolated and without outside contact. President Bolsonaro, who took office in January, has repeatedly questioned whether these demarcated territories - which are enshrined in Brazil's constitution - should continue to exist, arguing that their size is disproportionate to the number of indigenous people living there. His plans to open up these territories for mining, logging and agriculture are controversial. Mr Bolsonaro's visit to New York has sparked several protests by environmentalists. He has drawn intense domestic and international criticism for failing to protect the Amazon region, a vital carbon store that slows the pace of global warming. By Will Grant, BBC Latin America correspondent, ParÃ¡ state A burned area of Amazon forest in Para state The state of ParÃ¡ is often considered the epicentre of the environmental crisis in the Amazon. From above, the range of different pressures and stresses being put onto the rainforest by human activity is abundantly clear. As our light aircraft swooped down, the scar of open land interrupting the forest canopy revealed itself to be a vast series of illegal gold mines. The runoff and slurry were so extensive that they resembled a river - but a toxic one contaminated by mercury, which seeps into the Amazon's waterways and ecosystems. It is not just mining, either. In the part of the Amazon we visited, a recent wildfire had consumed an area of forest the size of 1,600 football pitches in just four days. In the Amazonian town of Alter do ChÃ£o, opinion was split between those urging greater protection for the forest and those saying further development was needed to bring in jobs. Yet everyone I spoke to agreed that the Amazon rainforest was a living, breathing resource that must be respected - and that fire, mining and large-scale agriculture were doing nothing but harm.

Government urged to bring in 'frequent flyer levy'The Committee on Climate Change says the extra tax would help curb the growing demand for air travel.BusinessComments,"Frequent flyers should face higher taxes to help tackle aviation emissions, the governmentâs climate advisers say. The Committee on Climate Change says a âfrequent flyer levyâ would help curb the growing demand for air travel. Analysis shows that 70% of UK flights are made by a wealthy 15% of the population,external, with 57% not flying abroad at all. The government says it will study the recommendations. Aviation is set to be the biggest source of UK emissions by 2050. And at the moment, ministers are planning for an increase of up to 49% in flying. But the committee says growth should be limited to 25% of current levels. The CCC said frequent flyers were a large part of the problem, but it is not clear how a levy would work in practice. For instance, would it apply to businesses at a time when the UK wants to stimulate trade with other nations? And how would you stop people pretending their flights were for work purposes to avoid paying it? Other solutions could include increasing taxes on airlines, or restricting airport capacity, the committee said. But it warned that if the planned expansion of Heathrow airport went ahead, it would leave very little growth room at other UK airports. The government has been hoping to solve problems of aviation emissions through new technology, including battery-powered short-haul planes and long-haul planes running on sustainable biofuels. The committee says aviation emissions could be reduced by about 20% from today to 2050 through improvements to fuel efficiency. But electric planes will only be suitable for small short-haul journeys for the foreseeable future, critics say. What is more, the aviation industry has been struggling to develop adequate biofuels. And all plant-based material is likely to be contested by different industries as the century wears on. Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train? Climate change: Which airline is best for carbon emissions? Heathrow reveals expansion 'masterplan' Young will pick up climate change bill, advisers warn In a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, the committee chairman, Lord Deben, writes that the industry is âhighly unlikelyâ to be able to eliminate emissions by 2050 by technical means. He warns that contrails - the trails of condensed water left by aircraft at high altitude - add to the warming impact of flying, even though currently their effects are poorly understood. Lord Deben says the UK should continue pushing for strong international policies on aviation. Currently the airline industry is hoping to counterbalance its emissions through the controversial practice of offsetting, in which firms agree to pay for, say, tree-planting in developing countries. But many such schemes have been discredited. Cait Hewitt, from the Aviation Environment Federation, said: âBritish people currently take more international flights than anyone else in the world, but thereâs a growing public recognition that this feels out of step with the action we need on climate change. âThe governmentâs dodged the issue of aviation emissions for too long. Itâs worth remembering that demand for aviation growth is being driven by a minority of frequent flyers - 70% of UK flights are made by just 15% of the population.â Neil Robinson, from the industry group Sustainable Aviation, urged the government not to adopt stand-alone UK policies on aviation pollution. He said: âBy investing tens of billions of pounds in new, cleaner aircraft we have already decoupled growth in aviation from growth in emissions, and as a global industry we have a long-established plan to halve our emissions by 2050. âCarbon reduction, however, is a global issue requiring a global response, with governments and industry working closely together for emissions to be managed within an international framework."" A government spokesman said: âWe are also committed to setting a clear ambition for the aviation sector and will carefully consider the advice of the Committee on Climate Change when we publish our position on aviation and climate change for consultation shortly.â Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train?

Uber's London licence renewed for two months,"Ride-hailing firm Uber has had its right to operate in London extended for two months. The firm lost its licence in 2017 due to public safety concerns, after which a judge granted a 15-month extension which was due to expire on Wednesday. Transport for London (TfL) said its licence would now be renewed temporarily while it requested additional information from the firm. Uber must also meet new conditions on passenger safety, it said. It means the ride-sharing firm must wait until November to find out if it will be granted another full five-year licence. If it is not, it may have to stop trading in London, its most important European market. Uber has faced push-back from regulators and traditional taxi services in a number of countries after beingdogged by controversyfor a number of years. What do drivers think of Uber? Uber shares tumble as profit figures disappoint In London, TfL rejected Uber's licence renewal request in 2017, due to failings in the firm's approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks. Jamie Heywood, Uber's regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said on Tuesday that Uber would ""continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information"". He added: ""Over the past two years, we've launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our clean air plan is helping to tackle air pollution."" About 45,000 drivers work for Uber in London, and if its licence is ultimately rejected all of them could lose their jobs. The GMB union, which represents Uber drivers, said the firm has had ""more chances than a game of monopoly"". Regional officer Steve Garelick said: ""A two month licence extension is no good for anyone - it leaves uncertainty for drivers and passengers, meanwhile Uber still operates an unsafe model on the streets of London. ""Transport for London has simply kicked the can down the road and shown no regard for drivers or public safety."" Last year, a judge granted Uber a probationary 15-month licence to operate in London after the firm said it had made changes to its business model. But TfL said the new two-month licence would come with ""new conditions to ensure passenger safety"", covering things like insurance and driver document checks. It added: ""Uber London Limited has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.""

"Thomas Cook latest: 16,500 passengers due back","Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk 95% of passengers returned to UK on Monday Thomas Cook customers told to expect 'bumpiness' 22,000 jobs at risk after Thomas Cook collapse Dearbail Jordan and Simon Read The travel company has collapsed, affecting hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers. So what happens next? That's it for today. We'll be back from 6am on Wednesday morning. Do join us then for all the latest breaking news and analysis, including the latest on Thomas Cook. Married couple Hayley and Dan fear financial worries after both losing their Thomas Cook jobs Thomas Cook staff say they have been stranded overseas and fear they will not receive thousands of pounds in wages, following the collapse of the world's oldest tour operator. Hayley, 36, a member of the cabin crew for 15 years, was watching the news unfold at home. She told the BBC: ""At first, we were devastated at learning the news. ""Now it transpires that it seems to have been a long time coming. ""I feel let down. I feel like I've been thrown under a bus."" Read more here One enterprising company is doing well out of Lady Hale's sudden fame. Balcony Shirts, a small independent shop in Uxbridge, designed a spider t-shirt this morning in her honour. So far, almost 2,000 t-shirts have been sold and the product is trending on eBay. The company is giving 30% of the proceeds from each Â£10 t-shirt to homeless charity Shelter. Scott Balcony, a spokesperson for the firm, said so far they'd raised over Â£5,000 for the charity. ""We designed it this morning and then the orders started coming in,"" he says. The FTSE 100 fell 34.65, or 0.47%, today to 7,291.43. Meanwhile the FTSE 250 dropped 124.72, or 0.62%, to 19,919.07. Shares in struggling Metro Bank slumped a third today after investors turned their back on its Â£200m bond sale launched on Monday. Shares closed at a record low of 176.68, after falling 95.92, or 35.19%. The shares were floated at Â£20 a share in 2016 and rallied to levels around Â£40 in 2018. The Bank has now lost nine-tenths of its stock market valuation this year. On Monday, the CAA started repatriating British holidaymakers who were abroad at the time that Thomas Cook collapsed. Dame Deirdre Hutton, CAA chairwoman, described Monday as ""a pretty good day for a first day"". She told BBC 5 Live's Wake Up to Money: ""We ran 64 flights, we brought back just under 15,000 people. That was over 90% of those we intended to bring back."" There will be more than 1,000 flights between now and Sunday 6 October to repatriate the remaining 135,300 holidaymakers, with 74 of those, returning more than 16,800 people, scheduled for Tuesday. The CAA has set up a dedicated website,externalto keep Thomas Cook customers updated with the latest advice and news. Before becoming US president, Donald Trump played golf at Menie It appears to be business as usual in Scotland where plans for a second golf course at US President Donald Trump's resort in Aberdeenshire have been approved. The 18-hole MacLeod course would be built to the south and west of the controversial original course, which opened at Menie in 2012. Councillors on the Formartine area committee approved the plans for the second course by eight votes to four. Permission forthe resort- including houses, holiday homes and a hotel - was granted in 2008. Rachel
Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrialâ¯Strategy Committee, has spoken out about the Thomas Cook collapse. She said: The public will be rightly appalled that as Thomas Cook mounted up debt and as the company headed for trouble, company bosses were happily pocketing hefty pay-packages. Now, in the aftermath of the companyâs collapse, as frustrated travellers are stuck abroad, when holidays are being cancelled and thousands of staff are losing their jobs, there are serious questions to answer, including about the companyâs accounting practices, its renumeration policy and practice, and about the stewardship of the company.  Hayley Hook and her family are on holiday in Greece. She told the BBC they have been forced to give their credit card details to hotel staff and that at one point, security guards were brought in (pictured above) - although they have since left. She posted on Facebook that the hotel was demanding â¬50 (Â£44) per person, per room per night and it said if they did not pay, it would stop supplying them with food and drink. The industry insurance fund ATOL, which covers payments in the event of a firm failing, will cover any bills for rooms and food that are run up this week following Thomas Cook's collapse. Read more Holidaymakers who were abroad when Thomas Cook folded have been telling the BBC that their hotels have been demanding extra money from them. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)says people should not make extra payments.,external But Jess Beeton, on holiday with her partner Richard Berrington, said ""everyone who booked through Thomas Cook has been locked out of the rooms"". She added: ""The only option we were given was to pay what Thomas Cook hasn't, or get our stuff and leave.""

Chelsea is paying for alternative travel for fans who booked through Thomas Cook to see the club's Champions League away clash with Lille. The club has also agreed to pick up the tab for new travel arrangements for fans who booked travel through Thomas Cook for its Premier League clash at Southampton on 6 October. Manchester United meanwhile is offering fans who bought a match package from Thomas Cook the opportunity to buy a replacement match ticket for the same match, as long as they have a copy of their 'Thomas Cook Sport Booking Confirmation' PDF, as well as proof of purchase. One former Thomas Cook worker - who asked to remain anonymous - reports on the pleasingly positive reaction they've received. As a former staff member of TC, we are hunting for jobs! The response has been amazing from our colleagues and regional managers and also other businesses who have kindly helped with recruitment etc. My Facebook has been awash with sunny hearts and our conference call this morning with our amazing regional manager really got the tears flowing. Fingers crossed we are all sorted soon.  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Some Thomas Cook customers have expressed their fears of a double whammy after the company's collapse. These are people who have not only bought holidays from Thomas Cook, but insurance too. There is clearly a chance that the insurance may be needed. However, Thomas Cook's Roam travel insurance was underwritten by White Horse Insurance Ireland. Although the BBC has been unable to contact White Horse, a recorded message on its phone line says that, although busy, it continues to operate as normal. White Horse is based in the Irish Republic, underwrites policies for various travel operators, and would come under the jurisdiction of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman of Ireland should customers have any complaints.

Please get in touch with your comments and questions at bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Josh Hardie The Confederation of British Industries has welcomed an inquiry into âhigh payâ at the collapsed Thomas Cook. Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said: Questions are now rightly being asked about directorsâ remuneration and decision-making. Disproportionate rewards are a lightning rod for public discontent, so high pay can only ever be justified by high performance over the long term.  Revenues at Manchester United have hit a record Â£627m for the year to July. This was despite the club enduring a ""turbulent season"" in 2018-19 that saw the departure of manager Jose Mourinho and the team finish in sixth place. Broadcast revenue soared by 18%, thanks to a new Uefa Champions League broadcasting deal, while commercial income was flat.

Manchester United revenues hit new record high,"Revenues at Manchester United have hit a record Â£627m for the year to July. This was despite the football club enduring a ""turbulent season"" in 2018-19 that saw the departure of manager Jose Mourinho and the team finish sixth in the Premier League. Broadcast revenue soared by 18% thanks to a new Uefa Champions League deal, while commercial income was flat. But the team expects revenue and profit to fall in 2019-20 after it failed to make the Champions League this season. The New York-listed club is currently eighth in the UK's Premier League after a flat start to the campaign. That leaves it 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, and five points behind cross-town rivals and reigning champions Manchester City. 'Everyone' at Man Utd working on revival There is now a danger of the club falling behind their traditional rivals in mainland Europe for the right to be branded the world's richest. Last week, Spanish giant Barcelona announced it expected to pass the â¬1bn ($1.1bn; Â£883m) income mark for the first time this season. Despite the record revenues executive, Manchester United's vice-chairman Ed Woodward said the club still valued playing success on the field most highly. He said: ""We remain focused on our plan of rebuilding the team and continuing to strengthen our youth system, in line with the philosophy of the club and the manager. ""Everyone at Manchester United is committed to delivering on our primary objective of winning trophies."" For the current financial year he forecast revenue of Â£560m to Â£580m, down from Â£627.1m, and core profit of Â£155m to Â£165m, down from Â£185.8m. The club said that during the past year it had signed three new first team players and completed several key player contract extensions. It said it had also announced 10 new or renewed global sponsorship deals, and that - as measured by Kantar - its total number of fans and followers globally had increased to 1.1 billion. During the year the Old Trafford club also made an operating profit of Â£50m. Staff wages for the year, mostly spent on players, were Â£332.3m, an increase of Â£36.m, or 12.3%, on the previous year, ""primarily due to investment in the first team squad"". The club spent more than half of its income on player wages, despite a campaign in which no trophies were won.

Married couple Hayley and Dan fear financial worries after both losing their Thomas Cook jobs Thomas Cook staff say they have been stranded overseas and fear they will not receive thousands of pounds in wages, following the collapse of the world's oldest tour operator. Hayley, 36, a member of the cabin crew for 15 years, was watching the news unfold at home. She told the BBC: ""At first, we were devastated at learning the news. ""Now it transpires that it seems to have been a long time coming. ""I feel let down. I feel like I've been thrown under a bus.""

So far, almost 2,000 t-shirts have been sold and the product is trending on eBay. The company is giving 30% of the proceeds from each Â£10 t-shirt to homeless charity Shelter. Scott Balcony, a spokesperson for the firm, said so far they'd raised over Â£5,000 for the charity. ""We designed it this morning and then the orders started coming in,"" he says.

Shares closed at a record low of 176.68, after falling 95.92, or 35.19%. The shares were floated at Â£20 a share in 2016 and rallied to levels around Â£40 in 2018. The Bank has now lost nine-tenths of its stock market valuation this year. On Monday, the CAA started repatriating British holidaymakers who were abroad at the time that Thomas Cook collapsed. Dame Deirdre Hutton, CAA chairwoman, described Monday as ""a pretty good day for a first day"". She told BBC 5 Live's Wake Up to Money: ""We ran 64 flights, we brought back just under 15,000 people. That was over 90% of those we intended to bring back."" There will be more than 1,000 flights between now and Sunday 6 October to repatriate the remaining 135,300 holidaymakers, with 74 of those, returning more than 16,800 people, scheduled for Tuesday. The CAA has set up a dedicated website,externalto keep Thomas Cook customers updated with the latest advice and news. Before becoming US president, Donald Trump played golf at Menie It appears to be business as usual in Scotland where plans for a second golf course at US President Donald Trump's resort in Aberdeenshire have been approved. The 18-hole MacLeod course would be built to the south and west of the controversial original course, which opened at Menie in 2012. Councillors on the Formartine area committee approved the plans for the second course by eight votes to four. Permission forthe resort- including houses, holiday homes and a hotel - was granted in 2008. Rachel
Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrialâ¯Strategy Committee, has spoken out about the Thomas Cook collapse. She said: The public will be rightly appalled that as Thomas Cook mounted up debt and as the company headed for trouble, company bosses were happily pocketing hefty pay-packages. Now, in the aftermath of the companyâs collapse, as frustrated travellers are stuck abroad, when holidays are being cancelled and thousands of staff are losing their jobs, there are serious questions to answer, including about the companyâs accounting practices, its renumeration policy and practice, and about the stewardship of the company.

Thomas Cook collapse: Your rights explained,"Thomas Cook has collapsed, triggering the biggest ever peacetime repatriation aimed at bringing more than 150,000 British holidaymakers home. The company, its customers and staff had hoped for a rescue deal, but now that last hope has gone, they will be looking at the practicalities for the near future. About 800,000 British people had future bookings and the company had 9,000 employees in the UK. Anyone who has bought a package holiday will be covered by theAir Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol),external. You would have received an Atol certificate when you booked. This means you will not be going away, but the cost of the holiday will be refunded. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will be launching an online service to manage all refunds on Monday, 7 October. It has asked people not to submit anything to the CAA before then. The CAA said all refunds should be processed within two months of a claim form being submitted properly. Customers who were paying by direct debit should be refunded within 14 days, The majority of Thomas Cook holidays are packages. Stating the obvious, everything that was paid for as part of the package - such as flights, accommodation, and excursions - will be refunded. Some holidaymakers might have paid separately for airport parking or car hire while away. In this situation, they would need to make a claim from their travel insurer for the cost. In more extreme cases, such as a wedding, there may be a host of other things that could be affected. Specialist cover, such as wedding insurance, may be the only route for those left out of pocket. No. Holidaymakers with package deals get a refund, as that is what the Atol protection states. Booking a new holiday in the very near future might have got more expensive. Some other operators which used Thomas Cook flights will try to switch their customers to an alternative at no extra cost. Others may be on cruises organised and paid through Thomas Cook. It is best to contact those operators directly as they will be prepared to explain the status of the holiday. The Atol protection covers packages, not flight-only deals. So that means you would not get an automatic refund. The main alternative is claiming a refund from the provider of the credit or debit card you used, so-called section 75 rules. Otherwise you may need to make a claim on travel insurance. That is why it is always advised to buy travel insurance at the same time as booking a holiday. Analysis by data company Defaqto shows that 45% of travel insurance policies do not cover the collapse of an airline, so not everyone will be covered. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers says: ""As a last resort, travel insurance with scheduled airline failure cover can cover the cost of a flight when the airline has gone into administration. A travel insurance policy with travel disruption cover will cover the cost of new travel arrangements."" Thomas Cook collapses as last-ditch rescue talks fail Thomas Cook latest: Repatriation begins Thomas Cook: What went wrong? There may be a little more protection if the hotel you booked was linked to the flight, such as a click-through when booking the flight. That could be covered by the Atol scheme. Anyone who bought a Thomas Cook package that did not include a flight may be covered under the separate Abta scheme. At the moment, enjoy your break as much as you can - do not cut it short. That said, the repatriation operation will only run up to and including Sunday 6 October. After that, travellers would have to make their own plans, although those covered by Atol will be refunded. Hoteliers will be paid via the Atol scheme, so they should not ask for any extra payment from holidaymakers. UK package holiday customers will be brought home ""as close as possible"" to their booked return date, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said. They must take their original ticket information with them and will be issued with a fresh boarding card for their flight. Customers will be on special free flights or booked on to another scheduled airline at no extra cost, with details of each flight to beposted on a dedicated CAA website,externalas soon as they are available, up to 72 hours before its scheduled departure. The CAA said some people might be flown to different UK airports from the ones originally scheduled, but free transfers would be provided. The DfT added that a ""small number"" of passengers might need to book their own flight home and reclaim the costs. Thomas Cook had 600,000 customers on holiday from around the world, including more than 150,000 from the UK, so it will be a huge logistical challenge. When the Monarch airline collapsed, there were arguments fora better repatriation system,external, but nothing has been implemented as yet. It looks like any direct debit to Thomas Cook is pointless, but most people will not need to cancel it. If a direct debit is due to be taken on Tuesday, then you should cancel it straight away with your bank, according to banking trade body UK Finance. Any payments from other customers at a later date will not be processed owing to the insolvency. Any money that has been paid towards a package holiday already should be refunded via the Atol scheme, so you will need to make a claim for it in due course. The same is true of a deposit. Nothing is clear on that yet. It is highly likely that gift cards or vouchers will be worthless, consumer experts say. It will depend on what happens to the company - whether it is rekindled and whether any vouchers would then be honoured. If they are useless, then the person who bought it might be able to make a claim to their credit card provider if it was a generous gift of more than Â£100, or their debit card provider for less. There is better news for those with a pre-paid Thomas Cook currency card, as any funds held on that are protected separately from the company, so will not be lost. Thomas Cook ran domesticticket and hotel packages for sporting events. As the business has ceased trading, they would no longer be valid, although anyone with trips planned could try contacting the destination direct. For example, Thomas Cook would have sold 360 hospitality packages for home matches at Liverpool football club's Anfield ground. ""We are currently assessing the impact of Thomas Cook ceasing trading and the impact for those supporters who have purchased packages from Thomas Cook. Once we have those details from Thomas Cook, we will update supporters,"" the football club said. Some people had booked travel and tickets for the forthcoming American football games in London through Thomas Cook. The NFL said it was investigating and would give further information soon. As most people would not have any insurance cover for such a trip, a refund claim would probably have to be made to the provider of the credit or debit card used to pay. While customers will be worried about their holidays, staff will be heartbroken about their livelihoods. Staff are being informed about what has happened to their jobs, with written confirmation to follow. A group of special managers, from accountancy firm KPMG, have been appointed and will contact staff with a case reference number which will allow them tomake a claim for redundancy payments,external. The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) should step in to protect the more than 13,000 members of Thomas Cook's four pension schemes. Workers who are over the age of their normal retirement will get full benefits, while those who have not yet reached normal retirement age will be paid 90% of their promised pension, up to a cap of Â£40,000. Members with bigger pensions will get at least 50% of their old age pensions, under PPF rules. Meanwhile, the 3,000 or so retired members of Thomas Cook's pension schemes will continue to have their pensions paid in full by the trustees. Were you a member of staff at Thomas Cook?

What is the court that ruled against the PM?,"Lady Hale, the brooch-wearing judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament was unlawful, has retired from the UK Supreme Court. Who will follow her as its president and what does the Supreme Court do? Lady Hale was president of the Supreme Court from September 2017 to January 2020 and oversaw the decision on the suspension of Parliament. She is among the most well-known judges in the world. Before she became a judge, she was the architect of the UK's internationally-recognised laws on the rights of children. As the first female justice,she has been critical of the lack of female representationon the body in the past. She stood down in 2020 in line with retirement rules for judges. Lord Reed is thenew Supreme Court president,external. The senior Scottish judge also sat in the European Court of Human Rights. He led the importantSupreme Court ruling that overturned high employment tribunal feeswhich had led to claims that people were being denied access to justice. Who is the new top judge at the Supreme Court? It is the highest court in the United Kingdom. The judges, known as justices, have the final say on the biggest legal issues. They are the ultimate check and balance on the UK's laws and constitution. Their job is no different to many comparable bodies in other countries. They rule on what a law means when there is a dispute. These are cases that raise what the court considers to be genuinely important points that affect the nation. This video can not be played The BBC's Clive Coleman takes a look inside the UK's Supreme Court Their judgements set out how a law should be interpreted and applied. Only a third of the cases that it is asked to rule on are heard by the Supreme Court. The court sits opposite the Houses of Parliament. Its location symbolises the relationship between the two. Parliament makes the laws and the Supreme Court oversees their ultimate interpretation and fair and just use. Over the course of its first 10 years of work, the court has delivered many judgements that have changed the nature of the UK. But its arguably most important case was 2019's decision to rule that Prime MinisterBoris Johnson had broken the law by proroguing (suspending) Parliament for five weeksas he faced division over the Brexit process. Lady Hale, wearing her spider brooch, reads out the Supreme Court's ruling on the suspension of Parliament The justices hear cases that have been considered in lower courts in any part of the United Kingdom, other than some issues from Northern Ireland and appeals against criminal convictions from Scotland. There is always an odd number of Supreme Court justices to decide on cases, so that if they disagree on the outcome, there is a majority ruling one way or the other. Since October 2009 it has heard and decided on more than 835 cases. Here are some examples: Two 2018 judgements meant the police could be sued for compensation,after 76-year-old Elizabeth Robinson was knocked overand whendetectives botched a solvable investigation into the John Worboys serial rapist case In 2016, the justices said a law about gang murderhad been wrongly interpreted for 30 years Three years later,justices backed end-of-life decisions Only Parliament can pass or cancel laws. The Supreme Court's role is to decide on the correct interpretation of those laws when there is a dispute. If the justices think a law conflicts with human rights safeguards, it can tell Parliament it should reconsider the legislation - but the government is under no legal obligation to act on that. New justices are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of a panel of legal experts from each of the UK's nations. Applicants must have been a High Court judge for at least two years or a practising lawyer for 15. These are the other members of the Supreme Court. Lord Hodgeis the deputy president and the second Scottish judge on the panel of 12. He specialises in commercial law, in particular intellectual property and land valuation. Lord Kerrwas Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland before joining the Supreme Court at its 2009 opening. As the only Northern Irish justice, he argued forfree NHS abortions to be given to Northern Irish womenwhen they travel to England, but the Supreme Court rejected the case. Lord Wilsonis one of the UK's most experienced judges in family law, having spent 12 years ruling on those cases. Lord Carnwathis an expert in company and commercial law. He has a particular interest in environmental law. Lady Blackis another expert in family law who has taught students at university and, from 2010, also sat as a Court of Appeal judge. Lord Lloyd-Jonesis the Supreme Court's judge from Wales and a Welsh speaker.

What is the court that ruled against government?,"Lady Hale, the brooch-wearing judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament was unlawful, has retired from the UK Supreme Court. Who will follow her as its president and what does the Supreme Court do? Lady Hale was president of the Supreme Court from September 2017 to January 2020 and oversaw the decision on the suspension of Parliament. She is among the most well-known judges in the world. Before she became a judge, she was the architect of the UK's internationally-recognised laws on the rights of children. As the first female justice,she has been critical of the lack of female representationon the body in the past. She stood down in 2020 in line with retirement rules for judges. Lord Reed is thenew Supreme Court president,external. The senior Scottish judge also sat in the European Court of Human Rights. He led the importantSupreme Court ruling that overturned high employment tribunal feeswhich had led to claims that people were being denied access to justice. Who is the new top judge at the Supreme Court? It is the highest court in the United Kingdom. The judges, known as justices, have the final say on the biggest legal issues. They are the ultimate check and balance on the UK's laws and constitution. Their job is no different to many comparable bodies in other countries. They rule on what a law means when there is a dispute. These are cases that raise what the court considers to be genuinely important points that affect the nation. This video can not be played The BBC's Clive Coleman takes a look inside the UK's Supreme Court Their judgements set out how a law should be interpreted and applied. Only a third of the cases that it is asked to rule on are heard by the Supreme Court. The court sits opposite the Houses of Parliament. Its location symbolises the relationship between the two. Parliament makes the laws and the Supreme Court oversees their ultimate interpretation and fair and just use. Over the course of its first 10 years of work, the court has delivered many judgements that have changed the nature of the UK. But its arguably most important case was 2019's decision to rule that Prime MinisterBoris Johnson had broken the law by proroguing (suspending) Parliament for five weeksas he faced division over the Brexit process. Lady Hale, wearing her spider brooch, reads out the Supreme Court's ruling on the suspension of Parliament The justices hear cases that have been considered in lower courts in any part of the United Kingdom, other than some issues from Northern Ireland and appeals against criminal convictions from Scotland. There is always an odd number of Supreme Court justices to decide on cases, so that if they disagree on the outcome, there is a majority ruling one way or the other. Since October 2009 it has heard and decided on more than 835 cases. Here are some examples: Two 2018 judgements meant the police could be sued for compensation,after 76-year-old Elizabeth Robinson was knocked overand whendetectives botched a solvable investigation into the John Worboys serial rapist case In 2016, the justices said a law about gang murderhad been wrongly interpreted for 30 years Three years later,justices backed end-of-life decisions Only Parliament can pass or cancel laws. The Supreme Court's role is to decide on the correct interpretation of those laws when there is a dispute. If the justices think a law conflicts with human rights safeguards, it can tell Parliament it should reconsider the legislation - but the government is under no legal obligation to act on that.

Supreme Court ruling: Your questions answered,"The UK Supreme Courthas ruled unanimously that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament broke the law. We've answered a sample of the questions we received from readers on this subject. The Supreme Court does not go as far as Scotland's Court of Session, which said that the PM had ""an improper purpose"" when he advised the Queen to prorogue Parliament. However,the Supreme Court judgement,externalsaid: ""It is impossible for us to conclude on the evidence... that there was any reason - let alone a good reason - to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament for five weeks."" Supreme Court judgement: The key lines The Supreme Court case was not about criminal law, but constitutional law, says BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani. As such, the PM broke the rules that govern how the UK functions, by breaching Parliament's right to hold the government to account. If someone complained to the police about misconduct of public office, the police would have to assess it accordingly. However, the bar to prove a criminal offence is very high and there is no suggestion the prime minister broke the law in this way. Gina Miller had appealed against the English High Court's decision that the prorogation was ""purely political"" and not a matter for the courts There is a procedure giving MPs the right to impeach a member of government,as Labour MP Liam Byrne has suggested,external. However, Parliament says that ""for all practical purposes the procedure of impeachment is obsolete"". The last time an impeachment case was prosecuted was in 1806, but the attempt was unsuccessful. In 2004, a cross-party group of MPs, including Boris Johnson, tabled a motion to impeach Tony Blair for his role in the Iraq war. This motion was never debated. Despite the ruling, Mr Johnson says he still wants to hold a Queen's Speech. The speech marks the start of a new session of Parliament, where the Queen reads out a list of laws the government hopes to pass over the next year or so. The Supreme Court ruling does not prevent Mr Johnson from suspending Parliament again, as long as it does not stop it from carrying out its duties ""without reasonable justification"". So if Mr Johnson wants a Queen's Speech on 14 October (as originally intended), he could prorogue Parliament a day or two beforehand so that preparations can be made. Will the Queen's Speech still happen? That will depend on when and if Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn calls one. If the leader of the opposition introduces the motion, convention means the government will provide time for a debate to take place. So far, no such move has been announced. If one more MP votes in favour of, than against, a motion, ""that this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government,"" then either an alternative government must be formed within 14 days or a general election is triggered. A complicating factor is that, if a vote of no confidence was successful now and a general election was triggered, it could mean Brexit taking place during the election campaign. It's still widely expected that there will be an early election at some point, but the timing is very unclear. What is a vote of no confidence? No, even if it wanted to, it couldn't. The European Court of Justice only rules on issues relating to the interpretation of EU law and disputes between member states. Because this is a domestic constitutional issue, the European court has no jurisdiction. As such, the government has no further opportunities to appeal against the decision, as the Supreme Court is the highest in the UK. Supreme Court president Lady Hale said the decision was unanimous, meaning all 11 justices agreed that the prorogation was unlawful. The justices are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of a panel of legal experts from each of the UK's nations. Applicants must have been a High Court judge for at least two years, or a practising lawyer for 15. What is the Supreme Court? It's already the case that decisions by government can be challenged in the courts. One of the functions of the judiciary is to oversee the appropriate use of power by public bodies, including the government, through a process called judicial review. The courts can't challenge every government decision, only those that fall into the grounds for judicial review - that is, if a body is failing in its legal duty to act in a certain way, or it is acting in a way that goes beyond its legal powers. In this case it ruled that there was ""no doubt that the courts have jurisdiction"". The Supreme Court doesn't say it would. What it does say is that one of Parliament's main responsibilities is to scrutinise the government, particularly at important moments, such as in the run up to Brexit. By proroguing Parliament for five weeks ""without reasonable justification"", the government had prevented Parliament from carrying out this job. Recess does not happen automatically. MPs get a vote on it - unlike whether Parliament is prorogued. Because of prorogation, MPs did not vote on whether to break for the political conferences. As they are not on recess, they can return to Parliament - and Commons Speaker John Bercow says this will happen on Wednesday. Yes it does. Parliament effectively goes back in time to 9 September, the day before prorogation took place. All the bills which were thrown out will be reinstated. This includes the trade bill and four other Brexit-related bills relating to immigration, agriculture, financial services and fisheries. It also brings back five other bills concerning, for example, domestic abuse, animal cruelty and divorce law reform. The bills will now pick up from the stage they had reached. There is very little discretion for the Queen when it comes to decisions such as prorogation, says the BBC's royal correspondent Jonny Dymond, as she acts on the advice of the prime minister. ""That advice, if you will, is with a capital A - she is effectively being told to prorogue.""

What is the court that ruled against government?In full: Court statement on 'unlawful' suspensionWhat questions do you have on ruling?,"Lady Hale, the brooch-wearing judge who delivered the ruling that Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament was unlawful, has retired from the UK Supreme Court. Who will follow her as its president and what does the Supreme Court do? Lady Hale was president of the Supreme Court from September 2017 to January 2020 and oversaw the decision on the suspension of Parliament. She is among the most well-known judges in the world. Before she became a judge, she was the architect of the UK's internationally-recognised laws on the rights of children. As the first female justice,she has been critical of the lack of female representationon the body in the past. She stood down in 2020 in line with retirement rules for judges. Lord Reed is thenew Supreme Court president,external. The senior Scottish judge also sat in the European Court of Human Rights. He led the importantSupreme Court ruling that overturned high employment tribunal feeswhich had led to claims that people were being denied access to justice. Who is the new top judge at the Supreme Court? It is the highest court in the United Kingdom. The judges, known as justices, have the final say on the biggest legal issues. They are the ultimate check and balance on the UK's laws and constitution. Their job is no different to many comparable bodies in other countries. They rule on what a law means when there is a dispute. These are cases that raise what the court considers to be genuinely important points that affect the nation. This video can not be played The BBC's Clive Coleman takes a look inside the UK's Supreme Court Their judgements set out how a law should be interpreted and applied. Only a third of the cases that it is asked to rule on are heard by the Supreme Court. The court sits opposite the Houses of Parliament. Its location symbolises the relationship between the two. Parliament makes the laws and the Supreme Court oversees their ultimate interpretation and fair and just use. Over the course of its first 10 years of work, the court has delivered many judgements that have changed the nature of the UK. But its arguably most important case was 2019's decision to rule that Prime MinisterBoris Johnson had broken the law by proroguing (suspending) Parliament for five weeksas he faced division over the Brexit process. Lady Hale, wearing her spider brooch, reads out the Supreme Court's ruling on the suspension of Parliament The justices hear cases that have been considered in lower courts in any part of the United Kingdom, other than some issues from Northern Ireland and appeals against criminal convictions from Scotland. There is always an odd number of Supreme Court justices to decide on cases, so that if they disagree on the outcome, there is a majority ruling one way or the other. Since October 2009 it has heard and decided on more than 835 cases. Here are some examples: Two 2018 judgements meant the police could be sued for compensation,after 76-year-old Elizabeth Robinson was knocked overand whendetectives botched a solvable investigation into the John Worboys serial rapist case In 2016, the justices said a law about gang murderhad been wrongly interpreted for 30 years Three years later,justices backed end-of-life decisions Only Parliament can pass or cancel laws. The Supreme Court's role is to decide on the correct interpretation of those laws when there is a dispute. If the justices think a law conflicts with human rights safeguards, it can tell Parliament it should reconsider the legislation - but the government is under no legal obligation to act on that. New justices are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of a panel of legal experts from each of the UK's nations. Applicants must have been a High Court judge for at least two years or a practising lawyer for 15. These are the other members of the Supreme Court. Lord Hodgeis the deputy president and the second Scottish judge on the panel of 12. He specialises in commercial law, in particular intellectual property and land valuation. Lord Kerrwas Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland before joining the Supreme Court at its 2009 opening. As the only Northern Irish justice, he argued forfree NHS abortions to be given to Northern Irish womenwhen they travel to England, but the Supreme Court rejected the case. Lord Wilsonis one of the UK's most experienced judges in family law, having spent 12 years ruling on those cases. Lord Carnwathis an expert in company and commercial law. He has a particular interest in environmental law. Lady Blackis another expert in family law who has taught students at university and, from 2010, also sat as a Court of Appeal judge. Lord Lloyd-Jonesis the Supreme Court's judge from Wales and a Welsh speaker. He specialises in international law He chaired the Law Commission - which advises the government on which laws need reforming - up until 2015. Lord Briggswas appointed to the Court of Appeal in 2013. Three years later he became deputy head of civil justice. Lady Ardenwas a Court of Appeal judge for 18 years and another former head of the Law Commission. Lord Kitchinis an expert in the complex branch of commercial cases that deals with intellectual property, such as patents that protect an invention from being copied by a rival. Lord Saleswas inthe original court which ruled the government must ask Parliamentbefore invoking Article 50, the part of EU law which gives any country the right to leave the EU. This led to the Daily Mail labelling him and the other two judges as ""enemies of the people."" Lord Justice Hamblenis the newest member. He's been a senior judge since 2008, specialising in commercial law. Two more new justices are in the wings waiting to be sworn in later in the year as others retire. Since Mr Johnson lost the prorogation case, there has been a drip feed of stories implying the court got the decision wrong and will face reform. Some Conservatives say judges snatched powers they never had. The Conservatives' 2019 general election manifesto pledged a constitutional review which would include the courts. It did not explicitly single out the Supreme Court for reform - so what may happen is unclear. Any attempt to water down the court's powers is likely to face a rocky road. Many lawyers would see this as an act of political revenge. No. There are two unrelated European Courts. TheEuropean Court of Justice(ECJ) oversees EU laws on trade and so on that are passed by the member states. When the UK leaves the EU, it will not be part of that system, unless it were to choose to be, as part of a deal. The entirely differentEuropean Court of Human Rights(ECtHR) was set up (largely at the instigation of the UK) to protect the rights of ordinary people across the continent from undemocratic use of power. It hears very few cases against the UK government as most human rights cases are dealt with by British judges. The Supreme Court takes into account the views of the ECtHR but is entitled to reject its conclusions.

Gun owners licence change plans 'flawed',"This video can not be played The move has been called ""fundamentally flawed"" by those who already have licences Gun owners have criticised plans to tighten guidelines on issuing firearms licences. Under the current system, police ask GPs to provide an applicant's medical details, but they are not obliged to give it. So the Home Officewants to put the onus on the applicant providing a medical certificate,external. But the move has been called ""fundamentally flawed"" by those who already have licences. Ceredigion-based shooting instructor Meurig Rees said people who shoot are being unfairly penalised for having to provide information which should be obtained by the police. Student jailed for making 3D printed gun More than 300 under-13s have access to guns The people who want the UK's gun laws relaxed ""When we look at it from a shooter's point of view, it's a right mess to be honest,"" said Mr Rees, a country officer for the British Association of Shooting and Conservation. ""The medical checks are there already. It's the inconsistencies on the medical side of it - certain doctors' surgeries can charge anything from Â£20 to Â£100 for the information and it's just not right. ""We shouldn't be paying but the onus is coming back on us as shooters all the time."" Meurig Rees said applicants should not be paying for the checks The Home Office has found not all GPs respond to police requests and some charge varying amounts for the service. In some cases, firearms certificates have been issued without medical information, which flags up any mental health issues or possible risks from owning a gun. The highest number of shotgun licences in Wales and England are held in the Dyfed-Powys Police force area. Last year alone more than 15,000Â shotgun licences were issued and more than 4,500 firearms certificates.Â The numbers tend to be higher in rural areas, where people hold guns for a variety of reasons, including the need to shoot predators to protect livestock.Â Dyfed-Powys Police said it would not issue a licence without medical information. Deputy Chief Constable Clare Parmenter, said public safety was paramount. ""We need a standardised process for the whole of the UK,"" she added. Dyfed-Powy Police's Deputy Chief Constable Clare Parmenter said public safety was important ""We are very thorough and have a good working relationship with our GP practices - they're very supportive in providing information but the new consultation would speed up the process for everyone involved."" Speaking on behalf of the British Medical Association, Dr Phil White, a GP in Y Felinheli, Gwynedd, said there were many reasons why doctors do not always provide the information. He said: ""We are allowed to disclose if the public is at risk from someone who has a firearms licence - putting a marker on their record is a way of doing this. ""But there are also GPs who feel strongly that no-one should have firearms in their homes and decline to comply with the regulations."" In a statement, a Home Office spokesman said: ""We have some of the toughest firearms controls in the world  and we will do everything we can to ensure it stays this way.""

"Wait, what's this Trump Ukraine story about?","The story centred around a call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump You may have heard this one before: a controversy involving a foreign power that threatened the future of the Trump presidency. Donald Trump was impeached over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. In the end, he was cleared on two charges by a majority of senators at this trial. How did we get here? Let's break it down. President Trump was accused of breaking the law by pressuring Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival. In July 2019, he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate one of the frontrunners to take him on in the 2020 presidential election. This mattered, opposition Democrats said, because it is illegal to ask foreign entities for help in winning a US election. He says he has done nothing wrong. After Mr Trump was impeached in December, a trial took place that could have led to the president being removed. In the end, he was cleared. At the heart of this story was a complaint from an unknown whistleblower. In August 2019, an anonymous intelligence official wrote a letter expressing concern over President Trump's 25 July phone conversation with Ukraine's president. The official spoke of an ""urgent concern"" that Mr Trump had used his office to ""solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election. Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means A rough transcript of the call,externallater revealed Mr Trump had urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the frontrunner to take on Mr Trump in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. The call came shortly after Mr Trump had blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine. A senior official later testified the president had made clear the release of this aid was conditional on Mr Biden being investigated. The White House denies this. This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Trump and his supporters alleged Mr Biden abused his power to pressure Ukraine to back away from a criminal investigation that could implicate his son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian energy company. But these allegations were widely discredited. There is no evidence that Mr Biden took any action to intentionally benefit his son, nor is there any evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Congressional Democrats said the phone call was proof Mr Trump broke the law by seeking foreign help to try to smear Mr Biden. But there was debate over whether soliciting opposition research from a foreign government constituted an impeachable offence. President Trump says it's a ""witch hunt"". The Democrat-held House of Representatives impeached him on two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. But to remove Mr Trump, senators from his own Republican Party would have needed to turn against him at his trial, which didn't happen. President Trump says he called his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July 2019 to congratulate him on his election victory. Mr Zelensky, a former TV star with no political experience, had been elected president three months earlier. But an anonymous whistleblower, reported to be a CIA official, felt there was something more serious in their exchange, and explained why in a formal complaint on 12 August. The whistleblower admitted having not directly heard the call but said accounts shared by other officials had painted a consistent picture. For context, about a dozen people are reported to have listened in on the conversation, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The call occurred days after Mr Trump blocked $391m (Â£316m) in military aid to Ukraine. Critics argued this was used as a bargaining chip, but Mr Trump denied this. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" The whistleblower alleged the president used ""the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 presidential election, adding that White House officials were ""deeply disturbed"" by the call and had acted to ""lock down"" all details of it. As the controversy grew, Mr Trump promised to release a ""complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript"" he said would prove the call had been ""totally appropriate"". But details disclosed by the White House were notes of the conversation and not a full, verbatim account. It did little to quell the spiralling controversy. The notes showed Mr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former Vice-President Joe Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son. Mr Trump and his allies suggested that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2015 because he had been investigating an energy company which employed Hunter Biden. At the time, by working closely with foreign-owned entities while his father was in the White House, Hunter Biden was criticised for leaving his father exposed to suggestions of a possible conflict of interest. But no evidence emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. Hunter Biden denied wrongdoing and officials in Kiev said there was no evidence to support the allegations. Then-President Barack Obama sits with then Vice-President Joe Biden and his son Hunter at a basketball game in 2010 Mr Trump pressing a foreign leader to investigate discredited allegations against Mr Biden was significant. If he wins the Democratic nomination, Mr Biden would be the man facing Mr Trump for the presidency in November 2020. As Mr Biden is a leading rival for the presidency, it opened Mr Trump up to claims he was working with a foreign power to influence the election. This - crucially - is against the law. This was not the first time Mr Trump has been scrutinised over his foreign connections. His 2016 election campaign was investigated over its alleged ties to Russia. The inquiry didn't establish a criminal conspiracy to influence the election, but it also didn't exonerate the president of obstructing justice. The Democrats launched a formal inquiry into the Ukraine affair and a number of officials were called to testify. They included the US government's special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who turned over a trove of text messages and other communications. Who listens in on a president's phone call? Ukraine has 'no jurisdiction' to investigate Bidens How easy is it to impeach a president? The acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told the inquiry that Mr Trump had made the release of the military aid conditional on Ukraine opening an investigation into the Bidens' dealings. He also said there was ""an irregular, informal channel of US policymaking"" in the country more generally. The White House denied this was the case. The president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was subpoenaed for documents relating to Ukraine. He has been central in pushing the allegations against the Bidens. Mr Pompeo has also been served with a subpoena. But the most dramatic testimony came from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union. He told Congress that he was working at the ""express direction"" of the president when pressure was put on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Sondland added that an offer of a White House visit for Ukraine's president was conditional on the country publicly announcing a probe. He also implicated Mr Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton in the Ukraine dealings. In December, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives unveiled two impeachment charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. Then, a week before Christmas, the House voted to impeach Mr Trump, ensuring he became only the third US president to suffer the same fate (after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton). Over two weeks in January and February 2020, the Senate held a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, so a guilty verdict was always unlikely given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. And this is how it came to pass. Mr Trump was cleared - by 52 votes to 48 on one count, and 53 votes to 47 on the other.

"Labour cash boost for wind farms and electric carsBillions will be spent on public ownership schemes to accelerate the ""green industrial revolution"".UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Long Bailey sets out Labour environment plan Labour is pledging to invest billions of pounds in electric car production and offshore wind farms to accelerate the ""green industrial revolution"". A future Labour government would take equity stakes in car producers in return for a Â£3bn capital investment in new electric models and machinery. Thirty-seven publicly-owned wind farms will be built, with the profits used to regenerate deprived coastal areas. Delegates have been debating the pace of decarbonisation at the conference. Earlier this year, Parliament approved a law requiring the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, a stricter target compared with the previous one of at least an 80% reduction from 1990 levels. Labour delegates, many of whom want a more ambitious strategy, approved a motion calling for a 2030 zero net emissions target as part of a green new deal. Corbyn wins party backing in crunch Brexit vote Labour promises 32-hour working week This does not automatically become part of Labour's manifesto, however, as the party's policy will be determined during the drafting process. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said she would be willing to support the more ambitious target if there was a ""credible plan with trade unions and industry"", and a ""just transition"" that did not adversely affect workers. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Provided we have a plan, I am happy to work as quickly as possible. I know we have got to act faster and we've got to push people to do that."" Some unions, including the GMB, are concerned this is too ambitious and want guarantees that it will not lead to massive job losses in the automotive, energy and industrial sectors.

Firms will be able to bid for funding over two years to bring new electric car models to market, in return for the government taking an equity stake in their business. A further Â£2.3bn will be set aside to build three battery plants to supply electric cars. The plants are  earmarked for South Wales, Stoke and Swindon - the latter potentially on the site of the Honda factory due to close in 2021. Labour has already signalled this week it would spend Â£3.6bn on new electric charging infrastructure and introduce 2.5 million interest free loans to spur the take-up of electric models. Announcing the new plans, Ms Long Bailey said the state should ""not be afraid to intervene"" to ensure the success of the automotive sector in light of the huge technological and economic challenges it faced. ""The sector is under siege from Brexit uncertainty and the government's lack of ambition on electrification,"" she said. ""At the same time, we need to accelerate the shift away from fossil-powered cars if we are to tackle the climate emergency. ""Labour's support package will offer a lifeline for a new clean era of manufacturing."" Jeremy Corbyn has said 2050 is too late to decarbonise the economy, although he hasn't offered an alternative date. The question is: could the UK achieve Momentum's preferred goal of 2030? Most energy economists say it's impossible without massive social upheaval. Just imagine - no petrol or diesel cars, and no gas central heating. But an increasing number of people are warning that with climate change accelerating faster than expected, society will need to accept major disruption to protect the planet for future generations. Labour's plans to support wind energy and battery cars build on Conservative policies which have caused the cost of renewables to plummet. But will Labour plan cut out the free market competition that's created the fall in energy prices? Environmentalists will also demand a broader vision of what's known as the ""just transition"" to a clean economy. They want to see a masterplan for retraining workers from dirty industries and supporting them to move to new areas with clean jobs. They want support for workers too old to retrain. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin In a series of green energy announcements on Tuesday, Labour will commit to using billions in public money to accelerate the transition to carbon-free transport and power systems. Labour is also planning an unprecedented intervention in the renewables industry, modelled on countries including Norway, Sweden and Denmark. To counter what it says is the domination of foreign firms in the UK's offshore market, it is proposing to take a 51% stake in a new public-private venture, which would build 37 new offshore wind farms capable of supplying the energy needs of 57 million households. Profits from the scheme would be reinvested in the wider energy network as well as a ""People's Power Fund"" - which would see up to Â£1bn each year for recreational and leisure facilities in struggling coastal communities. This, Labour says, will create 67,000 high-skilled jobs in Scotland, East Anglia, Yorkshire and North-East England. The CBI said it wanted to work with Labour and other parties to make a success of the transition to a zero-net carbon economy. Labour says the offshore wind sector is too dominated by foreign firms But the employers' group said ""in the push to reach net-zero as fast and as cost-effectively as possible, renationalisation will hugely disrupt the investment needed in the energy sector to decarbonise"". The Conservatives said the wind farms plan could cost up to Â£80bn and that ""nationalising huge swathes of the energy network"" would set back efforts to tackle climate change. ""It is by working with business that we've ensured offshore wind will provide more than a third of our electricity by 2030, tripling the number jobs in the industry and keeping bills low for consumers,"" said Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. Labour has made a raft of policy pledges during its conference, including plans to abolish prescription charges in England, push for a 32-hour working week and integrate private schools into the state system. The first three days in Brighton, though, have been dominated by Brexit divisions and internal wrangling. But Jeremy Corbyn received a major boost to his authority on Monday when delegates backed his ""wait and see"" policy of leaving a decision about which side the party would back in another Brexit referendum until after the next general election. Deputy leader Tom Watson, who has led calls for a more assertive pro-EU position and who survived efforts to oust him on Friday, will address the conference on Tuesday.

Introduce 'frequent flyer levy' to fight emissions,"Frequent flyers should face higher taxes to help tackle aviation emissions, the governmentâs climate advisers say. The Committee on Climate Change says a âfrequent flyer levyâ would help curb the growing demand for air travel. Analysis shows that 70% of UK flights are made by a wealthy 15% of the population,external, with 57% not flying abroad at all. The government says it will study the recommendations. Aviation is set to be the biggest source of UK emissions by 2050. And at the moment, ministers are planning for an increase of up to 49% in flying. But the committee says growth should be limited to 25% of current levels. The CCC said frequent flyers were a large part of the problem, but it is not clear how a levy would work in practice. For instance, would it apply to businesses at a time when the UK wants to stimulate trade with other nations? And how would you stop people pretending their flights were for work purposes to avoid paying it? Other solutions could include increasing taxes on airlines, or restricting airport capacity, the committee said. But it warned that if the planned expansion of Heathrow airport went ahead, it would leave very little growth room at other UK airports. The government has been hoping to solve problems of aviation emissions through new technology, including battery-powered short-haul planes and long-haul planes running on sustainable biofuels. The committee says aviation emissions could be reduced by about 20% from today to 2050 through improvements to fuel efficiency. But electric planes will only be suitable for small short-haul journeys for the foreseeable future, critics say. What is more, the aviation industry has been struggling to develop adequate biofuels. And all plant-based material is likely to be contested by different industries as the century wears on. Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train? Climate change: Which airline is best for carbon emissions? Heathrow reveals expansion 'masterplan' Young will pick up climate change bill, advisers warn In a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, the committee chairman, Lord Deben, writes that the industry is âhighly unlikelyâ to be able to eliminate emissions by 2050 by technical means. He warns that contrails - the trails of condensed water left by aircraft at high altitude - add to the warming impact of flying, even though currently their effects are poorly understood. Lord Deben says the UK should continue pushing for strong international policies on aviation. Currently the airline industry is hoping to counterbalance its emissions through the controversial practice of offsetting, in which firms agree to pay for, say, tree-planting in developing countries. But many such schemes have been discredited. Cait Hewitt, from the Aviation Environment Federation, said: âBritish people currently take more international flights than anyone else in the world, but thereâs a growing public recognition that this feels out of step with the action we need on climate change. âThe governmentâs dodged the issue of aviation emissions for too long. Itâs worth remembering that demand for aviation growth is being driven by a minority of frequent flyers - 70% of UK flights are made by just 15% of the population.â Neil Robinson, from the industry group Sustainable Aviation, urged the government not to adopt stand-alone UK policies on aviation pollution. He said: âBy investing tens of billions of pounds in new, cleaner aircraft we have already decoupled growth in aviation from growth in emissions, and as a global industry we have a long-established plan to halve our emissions by 2050. âCarbon reduction, however, is a global issue requiring a global response, with governments and industry working closely together for emissions to be managed within an international framework."" A government spokesman said: âWe are also committed to setting a clear ambition for the aviation sector and will carefully consider the advice of the Committee on Climate Change when we publish our position on aviation and climate change for consultation shortly.â Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train?

Global warming causing ocean 'emergency',"Melting in Greenland and Antarctica is contributing significantly to sea level rise It will be the clearest declaration yet on how an overheating world is hammering our oceans and frozen regions. Scientists have been meeting in Monaco to finalise a report on the seas and the cryosphere. Released on Wednesday, it will show how the oceans have been a friend, helping us cope with rising temperatures. But it will warn that warming is turning the seas into a huge potential threat to humanity. BBC Briefing: All you need to know about energy Rugby World Cup highlights 'climate injustice' Warming to drive 'robust increase' in UK flooding Researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were encouraged by Prince Albert II and the Monaco government in 2015 to produce a special report on the oceans and cryosphere - the Earth's surface where water is frozen solid. For the past three years, the scientists have been reviewing hundreds of published papers on how climate change affects the seas, the poles and glaciers. Their report will track the flow of water from the frozen tops of mountains to the bottom of the seas, and how this is changing in a warmer world. Over the past few days, they have been trying to agree a short summary of their findings with government representatives that will be published on Wednesday. It will likely detail the growing threat from rising sea levels that could imperil hundreds of millions of people before the end of this century. It will also warn of the threat posed by the growing acidification of the seas, the threats to coral and fisheries and the possibility that warming might melt permafrost, releasing huge amounts of the CO2 gas that's the key to rising temperatures. ""At current emissions rates, we are effectively dumping one million tonnes of CO2 into the oceans every hour,"" said Melissa Wang, a scientist with Greenpeace. ""Unless we accelerate efforts to curb carbon emissions and take greater steps to protect our oceans, there will be devastating human, environmental and economic consequences."" The oceans are like the big sister that constantly has to bail out her careless younger sibling. Every year, the ocean waters soak up about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emissions that arise from human activities. This video can not be played The acceleration in melting of the ice sheet covering Greenland has shocked researchers Glaciers are now melting all over the world Since 1970, the oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the extra heat that's come about through global warming. If they hadn't taken in that warming, the surface of the planet would have been devastated by excess heating. All this absorption has come at a price, though. Our seas are now warmer, less salty and more acidic as a result. ""The reality is that we have been quietly reliant on the ocean to do these things, but there comes a point where the ocean changes because of the scale of what we are doing,"" Prof Dan Laffoley, from the International Union to Conserve Nature, told BBC News. The heating of the world is having a profound impact on all things frozen. So the IPCC report will look at the loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets as well as from glaciers on mountains around the planet. It will chart the rise of CO2 that is making the waters more acidic and more difficult for sea life. It will also link the warming to the rise of ""superstorms"". One of the big changes has been in the impact of warming on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which has grown substantially in recent decades. These frozen regions are critically important for global sea levels, which impact flooding around the world. Asdocumentedby my colleague David Shukman, this year has been one of record melting on the gigantic frozen island of Greenland. In one day alone it lost 12.5 billion tonnes of ice. Antarctica has also enormous capacity to raise the waters around the world. According to studies, the amount of ice lost from the vast frozen region increased six-fold per year between 1979-1990 and 2009-2017. It is likely that much of the report will focus on the growing threat posed by rising sea waters. There is an expectation that some of the existing predictions for sea level will be revised upwards, with the threat posed to small island states and large cities increasing substantially by the middle of this century. ""By the end of this century, and if current adaptation efforts are not substantially scaled up, we must expect high levels of risk on low coasts such as atoll islands like the Maldives, and some Arctic communities even in a low-emission scenario,"" said Alexandre Magnan, a research fellow at the policy research institute IDDRI in Paris, and a co-author of the IPCC Ocean Report. Low-lying small island states will be badly hit by sea level rise ""In a higher-emission scenario, even wealthy megacities such as New York or Shanghai and large tropical agricultural deltas such as the Mekong will face high or very high risks."" The estimations for the centuries beyond 2100 will be even more stark, with suggestions that sea level rise could be 100 times higher than today. The threat of flood damage is likely to accelerate over this century ""What happens with sea level rise is not disconnected with what happens with warming,"" said Jane Lubchenco, former administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a co-chair of the expert group of aHigh Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy,external. ""Because the ocean is warming we are getting more intense storms. Because the ocean is rising the impact of storm surge from those storms has much more potential."" It will also look at the increase in marine heatwaves - these could increase by a factor of 50 by 2100. This will have big implications for ecosystems and will increase coral bleaching. ""Extreme sea level events, such as surges from tropical cyclones, that are currently historically rare, for example today's 100-year event, will become common by 2100 under all emissions scenarios,"" said Jean-Pierre Gattuso, an IPCC author and a CNRS research scientist at Sorbonne University. ""This will have major consequences for many low-lying megacities and small islands."" However, the report will also look at ocean acidification and will show how climate change is changing the balance. There will also be sections on coral reefs and there will also be a focus on fishing and fish stock, which are likely to suffer dramatic declines. For people living in the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush, a warmer future means that at first they will get too much water from glaciers as they melt. Then there will be too little. The melting of permafrost could add billions of tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere Areport last yearstated that two-thirds of these giant ice fields could disappear by the end of the century without rapid emissions cuts. This could have huge implications for the millions of people living in the region. The IPCC report will also document the threat posed by warming to permafrost. Some 30-99% of the Northern Hemisphere's permanently frozen soils could melt by the end of the century, freeing up billions of tonnes of CO2 which could in turn accelerate warming to a new, ever more dangerous level. Yes - the report will also show that the oceans could hold some important solutions to the threats posed by climate change. There is great scope for renewable energy systems based on the oceans, while cutting carbon from shipping would be a major step forward. Planting more mangroves and sea grass could remove huge amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. Even the potential to switch diets to get more of our protein from the oceans would likely help cut carbon.

Ex-priest admits link to IRA attack on Thatcher,"This video can not be played 'I would like to have been more effective' A man who helped arm the IRA has admitted links to major bomb attacks, including one which targeted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Patrick Ryan, a former priest from Tipperary, gave an interview to a BBC NI Spotlight series on the Troubles. Mrs Thatcher once described him as having an ""expert knowledge of bombing"". Asked if she was right to connect him to events like the Brighton bomb, he replied: ""One hundred per cent."" Five people died when an IRA bomb exploded inside the Grand Hotel, where Margaret Thatcher's ruling Conservative Party was holding its annual conference. The prime minister narrowly escaped injury in the attack on 12 October 1984. Margaret Thatcher's bathroom in the Grand Hotel, Brighton, following the explosion Episode three of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History explores Mr Ryan's key role in IRA arms shipments from Libya. In the programme, he takes credit for introducing the organisation to a type of timer unit it used to set off bombs. Asked if he had any regrets, Mr Ryan said: ""I regret that I wasn't even more effective, absolutely. ""I would have liked to have been much more effective, but we didn't do too badly."" Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he wanted an apology from the Irish government for not extraditing Mr Ryan. He said the Irish government should now ""step up to the mark"" and cooperate with extradition. ""He is an elderly man and the sooner he is brought before the courts the better for the pursuit of justice,"" he said. Ulster Unionist councillor Danny Kinahan, a former member of the Blues and Royals, an Army regiment whose members were killed in the Hyde Park bombing in 1982, said it was ""extremely uncomfortable to see a former priest seemingly gloating in the part that he played in the murder of my friends"". Four soldiers and seven horses were killed in the Hyde Park attack ""If Patrick Ryan happens to live in the Republic of Ireland, this will be a test of the Varadkar government`s commitment to righting the wrong of the Irish government`s refusal to extradite Ryan to the United Kingdom in 1988,"" he added. TUV leader Jim Allister also called for an apology from the Irish government and told the Nolan Show Mr Ryan should be ""pursued"" for the crimes he admits to in the programme. ""I believe when someone boasts of the terrible crimes that he has boasted of then there should be no end to justice,"" he said. ""If it's right to pursue British soldiers, and it seems that is the perceived wisdom, then why would it not be right to pursue Ryan for all his crimes which he has self-confessed to?"" Mr Ryan was once the subject of an extradition battle after being arrested with cash and bomb-making materials in Belgium in 1988. Repatriated to Ireland, the country refused to extradite him to the UK believing he would not receive a fair trial. Those who died in the Brighton bomb were Anthony Berry MP, Roberta Wakeham, Eric Taylor, Muriel Maclean and Jeanne Shattock. Many more were injured including Norman Tebbit, now a peer, and his wife. Norman Tebbit will not forgive IRA The then trade secretary and his wife Margaret were lying in bed when their ceiling collapsed. Lady Tebbit remains paralysed to this day. Patrick Magee, who planted the bomb, subsequently received eight life sentences, seven of them related to the bombing. Four members of an IRA ""active service unit"" were also jailed for involvement in the plot. Magee was released under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999. Episode three of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History will be shown Tuesday 24 September at 21:00 BST on BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Four. Episodes one and two can be viewed now on theBBC iPlayer.

'Half as many Britons' vape as smoke,"The number of people vaping in the UK has reached 3.6 million - about half the number of smokers - figures from Action on Smoking and Health suggest. The data indicates most vapers are former smokers, with the main reason for using e-cigarettes being to give up tobacco. The findings come as the US continues to investigate a spate of serious lung injuries linked to vaping. India, meanwhile, says it will ban e-cigarettes as they pose a health risk. Listen: Beyond Today - Can vaping kill you? E-cigarettes allow users to inhale nicotine in vapour rather than breathing in smoke. The anti-smoking charity Action on Smoking and Health has been monitoring trends in their use since 2012. Its latest report suggests vaping helped an extra 70,000 people quit smoking in 2017. It says the number of vapers in the UK has gone from 700,000 in 2012 to 3.6 million in 2019 - and of these: 54% have given up smoking 40% both smoke and vape 6% have never smoked ""It's important that all vapers stop smoking completely, as otherwise they are still exposing themselves to the serious risks of disease and disability caused by smoking,"" says Prof Ann McNeill, who compiled a review of e-cigarettes for Public Health England. She adds: ""Vaping isn't risk free - but it's much less risky than smoking, which kills nearly 100,000 people a year in the UK."" The figures come amid a backlash against e-cigarettes. The US Centers for Disease Control is investigating a mysterious outbreak of lung injuries linked to vaping, in which eight people have died and more than 500 have become ill. Most, but not all,,externalhave reported ""cannabis vaping"", in which the vapour contains THC (the psychoactive component in cannabis). There was a similar case in the UK last year,reported in the British Medical Journal,external, in which a woman developed lipoid pneumonia and the only explanation doctors could come up with was vaping. The CDC recommends people ""consider refraining from using e-cigarette or vaping products"". The situation in the US has led to President Donald Trump announcing a ban on flavoured e-cigarettes and the supermarket giant Walmart stopping selling them entirely. Meanwhile, India has announced a ban including three-year jail terms for offenders. What's behind a vaping illness outbreak in the US? Walmart ceases e-cigarette sales Trump plans ban on sale of flavoured e-cigarettes India e-cigarettes: Ban announced to prevent youth 'epidemic' The stance from health bodies in the UK has remained that vaping is 95% safer than smoking. Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of ASH, said: ""Vapers should not be scared back to smoking by the news of vaping illness in the US. Nor should smokers stick to smoking rather than switch to vaping. ""It is essential, however, to only use legal vapes bought from reputable suppliers in the UK and not source illicit unregulated products over the internet."" The World Health Organization says,externale-cigarettes are ""undoubtedly harmful and should therefore be subject to regulation"". It also raises concerns vaping is being aggressively marketed at young people - particularly through the use of flavourings - and risked re-normalising smoking. Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

Uber: Will it get its London licence back?,"Taxi booking firm Uber will soon hear whether its licence to operate in London will be renewed, and if so, by how long. As things stand, its private hire licence will expire on Wednesday. Transport for London (TfL) will decide whether to award another licence, which can be for up to five years. The company lost its licence in 2017 over public safety concerns, after which a judge granted a 15-month extension which is due to end. TfL will probably announce its decision before Wednesday's deadline. There are three possible options: It could grant Uber a five-year licence It could offer a shorter agreement with conditions attached It could decline the company the right to operate. If TfL does decide against allowing the company to operate, Uber has 21 days to appeal against TfL's decision and can continue to operate while any appeals are continuing. A five-year agreement is unlikely, says Richard Kramer, an analyst at Arete Research. ""TfL likely wants to preserve leverage over companies to review their compliance on the many problems at Uber,"" he said. Recent licences have also been shorter than the five-year maximum, he said. In July, Indian ride-hailing company Ola got a 15-month agreement for its entry into the London market, while ViaVan got a three-year licence renewal. In September 2017, TfL said it declined to renew the licence on the grounds of ""public safety and security implications"". TfL's concerns included Uber's approach to carrying out background checks on drivers and reporting serious criminal offences. The UK is a top market for Uber Uber's use of secret software, called ""Greyball"", which could be used to block regulators from gaining full access to the app, was another factor, according to TfL. At the time, Uber rejected TfL's claims that it endangered public safety and said Greyball had never been used in the UK for the purposes cited by TfL. The company says it has made ""wholesale"" changes to the business since the licence loss. It now reports crimes directly to the police instead of logging criminal complaints with TfL, which caused delays. Among other changes, drivers can now only use the app in the region in which they hold a private hire licence, while their working hours are more tightly regulated. A licensed driver on the app has to now take an uninterrupted six-hour break after 10 hours of taking passengers or travelling to pick them up. The firm also made changes to its app in London to ""make it clearer"" to passengers that its drivers are licensed by TfL and that it accepts ride requests before allocating drivers. It has also hired a new chairman of the UK business, former Bank of England advisor Laurel Powers-Freeling, described as ""impressive"" by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot  in her ruling approving Uber's extension. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan backed TfL's decision not to renew Uber's licence to operate in the capital in 2017 James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the IWGB union, says he's not in favour of the company losing its licence, but he would like it to pay its workers more and share data with TfL to show what is being paid after expenses to keep wages above the minimum. ""The problem here has always been the failure to regulate,"" he said. The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commissionset a minimum hourly wage,externalafter expenses of $17.22 (Â£13.80) for drivers last year. Mr Farrar said a similar rule in London would protect drivers' wages, and he would like Mayor Sadiq Khan to intervene. A questionput last week to Mr Khan about the licence renewal,externalis still awaiting a reply, according to the London Authority's website. Both Uber and TfL declined to comment ahead of the decision. ""Uber continues to lose share to Lyft in the US, faces the threat of further labour regulation which could bring rising driver costs in many markets and has limited scope for increasing the percentage it takes of the fare further after already making significant changes to charge riders more and pay drivers less,"" said Arete Research's Mr Kramer. ""As a business, burning cash but with slowing growth, it faces more challenges than just its licence in London, which is a top five market for them."" Uber's losses widened to $5.2bn in the three months to 30 June, from $878m in the quarter last year.  Total revenue rose 14.4% to $3.2bn, but fell short of average analysts' estimates of $3.4bn. Uber's costs rose 147% to $8.7bn in the quarter, including a sharp rise in spending for research and development. The company floated on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year and its shares have lost about a quarter of their value since then. Uber, which admitted ahead of its Wall Street listing that it may never make a profit, is trying to convince investors that growth will come not only from its ride services, but also from other logistics and food delivery services.

Corbyn wins party backing in crunch Brexit voteMembers at the party's annual conference vote against a motion which would have called for Remain backing at an election.,"This video can not be played There was confusion over the show of hands vote Jeremy Corbyn's policy on Brexit has triumphed at Labour conference, as members endorsed his stance to stay neutral while negotiating a new deal. The party voted against a motion which would have seen Labour backing Remain in any future referendum. But there was confusion as the votes were called, as the chair of the proceedings faced calls for a recount. Labour's position on Brexit has dominated the conference agenda, with huge disagreements over the issue. The party's draft plan for its Brexit policy, put forward by Mr Corbyn, suggests that, if Labour wins power in a general election, it would remain neutral while negotiating a new deal with the EU within three months. Labour tensions on full display Corbyn plays down Labour splits amid aide's exit Where does Labour stand on Brexit? It would then hold a referendum within six months, and the party would decide which side to back ahead of that at a special conference. Grassroots activists at the conference have been pushing for an unambiguous stance, tabling a motion calling for Labour to campaign ""energetically"" to Remain. But this motion was rejected in a show of hands while a motion setting out the leadership's official position and another endorsing its handling of Brexit were overwhelmingly passed. Len McCluskey said the Labour party trusted their leader After the results were announced by trade union official Wendy Nichols, there were charged scenes in the conference hall. Several delegates called for the votes to be counted individually, suggesting the outcome of the Remain motion was much closer than officials had suggested. One delegate said there had to be an official card vote as ""this is one of the most important decisions Labour is going to take in the next decade"". The result is a major boost for Jeremy Corbyn, who was backed by the majority of Labour's 12 affiliated unions, including Unite and the GMB. Unison had broken ranks with other unions to back the Remain motion. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said he was disappointed by the result of the vote, and that he would campaign for Remain. ""Would I have liked us to have gone a bit further and won that vote? Of course I would - but I don't want to take away from the fact that is quite considerable movement,"" he said. The leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said the vote showed ordinary members coming behind the Labour leader's stance in a show of loyalty. ""What you've seen here is a massive show of support for Jeremy Corbyn,"" he said, adding that it was ""time to unite"". The vote was decisive - the Labour leadership position on Brexit triumphed. Those calling for a more robust Remain stance at the likely snap election were defeated. But the manner of the triumph was immediately called in to question. The vote wasn't a secret ballot, it was a show of hands. Calls for a card vote - where the vote of each delegate is individually counted in secret - were dismissed by the chair. That's not to say there wasn't clear show of support for the leadership. But some remainers maintain that the vote would at least have been closer if it wasn't conducted in public. That's because the debate  became - for some delegates - a demonstration of support for the leadership, close to an election, rather than a pure test of opinion on Brexit. The conventional wisdom was that Jeremy Corbyn might have to rely on the big unions - with 50% of conference votes - to win. But some unions chose to defy him, making a defeat possible. In the end a section of the grassroots - the ordinary members - did not prioritise their own pro-Remain position and rallied round Jeremy Corbyn. Remainers are now accentuating, for them, the positive - that the party is now unambiguously backing a new referendum, with Remain as an option. Nonetheless, Labour will go in to the election unable to say whether it will officially back leave or remain in a subsequent referendum. But after a difficult few days, most of those close to Jeremy Corbyn are relieved tonight, and some are jubilant. Andrew Lewin, the founder of Remain Labour, said the vote represented the ""grassroots against the party machine - and the machine won"". ""If this fudge is the Labour policy at the next general election, we will drive Remain voters away."" Another campaigner, Michael Chessum, from Another Europe is Possible, said: ""Labour members, 90% of whom want to stay in the EU, will be deeply disappointed with this decision."" Labour's stance on Brexit has dominated the conference But Labour MPs remain divided over the issue. Speaking before the vote, shadow Treasury minister Annaliese Dodds said the economic consequences of Brexit were ""so severe"" that she believed Labour must back remain in another referendum. ""Is it going to be easy?"" she told the BBC's Carolyn Quinn. ""No it is not, because people are passionate in both directions."" But Stephen Kinnock, the MP for Aberavon, told a fringe meeting organised by the Social Market Foundation that Labour had had ""more Brexit positions than the Karma Sutra"". Describing the first two days of conference as an ""utter shambles"", he said Labour should have stuck with its 2017 manifesto pledge to honour the referendum result and moving away from this this would not go down well in Leave constituencies. ""Our position on Brexit is being treated with ridicule on the doorsteps in my constituency,"" he said.

"Ex-priest admits link to IRA attack on ThatcherFive people died when the IRA bombed a Brighton hotel, where the 1984 Tory conference was being held..Northern Ireland","This video can not be played 'I would like to have been more effective' A man who helped arm the IRA has admitted links to major bomb attacks, including one which targeted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Patrick Ryan, a former priest from Tipperary, gave an interview to a BBC NI Spotlight series on the Troubles. Mrs Thatcher once described him as having an ""expert knowledge of bombing"". Asked if she was right to connect him to events like the Brighton bomb, he replied: ""One hundred per cent."" Five people died when an IRA bomb exploded inside the Grand Hotel, where Margaret Thatcher's ruling Conservative Party was holding its annual conference. The prime minister narrowly escaped injury in the attack on 12 October 1984. Margaret Thatcher's bathroom in the Grand Hotel, Brighton, following the explosion Episode three of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History explores Mr Ryan's key role in IRA arms shipments from Libya. In the programme, he takes credit for introducing the organisation to a type of timer unit it used to set off bombs. Asked if he had any regrets, Mr Ryan said: ""I regret that I wasn't even more effective, absolutely. ""I would have liked to have been much more effective, but we didn't do too badly."" Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he wanted an apology from the Irish government for not extraditing Mr Ryan. He said the Irish government should now ""step up to the mark"" and cooperate with extradition. ""He is an elderly man and the sooner he is brought before the courts the better for the pursuit of justice,"" he said. Ulster Unionist councillor Danny Kinahan, a former member of the Blues and Royals, an Army regiment whose members were killed in the Hyde Park bombing in 1982, said it was ""extremely uncomfortable to see a former priest seemingly gloating in the part that he played in the murder of my friends"". Four soldiers and seven horses were killed in the Hyde Park attack ""If Patrick Ryan happens to live in the Republic of Ireland, this will be a test of the Varadkar government`s commitment to righting the wrong of the Irish government`s refusal to extradite Ryan to the United Kingdom in 1988,"" he added. TUV leader Jim Allister also called for an apology from the Irish government and told the Nolan Show Mr Ryan should be ""pursued"" for the crimes he admits to in the programme. ""I believe when someone boasts of the terrible crimes that he has boasted of then there should be no end to justice,"" he said. ""If it's right to pursue British soldiers, and it seems that is the perceived wisdom, then why would it not be right to pursue Ryan for all his crimes which he has self-confessed to?"" Mr Ryan was once the subject of an extradition battle after being arrested with cash and bomb-making materials in Belgium in 1988. Repatriated to Ireland, the country refused to extradite him to the UK believing he would not receive a fair trial. Those who died in the Brighton bomb were Anthony Berry MP, Roberta Wakeham, Eric Taylor, Muriel Maclean and Jeanne Shattock. Many more were injured including Norman Tebbit, now a peer, and his wife. Norman Tebbit will not forgive IRA The then trade secretary and his wife Margaret were lying in bed when their ceiling collapsed. Lady Tebbit remains paralysed to this day. Patrick Magee, who planted the bomb, subsequently received eight life sentences, seven of them related to the bombing. Four members of an IRA ""active service unit"" were also jailed for involvement in the plot. Magee was released under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999. Episode three of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History will be shown Tuesday 24 September at 21:00 BST on BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Four. Episodes one and two can be viewed now on theBBC iPlayer.

Your questions answered,"Thomas Cook has collapsed, triggering the biggest ever peacetime repatriation aimed at bringing more than 150,000 British holidaymakers home. The company, its customers and staff had hoped for a rescue deal, but now that last hope has gone, they will be looking at the practicalities for the near future. About 800,000 British people had future bookings and the company had 9,000 employees in the UK. Anyone who has bought a package holiday will be covered by theAir Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol),external. You would have received an Atol certificate when you booked. This means you will not be going away, but the cost of the holiday will be refunded. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will be launching an online service to manage all refunds on Monday, 7 October. It has asked people not to submit anything to the CAA before then. The CAA said all refunds should be processed within two months of a claim form being submitted properly. Customers who were paying by direct debit should be refunded within 14 days, The majority of Thomas Cook holidays are packages. Stating the obvious, everything that was paid for as part of the package - such as flights, accommodation, and excursions - will be refunded. Some holidaymakers might have paid separately for airport parking or car hire while away. In this situation, they would need to make a claim from their travel insurer for the cost. In more extreme cases, such as a wedding, there may be a host of other things that could be affected. Specialist cover, such as wedding insurance, may be the only route for those left out of pocket. No. Holidaymakers with package deals get a refund, as that is what the Atol protection states. Booking a new holiday in the very near future might have got more expensive. Some other operators which used Thomas Cook flights will try to switch their customers to an alternative at no extra cost. Others may be on cruises organised and paid through Thomas Cook. It is best to contact those operators directly as they will be prepared to explain the status of the holiday. The Atol protection covers packages, not flight-only deals. So that means you would not get an automatic refund. The main alternative is claiming a refund from the provider of the credit or debit card you used, so-called section 75 rules. Otherwise you may need to make a claim on travel insurance. That is why it is always advised to buy travel insurance at the same time as booking a holiday. Analysis by data company Defaqto shows that 45% of travel insurance policies do not cover the collapse of an airline, so not everyone will be covered. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers says: ""As a last resort, travel insurance with scheduled airline failure cover can cover the cost of a flight when the airline has gone into administration. A travel insurance policy with travel disruption cover will cover the cost of new travel arrangements."" Thomas Cook collapses as last-ditch rescue talks fail Thomas Cook latest: Repatriation begins Thomas Cook: What went wrong? There may be a little more protection if the hotel you booked was linked to the flight, such as a click-through when booking the flight. That could be covered by the Atol scheme. Anyone who bought a Thomas Cook package that did not include a flight may be covered under the separate Abta scheme. At the moment, enjoy your break as much as you can - do not cut it short. That said, the repatriation operation will only run up to and including Sunday 6 October. After that, travellers would have to make their own plans, although those covered by Atol will be refunded. Hoteliers will be paid via the Atol scheme, so they should not ask for any extra payment from holidaymakers. UK package holiday customers will be brought home ""as close as possible"" to their booked return date, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said. They must take their original ticket information with them and will be issued with a fresh boarding card for their flight. Customers will be on special free flights or booked on to another scheduled airline at no extra cost, with details of each flight to beposted on a dedicated CAA website,externalas soon as they are available, up to 72 hours before its scheduled departure. The CAA said some people might be flown to different UK airports from the ones originally scheduled, but free transfers would be provided. The DfT added that a ""small number"" of passengers might need to book their own flight home and reclaim the costs. Thomas Cook had 600,000 customers on holiday from around the world, including more than 150,000 from the UK, so it will be a huge logistical challenge. When the Monarch airline collapsed, there were arguments fora better repatriation system,external, but nothing has been implemented as yet. It looks like any direct debit to Thomas Cook is pointless, but most people will not need to cancel it. If a direct debit is due to be taken on Tuesday, then you should cancel it straight away with your bank, according to banking trade body UK Finance. Any payments from other customers at a later date will not be processed owing to the insolvency. Any money that has been paid towards a package holiday already should be refunded via the Atol scheme, so you will need to make a claim for it in due course. The same is true of a deposit. Nothing is clear on that yet. It is highly likely that gift cards or vouchers will be worthless, consumer experts say. It will depend on what happens to the company - whether it is rekindled and whether any vouchers would then be honoured. If they are useless, then the person who bought it might be able to make a claim to their credit card provider if it was a generous gift of more than Â£100, or their debit card provider for less. There is better news for those with a pre-paid Thomas Cook currency card, as any funds held on that are protected separately from the company, so will not be lost. Thomas Cook ran domesticticket and hotel packages for sporting events. As the business has ceased trading, they would no longer be valid, although anyone with trips planned could try contacting the destination direct. For example, Thomas Cook would have sold 360 hospitality packages for home matches at Liverpool football club's Anfield ground. ""We are currently assessing the impact of Thomas Cook ceasing trading and the impact for those supporters who have purchased packages from Thomas Cook. Once we have those details from Thomas Cook, we will update supporters,"" the football club said. Some people had booked travel and tickets for the forthcoming American football games in London through Thomas Cook. The NFL said it was investigating and would give further information soon. As most people would not have any insurance cover for such a trip, a refund claim would probably have to be made to the provider of the credit or debit card used to pay. While customers will be worried about their holidays, staff will be heartbroken about their livelihoods. Staff are being informed about what has happened to their jobs, with written confirmation to follow. A group of special managers, from accountancy firm KPMG, have been appointed and will contact staff with a case reference number which will allow them tomake a claim for redundancy payments,external. The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) should step in to protect the more than 13,000 members of Thomas Cook's four pension schemes. Workers who are over the age of their normal retirement will get full benefits, while those who have not yet reached normal retirement age will be paid 90% of their promised pension, up to a cap of Â£40,000. Members with bigger pensions will get at least 50% of their old age pensions, under PPF rules. Meanwhile, the 3,000 or so retired members of Thomas Cook's pension schemes will continue to have their pensions paid in full by the trustees. Were you a member of staff at Thomas Cook?
