Russians charged in Evil Corp hack investigation,"Maksim Yakubets (L) and Igor Turashev are accused of running Evil Corp US authorities have filed charges against two Russian nationals alleged to be running a global cyber crime organisation named Evil Corp. An indictment named Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashev - who remain at large - as figures in a group which used malware to steal millions of dollars in more than 40 countries. Those affected by the hacks include schools and religious organisations. It is also alleged that Mr Yakubets worked for Russian intelligence. Speaking at a news conference, Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said the attacks were among ""the worst computer hacking and bank fraud schemes of the past decade"". Mr Yakubets is accused of leading Moscow-based Evil Corp, while Mr Turashev allegedly acted as an administrator. The pair are thought to be in Russia. Thursday's indictment came after a multi-year investigation by the FBI, and by Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) and Cyber Security Centre. US authorities allege that the group stole at least $100m (Â£76m) using Bugat malware - known as Dridex. Alleged members of Evil Corp have shares images of personalised sports cars on their social media accounts The malware was spread through so-called ""phishing"" campaigns, which encouraged victims to click on malicious links sent by email from supposedly trusted entities. Once a computer was infected, the group stole personal banking information which was used to transfer funds. A network of money launderers - targeted by the NCA and Britain's Metropolitan Police - were then utilised to funnel the criminal proceeds to members of Evil Corp. Eight members of this network have been sentenced to a total of over 40 years in prison. The NCA alleges that Maksim Yakubets spent Â£250,000 on his wedding US authorities said Mr Yakubets was also involved in a similar scheme using another form of malware - known as Zeus - which stole $70m from victims' bank accounts. The NCA alleged that Maksim Yakubets spent more than Â£250,000 ($328,971) of criminal proceeds on his wedding. He is also said to drive a customised Lamborghini with a personalised number plate which reads ""Thief"" in Russian. In a separate statement, the US Treasury alleged that, since 2017, Mr Yakubets had worked on projects for the Russian state, including the theft of confidential documents and ""cyber-enabled operations"". The department said it had rolled out sanctions against 17 individuals and seven ""entities,"" including businesses associated with a member of the group. A $5m reward has been offered for information leading to their arrest and prosecution. The US Department of Justice said the amount was the largest offered for a cyber criminal to date.

Labour pledges more help for smaller firms,"Labour is promising to base a network of small business advisers in Post Office branches if it wins next Thursday's general election. The party says the advisers would form part of a wider agency to help firms access advice and bid for government contracts. The party says it would also help small firms by replacing business rates with a tax based on land value. But the Conservatives said Labour would bring higher taxes and uncertainty. The Tories have pledged to reduce business rates for smaller firms, and give them a bigger discount on National Insurance payments. Live: Latest from the campaign trail Labour plans will âslowâ climate change fight Tories promise help for 'left-behind' towns Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said smaller companies are ""being stretched to breaking point by global corporations which evade their taxes and fail to pay their suppliers on time"". ""Labour wants business support and finance to be available for entrepreneurs from the moment the seed of an idea is planted,"" she said. ""Labour's Business Development Agency will create thriving businesses within our communities, bringing life back to local economies."" The party also plans to set up a website offering support to smaller firms, andfree full-fibre broadbandfor every business and home by 2030. It also says it will establish a Â£250bn national investment bank providing loans for businesses.

Labour has pledged to offer voters a choice between its deal or remaining in the EU - it has not said which option it would back and Mr Corbyn has said he would stay ""neutral"" during the campaign. Lib Dem business spokesman Sam Gyimah said smaller firms have ""made it abundantly clear that any form of Brexit - be it red or blue - will harm their ability to hire staff, make it more difficult to export to our closest partners and ratchet up the cost of doing business"". ""It is only the Liberal Democrats who will stop Brexit and bring forward a bold vision to support small businesses in the UK,"" he added. His party also wants to replace business rates with a levy on commercial properties based on land values, and create a new ""start-up allowance"" to help those setting up businesses with their living costs. Parties are competing to offer more help to high streets ahead of the general election The Federation of Small Businesses said it welcomed Labour's plan for an agency to support small firms, as well as the party's commitment to clamp down on suppliers that make late payments. However its chairman Mike Cherry said the party needed to provide ""urgent clarity"" on its tax changes to dividend payouts.

Saudi Aramco raises record $25.6bn in share sale,"This video can not be played Saudi Aramco traces its history back to the 1930s State-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco has raised a record $25.6bn (Â£19.4bn) in its initial public offering in Riyadh. The share sale was the biggest to date, surpassing that of China's Alibaba which raised $25bn in 2014 in New York. Aramco relied on domestic and regional investors to sell a 1.5% stake after lukewarm interest from abroad. The IPO will value it at $1.7tn when trading begins - short of its $2tn target, but making it the most valuable listed company in the world. The share sale is at the heart of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to modernise the Saudi economy and wean it off its dependence on oil. World's most profitable company to go public The country urgently needs tens of billions of dollars to fund megaprojects and develop new industries. Aramco has found the journey to its public offering testing. It initially sought to raise $100bn on two exchanges - with a first listing on the kingdom's Tadawul bourse, and then another on an overseas exchange such as the London Stock Exchange. But it scaled back its plans after foreign investors raised concerns about climate change, political risk and a lack of corporate transparency. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman International institutions also baulked at the firm's $1.7tn valuation, prompting Aramco to pull marketing roadshows in New York and London. Instead, it focused its marketing efforts on Saudi investors and wealthy Gulf Arab allies. Saudi banks also offered citizens cheap credit to bid for the shares following a nationwide advertising campaign. Shares were priced at 32 Saudi riyals ($8.53) on Thursday and were heavily oversubscribed, according to reports. But it remains to be seen whether the share price rises or falls when trading begins, most likely later this month. The IPO's pricing came as Saudi Arabia met with Russia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in Vienna to discuss oil production. The allies - who together pump 40% of the world's oil - agreed to deepen output cuts as part of ongoing efforts to prop up global prices. Oil prices collapsed in mid 2014 and have yet to fully recover, leaving oil-dependent economies under pressure. The market is struggling with slower global growth and a flood of new production from countries such as the US. Sameer Hashmi, Middle East business correspondent Three years after it was first announced Saudi Arabia is finally taking the world's most profitable company public. The market valuation is less than the $2tn target that Crown Prince Bin-Salman - had initially hoped to achieve. The company has committed to a large annual dividend until 2024 to ensure investors don't sell shares in the near future leading to a drop in market valuation. But analysts believe the biggest challenge for the company will be if it decides to list on an international stock exchange in the future to expand its investor pool. The core business of Saudi Aramco - oil - is considered by many experts its biggest risk. Demand for crude has been falling, which could make it difficult for the company to grow in the long term. The climate crisis and geopolitical risks are also key factors that could deter potential investors.

Labour plans will âslowâ climate change fight,"This video can not be played 'Private investment is bringing down the cost of renewable energy' Nationalising UK energy companies will delay the UK's move towards a zero carbon future, according to the chief executive of Scottish Power, Keith Anderson. He said that investment by the private sector had seen the cost of renewable energy plummet over the last decade and that debates about nationalisation would only serve as a distraction from averting a climate emergency. ""We need to focus on hitting zero carbon by 2050. Anything else is a distraction. ""Having big arguments about who owns what is the worst thing we could do right now. It would slow everything down when what we need to do is speed up."" A Labour spokesman said Mr Anderson's comments were ""hardly surprising"" as they represented ""vested interests"". ""Labour has set out our plans to dramatically expand the rollout of renewable generation - so that we can hit net zero by the 2030s - not 2050,"" he said. ""While generous public subsidies have led to some private sector investment in renewable generation, private ownership of the UK's grid has been a disaster, with shareholder dividends prioritised over investment."" Top energy firms move offshore over Labour plans Labour eyes 'radical' plan for companies Mr Anderson told the BBC: ""We estimate we need to install 4,000 electric car charging points a day between now and 31 December 2050, and if we delay that for a year arguing about ownership that is 1.5 million charging points that won't get installed in time."" Labour says it would increase charging points at a faster rate than the private sector has managed. But Mr Anderson said that competition and innovation had revolutionised his company and the industry. ""If you look back 20 years we were predominantly a coal burning generator. Now, we have shut down all our coal mines, got rid of gas and we are now a 100% renewable energy company. That's what we want us and other companies to deliver."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described Labour's plans as radical Labour plans to nationalise the big six energy providers and divide their assets, workforce and customers into 14 state-owned regional agencies. It's not just energy. A Labour government would also take water, the Royal Mail and BT's broadband business into public ownership. So how much would this cost? That's a tricky question to answer. Labour say parliament would decide how much to pay the current owners - which of course includes many worker's pension funds - but the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates it would add at least Â£200bn to government debt. However, the government would collect the associated revenue - apart from broadband which it eventually wants to give away for free. Arguments about who is better at delivering key public services and utilities are not new. But the Labour Party manifesto proposes one of the most radical overhauls of how companies are owned and run in decades. The private sector will tell you that the prospect of nationalisation is deterring private investment at a crucial time - while Labour would say only the state has the power to borrow and invest at the scale and pace that's needed. In Scotland, as in most of Europe, the water industry is already nationalised and the SNP wants to extend public ownership of rail, buses and ferries. Prof Andrew Cumbers of Glasgow University says that many breakthroughs in innovation and technology - particularly in renewable energy - have been achieved thanks to state subsidies. ""It sounds radical but it's only what happens in many other countries. The government can borrow much more cheaply than companies. If you leave it all to the private sector, research and development inevitably gets cut to divert profits into shareholder dividends."" Smaller companies - such as Bulb, Ovo and Octopus in energy, and Virgin Media and Talk Talk in broadband - would not face nationalisation. That would leave them competing with the state. Tough if you are giving services like broadband away for free or others at less than market prices. Even Labour describe their own policies as radical. On that at least business would agree.

Tories promise Brexit and Budget in first 100 days,"This video can not be played PM: 'I absolutely promise' UK out of EU by January Boris Johnson has promised to pass his Brexit deal and bring a Budget within 100 days if he is elected PM. The Tory leader said it would includehis pledge to raise the National Insurance threshold to Â£9,500, along with cash for schools and the NHS. He has pledged a ""new government with a new approach"" - with a focus on better infrastructure, education and technology. But Labour said Tories only offered ""more of the same failure"". The Lib Dems called the Conservative plans ""pure fantasy"", while the SNP warned there were seven days left to ""lock"" Mr Johnson out of Downing Street. LIVE: One week to go until voting day What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? Sajid Javid EU trade deal claim fact-checked How much tax do British people pay? Voters will go to the polls on 12 December for the third election in just over four years. Mr Johnson said he would set out his wider legislative agenda in a Queen's Speech pencilled in for 19 December if he gets back into No 10. He promised this would build onthe programme that was approved by Parliament as recently as October, but which was then effectively mothballed after MPs voted to back an early election. And he has committed to bringing his EU withdrawal agreement back for initial approval by MPs before Christmas. ""All we need is a working majority to deliver it. Every single one of our candidates has signed up to this deal,"" Mr Johnson said. He said the possibility that a Conservative government could fail to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020 ""simply will not happen"". This 11-month deadline covers thetransition periodthat would follow if the UK left the EU in January, which critics say does not leave enough time to negotiate such a deal and could mean the UK ends up without one. They include former Tory Justice Secretary - and now independent candidate -David Gauke, who said leaving without a deal would be ""disastrous for the prosperity of our countryâ¦ [making] whole sectors unviable"". But Mr Johnson said the UK was in a ""zero-tariff, zero-quota position"" already, which would make the talks easier. He added: ""Look at what we achieved in three months with the deal I did"". In an interview with ITV's This Morning, he said a trade deal with the EU was a ""very exciting prospect"", could be agreed ""by the end of next year"". Mr Johnson's plan for the first 100 days gives a timetable to a number of his existing pledges from the campaign trail, including: Raising the National Insurance threshold, which the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies says will save workers about Â£85 per year Ending the automatic release of serious violent and sexual offenders Increasing the amount migrants pay for using the NHS Finalising an agreement with mobile operators over countryside coverage The Conservatives have also said they would introduce a number of pieces of legislation in the 100-day timeframe to take the first steps on other promises including: A law to raise minimum per pupil funding in schools A law to ensure Â£33.9bn is put into the NHS each year by 2023 A new points-based immigration system The roll-out of gigabit broadband Mr Johnson vowed that, in government, the Tories would prioritise their plan to raise the National Insurance threshold, as it would deliver a tax cut for ""those who need the most help with the cost of living"". But Labour,which is making an announcement of its own on schools funding on Thursday, said the Conservatives' record in office over the past nine-and-a-half years was one of total failure. ""In those days we've seen child poverty soar, rising homelessness, rising food bank use, and violent crime is up too while the NHS has more people waiting for operations, and record staff vacancies,"" said shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne. ""As the Conservatives approach 3,500 days of failure, it's clear that more of the same failed austerity, privatisation and tax giveaways for the few is not the answer."" And as she prepared to embark on a week-long election bus tour, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said her party was the only one in Scotland capable of thwarting Mr Johnson's ""extreme Brexit"". ""If Boris Johnson wins a majority in seven days' time, Scotland will be dragged out of Europe within just eight weeks,"" she said. ""We have seven days to escape Brexit, lock Boris Johnson out of office and put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands.""

Chinese worry about rise of facial recognitionA study by a Beijing-based body indicates many are worried about their biometric data being hacked.,"Some buses in Shanghai have had facial recognition systems fitted to them A survey by a Beijing research institute indicates growing pushback against facial recognition in China. Some 74% of respondents said they wanted the option to be able to use traditional ID methods over the tech to verify their identity. Worries about the biometric data being hacked or otherwise leaked was the main concern cited by the 6,152 respondents. Facial recognitions systems are being rolled out in stations, schools, and shopping centres across the country. The survey, firstreported in the West by The Financial Times,external, was released on Thursday by the Nandu Personal Information Protection Research Centre. It has been described as being one of the first major studies of its kind into public opinion on the subject in mainland China. Some 80% of respondents said they were concerned that facial recognition system operators had lax security measures. Separate research suggests that they have good reason to be concerned. China was ranked the worst of 50 surveyed countries in a study looking at how extensively and invasively biometric ID and surveillance systems are being deployed. The work was carried outby the cybersecurity firm Comparitech,external. It said China had no ""specific law to protect citizens' biometrics"" and highlighted a ""lack of safeguards for employees in the workplace"". Some cities are deploying facial recognition systems at road crossings to identify and deter jaywalkers Nandu's survey was carried out via the internet between October and November. In its sample, 57% of respondents voiced concern about their movements being tracked. In addition, 84% of people said they wanted to be able to review the data that facial recognition systems had collected on them and to be able to request that it should be deleted. The majority said they wanted an option to be able to use ID cards, driving licenses and/or passports as an alternative. But the survey also suggested that between 60 to 70% of Chinese residents believed facial recognition made public places safer. China has more facial recognition cameras than any other country and they are often hard to avoid. Earlier this week, local reports said that Zhengzhou, the capital of the northeastern Henan province, had become the first Chinese city to roll the tech out across all its subway train stations. Commuters can use the technology to automatically authorise payments instead of scanning a QR code on their phones. For now, it is a voluntary option,said the China Daily,external. Earlier this month, university professor Guo Bing announced he wassuing Hangzhou Safari Parkfor enforcing facial recognition. Prof Guo, a season ticket holder at the park, had used his fingerprint to enter for years, but was no longer able to do so. The case was covered in the government-owned media, indicating that the Chinese Communist Party is willing for the private use of the technology to be discussed and debated by the public. This video can not be played WATCH: BBC's John Sudworth put a Chinese facial recognition system to the test in December 2007 But the state continues to make some uses of the tech mandatory. At the start of the month, a new regulation came into force that requires mobile phone subscribers to  have their faces scanned when they sign a new contract with a provider. The authorities say the move is designed to prevent the resale of Sim cards to help combat fraud. But country-watchers have suggested it may also be usedto help the police and other officialskeep track of the population.

"France crippled by biggest strike in yearsSome 800,000 people walked out nationwide over proposed pension reform.","This video can not be played Some of the protests turned violent France's largest nationwide strike in years has severely disrupted schools and transport. Workers are angry about planned pension reforms that would see them retiring later or facing reduced payouts. More than 800,000 workers from a wide range of professions demonstrated against the changes. Some cities saw clashes between protesters and police. President Emmanuel Macron wants to introduce a universal points-based pension system. That would replace France's current system, which has 42 different pension schemes across its private and public sectors, with variations in retirement age and benefits. Why are French workers on a nationwide strike? In pictures: The pension protests rocking France How could French strikes affect UK travellers? ""What we've got to do is shut the economy down,"" said union official Christian Grolier of the Force OuvriÃ¨re (Workers' Force). ""People are spoiling for a fight."" There have been clashes between police and protesters in Nantes Since coming to power, Mr Macron has pushed through other reforms including relaxing labour laws and cutting taxes for businesses. More than 800,000 people had joined demonstrations in more than 100 cities across France, the interior ministry said. The CGT union said 1.5m people had turned out, including 250,000 in Paris. The CGT also said workers had blocked seven of the country's eight oil refineries, potentially causing fuel shortages if the strike continues. In Paris, popular tourist sites including the Eiffel Tower, the MusÃ©e d'Orsay and the Palace of Versailles were shut for the day. Allow Twitter content?

At some of the marches there were clashes between protesters and police. Police in Paris had arrested 71 people, officials said. There were numerous reports of vandalism in the city. Violence was also reported in Nantes, Bordeaux and Rennes. Police and protesters clashed in Paris Some 90% of high-speed TGV and inter-city trains were cancelled In Paris, just five of the city's 16 metro lines were running Train operators Eurostar and Thalys cancelled at least half their services linking Paris with London and Brussels.Eurostar will operate a reduced timetable,externaluntil 10 December Hundreds of flights were cancelled Air France cancelled 30% of internal flights and 10% of short-haul international flights amid walkouts by air traffic controllers Low-cost carrier EasyJet cancelled 223 domestic and short-haul international flights, and warned passengers to expect delays. Meanwhile the Extinction Rebellion group said it had sabotaged thousands of e-scooters by painting over the QR codes that smartphone users scan to unlock the vehicles. Allow Twitter content?

The group said this was because e-scooters - despite being widely viewed as an ecologically-friendly form of transport - actually required large quantities of energy and resources during their manufacture and had short life cycles. Teachers and transport workers were joined by police, lawyers, hospital and airport staff, and other professions for the general walkout. Train driver Cyril Romero from Toulouse told France Info he would reconsider his job if the reforms went through. ""I started in 2001 with a contract that allowed me to leave at 50. But like everyone else, I got the reforms which pushed back my early retirement age to 52-and-a-half and then, in reality, 57-and-a-half for full pension. Now they want to make us work even longer."" Demonstrations are taking place across France An unnamed history teacher, writing in HuffPost, was planning to strike on Friday as well as Thursday. ""For me, the pension reforms are one punch too many. We're fighting not to lose hundreds of euros of pension a month - after more than 40 years in a job. ""How can you even think of ending your career in front of pupils beyond the age of 70, in worsening conditions and on what for many of us is just a minimum wage?"" Some trade union leaders have vowed to strike until Mr Macron abandons his campaign promise to overhaul the retirement system. One opinion poll put public support for the strikes at 69%, with backing strongest among 18- to 34 year olds. However farmers, whose pensions are among the lowest in the country, are not taking part. Demonstrators blocked buses in Marseille The Macron administration will hope to avoid a repeat of the country's general strike over pension reforms in 1995, which crippled the transport system for three weeks and drew massive popular support, forcing a government climbdown. A number of ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protesters had said they planned to join the demonstrations. Anger of yellow vests grips France a year on Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? The movement, which emerged at the end of 2018, started with demonstrations against a sharp increase in diesel taxes, but has broadened to reflect anger over higher living costs and President Macron's economic policies. Mr Macron's unified system - which he says would be fairer - would reward employees for each day worked, awarding points that would later be transferred into future pension benefits. The official retirement age has been raised in the last decade from 60 to 62, but remains one of the lowest among the OECD group of rich nations - in the UK, for example, the retirement age for state pensions is 66 and is due to rise to at least 67. The move would remove the most advantageous pensions for a number of jobs ranging from sailors to lawyers and even opera workers. Meanwhile, those retiring before 64 would receive a lower pension. For example, someone retiring at 63 would receive 5% less, so unions fear it will mean having to work longer for a lower pension. A recent poll concluded that 75% of people thought that pension reforms were necessary, but only a third believed the government could deliver them. How could French strikes affect UK travellers?

"Farage defends decision not to contest Tory seatsThe Brexit Party leader claims his party are ""tearing chunks out of the Labour vote"", as three of its MEPs quit.","This video can not be played Nigel Farage says portraying his party as harbouring candidates with extreme views is ""completely wrong"". Nigel Farage has defended his ""difficult"" decision not to contest Tory-held seats, insisting he was putting ""country before party"". The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Neil that his party had stopped the ""Lib Dem surge"" and were ""tearing chunks out of the Labour vote"". He said his party was the challenger in Labour-Leave areas in next week's poll. It comes as three Brexit Party MEPs quit to support the Tories, saying the party will split the pro-Brexit vote. Annunziata Rees-Mogg, Lance Forman and Lucy Harris resigned the whip on Thursday, with Ms Rees-Mogg - Tory minister Jacob Rees-Mogg's sister - saying it was ""tragic"" that the Brexit Party ""are now the very party risking Brexit"". Mr Farage announced in November that his party would not contest the 317 Westminster seats the Conservatives won in 2017, in order to help Leave-supporting candidates win. Some have been critical of this decision, including MEP John Longworth, who lost the Brexit Party whip in the European Parliament on Wednesday for not support his leader's strategy. He is now backing the Conservatives. Andy Wigmore, from the Leave.EU group Mr Farage fronted at the 2016 referendum, said the former Brexit Party MEPs had made the ""right decision at the right time"" to back the Conservatives. ""It's time for Nigel to join them,"" he added in a tweet. LIVE: General election campaign What are the Brexit Party's 12 key policies? Farage hits out at MEPs over Tory support Nigel Farage's interview fact-checked During the 30-minute interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Farage was asked about his election strategy, Islamophobic remarks made by two of his candidates and whether the NHS should be ""on the table"" in any post-Brexit trade talks with the US. The Brexit Party leader denied being marginalised at the general election. Mr Farage said: ""I don't think if you came with me and visited some of the Labour heartlands in the north you would think that and I also think that what we've done is have a very dramatic effect on this election. ""I think, number one, the decision, difficult decision, I took in 317 seats to stand down. ""What that's done is that's poleaxed the Liberal Democrats. They were going to win in south London down through Surrey, right out to the west of England they were going to win a lot of seats if we'd stood. And I knew that wasn't the right thing to do."" The four former Brexit Party MEPs are urging voters to support the Conservative Party Mr Farage claimed the Brexit Party had prevented a ""surge"" from the pro-EU Lib Dems and had, therefore, blocked a second EU referendum. ""What we are actually doing now is tearing chunks out of the Labour vote,"" he said. He blamed his failure to form a so-called ""Leave alliance"" between his party and the Conservative Party for the election on the Tories. ""The Conservative Party didn't want to do it,"" he said. This video can not be played Nigel Farage says three of the MEPs who have left his Brexit Party have links to the Conservative government On his call for political reform, including scrapping the House of Lords and changing the voting system, he said: ""At this stage we don't look like fundamentally reforming British politics, but do I think there is an appetite for it? Absolutely."" Mr Farage said he believed Boris Johnson would win the election and that was his preference in a choice with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. But he said he was undecided who to vote for in the Conservative-held constituency where he lives. Andrew Neil also challenged Mr Farage on Islamophobic comments made by two of his candidates in in Edinburgh South West and Birmingham Ladywood. ""Any attempt that gets made to try and paint the Brexit Party into being a right-wing political party that would harbour anybody with extreme views is completely and utterly wrong,"" he said. ""We are, in terms of the mix of our candidates, if I look at what we put forward for the European elections, we had more diversity of background, of class, of race, than any other party."" On Brexit, Mr Farage said he wanted to see ""some amendments"" to Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, saying: ""If we don't we are not going to get a clean break from the EU."" And on whether he thinks NHS drug prices would be ""on the table"" in post-Brexit trade deal talks with the US, Mr Farage said the suggestion was ""ludicrous because no British government will sign up to more expensive drugs"". He said he believed that ""wealthier people should be encouraged to take out private insurance to lift the burden off a system that is struggling to cope"". ""When it comes to opening up the NHS for privatisation, do you want the truth? It's already happened."" In a special series of election interviews, Andrew Neil has already questioned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has yet to agree a date to taking part, which has prompted a political row and accusations from Labour that he is ""running scared"".

Chinese worry about rise of facial recognitionA study by a Beijing-based body indicates many are worried about their biometric data being hacked.Technology,"Some buses in Shanghai have had facial recognition systems fitted to them A survey by a Beijing research institute indicates growing pushback against facial recognition in China. Some 74% of respondents said they wanted the option to be able to use traditional ID methods over the tech to verify their identity. Worries about the biometric data being hacked or otherwise leaked was the main concern cited by the 6,152 respondents. Facial recognitions systems are being rolled out in stations, schools, and shopping centres across the country. The survey, firstreported in the West by The Financial Times,external, was released on Thursday by the Nandu Personal Information Protection Research Centre. It has been described as being one of the first major studies of its kind into public opinion on the subject in mainland China. Some 80% of respondents said they were concerned that facial recognition system operators had lax security measures. Separate research suggests that they have good reason to be concerned. China was ranked the worst of 50 surveyed countries in a study looking at how extensively and invasively biometric ID and surveillance systems are being deployed. The work was carried outby the cybersecurity firm Comparitech,external. It said China had no ""specific law to protect citizens' biometrics"" and highlighted a ""lack of safeguards for employees in the workplace"". Some cities are deploying facial recognition systems at road crossings to identify and deter jaywalkers Nandu's survey was carried out via the internet between October and November. In its sample, 57% of respondents voiced concern about their movements being tracked. In addition, 84% of people said they wanted to be able to review the data that facial recognition systems had collected on them and to be able to request that it should be deleted. The majority said they wanted an option to be able to use ID cards, driving licenses and/or passports as an alternative. But the survey also suggested that between 60 to 70% of Chinese residents believed facial recognition made public places safer. China has more facial recognition cameras than any other country and they are often hard to avoid. Earlier this week, local reports said that Zhengzhou, the capital of the northeastern Henan province, had become the first Chinese city to roll the tech out across all its subway train stations. Commuters can use the technology to automatically authorise payments instead of scanning a QR code on their phones. For now, it is a voluntary option,said the China Daily,external. Earlier this month, university professor Guo Bing announced he wassuing Hangzhou Safari Parkfor enforcing facial recognition. Prof Guo, a season ticket holder at the park, had used his fingerprint to enter for years, but was no longer able to do so. The case was covered in the government-owned media, indicating that the Chinese Communist Party is willing for the private use of the technology to be discussed and debated by the public. This video can not be played WATCH: BBC's John Sudworth put a Chinese facial recognition system to the test in December 2007 But the state continues to make some uses of the tech mandatory. At the start of the month, a new regulation came into force that requires mobile phone subscribers to  have their faces scanned when they sign a new contract with a provider. The authorities say the move is designed to prevent the resale of Sim cards to help combat fraud. But country-watchers have suggested it may also be usedto help the police and other officialskeep track of the population.

Simon JackBBC Business Editor Nationalising UK energy companies will delay the UK's move towards a zero carbon future according to the chief executive of Scottish Power, Keith Anderson. He says that investment by the private sector had seen the cost of renewable energy plummet over the last decade and that debates about nationalisation would only serve as a distraction from averting a climate emergency. ""We need to focus on hitting zero carbon by 2050. Anything else is a distraction. ""Having big arguments about who owns what is the worst thing we could do right now.

By BBC politics reporter Lucy Webster When you register to vote, your name and address are placed on the electoral roll - a public document that is available to all. For some, that can lead to a potentially dangerous dilemma. ""If I were being really cynical about it, one could argue that it's almost sexual discrimination by the back door,"" says a women we'll call Kate, as we talk about her struggle to access the vote after escaping an abusive relationship, with the two small boys. Kate was always politically engaged. She had been registered to vote by post at her previous address - but it was too dangerous for her to return there to pick up her ballot paper and she couldn't make her new address public for fear her abusive partner could catch up with her. But she still wanted to vote. So she began researching her options. Initially, she found nothing online to help her. Eventually, her mother suggested asking her local council. ""The first person she spoke to said she had no idea what my mother was talking about but when pressed did find a senior officer,"" Kate says. ""This officer knew that Icould register anonymously,externaland checked my current address and advised there was a special form that would be posted to me."" It was the first time Kate had heard of the system. It seems many others don't know it exists. Continue reading here.

Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt both died in the London Bridge attack last week In case you missed it, here's a bit more from the Labour leader's appearance on ITV earlier. Jeremy Corbyn warned the UK's
involvement in overseas wars has led to the development of breeding grounds for
""the most extreme kind of terrorists"". The Labour leader said there were
""vast, ungoverned spaces"" in Lybia and Syria as a consequence of
conflicts the UK had taken part in. Speaking on ITV Tonight's The Leader
Interviews, Mr Corbyn warned that ""no country could completely insulate itself
from the rest of the world"". Asked about the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan, who
had been released from prison half way through a terrorism sentence, Mr Corbyn said there were questions to
answer. ""I want to know exactly what deradicalisaiton programme he
undertook in prison, why the Parole Board was not involved in his
release."" He denied that his first instinct had been
to criticise the UK. ""My first instinct was the instinct of everybody else
to be shocked and appalled at what had happened and to resolve that we do
everything to keep everybody safe in the future,"" he added. You can tune in to BBC One from 22:45 GMT to watch. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That's it from Mr Corbyn's speech at the rally in Birmingham. He says ""everything will be thrown at us"" over the last week of the campaign. But ""we're going to be out there... with our message of hope, of inclusion, of a society that is based on the needs of all of us and the social justice of all"". He wraps things up by saying: ""I can't wait for next Thursday."" Hammering home his main message, Mr Corbyn says: ""It runs like a golden thread all the way through our manifesto - the need to bring people together, and the need to develop a society that genuinely works for all."" He references policies to improve workers' rights, to tackle the gender pay gap (for which he gets a loud cheer), to fight climate change and to ""save our planet"". He says he goes into the election campaign knowing there is great ""inequality"" and many ""injustices"" within regions across the country - and adds that a Labour government would ensure local communities get their ""fair share of transport and investment"". He says the West Midlands has made a ""massive contribution to this country"" and deserves to avoid ""another 10 years of austerity and cuts"". You can read more about Labour's policies - and compare them with all of the other major parties' pledges - here. The UK's main parties are gearing up for a general election on 12 December. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. So how has this happened? The answer to that and other questionscan be found in our really simple election guide. The Labour leader starts things off by reflecting on the school visits he's been on today. Mr Corbyn says he's ""inspired"" by the ambitions of the children he's met - but also saddened by the difficulties they and their ""stressed-out"" teachers have faced as they struggle with a ""lack of funds"". ""None of this is necessary, none of this is right,"" he says. All of this is part of Labour's promotion ofeducation plans they announced earlier today. Highlights of the pledges made include capping class sizes by recruiting 20,000 extra teachers. ... with the familar chants of ""oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" from his supporters. Once the singing dies down, he'll start his speech. Ahead of Jeremy Corbyn taking the stage at the Labour rally in Birmingham comes support from singer Jamelia. She talks about being a single mum, enjoying her education and having all three of her daughters in NHS hospitals. ""It's very important to support all of the services that have made me the woman I am,"" she says. She also talks about how her daughter almost died as a newborn - but because of the NHS, she is alive. She's going to turn two soon and ""all she wants for her birthday is a Labour government"".

""If I were being really cynical about it, one could argue that it's almost sexual discrimination by the back door,"" says a women we'll call Kate, as we talk about her struggle to access the vote after escaping an abusive relationship, with the two small boys. Kate was always politically engaged. She had been registered to vote by post at her previous address - but it was too dangerous for her to return there to pick up her ballot paper and she couldn't make her new address public for fear her abusive partner could catch up with her. But she still wanted to vote. So she began researching her options. Initially, she found nothing online to help her. Eventually, her mother suggested asking her local council. ""The first person she spoke to said she had no idea what my mother was talking about but when pressed did find a senior officer,"" Kate says. ""This officer knew that Icould register anonymously,externaland checked my current address and advised there was a special form that would be posted to me."" It was the first time Kate had heard of the system. It seems many others don't know it exists. Continue reading here.

Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt both died in the London Bridge attack last week In case you missed it, here's a bit more from the Labour leader's appearance on ITV earlier. Jeremy Corbyn warned the UK's
involvement in overseas wars has led to the development of breeding grounds for
""the most extreme kind of terrorists"". The Labour leader said there were
""vast, ungoverned spaces"" in Lybia and Syria as a consequence of
conflicts the UK had taken part in. Speaking on ITV Tonight's The Leader
Interviews, Mr Corbyn warned that ""no country could completely insulate itself
from the rest of the world"". Asked about the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan, who
had been released from prison half way through a terrorism sentence, Mr Corbyn said there were questions to
answer. ""I want to know exactly what deradicalisaiton programme he
undertook in prison, why the Parole Board was not involved in his
release."" He denied that his first instinct had been
to criticise the UK. ""My first instinct was the instinct of everybody else
to be shocked and appalled at what had happened and to resolve that we do
everything to keep everybody safe in the future,"" he added. You can tune in to BBC One from 22:45 GMT to watch. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That's it from Mr Corbyn's speech at the rally in Birmingham. He says ""everything will be thrown at us"" over the last week of the campaign. But ""we're going to be out there... with our message of hope, of inclusion, of a society that is based on the needs of all of us and the social justice of all"". He wraps things up by saying: ""I can't wait for next Thursday."" Hammering home his main message, Mr Corbyn says: ""It runs like a golden thread all the way through our manifesto - the need to bring people together, and the need to develop a society that genuinely works for all."" He references policies to improve workers' rights, to tackle the gender pay gap (for which he gets a loud cheer), to fight climate change and to ""save our planet"". He says he goes into the election campaign knowing there is great ""inequality"" and many ""injustices"" within regions across the country - and adds that a Labour government would ensure local communities get their ""fair share of transport and investment"". He says the West Midlands has made a ""massive contribution to this country"" and deserves to avoid ""another 10 years of austerity and cuts"". You can read more about Labour's policies - and compare them with all of the other major parties' pledges - here. The UK's main parties are gearing up for a general election on 12 December. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. So how has this happened? The answer to that and other questionscan be found in our really simple election guide. The Labour leader starts things off by reflecting on the school visits he's been on today. Mr Corbyn says he's ""inspired"" by the ambitions of the children he's met - but also saddened by the difficulties they and their ""stressed-out"" teachers have faced as they struggle with a ""lack of funds"". ""None of this is necessary, none of this is right,"" he says. All of this is part of Labour's promotion ofeducation plans they announced earlier today. Highlights of the pledges made include capping class sizes by recruiting 20,000 extra teachers. ... with the familar chants of ""oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" from his supporters. Once the singing dies down, he'll start his speech. Ahead of Jeremy Corbyn taking the stage at the Labour rally in Birmingham comes support from singer Jamelia. She talks about being a single mum, enjoying her education and having all three of her daughters in NHS hospitals. ""It's very important to support all of the services that have made me the woman I am,"" she says. She also talks about how her daughter almost died as a newborn - but because of the NHS, she is alive. She's going to turn two soon and ""all she wants for her birthday is a Labour government"".

"Tories promise Brexit and Budget in first 100 daysBoris Johnson's blueprint prompts attacks from Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems.Election 2019Comments","This video can not be played PM: 'I absolutely promise' UK out of EU by January Boris Johnson has promised to pass his Brexit deal and bring a Budget within 100 days if he is elected PM. The Tory leader said it would includehis pledge to raise the National Insurance threshold to Â£9,500, along with cash for schools and the NHS. He has pledged a ""new government with a new approach"" - with a focus on better infrastructure, education and technology. But Labour said Tories only offered ""more of the same failure"". The Lib Dems called the Conservative plans ""pure fantasy"", while the SNP warned there were seven days left to ""lock"" Mr Johnson out of Downing Street. LIVE: One week to go until voting day What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? Sajid Javid EU trade deal claim fact-checked How much tax do British people pay? Voters will go to the polls on 12 December for the third election in just over four years. Mr Johnson said he would set out his wider legislative agenda in a Queen's Speech pencilled in for 19 December if he gets back into No 10. He promised this would build onthe programme that was approved by Parliament as recently as October, but which was then effectively mothballed after MPs voted to back an early election. And he has committed to bringing his EU withdrawal agreement back for initial approval by MPs before Christmas. ""All we need is a working majority to deliver it. Every single one of our candidates has signed up to this deal,"" Mr Johnson said. He said the possibility that a Conservative government could fail to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020 ""simply will not happen"". This 11-month deadline covers thetransition periodthat would follow if the UK left the EU in January, which critics say does not leave enough time to negotiate such a deal and could mean the UK ends up without one. They include former Tory Justice Secretary - and now independent candidate -David Gauke, who said leaving without a deal would be ""disastrous for the prosperity of our countryâ¦ [making] whole sectors unviable"". But Mr Johnson said the UK was in a ""zero-tariff, zero-quota position"" already, which would make the talks easier. He added: ""Look at what we achieved in three months with the deal I did"". In an interview with ITV's This Morning, he said a trade deal with the EU was a ""very exciting prospect"", could be agreed ""by the end of next year"". Mr Johnson's plan for the first 100 days gives a timetable to a number of his existing pledges from the campaign trail, including: Raising the National Insurance threshold, which the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies says will save workers about Â£85 per year Ending the automatic release of serious violent and sexual offenders Increasing the amount migrants pay for using the NHS Finalising an agreement with mobile operators over countryside coverage The Conservatives have also said they would introduce a number of pieces of legislation in the 100-day timeframe to take the first steps on other promises including: A law to raise minimum per pupil funding in schools A law to ensure Â£33.9bn is put into the NHS each year by 2023 A new points-based immigration system The roll-out of gigabit broadband Mr Johnson vowed that, in government, the Tories would prioritise their plan to raise the National Insurance threshold, as it would deliver a tax cut for ""those who need the most help with the cost of living"". But Labour,which is making an announcement of its own on schools funding on Thursday, said the Conservatives' record in office over the past nine-and-a-half years was one of total failure. ""In those days we've seen child poverty soar, rising homelessness, rising food bank use, and violent crime is up too while the NHS has more people waiting for operations, and record staff vacancies,"" said shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne. ""As the Conservatives approach 3,500 days of failure, it's clear that more of the same failed austerity, privatisation and tax giveaways for the few is not the answer."" And as she prepared to embark on a week-long election bus tour, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said her party was the only one in Scotland capable of thwarting Mr Johnson's ""extreme Brexit"". ""If Boris Johnson wins a majority in seven days' time, Scotland will be dragged out of Europe within just eight weeks,"" she said. ""We have seven days to escape Brexit, lock Boris Johnson out of office and put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands.""

Instructor guilty of indecent assaults on boys,"Robert Pugh denied all the charges A former climbing instructor has been found guilty of indecently assaulting three boys. Robert Pugh, 75, of Cardiff, assaulted the boys at Storey Arms outdoor activity centre in the Brecon Beacons during the 1980s and 1990s. At Cardiff Crown Court the jury were previouslydirected to find Pugh not guiltyof three charges of historical child abuse due to a lack of evidence. Pugh was remanded in custody and will be sentenced in January. The 75-year-old was emotionless as guilty verdicts were read out on the 10 charges. Pugh had faced trial for the third time over the indecent assault allegations. Storey Arms outdoor activity centre is in the Brecon Beacons National Park The first trial in 2018 was halted for legal reasons, and following that trial a second victim came forward. A jury failed to reach a verdict in a second trial in August 2019 and after that, a third victim was identified. All three victims said they were under the age of 16 when Pugh started abusing them at the outdoor pursuits centre. The court heard the boys seen as Pugh's favourites were offered additional courses, received gifts and were taken to a pub. They were given the opportunity to sleep in single rooms rather than dormitories. The prosecution said that beneath Pugh's respectable exterior ""there was something that drove him to touch these boys"". The jury was told one of the boys was ""petrified"" when asked to share a tent with Pugh on a camping trip. Another told the court that it was easier to let it happen than to try and fight Pugh off. Instructor not guilty of three child abuse charges Boy 'repeatedly assaulted by climbing instructor' Boy 'shared tent with abuser for free holiday' After the verdict, one of Pugh's victims thanked South Wales Police and the Crown Prosecution Service. ""My friends and family have also been a huge support, considering they have also suffered a lot throughout this process,"" he wrote. ""Ultimately this trial was about victims. Having suffered some very dark times during this process, I'm getting myself better, and can look forward to moving on with my life.""

Huge bushfires surround Sydney and destroy homes,"Officials have issued fresh warnings for blazes around Sydney About 100 bushfires are raging in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), with the most severe forming into a ""mega blaze"" north of Sydney. More than 2,000 firefighters are battling bushfires, which escalated in intensity late on Thursday. Footage of one blaze on the southern fringe of the city showed firefighters fleeing as flames surged forward. Australia's largest city has been blanketed by thick smoke all week, causing a rise in medical problems. Since October, bushfires have killed six people and destroyed more than 700 homes across Australia. The severity of the blazes so early in the fire season has caused alarm, and prompted calls for greater action to tackle climate change. This video can not be played Firefighters flee intense flames in Sydney, in a video shared by them to show the dangers of bushfires More than 1.6 million hectares of land in NSW have been burnt already. Fires have also raged across Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Fires spanned the entire NSW coastline on Friday, with some sparking emergency warnings amid hot and windy conditions. Authorities confirmed three fires had merged into a ""mega blaze"" north of Sydney on Friday, covering more than 300,000 hectares. That blaze is about the size of greater Sydney, officials said. ""We have also seen the fires coming in very close proximity to major population centres,"" said NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian. Allow Twitter content?

Many fires have raged for weeks, feeding off tinder-dry conditions from a severe drought which has affected much of the nation. ""We are in for another tough day,"" said NSW Rural Fire Service assistant commissioner Rob Rogers, adding that several properties had been destroyed in the past 24 hours. Fire crews from the US and Canada arrived in NSW this week to help tackle the blazes. Why Australia's bushfire threat will continue How are animals faring in the fires? Victim takes charred home to parliament In Queensland, authorities said at least two homes had been destroyed in the past day. Sydney's air quality deteriorated beyond ""hazardous"" levels this week as smoke from the fires again blanketed the city. The front page of the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Friday read:""Sydney chokes as state burns"".,external The smoke haze over the city on Thursday Hospital admissions have risen 25% in the past week said officials, with people reporting asthma and breathing problems. About five million people live in greater Sydney. People have been warned to stay indoors, but the smoke in some areas has also seeped into buildings. How bad is bushfire smoke for health? Toxic smoke affects golfers at Australian Open Early on Friday, the NSW capital ranked number 19 on the Air Visual global rankings of cities with the worst air pollution - putting it ahead of Shanghai and Mumbai. The smoke has also affected towns closer to the fires for weeks. The state government said on Thursday that the air pollution event was ""the longest and most widespread in our records"". Bushfires are common in Australia, but this year's fire season is more intense and has begun earlier than usual - something meteorologists say is exacerbated by climate change. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology says thatclimate change has led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland raised the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Last week, the bureau noted that NSW had endured its driest spring season on record. It also warned that Australia's coming summer was predicted to bring similar conditions to last year's - the nation's hottest summer on record. Australia may see 50C days 'in decades' Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' Official figures have shown 2018 and 2017 were Australia's third and fourth-hottest years on record respectively. As the fires rage on, the Australian government has been criticised over its efforts to address climate change. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has dismissed accusations linking the crisis to his government's policies. Hundreds of bushfire survivors and farmers converged on the nation's capital, Canberra, this week in protest.One woman displayed the charred remains of her home outside Parliament- on which she had written: ""Morrison, your climate crisis destroyed my home."" Melinda Plesman called for the government to take action on climate change Last weekthe UN reiterated that Australia is among seven G20 nations needing to do moreto meet their climate promises. The list also includes Brazil, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, South Africa and the US. The UN has previously noted that Australia is falling short of its Paris agreement commitments to cut CO2 emissions. Australia has pledged to a 26-28% cut on its 2005 levels by 2030. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that global emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 to keep temperature rise under 1.5C.

France crippled by biggest strike in years,"This video can not be played Some of the protests turned violent France's largest nationwide strike in years has severely disrupted schools and transport. Workers are angry about planned pension reforms that would see them retiring later or facing reduced payouts. More than 800,000 workers from a wide range of professions demonstrated against the changes. Some cities saw clashes between protesters and police. President Emmanuel Macron wants to introduce a universal points-based pension system. That would replace France's current system, which has 42 different pension schemes across its private and public sectors, with variations in retirement age and benefits. Why are French workers on a nationwide strike? In pictures: The pension protests rocking France How could French strikes affect UK travellers? ""What we've got to do is shut the economy down,"" said union official Christian Grolier of the Force OuvriÃ¨re (Workers' Force). ""People are spoiling for a fight."" There have been clashes between police and protesters in Nantes Since coming to power, Mr Macron has pushed through other reforms including relaxing labour laws and cutting taxes for businesses. More than 800,000 people had joined demonstrations in more than 100 cities across France, the interior ministry said. The CGT union said 1.5m people had turned out, including 250,000 in Paris. The CGT also said workers had blocked seven of the country's eight oil refineries, potentially causing fuel shortages if the strike continues. In Paris, popular tourist sites including the Eiffel Tower, the MusÃ©e d'Orsay and the Palace of Versailles were shut for the day. Allow Twitter content?

The group said this was because e-scooters - despite being widely viewed as an ecologically-friendly form of transport - actually required large quantities of energy and resources during their manufacture and had short life cycles. Teachers and transport workers were joined by police, lawyers, hospital and airport staff, and other professions for the general walkout. Train driver Cyril Romero from Toulouse told France Info he would reconsider his job if the reforms went through. ""I started in 2001 with a contract that allowed me to leave at 50. But like everyone else, I got the reforms which pushed back my early retirement age to 52-and-a-half and then, in reality, 57-and-a-half for full pension. Now they want to make us work even longer."" Demonstrations are taking place across France An unnamed history teacher, writing in HuffPost, was planning to strike on Friday as well as Thursday. ""For me, the pension reforms are one punch too many. We're fighting not to lose hundreds of euros of pension a month - after more than 40 years in a job. ""How can you even think of ending your career in front of pupils beyond the age of 70, in worsening conditions and on what for many of us is just a minimum wage?"" Some trade union leaders have vowed to strike until Mr Macron abandons his campaign promise to overhaul the retirement system. One opinion poll put public support for the strikes at 69%, with backing strongest among 18- to 34 year olds. However farmers, whose pensions are among the lowest in the country, are not taking part. Demonstrators blocked buses in Marseille The Macron administration will hope to avoid a repeat of the country's general strike over pension reforms in 1995, which crippled the transport system for three weeks and drew massive popular support, forcing a government climbdown. A number of ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protesters had said they planned to join the demonstrations. Anger of yellow vests grips France a year on Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? The movement, which emerged at the end of 2018, started with demonstrations against a sharp increase in diesel taxes, but has broadened to reflect anger over higher living costs and President Macron's economic policies. Mr Macron's unified system - which he says would be fairer - would reward employees for each day worked, awarding points that would later be transferred into future pension benefits. The official retirement age has been raised in the last decade from 60 to 62, but remains one of the lowest among the OECD group of rich nations - in the UK, for example, the retirement age for state pensions is 66 and is due to rise to at least 67. The move would remove the most advantageous pensions for a number of jobs ranging from sailors to lawyers and even opera workers. Meanwhile, those retiring before 64 would receive a lower pension. For example, someone retiring at 63 would receive 5% less, so unions fear it will mean having to work longer for a lower pension. A recent poll concluded that 75% of people thought that pension reforms were necessary, but only a third believed the government could deliver them. How could French strikes affect UK travellers?

Chinese worry about rise of facial recognition,"Some buses in Shanghai have had facial recognition systems fitted to them A survey by a Beijing research institute indicates growing pushback against facial recognition in China. Some 74% of respondents said they wanted the option to be able to use traditional ID methods over the tech to verify their identity. Worries about the biometric data being hacked or otherwise leaked was the main concern cited by the 6,152 respondents. Facial recognitions systems are being rolled out in stations, schools, and shopping centres across the country. The survey, firstreported in the West by The Financial Times,external, was released on Thursday by the Nandu Personal Information Protection Research Centre. It has been described as being one of the first major studies of its kind into public opinion on the subject in mainland China. Some 80% of respondents said they were concerned that facial recognition system operators had lax security measures. Separate research suggests that they have good reason to be concerned. China was ranked the worst of 50 surveyed countries in a study looking at how extensively and invasively biometric ID and surveillance systems are being deployed. The work was carried outby the cybersecurity firm Comparitech,external. It said China had no ""specific law to protect citizens' biometrics"" and highlighted a ""lack of safeguards for employees in the workplace"". Some cities are deploying facial recognition systems at road crossings to identify and deter jaywalkers Nandu's survey was carried out via the internet between October and November. In its sample, 57% of respondents voiced concern about their movements being tracked. In addition, 84% of people said they wanted to be able to review the data that facial recognition systems had collected on them and to be able to request that it should be deleted. The majority said they wanted an option to be able to use ID cards, driving licenses and/or passports as an alternative. But the survey also suggested that between 60 to 70% of Chinese residents believed facial recognition made public places safer. China has more facial recognition cameras than any other country and they are often hard to avoid. Earlier this week, local reports said that Zhengzhou, the capital of the northeastern Henan province, had become the first Chinese city to roll the tech out across all its subway train stations. Commuters can use the technology to automatically authorise payments instead of scanning a QR code on their phones. For now, it is a voluntary option,said the China Daily,external. Earlier this month, university professor Guo Bing announced he wassuing Hangzhou Safari Parkfor enforcing facial recognition. Prof Guo, a season ticket holder at the park, had used his fingerprint to enter for years, but was no longer able to do so. The case was covered in the government-owned media, indicating that the Chinese Communist Party is willing for the private use of the technology to be discussed and debated by the public. This video can not be played WATCH: BBC's John Sudworth put a Chinese facial recognition system to the test in December 2007 But the state continues to make some uses of the tech mandatory. At the start of the month, a new regulation came into force that requires mobile phone subscribers to  have their faces scanned when they sign a new contract with a provider. The authorities say the move is designed to prevent the resale of Sim cards to help combat fraud. But country-watchers have suggested it may also be usedto help the police and other officialskeep track of the population.

"As it happened: Updates from the campaign trailWith a week until polling day, party leaders continued to tour the country in the hope of winning votes.","Today marks one week until the general election The BBC's Andrew Neil interviews Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage - and challenges the PM to face him The Conservatives set out a pitch for their first 100 days in office, should they win, including a February Budget Three Brexit Party MEPs have resigned the party's whip, to throw their support behind the Tories Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has detailed his plan to tackle homelessness and recruit more teachers The Lib Dems want to spend money on research and development There are seven days to stop Brexit, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon says, as she starts a national bus tour Hamish Mackay and Alice Evans This time next week, the votes will be in and the ballot boxes will be on their way to be counted. In case you missed any of today's developments, here's a summary:  That's the end of our live coverage for tonight - join us tomorrow for more live page fun. Simon JackBBC Business Editor Nationalising UK energy companies will delay the UK's move towards a zero carbon future according to the chief executive of Scottish Power, Keith Anderson. He says that investment by the private sector had seen the cost of renewable energy plummet over the last decade and that debates about nationalisation would only serve as a distraction from averting a climate emergency. ""We need to focus on hitting zero carbon by 2050. Anything else is a distraction. ""Having big arguments about who owns what is the worst thing we could do right now. It would slow everything down when what we need to do is speed up."" A Labour spokesman responds by saying Mr Anderson's comments are ""hardly surprising"" as they represent ""vested interests"". Read the full story here. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell tells the Financial Times that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would not negotiate deals with smaller parties in the event of a hung Parliament. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph launches its latest attack on Mr Corbyn for what it calls the anti-Semitism ""storm"" in his party. It's that time of the night when we get a preview of the next day's papers - and a number of them focus on Andrew Neil's challenge to Boris Johnson. The Metro says the ""BBC rottweiler"" hasthrown down the gauntlet with his request for an interview.The PM is the only main party leader not to face Neil in a one-on-one interview.  The same story also features on the front page of Friday's Guardian - although the paper's lead concerns the ""worldwide surge"" in measles cases. By BBC politics reporter Lucy Webster When you register to vote, your name and address are placed on the electoral roll - a public document that is available to all. For some, that can lead to a potentially dangerous dilemma. ""If I were being really cynical about it, one could argue that it's almost sexual discrimination by the back door,"" says a women we'll call Kate, as we talk about her struggle to access the vote after escaping an abusive relationship, with the two small boys. Kate was always politically engaged. She had been registered to vote by post at her previous address - but it was too dangerous for her to return there to pick up her ballot paper and she couldn't make her new address public for fear her abusive partner could catch up with her. But she still wanted to vote. So she began researching her options. Initially, she found nothing online to help her. Eventually, her mother suggested asking her local council. ""The first person she spoke to said she had no idea what my mother was talking about but when pressed did find a senior officer,"" Kate says. ""This officer knew that Icould register anonymously,externaland checked my current address and advised there was a special form that would be posted to me."" It was the first time Kate had heard of the system. It seems many others don't know it exists. Continue reading here.

Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt both died in the London Bridge attack last week In case you missed it, here's a bit more from the Labour leader's appearance on ITV earlier. Jeremy Corbyn warned the UK's
involvement in overseas wars has led to the development of breeding grounds for
""the most extreme kind of terrorists"". The Labour leader said there were
""vast, ungoverned spaces"" in Lybia and Syria as a consequence of
conflicts the UK had taken part in. Speaking on ITV Tonight's The Leader
Interviews, Mr Corbyn warned that ""no country could completely insulate itself
from the rest of the world"". Asked about the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan, who
had been released from prison half way through a terrorism sentence, Mr Corbyn said there were questions to
answer. ""I want to know exactly what deradicalisaiton programme he
undertook in prison, why the Parole Board was not involved in his
release."" He denied that his first instinct had been
to criticise the UK. ""My first instinct was the instinct of everybody else
to be shocked and appalled at what had happened and to resolve that we do
everything to keep everybody safe in the future,"" he added. You can tune in to BBC One from 22:45 GMT to watch. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That's it from Mr Corbyn's speech at the rally in Birmingham. He says ""everything will be thrown at us"" over the last week of the campaign. But ""we're going to be out there... with our message of hope, of inclusion, of a society that is based on the needs of all of us and the social justice of all"". He wraps things up by saying: ""I can't wait for next Thursday."" Hammering home his main message, Mr Corbyn says: ""It runs like a golden thread all the way through our manifesto - the need to bring people together, and the need to develop a society that genuinely works for all."" He references policies to improve workers' rights, to tackle the gender pay gap (for which he gets a loud cheer), to fight climate change and to ""save our planet"". He says he goes into the election campaign knowing there is great ""inequality"" and many ""injustices"" within regions across the country - and adds that a Labour government would ensure local communities get their ""fair share of transport and investment"". He says the West Midlands has made a ""massive contribution to this country"" and deserves to avoid ""another 10 years of austerity and cuts"". You can read more about Labour's policies - and compare them with all of the other major parties' pledges - here. The UK's main parties are gearing up for a general election on 12 December. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. So how has this happened? The answer to that and other questionscan be found in our really simple election guide. The Labour leader starts things off by reflecting on the school visits he's been on today. Mr Corbyn says he's ""inspired"" by the ambitions of the children he's met - but also saddened by the difficulties they and their ""stressed-out"" teachers have faced as they struggle with a ""lack of funds"". ""None of this is necessary, none of this is right,"" he says. All of this is part of Labour's promotion ofeducation plans they announced earlier today. Highlights of the pledges made include capping class sizes by recruiting 20,000 extra teachers. ... with the familar chants of ""oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" from his supporters. Once the singing dies down, he'll start his speech. Ahead of Jeremy Corbyn taking the stage at the Labour rally in Birmingham comes support from singer Jamelia. She talks about being a single mum, enjoying her education and having all three of her daughters in NHS hospitals. ""It's very important to support all of the services that have made me the woman I am,"" she says. She also talks about how her daughter almost died as a newborn - but because of the NHS, she is alive. She's going to turn two soon and ""all she wants for her birthday is a Labour government"".

Farage defends decision not to contest Tory seats,"This video can not be played Nigel Farage says portraying his party as harbouring candidates with extreme views is ""completely wrong"". Nigel Farage has defended his ""difficult"" decision not to contest Tory-held seats, insisting he was putting ""country before party"". The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Neil that his party had stopped the ""Lib Dem surge"" and were ""tearing chunks out of the Labour vote"". He said his party was the challenger in Labour-Leave areas in next week's poll. It comes as three Brexit Party MEPs quit to support the Tories, saying the party will split the pro-Brexit vote. Annunziata Rees-Mogg, Lance Forman and Lucy Harris resigned the whip on Thursday, with Ms Rees-Mogg - Tory minister Jacob Rees-Mogg's sister - saying it was ""tragic"" that the Brexit Party ""are now the very party risking Brexit"". Mr Farage announced in November that his party would not contest the 317 Westminster seats the Conservatives won in 2017, in order to help Leave-supporting candidates win. Some have been critical of this decision, including MEP John Longworth, who lost the Brexit Party whip in the European Parliament on Wednesday for not support his leader's strategy. He is now backing the Conservatives. Andy Wigmore, from the Leave.EU group Mr Farage fronted at the 2016 referendum, said the former Brexit Party MEPs had made the ""right decision at the right time"" to back the Conservatives. ""It's time for Nigel to join them,"" he added in a tweet. LIVE: General election campaign What are the Brexit Party's 12 key policies? Farage hits out at MEPs over Tory support Nigel Farage's interview fact-checked During the 30-minute interview with Andrew Neil, Mr Farage was asked about his election strategy, Islamophobic remarks made by two of his candidates and whether the NHS should be ""on the table"" in any post-Brexit trade talks with the US. The Brexit Party leader denied being marginalised at the general election. Mr Farage said: ""I don't think if you came with me and visited some of the Labour heartlands in the north you would think that and I also think that what we've done is have a very dramatic effect on this election. ""I think, number one, the decision, difficult decision, I took in 317 seats to stand down. ""What that's done is that's poleaxed the Liberal Democrats. They were going to win in south London down through Surrey, right out to the west of England they were going to win a lot of seats if we'd stood. And I knew that wasn't the right thing to do."" The four former Brexit Party MEPs are urging voters to support the Conservative Party Mr Farage claimed the Brexit Party had prevented a ""surge"" from the pro-EU Lib Dems and had, therefore, blocked a second EU referendum. ""What we are actually doing now is tearing chunks out of the Labour vote,"" he said. He blamed his failure to form a so-called ""Leave alliance"" between his party and the Conservative Party for the election on the Tories. ""The Conservative Party didn't want to do it,"" he said. This video can not be played Nigel Farage says three of the MEPs who have left his Brexit Party have links to the Conservative government On his call for political reform, including scrapping the House of Lords and changing the voting system, he said: ""At this stage we don't look like fundamentally reforming British politics, but do I think there is an appetite for it? Absolutely."" Mr Farage said he believed Boris Johnson would win the election and that was his preference in a choice with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. But he said he was undecided who to vote for in the Conservative-held constituency where he lives. Andrew Neil also challenged Mr Farage on Islamophobic comments made by two of his candidates in in Edinburgh South West and Birmingham Ladywood. ""Any attempt that gets made to try and paint the Brexit Party into being a right-wing political party that would harbour anybody with extreme views is completely and utterly wrong,"" he said. ""We are, in terms of the mix of our candidates, if I look at what we put forward for the European elections, we had more diversity of background, of class, of race, than any other party."" On Brexit, Mr Farage said he wanted to see ""some amendments"" to Mr Johnson's Brexit deal, saying: ""If we don't we are not going to get a clean break from the EU."" And on whether he thinks NHS drug prices would be ""on the table"" in post-Brexit trade deal talks with the US, Mr Farage said the suggestion was ""ludicrous because no British government will sign up to more expensive drugs"". He said he believed that ""wealthier people should be encouraged to take out private insurance to lift the burden off a system that is struggling to cope"". ""When it comes to opening up the NHS for privatisation, do you want the truth? It's already happened."" In a special series of election interviews, Andrew Neil has already questioned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has yet to agree a date to taking part, which has prompted a political row and accusations from Labour that he is ""running scared"".

Labour pledges to cap class sizes at 30 pupils,"This video can not be played Labour promises to recruit 20,000 new teachers Labour is promising to cap class sizes at 30 pupils across all schools in England if it wins next Thursday's general election. The pledge is an extension of the party's commitment in its manifesto to limit classes to this size at all primary schools. The party said it would fulfil the pledge by recruiting nearly 20,000 extra teachers over five years. The Conservatives said English schools were rising up international rankings. The party has pledgedan extra Â£7.1bn by 2022-23 for schools in England. Tories signal tax-cutting Budget if elected Seven charts on the Â£73,000 cost of educating a child A simple guide to the Labour Party See how the parties compare on education Labour's pledge to recruit nearly 20,000 teachers issimilar to a promise made two weeks ago by the Liberal Democrats. Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran accused the party of trying to ""copy"" them, but added that Labour had ""no hope of meeting this target"". She said Labour would not be able to ""square these promises"" with leaving the EU if voters back the party's Brexit deal in its planned referendum, due to ""thousands of EU teachers coming to work in schools each year"". Labour said the recruitment would be funded from an extra Â£25bn in schools spending over the next three years. The party has also committed to ensuring all teachers have formal teaching qualifications within five years. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner told BBC Breakfast a Labour government could not make changes ""overnight"", but they would ""reversing the trend"" of increasing class sizes and lack of spending under the Conservatives. ""The investment would go in immediately, so the money that schools have had cut they would instantly see,"" she said. ""On 13 December, I can't bring in 20,000 teachers, of course not. But what I can do through our National Education Service [is] bring in the training and skills. ""So, things will move. Will it happen immediately over night? Of course not. But immediately from day one of me being education secretary we will put it in place."" There is a teacher shortage in England, with the latest official statistics showing a 15% shortfall in numbers beginning training for secondary schools. But Labour's promise to recruit more may not be easy to deliver. In subjects such as physics, fewer than half the required graduates have begun to train. Schools hire teachers, not the government, and it is harder to attract and keep teachers to work in poorer areas. The party also says it would cap all class sizes at 30. At the moment, just over 12% of secondary pupils are taught in classes with between 31-35 pupils. In 2009, when Labour was last in government, it was just over 10%. While slightly smaller class sizes could appeal to parents, the international evidence suggests it may make less of a difference to results than the quality of teaching. Labour is also promising to train up 24,958 unqualified teachers.  Official statistics suggest 98.7% of the teachers in England have at least a degree-level qualification, so who is the party talking about? Some are trainees working towards becoming a qualified teacher. Some are teachers who qualified overseas. Others are described as instructors who bring a special skill from their previous working life. Some are working in smaller units with excluded children or in schools for children with special needs. But there have always been some teachers in these categories in England's schools. The National Association of Head Teachers said 47,000 secondary teachers and 8,000 primary teachers would be needed by 2024 to keep pace with an expected increase in pupil numbers. Its general secretary Paul Whiteman said: ""We need significantly more recruits than Labour are suggesting just to meet rising demand, never mind reduce current class sizes."" ""The new recruits we need will not magically appear, and nor will they stay if we don't also address the stress and unnecessary workload that is widespread in the system."" Pushed on whether Labour's pledges were enough, Ms Rayner said the party was being ""realistic"". ""We are promising a huge amount more than what the other parties are,"" she told Breakfast. ""Over the last seven years, the government has missed their recruitment and retention target. Under Labour, you would get 20,000 new teachers and 25,000 unqualified teachers getting qualified."" UK improving in international school rankings Who should I vote for? Election 2019 manifesto guide Schools minister Nick Gibb said that in government Labour would ""would wreck the economy, leaving no money for public services"". He added thatfigures this week from the OECD's international school rankingsshowed English schools had risen up the league tables. Mr Gibb added that schools in Wales, where schools are run by the Labour-led devolved government, were the lowest performing within the UK. ""Conservative education reforms are improving standards in our schools, meaning children can get a better start in life,"" he added. Labour is also announcing new plans to tackle homelessness, including Â£100m a year for emergency winter shelters, Â£600m to build new hostels, and Â£200m to refurbish existing ones. Shadow housing secretary John Healey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people living on the streets was not ""inevitable"", but a ""direct result of decisions the government has taken in the past 10 years"". ""Some of these things aren't political,"" he said.  ""It shames us all that we have people dying on our streets because they are homeless and shames Conservative ministers most of all. ""The tragedy is we know what needs to be done as we have done it before... It is a new moral mission for Britain."" A Conservative party spokesman said: ""There is record investment going in to tackling homelessness - Â£1.2bn until April 2020 with a further Â£422m for 2020-21."" The Conservatives, like Labour, have pledged to end rough sleeping within five years if elected to government.

Silva sacked as Everton manager,"This video can not be played Watch: Silva's last interview as Everton manager Everton have sacked manager Marco Silva after 18 months, with the club in the Premier League relegation zone after their Merseyside derby humiliation. Wednesday's5-2 defeat by Liverpool at Anfieldwas their ninth of the season and leaves them 18th in the Premier League after three successive losses. Silva, who took charge in May 2018, won 24 and lost 24 of his 60 games. Shanghai SIPG boss Vitor Pereira is a contender to succeed Silva, while David Moyes' return can not be ruled out. Former striker Duncan Ferguson has been put in temporary charge and will manage the side against Chelsea on Saturday. The club said they aim to appoint a new manager ""as swiftly as possible"". Phil McNulty analysis: 'Everton are turning into a badly scripted soap opera' Football Daily special: No 'Silva-lining' for Everton Everton are now searching for their fourth permanent boss since Roberto Martinez was sacked in May 2016. Former Everton manager Moyes has been considered as a potential interim successor, but the suggestion has sparked a largely negative reaction from supporters and it remains to be seen whether majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri and his boardroom colleagues ignore that and invite the 56-year-old Scot to return. Moyes spent 11 years as Everton manager, and his return has been seen by fans as a retrograde step given his lack of success since leaving for Manchester United in 2013. He was sacked at United and Real Socieded and was in charge of Sunderland when they were relegated from the Premier League before having a short spell at West Ham. It has been suggested that if Moyes does return he could bring another Everton old boy, Tim Cahill, back as his assistant. Portuguese Pereira, 51, won two league titles with Porto, the league and cup double with Olympiakos and the Chinese Super League with Shanghai. Marco Silva has lost more Premier League matches than he has won at Everton Portuguese Silva, 42, is the fifth managerial dismissal in the Premier League this season, after the departures of Javi Gracia - who had replaced Silva at Vicarage Road - and Quique Sanchez Flores from Watford, as well as Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino and Arsenal's Unai Emery. Former Hull City boss Silva succeeded Sam Allardyce at Goodison Park. He was brought in with the hope hewould get Everton to play more attractive football and was backed with almost Â£90m of signings in the summer of 2018. Everton finished eighth in Silva's first campaign but, after spending more than Â£100m on players in the summer, they have won just four league games this season. The Toffees face a tricky run of league fixtures over the next month when they play Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City, and also Leicester in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals. After Martinez was dismissed in 2016, Ronald Koeman led Everton into the Europa League in his first season in charge, but was sacked when the club fell into the relegation zone following a poor start to his second campaign. David Unsworth then lost five of eight games as interim boss, while Allardyce made way following an eighth-place finish after fans frequently expressed their displeasure at the lack of attacking flair under the former England coach. Recent record of Everton managers in the Premier League Manager Games Wins Draws Losses Win percentage David Moyes 427 173 123 131 40.5% Roberto Martinez 113 43 34 36 38.1% Ronald Koeman 47 19 12 16 40.4% Sam Allardyce 24 9 7 8 37.5% Marco Silva 53 19 11 23 35.9% Silva has now had three jobs in English football that have all ultimately ended in failure and been characterised by promising starts followed by steep declines. In his four months in charge of Hull, his side accumulated 17 points from his first 11 games - but only four from the next seven as they were relegated from the Premier League. Two days after leaving the Tigers, Silva joined Watford in May 2017 and took the team into the top four during his first few months in charge. His side took 21 points from 13 games but the Hornets only won once in his next 11 matches, before Silva was sacked in January 2018. Some of this was attributed by the Vicarage Road hierarchy to Everton's approach for Silva the previous November - before hiring Allardyce. Watford fiercely resisted the Toffees' unwanted advances and complained to the Premier League with a demand for compensation. He was eventually appointed Everton boss in May 2018 and won 22 points from his first 13 league games in charge, but has only taken 42 points from the following 38 matches. Before his time in England, Silva guided Estoril into the Portuguese top flight and they qualified for the Europa League the following season. In one season at Sporting Lisbon he won the Portuguese Cup, and in his year at Olympiakos, who he also managed in the Champions League, he took them to the Greek league title. by BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty Everton fans will ask why the club can't go for Mauricio Pochettino, but the honest answer is he just wouldn't be interested. I know Eddie Howe is of interest to the Everton board but getting him mid-season might be difficult.

Silva sacked as Everton managerEverton dismiss manager Marco Silva after 18 months in charge with the club in the relegation zone.,"This video can not be played Watch: Silva's last interview as Everton manager Everton have sacked manager Marco Silva after 18 months, with the club in the Premier League relegation zone after their Merseyside derby humiliation. Wednesday's5-2 defeat by Liverpool at Anfieldwas their ninth of the season and leaves them 18th in the Premier League after three successive losses. Silva, who took charge in May 2018, won 24 and lost 24 of his 60 games. Shanghai SIPG boss Vitor Pereira is a contender to succeed Silva, while David Moyes' return can not be ruled out. Former striker Duncan Ferguson has been put in temporary charge and will manage the side against Chelsea on Saturday. The club said they aim to appoint a new manager ""as swiftly as possible"". Phil McNulty analysis: 'Everton are turning into a badly scripted soap opera' Football Daily special: No 'Silva-lining' for Everton Everton are now searching for their fourth permanent boss since Roberto Martinez was sacked in May 2016. Former Everton manager Moyes has been considered as a potential interim successor, but the suggestion has sparked a largely negative reaction from supporters and it remains to be seen whether majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri and his boardroom colleagues ignore that and invite the 56-year-old Scot to return. Moyes spent 11 years as Everton manager, and his return has been seen by fans as a retrograde step given his lack of success since leaving for Manchester United in 2013. He was sacked at United and Real Socieded and was in charge of Sunderland when they were relegated from the Premier League before having a short spell at West Ham. It has been suggested that if Moyes does return he could bring another Everton old boy, Tim Cahill, back as his assistant. Portuguese Pereira, 51, won two league titles with Porto, the league and cup double with Olympiakos and the Chinese Super League with Shanghai. Marco Silva has lost more Premier League matches than he has won at Everton Portuguese Silva, 42, is the fifth managerial dismissal in the Premier League this season, after the departures of Javi Gracia - who had replaced Silva at Vicarage Road - and Quique Sanchez Flores from Watford, as well as Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino and Arsenal's Unai Emery. Former Hull City boss Silva succeeded Sam Allardyce at Goodison Park. He was brought in with the hope hewould get Everton to play more attractive football and was backed with almost Â£90m of signings in the summer of 2018. Everton finished eighth in Silva's first campaign but, after spending more than Â£100m on players in the summer, they have won just four league games this season. The Toffees face a tricky run of league fixtures over the next month when they play Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City, and also Leicester in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals. After Martinez was dismissed in 2016, Ronald Koeman led Everton into the Europa League in his first season in charge, but was sacked when the club fell into the relegation zone following a poor start to his second campaign. David Unsworth then lost five of eight games as interim boss, while Allardyce made way following an eighth-place finish after fans frequently expressed their displeasure at the lack of attacking flair under the former England coach. Recent record of Everton managers in the Premier League Manager Games Wins Draws Losses Win percentage David Moyes 427 173 123 131 40.5% Roberto Martinez 113 43 34 36 38.1% Ronald Koeman 47 19 12 16 40.4% Sam Allardyce 24 9 7 8 37.5% Marco Silva 53 19 11 23 35.9% Silva has now had three jobs in English football that have all ultimately ended in failure and been characterised by promising starts followed by steep declines. In his four months in charge of Hull, his side accumulated 17 points from his first 11 games - but only four from the next seven as they were relegated from the Premier League. Two days after leaving the Tigers, Silva joined Watford in May 2017 and took the team into the top four during his first few months in charge. His side took 21 points from 13 games but the Hornets only won once in his next 11 matches, before Silva was sacked in January 2018. Some of this was attributed by the Vicarage Road hierarchy to Everton's approach for Silva the previous November - before hiring Allardyce. Watford fiercely resisted the Toffees' unwanted advances and complained to the Premier League with a demand for compensation. He was eventually appointed Everton boss in May 2018 and won 22 points from his first 13 league games in charge, but has only taken 42 points from the following 38 matches. Before his time in England, Silva guided Estoril into the Portuguese top flight and they qualified for the Europa League the following season. In one season at Sporting Lisbon he won the Portuguese Cup, and in his year at Olympiakos, who he also managed in the Champions League, he took them to the Greek league title. by BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty Everton fans will ask why the club can't go for Mauricio Pochettino, but the honest answer is he just wouldn't be interested. I know Eddie Howe is of interest to the Everton board but getting him mid-season might be difficult. I don't know how David Moyes going back would work, because he was in control of everything when he was there last time. That wouldn't be the case now with director of football Marcel Brands.

Parties' spending plans 'not credible',"This video can not be played Parties react to IFS analysis of manifesto spending plans Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are offering ""credible"" spending plans ahead of the general election, an influential research group has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said it was ""highly likely"" the Tories would end up spending more than their manifesto pledges. Labour, it warned, would be unable to deliver its spending increases as it has promised. Neither party was being ""honest"" with voters, IFS director Paul Johnson said. The Liberal Democrats' manifesto, he said, would involve lower levels of borrowing than under Labour or the Conservatives, but would still be seen as ""radical"" in ""most periods"". However, he added that, given the uncertainty around Brexit, it was difficult to determine what the exact effects of the three parties' offers would be. Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems have all published their manifestos, including spending and taxation plans, ahead of the 12 December general election. More on the IFS report: Our Reality Check team analyse spending pledges Labour is promising to renationalise rail, mail, water and energy, as well as give a 5% pay increase to public sector workers in its first year in government, if elected. The Lib Dems say stopping Brexit would deliver an extra Â£10bn a year for public services - they also want to increase all income tax rates by 1% to fund more NHS spending. The Conservatives have pledged to postpone a scheduled corporation tax cut - from 19% to 17% - to increase spending on public services. This video can not be played IFS: 'The choice could not be clearer' for voters Paul Johnson said that, under Tory plans, spending on public services apart from healthcare would still be 14% lower by 2023/24 than it was in 2010/11. Despite this, he said the Conservatives were continuing to ""pretend that tax rises will never be needed to secure decent public services"" - and said a pledge from the party not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT over the next five years was ""ill-advised"". ""It is highly likely that the Conservatives would end up spending more than their manifesto implies, and thus taxing or borrowing more,"" he added. Mr Johnson also said it was ""highly likely"" Labour would need to raise taxes beyond what it is promising to pay for its proposed Â£80bn a year in extra spending. He said it was ""clearly not the case"" the party's plans would see taxes rise for only the richest 5% of taxpayers. The IFS said Labour plans to scrap a tax break for married couples and change taxes on company dividends would affect people outside this earnings bracket. It also argued the party's planned rise in corporation tax would be passed on to workers in the form of lower wages, and to consumers in the form of higher prices. ""In reality, a change in the scale and the scope of the state that they propose would require more broad-based tax increases at some point,"" Mr Johnson added. It's a plague on all your houses - but for very different reasons. The main criticism of Labour is that its spending on investment is just so big, it wouldn't be able to deliver it. The IFS also says it is highly likely the party's tax rises would impact, directly or indirectly, on more than just the top 5% of earners. There's no respite for the Conservatives though - particularly on their pledge not to extend the transition period included in the PM's Brexit deal beyond 2020, even if a trade deal has not been agreed. The idea that the UK might have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms is seen by these economists as something which would be highly damaging to the economy. It says this could cause an increase in the deficit of the same order, potentially even higher, than would be caused by Labour's tax and spending plans. Paul Johnson also said a Labour manifesto pledge to abolish poverty for people in work over the next five years was ""not achievable"", and a plan to scrap theuniversal creditbenefits payment scheme would be ""expensive, disruptive and unnecessary"". He criticised the party's promise to pay compensation tomore than three million womenaffected by an accelerated rise in the state pension age. Mr Johnson said there may be scope for ""much more limited compensation"", but the group was ""relatively well off on average"". He also criticised the Tories for failing to ""come up with any kind of plan or any kind of money for social care"". Conservative manifesto - our analysis of key policies Labour manifesto -  our analysis of key policies Lib Dem manifesto -  our analysis of key policies Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party's manifesto was ""bold"", ""ambitious"", ""prepared for"" and had been fully costed. He said he was ""very confident"" it would improve the ""lifestyle and life chances"" of the poorest people in the UK. Conservative leader Boris Johnson said his party's manifesto had made ""very substantial commitments,"" but also insisted it was ""fully costed"". He added that Labour's spending plans followed an ""out-and-out socialist approach"" that would ""push up taxes massively"". Lib Dem deputy leader Sir Ed Davey said the IFS assessment ""shows that neither the Tories or Labour have a credible plan for the economy"". ""Both are failing to come clean with the electorate and ignoring the Brexit black hole their plans would leave in the public finances,"" he added.

"France crippled by biggest strike in yearsSome 800,000 people walked out nationwide over proposed pension reform.Europe","This video can not be played Some of the protests turned violent France's largest nationwide strike in years has severely disrupted schools and transport. Workers are angry about planned pension reforms that would see them retiring later or facing reduced payouts. More than 800,000 workers from a wide range of professions demonstrated against the changes. Some cities saw clashes between protesters and police. President Emmanuel Macron wants to introduce a universal points-based pension system. That would replace France's current system, which has 42 different pension schemes across its private and public sectors, with variations in retirement age and benefits. Why are French workers on a nationwide strike? In pictures: The pension protests rocking France How could French strikes affect UK travellers? ""What we've got to do is shut the economy down,"" said union official Christian Grolier of the Force OuvriÃ¨re (Workers' Force). ""People are spoiling for a fight."" There have been clashes between police and protesters in Nantes Since coming to power, Mr Macron has pushed through other reforms including relaxing labour laws and cutting taxes for businesses. More than 800,000 people had joined demonstrations in more than 100 cities across France, the interior ministry said. The CGT union said 1.5m people had turned out, including 250,000 in Paris. The CGT also said workers had blocked seven of the country's eight oil refineries, potentially causing fuel shortages if the strike continues. In Paris, popular tourist sites including the Eiffel Tower, the MusÃ©e d'Orsay and the Palace of Versailles were shut for the day. Allow Twitter content?

The group said this was because e-scooters - despite being widely viewed as an ecologically-friendly form of transport - actually required large quantities of energy and resources during their manufacture and had short life cycles. Teachers and transport workers were joined by police, lawyers, hospital and airport staff, and other professions for the general walkout. Train driver Cyril Romero from Toulouse told France Info he would reconsider his job if the reforms went through. ""I started in 2001 with a contract that allowed me to leave at 50. But like everyone else, I got the reforms which pushed back my early retirement age to 52-and-a-half and then, in reality, 57-and-a-half for full pension. Now they want to make us work even longer."" Demonstrations are taking place across France An unnamed history teacher, writing in HuffPost, was planning to strike on Friday as well as Thursday. ""For me, the pension reforms are one punch too many. We're fighting not to lose hundreds of euros of pension a month - after more than 40 years in a job. ""How can you even think of ending your career in front of pupils beyond the age of 70, in worsening conditions and on what for many of us is just a minimum wage?"" Some trade union leaders have vowed to strike until Mr Macron abandons his campaign promise to overhaul the retirement system. One opinion poll put public support for the strikes at 69%, with backing strongest among 18- to 34 year olds. However farmers, whose pensions are among the lowest in the country, are not taking part. Demonstrators blocked buses in Marseille The Macron administration will hope to avoid a repeat of the country's general strike over pension reforms in 1995, which crippled the transport system for three weeks and drew massive popular support, forcing a government climbdown. A number of ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protesters had said they planned to join the demonstrations. Anger of yellow vests grips France a year on Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? The movement, which emerged at the end of 2018, started with demonstrations against a sharp increase in diesel taxes, but has broadened to reflect anger over higher living costs and President Macron's economic policies. Mr Macron's unified system - which he says would be fairer - would reward employees for each day worked, awarding points that would later be transferred into future pension benefits. The official retirement age has been raised in the last decade from 60 to 62, but remains one of the lowest among the OECD group of rich nations - in the UK, for example, the retirement age for state pensions is 66 and is due to rise to at least 67. The move would remove the most advantageous pensions for a number of jobs ranging from sailors to lawyers and even opera workers. Meanwhile, those retiring before 64 would receive a lower pension. For example, someone retiring at 63 would receive 5% less, so unions fear it will mean having to work longer for a lower pension. A recent poll concluded that 75% of people thought that pension reforms were necessary, but only a third believed the government could deliver them. How could French strikes affect UK travellers?

YouTube reveals 2019's most-watched music videos,"Daddy Yankee, Stormzy and Billie Eilish racked up millions of views for their music videos in 2019 Stormzy's infectious single Vossi Bop was the most-watched music video of 2019 in the UK, YouTube has revealed. Based around aviral dance craze,external, the video sees the star rapping on Westminster Bridge and features a cameo from Idris Elba. Sam Smith and Normani's Dancing With A Stranger was the second-biggest video. Billie Eilish's Bad Guy came third. Outside the UK, Latin music dominated, accounting for all of YouTube's top five music videos. Top of the list is Daddy Yankee's Con Calma - which interpolates Snow's 1990s rap classic Informer; while electro-flamenco singer RosalÃ­a takes second place with the earworm groove of Con Altura.

It's the third year in a row that a Latin song has topped YouTube's global chart. In 2018, the honour went to Nio GarcÃ­a's Te BotÃ©; while in 2017, it was Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's Despacito (which is the most-viewed video in the site's history, with 6.5bn views). The figures reflect Latin America's increasing importance to the music industry: It's the world's fastest-growing music market - revenues increased by 16.8% last year, with Brazil the largest contributor. YouTube users can't stop streaming Latin Pop Spotify reveals decade's most-streamed songs ""Without any doubt, there was always huge music consumption in Brazil - it's a country that truly has music at its heart - but, due to copyright infringement, this was never recognised,"" said Afo Verde, chairman of Sony Music Latin Iberia, earlier this year. ""When consumption began to take the form of streaming, the results were impressive."" ""I think it has been a sleeping giant for years and years, and the reality is that it's a country with more than 200 million people.

However, the spectre of piracy still looms over the market. It's notable that Latin artists thrive on YouTube, an advertising-supported platform, but have a lesser impact on services like Spotify and Apple, which generate larger revenues through monthly subscriptions. There have also been accusations that record labels in South America are""buying"" views on YouTube,externalto boost their artists' profiles. Both Spotify and Apple Music released their own most-streamed charts this week, and artists like Daddy Yankee were conspicuously absent; with Western stars like Camila Cabello, Lil Nas X and Post Malone populating the countdown. You can compare the various charts below: Apple also released data about the year's most searched-for songs on the music discovery app Shazam - with Lewis Capaldi's Someone You Loved coming out on top. Meanwhile, Joel Corry's sad-banger Sorry broke the record for the most Shazams in a single day. A total of 41,000 people looked the song up after it featured in an episode of ITV 2's Love Island on 24 July. ""My phone went into meltdown when it happened,"" the producer said at the time.

Thomas Cook customers face refund delays,"Customers of defunct tour operator Thomas Cook have reacted angrily after learning they will face delays in getting refunds for Atol-protected package holidays. The Civil Aviation Authority originally said all valid claims made on the first day of its refund programme would be paid within 60 days, or by this Friday. But now it says only two-thirds will be paid on time. It said it had asked the remaining claimants for more information. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

CAA boss Richard Moriarty acknowledged many would be worried about not getting their money back before Christmas. ""We thank consumers for their ongoing patience as we continue to do all that we can to work through the UK travel industry's largest ever refunds programme,"" he said. Thomas Cook collapse: Your rights explained Fraudsters 'target Thomas Cook refund site' ""I appreciate that this is a concerning time for Thomas Cook customers who are waiting for their refunds, particularly at this time of the year."" When Thomas Cook ceased trading on 23 September, anyone who had paid for a future Thomas Cook package holiday protected under the CAA's Atol scheme was entitled to a full refund. From 7 October an online refund application system opened, and customers were told the Civil Aviation Authority aimed to pay out within 60 days. The CAA said it had received 67,000 claims on the first day, and two thirds would be paid by this weekend, bringing the total amount of compensation paid to date to Â£160m. The Thomas Cook collapse triggered the biggest ever peacetime repatriation Sue Moore applied for a refund for her Thomas Cook holiday on the day the CAA launched its online form. She told the BBC: ""We submitted our claim online and gave the information that they asked for, which was only the information on our Atol form. They did not ask for full booking information or evidence of payment. ""We have waited nearly 60 days only to be told that this additional information was now required, and that we would have to wait a further 60 days before we would receive our refund. ""We are very disappointed and feel that the agency working for the CAA should have thought  through what information would be required in the first instance before people submitted their claims. I wonder if this was a deliberate delaying tactic to delay the payment of refunds?"" But it said the refunds operation had been challenging due to the potential for fraudulent claims, and some 85,000 claims it had received so far were invalid or duplicates. It said it had ""paused"" the 60-day claims period for certain customers, and urged anyone who had been asked for further information to respond at ""the earliest opportunity"". The regulator stressed that all valid Atol-protected payments would be refunded, without giving a specific timeframe. But some who spoke to the BBC said they had been told they would have to wait a further 60 days. Thomas Cook collapsed in September after last-minute negotiations aimed at saving the 178-year-old holiday firm failed. It triggered the biggest ever peacetime repatriation, aimed at bringing more than 150,000 British holidaymakers home. It also put 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, although some of those roles have been saved. The refunds process has been rocky, with the CAA's online form crashing due to high demand on the day it launched. The website was alsotargeted by scammers,while many customers have said the long wait for refunds has stopped them rebooking holidays. The CAA said it had received 260,000 valid claims to date. But around 40,000 of the cancelled holidays eligible for a refund have still not been claimed for. Customers have until September next year to submit the online form. One of the reassuring things about booking a holiday with a tour operator is that the trip is Atol protected - you know you'll get your money back if anything goes wrong with the company. So the 300,000 customers who had booked package deals with Thomas Cook were at least comforted that they'd get their money back. However, the process has not been an easy one. It's been a difficult job to weed out any hoaxes, and verify passengers across different Thomas Cook booking systems. But the CAA set themselves a tight deadline, to make sure people weren't out of pocket for long. But now it's more disappointment for 22,000 of those early bird customers who applied immediately for a refund and still haven't received a penny back. For many it'll mean things are extra-tight this Christmas, or a longer wait before they can afford to book a new holiday. Those customers are being advised to provide any extra information asked for, and be patient.

Joshua responds to Saudi 'sportwashing' claims,"This video can not be played 'I just want to do a job' - Joshua on fighting in Saudi Arabia Andy Ruiz v Anthony Joshua Venue:Diriyah Arena, Saudi ArabiaDate:Saturday, 7 December Coverage:Live BBC Radio 5 Live commentary with live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app 'One Night: Joshua vs Ruiz' - watch documentary which relives one of boxing's greatest upsets on iPlayerhere Anthony Joshua says he would ""definitely be bothered"" if his world title fight with Andy Ruiz Jr was being used to 'sportswash' human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. The Briton bids to reclaim three of the heavyweight world titles from Ruiz on Saturday and has faced criticism for the fight being staged in Diriyah. Campaigners have urged him to ""speak out"" about issues in the country. ""In the future maybe I can bear a different kind of flag,"" Joshua said. ""But at the minute it's a world championship flag. I just want to do a job."" What Andy Ruiz Jr did next Joshua: 'I'm punching like a horse kicking backwards' Podcast: Joshua's 'stunning revelation' Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn has openly stated that a huge financial commitment by Saudi's General Sports Authority (GSA) left little option but to stage the bout in the kingdom. Joshua, who holds ambassador posts with several high-profile brands and who works closely with a number of charities, told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that fighting in Saudi did not ""necessarily"" detract from his image as a role model. Asked how he would feel if the event was part of a move to 'sportswash' over wrongdoing, he said: ""If that was the case I would definitely have to say I would be bothered - but my only focus is the boxing. ""I feel like taking boxing globally is what a world champion should be doing. You fight around the world."" Joshua was also asked if his status as a role model may be undermined by fighting in the country. ""Not necessarily,"" he said. ""I just came here for the boxing opportunity. I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I've not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time. ""As an individual I try to bring positivity and light everywhere I go. I'm just seeing it from my eyes alone but for sure the country in itself is trying to do a good job politically. ""For the sporting side of things, I just feel I've got a fight to focus on."" This video can not be played 'There are so many hypocrites' - Eddie Hearn The move to stage high-level sport in Saudi Arabia forms part of a wider strategy - known as Vision 2030 - that seeks to improve how the country is viewed and progressively move it away from its oil-dependent economy. Formula E, golf's European Tour and World Wrestling Entertainment have moved to hold events in the country, while a number of pop stars have staged concerts. Campaigners say sport is being used as a soft power by the Saudi government to hide long-standing issues including women's rights abuses, the treatment of the LGBT community and the restriction of free speech. Promoter Hearn insists Saudi involvement is ""here to stay in boxing"" but he has repeatedly referenced the fact other sporting institutions have worked in the country, while well-known brands found on UK high streets are also open to business in the capital city Riyadh. Asked by BBC Sport whether money was influential in Joshua's decision, Hearn replied: ""Of course. ""There are so many hypocrites. You're here covering the event, why? Because you want as many eyeballs on the BBC website or news piece as possible. ""No individual, journalist or media outlet can possibly tell a fighter where they can or can't go to earn money in a sport like this. ""We can't be seen to be endorsing anything other than our job to provide life-changing opportunities for our clients who take part in one of the most barbaric and dangerous sport that exists. ""If we don't get on board then someone else will anyway."" Saudi royal wants Ruiz-Joshua ring as souvenir Watch: Relive Ruiz's sensational upset of Joshua in June Long read: Inside the 24 hours that shook boxing This video can not be played 'A colossal upset' - Relive Anthony Joshua's shock defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr in June Joshua has freely fielded questions on the politics around what is a critical fight in his career following his shock loss to Ruiz in New York in June. He explains his first professional loss has left ""scar tissue"" but says it taught him to ""never lose grip of your goals"". Asked whether victory at Diriyah Arena on Saturday would therefore top his list of achievements he replied: ""Yes, this would be number one. There are now doubters. ""I feel like I belong here so it's not like it's something I am chasing. It's just a quest for greatness in myself. ""How much do I want it? A whole heap. But not to prove anything to anyone, just to prove it to myself. When I win, I am not going to be too surprised as I believe this is my destiny and I belong in this position.""

UK household debts see big increase,"Debts excluding mortgages are on the rise in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. Debts including credit card debt and personal loans rose 11% to Â£119bn in the two years to March 2018, according tothe ONS study,external, which is published every two years. Average household financial debt rose 9% to Â£9,400. Much of the increase is a result of higher student loan and hire purchase debt. ""The figures are skewed slightly by the Â£32bn of student debts - which the vast majority of graduates will never pay back in full,"" said Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown. ""However, even excluding that we're carrying Â£87bn in loans, credit cards, hire purchase agreements, overdrafts and arrears."" Median financial debt - taking the middle household as the norm, rather than dividing total debt by the  number of households - grew 12% to Â£4,500. This figure excludes households with no debt and suggests these debts are not evenly spread. The poorest 10% of households have debts three times bigger than the value of assets they own, while the top 10% have total wealth - property, pensions and other assets- worth 35 times larger than their debt. What do you think about this story? Join ourBBC News Affordable Living Facebook group here,external. ""Not all these debts are the same: there's a world of difference between taking an affordable, low-cost loan for vital home improvements, and living on your overdraft month after month, because it's proving so difficult to make your salary stretch to the end of the month,"" said Ms Coles. ""But if you're one of the 44% of people who see their borrowing as a burden, it's worth taking steps to deal with your debts.""

"Andrew Neil issues interview challenge to JohnsonBBC presenter tells Boris Johnson it is ""not too late"" for the PM to face questions from him.Election 2019","This video can not be played What Andrew Neil wants to ask Boris Johnson The BBC's Andrew Neil has issued a challenge to Boris Johnson to take part in a sit-down interview with him before next week's general election. Mr Johnson is the only leader of a main party not to have faced a half-hour, prime-time BBC One grilling by Mr Neil. The Conservative leader has denied claims he is avoiding scrutiny. But Mr Neil addressed the PM directly at the end of his fourth leader interview at this election, with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. ""It is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say,"" he said, in a monologue. ""The theme running through our questions is trust - and why at so many times in his career, in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those close to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy. ""It is, of course, relevant to what he is promising us all now."" In full: Neil's interview challenge to Johnson Mr Johnson has also declined an invitation to be grilled by ITV's Julie Etchingham, as part of her series of leader interviews. Mr Neil said that no broadcaster ""can compel a politician to be interviewed"". But he added: ""Leaders' interviews have been a key part of the BBC's prime-time election coverage for decades. ""We do them, on your behalf, to scrutinise and hold to account those who would govern us. That is democracy. ""We have always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate. And in every election they have. All of them. Until this one."" Mr Neil then listed the questions he wanted the prime minister to answer. These include whether he can be trusted to deliver on his promises for the NHS - and keeping the health service ""off the table"" in any post-Brexit trade talks with the US. Mr Neil said he would also ask the PM about his claim that he has always been an opponent of austerity, another ""question of trust"". He ended the monologue by saying: ""The prime minister of our nation will, at times, have to stand up to President Trump, President Putin, President Xi of China.

Separately, on Thursday evening, The Labour Party complained about BBC bias, in a letter to Director General Tony Hall.

He said Labour had agreed Mr Corbyn's interview with Mr Neil based on the ""clear understanding"" that Mr Johnson had agreed the same terms. ""Instead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability."" The BBC is expected to respond in writing to the Labour complaint.

Police watchdog chief quits over 'flawed' system,"Susan Deacon was a Labour MSP for two terms, and served as health minister Susan Deacon has resigned as chairwoman of Scotland's police watchdog, saying the system is ""fundamentally flawed"". The former Labour MSP was appointed to the Scottish Police Authority in 2017. But in her resignation letter, she said there was ""little more"" she could do to make the governance and accountability of policing work effectively. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon rejected opposition claims the police service was ""in crisis"" and said the SPA would continue to make improvements. Prof Deacon was the third person to chair the SPA since it began work in April 2013 alongside the launch of Scotland's single police service. When she was appointed in 2017, then justice secretary Michael Matheson said she would ""bring a fresh perspective to the governance of Scottish policing"". Prof Deacon said she had worked ""tirelessly"" to ensure the SPA operated effectively, and that public confidence and trust in policing was maintained. ""In truth, however, I have increasingly become convinced that the governance and accountability arrangements for policing in Scotland are fundamentally flawed, in structure, culture and practice, and I conclude that there is little more I can do to make these arrangements work effectively,"" she said. ""I would suggest that the Scottish government thinks afresh about how the police service is scrutinised and held to account and how, or if, a better separation between politics and policing, and indeed between the police service and those who oversee it, can be achieved."" It has not been an easy two years for Susan Deacon as chairwoman of the Scottish Police Authority. She was appointed in December 2017 following turmoil in the authority, which was seen as lacking transparency in its dealings, and was rocked by accusations of bullying surrounding previous chairman Andrew Flanagan. The police service was also in turmoil, with aseries of allegations of gross misconductbeing investigated against the chief constable, Phil Gormley, who resigned in early 2018. The SPA's turbulent beginnings Police complaints system 'should be speeded up' 'Unacceptable' failings at police body Prof Deacon has been credited with making the actions of the authority, whose role is to hold Police Scotland to account, more transparent. But it is her criticism of the way the national force is scrutinised and held to account which will cause concern, particularly her view that current governance and accountability arrangements are fundamentally flawed. It was a view shared by HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland, Gill Imrie, who told Holyrood's justice committee on Tuesday that senior officers at Police Scotland had become ""frustrated"" by the lack of scrutiny. In anearlier report,external, she said there was ""no clear vision, strategy or plan in place"" for the SPA. Policing inevitably is a highly political matter, but Prof Deacon said the government must review the separation between politics and policing, and said she felt there was little more she could do in the role. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon responded to questions about the Scottish Police Authority Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said there had been ""significant improvement across many facets of the police service in Scotland"" during Prof Deacon's time at the SPA. ""As Ms Deacon herself acknowledges, our police service is in a much stronger place now than prior to her appointment,"" he said. At First Minister's Questions, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the police was ""in crisis once again"" and claimed there was a ""toxic mix of chaos and complacency"". Ms Sturgeon replied: ""The police is not in crisis and I think it does a disservice to police officers around our country who are working so hard to keep us safe to say so."" She said the SPA would continue with the improvements which were being made to governance and accountability. Audit Scotland has criticised the SPA for poor governance and a lack of transparency Scottish Labour said the resignation ""raises serious questions"" about the SPA's ability to oversee Police Scotland, while the Scottish Conservatives described the SPA as ""an organisation in crisis"". The SPA's vice chairman, David Crichton, will lead the SPA until a new appointment is made. He said: ""We believe that the system of governance and accountability for policing in Scotland that was envisaged by the founding legislation is a sound one and can work effectively,"" he added. ""While we respect this personal decision of the chair, our collective focus will be on working together with our dedicated staff team to build on recent progress, deliver the actions and improvements already identified, and redouble the SPA's focus on the issues of greatest importance to policing and the public."" However, the Scottish Police Federation said the resignation was not a surprise. Its chairwoman, Andrea MacDonald, said: ""It has been apparent to the Scottish Police Federation that the authority has not been operating effectively for some time. ""It is nonetheless disappointing that we now see the Scottish Police Authority looking for its fourth chair in six years."" Ms Deacon's predecessorAndrew Flanagan resigned in June 2017 after heavy criticismfrom two Holyrood committees over governance and transparency at the SPA. He said he was quitting to avoid being a ""distraction"" to the new 10-year policing strategy, and that the ""personalised"" debate had ""impacted on me and my family"". The SPA's first chairman, Vic Emery, stepped down in September 2015 after deciding not to seek an extension to his contract. He had been involved in a number of public spats with the first chief constable of the new police service, Sir Stephen House.

Joshua responds to Saudi 'sportwashing' claimsAnthony Joshua fields questions about Saudi 'sportwashing' human rights abuse claims with his fight.BBC Sport,"This video can not be played 'I just want to do a job' - Joshua on fighting in Saudi Arabia Andy Ruiz v Anthony Joshua Venue:Diriyah Arena, Saudi ArabiaDate:Saturday, 7 December Coverage:Live BBC Radio 5 Live commentary with live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app 'One Night: Joshua vs Ruiz' - watch documentary which relives one of boxing's greatest upsets on iPlayerhere Anthony Joshua says he would ""definitely be bothered"" if his world title fight with Andy Ruiz Jr was being used to 'sportswash' human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. The Briton bids to reclaim three of the heavyweight world titles from Ruiz on Saturday and has faced criticism for the fight being staged in Diriyah. Campaigners have urged him to ""speak out"" about issues in the country. ""In the future maybe I can bear a different kind of flag,"" Joshua said. ""But at the minute it's a world championship flag. I just want to do a job."" What Andy Ruiz Jr did next Joshua: 'I'm punching like a horse kicking backwards' Podcast: Joshua's 'stunning revelation' Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn has openly stated that a huge financial commitment by Saudi's General Sports Authority (GSA) left little option but to stage the bout in the kingdom. Joshua, who holds ambassador posts with several high-profile brands and who works closely with a number of charities, told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that fighting in Saudi did not ""necessarily"" detract from his image as a role model. Asked how he would feel if the event was part of a move to 'sportswash' over wrongdoing, he said: ""If that was the case I would definitely have to say I would be bothered - but my only focus is the boxing. ""I feel like taking boxing globally is what a world champion should be doing. You fight around the world."" Joshua was also asked if his status as a role model may be undermined by fighting in the country. ""Not necessarily,"" he said. ""I just came here for the boxing opportunity. I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I've not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time. ""As an individual I try to bring positivity and light everywhere I go. I'm just seeing it from my eyes alone but for sure the country in itself is trying to do a good job politically. ""For the sporting side of things, I just feel I've got a fight to focus on."" This video can not be played 'There are so many hypocrites' - Eddie Hearn The move to stage high-level sport in Saudi Arabia forms part of a wider strategy - known as Vision 2030 - that seeks to improve how the country is viewed and progressively move it away from its oil-dependent economy. Formula E, golf's European Tour and World Wrestling Entertainment have moved to hold events in the country, while a number of pop stars have staged concerts. Campaigners say sport is being used as a soft power by the Saudi government to hide long-standing issues including women's rights abuses, the treatment of the LGBT community and the restriction of free speech. Promoter Hearn insists Saudi involvement is ""here to stay in boxing"" but he has repeatedly referenced the fact other sporting institutions have worked in the country, while well-known brands found on UK high streets are also open to business in the capital city Riyadh. Asked by BBC Sport whether money was influential in Joshua's decision, Hearn replied: ""Of course. ""There are so many hypocrites. You're here covering the event, why? Because you want as many eyeballs on the BBC website or news piece as possible. ""No individual, journalist or media outlet can possibly tell a fighter where they can or can't go to earn money in a sport like this. ""We can't be seen to be endorsing anything other than our job to provide life-changing opportunities for our clients who take part in one of the most barbaric and dangerous sport that exists. ""If we don't get on board then someone else will anyway."" Saudi royal wants Ruiz-Joshua ring as souvenir Watch: Relive Ruiz's sensational upset of Joshua in June Long read: Inside the 24 hours that shook boxing This video can not be played 'A colossal upset' - Relive Anthony Joshua's shock defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr in June Joshua has freely fielded questions on the politics around what is a critical fight in his career following his shock loss to Ruiz in New York in June. He explains his first professional loss has left ""scar tissue"" but says it taught him to ""never lose grip of your goals"". Asked whether victory at Diriyah Arena on Saturday would therefore top his list of achievements he replied: ""Yes, this would be number one. There are now doubters. ""I feel like I belong here so it's not like it's something I am chasing. It's just a quest for greatness in myself. ""How much do I want it? A whole heap. But not to prove anything to anyone, just to prove it to myself. When I win, I am not going to be too surprised as I believe this is my destiny and I belong in this position.""

Thomas Cook customers face further refund delaysA third of the first Thomas Cook customers to claim refunds will not be paid within the 60-day target.,"Customers of defunct tour operator Thomas Cook have reacted angrily after learning they will face delays in getting refunds for Atol-protected package holidays. The Civil Aviation Authority originally said all valid claims made on the first day of its refund programme would be paid within 60 days, or by this Friday. But now it says only two-thirds will be paid on time. It said it had asked the remaining claimants for more information. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Customers have reacted angrily on Twitter, with some arguing they should have been made aware from the start that the process could take longer than 60 days. Others say they have struggled to reach the CAA by phone to get information. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

CAA boss Richard Moriarty acknowledged many would be worried about not getting their money back before Christmas. ""We thank consumers for their ongoing patience as we continue to do all that we can to work through the UK travel industry's largest ever refunds programme,"" he said. Thomas Cook collapse: Your rights explained Fraudsters 'target Thomas Cook refund site' ""I appreciate that this is a concerning time for Thomas Cook customers who are waiting for their refunds, particularly at this time of the year."" When Thomas Cook ceased trading on 23 September, anyone who had paid for a future Thomas Cook package holiday protected under the CAA's Atol scheme was entitled to a full refund. From 7 October an online refund application system opened, and customers were told the Civil Aviation Authority aimed to pay out within 60 days. The CAA said it had received 67,000 claims on the first day, and two thirds would be paid by this weekend, bringing the total amount of compensation paid to date to Â£160m. The Thomas Cook collapse triggered the biggest ever peacetime repatriation Sue Moore applied for a refund for her Thomas Cook holiday on the day the CAA launched its online form. She told the BBC: ""We submitted our claim online and gave the information that they asked for, which was only the information on our Atol form. They did not ask for full booking information or evidence of payment. ""We have waited nearly 60 days only to be told that this additional information was now required, and that we would have to wait a further 60 days before we would receive our refund. ""We are very disappointed and feel that the agency working for the CAA should have thought  through what information would be required in the first instance before people submitted their claims. I wonder if this was a deliberate delaying tactic to delay the payment of refunds?"" But it said the refunds operation had been challenging due to the potential for fraudulent claims, and some 85,000 claims it had received so far were invalid or duplicates. It said it had ""paused"" the 60-day claims period for certain customers, and urged anyone who had been asked for further information to respond at ""the earliest opportunity"". The regulator stressed that all valid Atol-protected payments would be refunded, without giving a specific timeframe. But some who spoke to the BBC said they had been told they would have to wait a further 60 days. Thomas Cook collapsed in September after last-minute negotiations aimed at saving the 178-year-old holiday firm failed. It triggered the biggest ever peacetime repatriation, aimed at bringing more than 150,000 British holidaymakers home. It also put 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, although some of those roles have been saved. The refunds process has been rocky, with the CAA's online form crashing due to high demand on the day it launched. The website was alsotargeted by scammers,while many customers have said the long wait for refunds has stopped them rebooking holidays. The CAA said it had received 260,000 valid claims to date. But around 40,000 of the cancelled holidays eligible for a refund have still not been claimed for. Customers have until September next year to submit the online form. One of the reassuring things about booking a holiday with a tour operator is that the trip is Atol protected - you know you'll get your money back if anything goes wrong with the company. So the 300,000 customers who had booked package deals with Thomas Cook were at least comforted that they'd get their money back. However, the process has not been an easy one. It's been a difficult job to weed out any hoaxes, and verify passengers across different Thomas Cook booking systems. But the CAA set themselves a tight deadline, to make sure people weren't out of pocket for long. But now it's more disappointment for 22,000 of those early bird customers who applied immediately for a refund and still haven't received a penny back. For many it'll mean things are extra-tight this Christmas, or a longer wait before they can afford to book a new holiday. Those customers are being advised to provide any extra information asked for, and be patient.

"Andrew Neil issues interview challenge to JohnsonBBC presenter tells Boris Johnson it is ""not too late"" for the PM to face questions from him.Election 2019Unions reject fresh pay offer to health workersThe Department of Health makes a new pay offer, but the unions said it fell short of what they had wanted.Northern Ireland","This video can not be played What Andrew Neil wants to ask Boris Johnson The BBC's Andrew Neil has issued a challenge to Boris Johnson to take part in a sit-down interview with him before next week's general election. Mr Johnson is the only leader of a main party not to have faced a half-hour, prime-time BBC One grilling by Mr Neil. The Conservative leader has denied claims he is avoiding scrutiny. But Mr Neil addressed the PM directly at the end of his fourth leader interview at this election, with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. ""It is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say,"" he said, in a monologue. ""The theme running through our questions is trust - and why at so many times in his career, in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those close to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy. ""It is, of course, relevant to what he is promising us all now."" In full: Neil's interview challenge to Johnson Mr Johnson has also declined an invitation to be grilled by ITV's Julie Etchingham, as part of her series of leader interviews. Mr Neil said that no broadcaster ""can compel a politician to be interviewed"". But he added: ""Leaders' interviews have been a key part of the BBC's prime-time election coverage for decades. ""We do them, on your behalf, to scrutinise and hold to account those who would govern us. That is democracy. ""We have always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate. And in every election they have. All of them. Until this one."" Mr Neil then listed the questions he wanted the prime minister to answer. These include whether he can be trusted to deliver on his promises for the NHS - and keeping the health service ""off the table"" in any post-Brexit trade talks with the US. Mr Neil said he would also ask the PM about his claim that he has always been an opponent of austerity, another ""question of trust"". He ended the monologue by saying: ""The prime minister of our nation will, at times, have to stand up to President Trump, President Putin, President Xi of China. ""So it was surely not expecting too much that he spend half an hour standing up to me.""

"Unions reject fresh pay offer to health workersThe Department of Health makes a new pay offer, but the unions said it fell short of what they had wanted.Northern Ireland","This video can not be played ""That was a political, not a negotiating meeting"" - unions react after meeting with the secretary of state A new pay offer made to health workers in Northern Ireland amid ongoing industrial action has been rejected. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith said there had been positive discussions and an ""improved offer"" from the Department of Health. However, Anne Speed, Unison, said it fell short of what they had asked for and industrial action would continue. Richard Pengelly of the Department of Health said he was desperately disappointed the offer was turned down. Health workers across Northern Ireland are taking industrial action in protest at pay and staffing levels which they have said are ""unsafe"". Full details of the cancellations and advice for patients can be found on theHealth and Social Care Board website,external. Unions have been taking part in fresh talks with Stormont's health department in a bid to end workers' industrial action. Afterwards, Ms Speed made a statement on behalf of the unions involved, saying: ""The department has presented a new position, trade unions have jointly agreed this remains insufficient and falls short of our members' requirements and mandate that they have given us.

Later, she added: ""It is now clear that neither the Department of Health nor the secretary of state has acted in good faith today. Our worst fears have been realised. ""They are using the health service, health workers and patients alike as bargaining chips to force the return of Stormont."" Pat Cullen, the director of the Royal College of Nursing in Northern Ireland, said:  ""It is clear that Department of Health officials are still incapable of grasping either the severity of the crisis in our health service or the determination of nurses and other health staff to secure safe staffing and pay equality. ""Nurses are no longer prepared to listen to the same excuses from the Department of Health about budgets and/or not having the ministerial authority to deliver an acceptable pay award even if the money were available. ""Our health service is collapsing as we speak."" Safety warning as nurses take industrial action 'It feels like someone sawing into my hip' A limited number of outpatient appointments went ahead in hospitals across Belfast on Thursday. It follows days of disruption during which 10,000 outpatient appointments and surgeries were cancelled. Mr Pengelly, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, said over the last 24 hours colleagues in the Department of Finance had made more money available. ""We responded immediately by making the offer that unions had previously indicated would be sufficient to allow suspension of activities,"" he said. Richard Pengelly said he was desperately disappointed the pay offer was rejected ""The offer last week of 2.1% has been increased by Â£28m to make it a 3.1% increase in the pay bill. ""I have gone to the limit of my authority. The only thing remaining for me is to seek to overturn a decision taken by a previous democratically elected minister - I don't think it's appropriate that a civil servant overturns ministerial decisions."" The Department of Finance said the January monitoring round process is currently under way, during which government departments declare reduced requirements and surrender any funding no longer required so it can be reallocated. It said funding no longer required was given up by a number of departments on Wednesday as part of that process. ""Given the current pressures and extenuating circumstances, the Department of Finance has taken the unprecedented step to expedite the reallocation of Â£28m of this money to the Department of Health for immediate use,"" the department said. Secretary of state Mr Smith met members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), Unite and Unison on Thursday afternoon. Patricia McKeown, Unison's regional secretary, said the meeting had been positive and she expected there  would be ""movement"" as a result. Unison's Patricia McKeown says she expected ""movement"" after meeting Julian Smith Earlier, Mr Smith said the situation in the health service was unacceptable. ""I am extremely sorry this is affecting patients, families and workers,"" he said. ""We need to come together now to try to resolve this to make sure the impacts don't get worse - I will do whatever I can to move things forward."" Unison members in the health service say they want better pay and increased staffing levels Unison, which represents more than 6,500 registered nurses and 3,500 health care assistants, has called for ""compromise and money on the table"". Healthcare workers who are members of the Unite trade union are due to join strike action with members of other unions on 18 December. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since January 2017 when the power-sharing parties - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in - split after a bitter row. Mr Smith said he would have more conversations with both the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the unions in the coming days. ""This area of health is a devolved matter so the decisions have to be taken by the NI Civil Service - they are working in difficult circumstances because Stormont's not running. ""But I am working with them to see if we can find a way through."" The Health and Social Care Board, the health service operator in Northern Ireland, said patient care and safety was of ""paramount concern"". ""We sincerely apologise for the distress and anxiety caused to all those patients, service users and family members who have been or may be affected by the industrial action,"" it added.

Farage hits out at MEPs over Tory support,"This video can not be played Nigel Farage says three of the MEPs who have left his Brexit Party have links to the Conservative government Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has hit out at three MEPs who quit the party and are now urging voters to back the Conservatives in the election. He told the BBC that Annunziata Rees-Mogg, Lance Forman and Lucy Harris had strong personal links to the Tories. But the MEPs say the Brexit Party's participation in the election will split the Leave vote. A fourth MEP, John Longworth, lost the whip on Wednesday for criticising the party's election strategy. The Brexit Party, which is not contesting seats won by the Conservatives in the 2017 general election, has maintained it is taking votes away from Labour in Leave-supporting areas where it is standing. And it says it is saving the Tories from losses to the pro-EU Liberal Democrats in the south of England. LIVE: General election campaign Manifesto guide: Who should I vote for? Where do the parties stand on Brexit? The four former Brexit Party MEPs are asking voters to back Boris Johnson's Conservatives in order to ""deliver"" Brexit, by giving him enough MPs to get his deal with the EU through Parliament. Asked about the resignations of Ms Rees-Mogg, Ms Harris and Mr Forman from his party, Mr Farage told the BBC's Andrew Neil: ""One of them [Ms Rees-Mogg] is the sister of a cabinet minister. Another one has a boyfriend working for that cabinet minister and another one is a personal friend of Boris Johnson's."" When challenged on whether he was smearing the MEPs, Mr Farage said he was presenting the facts. ""They joined the Brexit Party. They joined the coalition that I put together. They clearly were disaffected with Mrs [Theresa] May as leader,"" he said. ""We are not the Conservative Party."" Mr Farage added: ""I tell you something - Boris Johnson's deal unamended is unacceptable. I certainly stand by that."" The MEPs have also called for Mr Farage to stand down his candidates in the 12 December election. Ms Rees-Mogg, a former Tory parliamentary candidate and sister of Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, said it was ""tragic"" that the Brexit Party ""are now the very party risking Brexit"". ""It is clear to me that the Brexit Party is splitting the vote of Leavers in marginal and not-so-marginal constituencies,"" Ms Rees-Mogg said. ""The Brexit Party are permitting votes to go away from the Conservatives, providing us with a Remain coalition that will do anything not to honour the Brexit referendum."" The four former Brexit Party MEPs are urging voters to support the Conservative Party Ms Rees-Mogg said it had ""not been an easy decision for any of us"" to quit the Brexit Party, but ""we all feel it's one we had no choice but to make"". She said that Mr Johnson's Brexit deal was ""the only Leave option we have"", with the others being ""more damaging delays, a second Remain-Remain referendum or straight revoke"". She also rejected the suggestion that her brother had influenced her decision as ""disturbingly old-fashioned"", saying: ""We have completely independent views from each other and I am only concerned about Brexit."" The four MEPs have said they will continue with their roles in the European Parliament, with Miss Harris saying they would stay as MEPs in order to vote for the prime minister's withdrawal agreement. The Brexit Party, formed earlier this year, won 29 seats in July's European Parliament elections. In November Mr Farage announced it would not contest the 317 Westminster seats the Conservatives won in 2017, in order to help Leave-supporting candidates win. Mr Longworth has been critical of this decision, arguing that the party should be targeting between 20 and 30 seats. Earlier, Mr Farage said he was ""disappointed that four of our MEPs don't seem to understand that we both saved the Conservative Party from large-scale losses to the Liberal Democrats in the south and south-west of England"". He added that the Brexit Party was ""hammering the Labour Leave vote in its traditional heartlands, making it much easier for the Conservatives to win many of those seats"". However, Mr Farage said he would continue to target Labour-held Leave areas, despite these being a key part of the Conservatives' plan to win a majority and pass a Brexit deal. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey said there had been a Brexit Party ""takeover of the Tory party"", adding that ""Boris Johnson is only attracting the support of Farage and his stooges"". While Mr Johnson is campaigning to leave the EU under the terms of his deal, the Brexit Party is calling for what it calls a ""clean-break Brexit"". This would mean leaving the EU without a formal deal and trading under World Trade Organisation terms. Labour wants to renegotiate Mr Johnson's Brexit deal andput it to another public vote.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would remain neutral during that referendum.

Long waits 'leave mental health patients in limbo',"Patients with mental health problems are being left in limbo on ""hidden"" waiting lists by England's NHS talking therapy service, the BBC can reveal. The service - called Improving Access to Psychological Therapies - provides therapy, such as counselling, to adults with conditions like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. It starts seeing nine in 10 patients within the target time of six weeks. But that masks the fact many then face long waits for regular treatment. Half of patients waited over 28 days, and one in six longer than 90 days, between their first and second sessions in the past year. For most, the first session is a combination of an assessment and basic advice, with the second appointment marking the start of the core treatment sessions. Charities said the headline target was giving a false impression of what was happening, warning that patients were facing ""hidden waits"" that were putting their health at risk. NHS England acknowledged the pressure on the system was causing delays, but pointed out that despite the delays, half of patients given treatment still recovered. This video can not be played While waiting for therapy, Paul tried to take his own life Paul Williams, 60, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following a violent incident he was involved with as a police officer in Devon. He had to retire on medical grounds from the service in 2013 and turned to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) for help. While waiting for therapy, he tried to take his own life. ""The treatment was really good when I got it, but the problem is you are kept in a holding pattern. ""Waiting is really hard when you are struggling mentally. ""I'm not saying the delays were the reason I tried to kill myself - I had lost my career and there was a lot going on - but they certainly didn't help."" Gemma, 30, a teacher from Portsmouth, is another patient who turned to the service when she was suffering panic attacks and anxiety two years ago. Demands on the service meant face-to-face therapy was not available quickly, so she ended up paying for treatment privately. She said: ""It's such an important service, but it was not there when I needed it. ""I fear people's lives are being put at risk by this. ""I was having suicidal thoughts and knew I needed seeing quickly. ""It cost me Â£60 a session. I had them every week for three months."" Like many NHS services, IAPT is expected to see patients quickly. It has been given a target of seeing 75% within six weeks of a referral. It achieved this in nearly 90% of cases in 2018-19. But it is the second appointment which kick-starts the regular treatment for most patients. This normally starts with weekly sessions before becoming less frequent. The numbers facing long waits for the second session have been growing. During 2018-19, of the 580,000 patients who went on to have a second session, half had waited more than 28 days from their first appointment for it. One in six patients - nearly 95,000 - waited over 90 days, a doubling in number in just three years. That is on top of their wait for the first appointment. The average overall wait from referral to second session is over two months. There is concern that the delays are leading to patients dropping out. Data analysed by NHS England suggests there around 100,000 patients a year who drop out between the first and second appointment, who need treatment. It is not known, however, just how many of these would be down to the waits. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said the findings ""gives the lie to current waiting time figures being a mark of success"". She said the fact that so many patients were facing these ""hidden waits"" was ""deeply concerning"". ""We fear these delays may leave some people more at risk than they were before. ""During the period the person is being assessed as needing help, their expectations are raised, only to be disappointed and lose faith that help is there. ""If that critical window passes, then it may be too late. Such experiences may trigger a patient into self-harm, or increase the risk they become suicidal."" Paul Farmer, of the charity Mind, agreed. ""IAPT has been the biggest driver of more people getting access to services over the last ten years. ""But there are problems. Being left without support can have life-threatening consequences. ""Whoever forms our next government needs to make sure that everyone with a mental health problem gets the right help and support at the right time."" IAPT has certainly been a victim of its own success. The numbers being referred into the service have been rising ever since it was launched. Last year more than 1.5 million referrals were made - up by more than 10% in a year. Most do not end up being given a course of treatment. But individual services have still reported there is a shortage of therapists to provide support to the growing number of patients. Steps are being made to tackle this. NHS England acknowledged there were pressures in the system and said it was now providing financial support to local services to cover the cost of training extra staff. But a spokesman said the service was still exceeding expectations, and helping ""hundreds of thousands overcome"" their problems. The spokesman said seven in 10 patients show a ""significant"" improvement in their condition, with half going on to recover so that they were no longer clinically classed as having a mental health problem. IAPT clinical director David Clark said these results were ""remarkable"". He acknowledged the service would like to make waits ""shorter"".

Seizures of illegal diazepam double in a year,"The number of illegal diazepam tablets seized entering the UK has more than doubled in a year, figures obtained by the Victoria Derbyshire programme show. Some 1.3 million were intercepted in the postal system by the UK's Border Force in 2018, up from 545,000 in 2017. Doctors warn the authenticity of diazepam bought online cannot be trusted. It is illegal to possess without a prescription. The medicines regulator said selling such drugs was a ""serious offence"". Its figures, for tablets that tested positive for diazepam, do not include the number of fake pills being seized. One woman who was addicted to the drug for a decade - fuelled by pills bought online - said it had ruined her life. Diazepam - also known by one of its brand names, Valium - is a class-C drug in the UK. It is commonly used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and seizures, working to calm the brain and nerves. On the NHS, the medication is not recommended to be taken for longer than four weeks, while possessing the drug without a prescription carries a maximum prison sentence of two years. Some people turn to rogue online pharmacies and dealers to buy it when they are unable to - or do not want to - get it from a doctor. Hardyal Dhindsa believes ""more must be done"" across the health service and enforcement agencies Hardyal Dhindsa, the national lead on drug and alcohol abuse for the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), said online sales needed better legislation and monitoring. ""It's hard to see how we'll tackle this because availability online is so easy,"" he said. ""More needs to be done through the health service, the enforcement agencies and public health departments."" As part of its investigation, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme bought three batches of diazepam online and had them tested by experts at St George's Hospital in south London. Two batches were found to contain diazepam but one contained flualprazolam - an unlicensed drug that is more powerful and addictive. ""Emma"" was first prescribed diazepam in her early 20s during a serious bout of anxiety. ""I went to the doctor crying and wanting to kill myself,"" she says. ""I just remember being given these pills and they made it all go away."" But Emma became addicted and doctors would not prescribe her the amounts she felt she needed. ""Instead of going to another GP and explaining the situation, I started buying them on the black market,"" she says. Emma says the addiction ruined a decade of her life, causing her to underperform in her degree and postgraduate degree. And she is only now beginning to recover after being clean for almost a year. ""I don't remember most of my 20s, I don't remember anything,"" she says. The issue of people self-medicating for their mental health with diazepam illegally bought online has become so serious the Addiction to Online Medicine Service (Atom) has been established by the Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust. Its consultant psychiatrist, Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, said the main drug used by patients at the clinic was diazepam. ""The internet has been a game-changer,"" he said. Dr Owen Bowden-Jones ""People are experiencing high anxiety or severe depression or sometimes chronic pain and they find that these drugs make them feel better and their dose just goes up and up and up."" Dr Bowden-Jones said coming off high doses of diazepam could be more dangerous than heroin withdrawal. ""If people are addicted to it and they stop suddenly, then they are at risk of having a seizure and of course that could potentially be life-threatening,"" he said. It is not known how many people are buying illegal or fake diazepam online but it is significant enough for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to have made seizing it a priority in the past year. The Victoria Derbyshire programme visited a Border Force hub in central England where pills ordered online from across the globe arrive. Thousands of pills are seized and tested by UK Border Force at its hub in central England Officers there found some diazepam pills laced with fentanyl - a painkiller more potent than morphine and potentially fatal if taken without medical supervision. The MHRA said selling prescription-only medicines outside of the legal supply chain was a serious criminal offence. ""Diazepam is scheduled under the Misuse of Drugs Act and classified as a prescription-only medicine for a reason,"" it said. ""Prescription medicines are - by their very nature - potent and must be prescribed by a healthcare professional based on their clinical judgement and access to patient records."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""Border Force, the National Crime Agency, police and other law enforcement organisations work together with international partners to protect our borders from a range of threats, including harmful substances, and to disrupt and prosecute organised crime groups.""

The four MEPs have said they will continue with their roles in the European Parliament, with Miss Harris saying they would stay as MEPs in order to vote for the prime minister's withdrawal agreement. The Brexit Party, formed earlier this year, won 29 seats in July's European Parliament elections. In November Mr Farage announced it would not contest the 317 Westminster seats the Conservatives won in 2017, in order to help Leave-supporting candidates win. Mr Longworth has been critical of this decision, arguing that the party should be targeting between 20 and 30 seats. Earlier, Mr Farage said he was ""disappointed that four of our MEPs don't seem to understand that we both saved the Conservative Party from large-scale losses to the Liberal Democrats in the south and south-west of England"". He added that the Brexit Party was ""hammering the Labour Leave vote in its traditional heartlands, making it much easier for the Conservatives to win many of those seats"". However, Mr Farage said he would continue to target Labour-held Leave areas, despite these being a key part of the Conservatives' plan to win a majority and pass a Brexit deal. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey said there had been a Brexit Party ""takeover of the Tory party"", adding that ""Boris Johnson is only attracting the support of Farage and his stooges"". While Mr Johnson is campaigning to leave the EU under the terms of his deal, the Brexit Party is calling for what it calls a ""clean-break Brexit"". This would mean leaving the EU without a formal deal and trading under World Trade Organisation terms. Labour wants to renegotiate Mr Johnson's Brexit deal andput it to another public vote.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would remain neutral during that referendum.

"Long waits 'leave mental health patients in limbo'NHS leaves patients stuck on 'hidden' waiting lists for months, a BBC investigation shows.Health","Patients with mental health problems are being left in limbo on ""hidden"" waiting lists by England's NHS talking therapy service, the BBC can reveal. The service - called Improving Access to Psychological Therapies - provides therapy, such as counselling, to adults with conditions like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. It starts seeing nine in 10 patients within the target time of six weeks. But that masks the fact many then face long waits for regular treatment. Half of patients waited over 28 days, and one in six longer than 90 days, between their first and second sessions in the past year. For most, the first session is a combination of an assessment and basic advice, with the second appointment marking the start of the core treatment sessions. Charities said the headline target was giving a false impression of what was happening, warning that patients were facing ""hidden waits"" that were putting their health at risk. NHS England acknowledged the pressure on the system was causing delays, but pointed out that despite the delays, half of patients given treatment still recovered. This video can not be played While waiting for therapy, Paul tried to take his own life Paul Williams, 60, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following a violent incident he was involved with as a police officer in Devon. He had to retire on medical grounds from the service in 2013 and turned to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) for help. While waiting for therapy, he tried to take his own life. ""The treatment was really good when I got it, but the problem is you are kept in a holding pattern. ""Waiting is really hard when you are struggling mentally. ""I'm not saying the delays were the reason I tried to kill myself - I had lost my career and there was a lot going on - but they certainly didn't help."" Gemma, 30, a teacher from Portsmouth, is another patient who turned to the service when she was suffering panic attacks and anxiety two years ago. Demands on the service meant face-to-face therapy was not available quickly, so she ended up paying for treatment privately. She said: ""It's such an important service, but it was not there when I needed it. ""I fear people's lives are being put at risk by this. ""I was having suicidal thoughts and knew I needed seeing quickly. ""It cost me Â£60 a session. I had them every week for three months."" Like many NHS services, IAPT is expected to see patients quickly. It has been given a target of seeing 75% within six weeks of a referral. It achieved this in nearly 90% of cases in 2018-19. But it is the second appointment which kick-starts the regular treatment for most patients. This normally starts with weekly sessions before becoming less frequent. The numbers facing long waits for the second session have been growing. During 2018-19, of the 580,000 patients who went on to have a second session, half had waited more than 28 days from their first appointment for it. One in six patients - nearly 95,000 - waited over 90 days, a doubling in number in just three years. That is on top of their wait for the first appointment. The average overall wait from referral to second session is over two months. There is concern that the delays are leading to patients dropping out. Data analysed by NHS England suggests there around 100,000 patients a year who drop out between the first and second appointment, who need treatment. It is not known, however, just how many of these would be down to the waits. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said the findings ""gives the lie to current waiting time figures being a mark of success"". She said the fact that so many patients were facing these ""hidden waits"" was ""deeply concerning"". ""We fear these delays may leave some people more at risk than they were before. ""During the period the person is being assessed as needing help, their expectations are raised, only to be disappointed and lose faith that help is there. ""If that critical window passes, then it may be too late. Such experiences may trigger a patient into self-harm, or increase the risk they become suicidal."" Paul Farmer, of the charity Mind, agreed. ""IAPT has been the biggest driver of more people getting access to services over the last ten years. ""But there are problems. Being left without support can have life-threatening consequences. ""Whoever forms our next government needs to make sure that everyone with a mental health problem gets the right help and support at the right time."" IAPT has certainly been a victim of its own success. The numbers being referred into the service have been rising ever since it was launched. Last year more than 1.5 million referrals were made - up by more than 10% in a year. Most do not end up being given a course of treatment. But individual services have still reported there is a shortage of therapists to provide support to the growing number of patients. Steps are being made to tackle this. NHS England acknowledged there were pressures in the system and said it was now providing financial support to local services to cover the cost of training extra staff. But a spokesman said the service was still exceeding expectations, and helping ""hundreds of thousands overcome"" their problems. The spokesman said seven in 10 patients show a ""significant"" improvement in their condition, with half going on to recover so that they were no longer clinically classed as having a mental health problem. IAPT clinical director David Clark said these results were ""remarkable"". He acknowledged the service would like to make waits ""shorter"".

HSBC to bring in single overdraft rate of 40%The move will as much as quadruple the rate it charges some customers.,"The bank said it would cut fees on unarranged overdrafts HSBC is to bring in a single overdraft rate of 39.9% for UK customers from March 2020, as much as quadrupling the rate it charges some customers. However, the bank is removing a Â£5 daily fee for going into an unarranged overdraft and introducing an interest-free Â£25 buffer on some accounts. It follows a similar move from Nationwide Building Society in July. The new annual rate comes in response to tough new rules from regulators designed to protect consumers. But one analyst warned that steep overdraft rates could now become the ""new normal"". HSBC UK currently charges rates of 9.9% to 19.9% on arranged overdrafts, but the higher rate will be applied across its whole range of accounts except for its student bank account. The Â£25 buffer will apply to Bank Accounts and Advance Bank Accounts, providing leeway for those going slightly overdrawn. Bank overdraft fees in major shake-up Nationwide customers refunded Â£6m in charges HSBC said that as a result of this and the removal of the Â£5 daily fee for unarranged overdrafts, seven in 10 who use an overdraft would be better off or the same as a result of the changes. But that suggests around a third could end up worse off. The bank has eight to nine million current account holders in the UK. Madhu Kejriwal, HSBC UK's head of lending and payments, said: ""By simplifying our overdraft charging structure we are making them easier to understand, more transparent and giving customers tools to help them make better financial decisions."" Nationwide has also raised its overdraft rates The move comes in response to Financial Conduct Authority's plans to shake up the ""dysfunctional"" overdraft market - including stopping banks and building societies from charging higher prices for unarranged overdrafts than for arranged overdrafts. The new rules, which come into force next April, will require providers to charge a simple annual interest rate on all overdrafts and get rid of fixed fees. But there have been concerns that banks will hike authorised overdraft charges to claw back some revenue lost from unauthorised overdraft fees. In July, Nationwide also unveiled a new single rate of 39.9% across its adult current account range. Its changes came into force in November. Helen Saxon, banking editor at MoneySavingExpert.com, said: ""With both of the first banks to announce changes moving overdraft interest rates to around 40%, we have to wonder if this is the new normal."" The FCA has acknowledged banks may look to increase their arranged overdraft prices as a result of the new rules. But it argues the net effect will still be better for consumers - and increased competition between providers as a result of the changes will constrain any price increases. Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: ""It's disappointing to see such a hike in overdraft charges but there may be more brands coming out in the coming weeks to announce changes too. ""This shake-up is designed to make things fairer and more transparent to consumers. ""Borrowers would be wise to scrutinise any changes to their current account and look to switch elsewhere if they find that the account has lost its shine.""

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon rejected suggestions there is a police crisis after Susan Deacon, the head of the Scottish Police Authority, quit citing ""fundamentally flawed"" governance. Her departure prompted Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie to claim at first minister's questions that the police were ""in crisis once again"". Ms Sturgeon did not agree saying: ""No. I have to say to Willie Rennie the police is not in crisis and I think it does a disservice to the police officers around the country working so hard to keep us safe to say so."" Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr called on the first minister and the justice secretary to have an ""immediate review to learn what has gone wrong with the SNP's centralisation project"". Ms Sturgeon said her government had invested in and supported 1,000 extra police officers for Scotland while numbers elsewhere in the UK were ""slashed"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard called on the first minister to apologise over her government's public services ""failure"", but Ms Sturgeon highlights crime was at one of its lowest levels for decades.

Sports Minister Joe Fitzpatrick says there are many fantastic examples of people being real advocates of disability sport. We need to focus our efforts all ends of the spectrum, not just elite sport he adds. Mr Fitzpatrick highlights the sport inclusion disability charter in place in Ireland, which demonstrates the need the bring various sports bodies together. Tory MSP Jeremy Balfour Jeremy Balfour asks how we can normalise disability sport and get to a point where we just talk about sport. The Tory MSP says we need to put our money into grassroots and get the basics right, like changing rooms and public transport to clubs. ""I do hope that one day everybody who wants to play sport, whatever their ability or lack of ability, will be able to do that and enjoy it."" Labour MSP David Stewart says ""no one should be left behind"" when it comes to sport participation. Barriers can be social or personal, ranging from whether facilities are available to transport and poverty he says. I believe physical activity and social prescribing are vitally important in helping manage some disabilities, he concludes. Mr Rumbles says it is vital that we listen to disabled people and involve them in the development of sporting activities. It's essential to show disabled people participating in ""ordinary sporting activities"" as well as in elite events he insists. He agrees with previous speakers that we need to get to a point where we debate sport integration for everyone rather than having to highlight disability. Mike Rumbles Mike Rumbles welcomes the consensus breaking out in the chamber this afternoon, with backing for increasing support for more equal participation in sport and indeed more support for carers. The Lib Dem MSP makes no apology for reiterating the ""stark statistic"" that only 20% of disabled people get the recommended activity level. ""We shouldn't rest until this activity gap is closed."" From left to right: Matt Scott, McKenna Dahl, Jessica Long, Ryan Boyle, Melissa Stockwell BBC Sport's Incredible Athletes series explores the inspiring stories of Paralympic hopefuls targeting medals at the 2020 Games in Tokyo. We speak to wheelchair basketball player Matt Scott, swimmer Jessica Long, para-triathlete Melissa Stockwell, para-cyclist Ryan Boyle and shooter McKenna Dahl to discover what they aim to achieve within their sport and the lasting legacy they hope to create outside of their chosen discipline. Check it out here. Green MSP Alison Johnstone says the essence of this debate is wanting each and every person to have an opportunity to take part in something which inspires them. Only 20% of disabled people take the recommended daily activity, compared to 52% of non-disabled people she states. We must break down the initial barriers to participation, including access to suitable toilets and changing places she adds. Ms Johnstone argues ensuring disabled people can become coaches is also important and calls for more support for this.  Useful links:  Ms Fee says there are a range of barriers that disabled people have to overcome to participate in sport, which is why only 20% of disabled people meet the recommended level of activity. Fear of losing benefits if they are seen participating in sport is a real factor she says. The Labour MSP concludes saying we still don't have full participation or equality, and she reads a quote calling for an even playing field. Allow Twitter content?

""Scotland is fortunate to have many leading athletes and sports people of all abilities."" Disabled and non-disabled athletes must have their successes recognised equally, she adds. ""Sport can have a significant impact on the life of someone with a disability."" She cites testimony that providing Changing Places toilets would increase access to sport for all. Changing Places,externaltoilets are bigger disabled toilets with a hoist, a changing bed and more space around the toilet for someone who needs assistance.

Seizures of illegal diazepam double in a yearDoctors warn people cannot trust the authenticity of drugs bought from rogue online pharmacies or dealers.UK,"The number of illegal diazepam tablets seized entering the UK has more than doubled in a year, figures obtained by the Victoria Derbyshire programme show. Some 1.3 million were intercepted in the postal system by the UK's Border Force in 2018, up from 545,000 in 2017. Doctors warn the authenticity of diazepam bought online cannot be trusted. It is illegal to possess without a prescription. The medicines regulator said selling such drugs was a ""serious offence"". Its figures, for tablets that tested positive for diazepam, do not include the number of fake pills being seized. One woman who was addicted to the drug for a decade - fuelled by pills bought online - said it had ruined her life. Diazepam - also known by one of its brand names, Valium - is a class-C drug in the UK. It is commonly used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and seizures, working to calm the brain and nerves. On the NHS, the medication is not recommended to be taken for longer than four weeks, while possessing the drug without a prescription carries a maximum prison sentence of two years. Some people turn to rogue online pharmacies and dealers to buy it when they are unable to - or do not want to - get it from a doctor. Hardyal Dhindsa believes ""more must be done"" across the health service and enforcement agencies Hardyal Dhindsa, the national lead on drug and alcohol abuse for the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), said online sales needed better legislation and monitoring. ""It's hard to see how we'll tackle this because availability online is so easy,"" he said. ""More needs to be done through the health service, the enforcement agencies and public health departments."" As part of its investigation, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme bought three batches of diazepam online and had them tested by experts at St George's Hospital in south London. Two batches were found to contain diazepam but one contained flualprazolam - an unlicensed drug that is more powerful and addictive. ""Emma"" was first prescribed diazepam in her early 20s during a serious bout of anxiety. ""I went to the doctor crying and wanting to kill myself,"" she says. ""I just remember being given these pills and they made it all go away."" But Emma became addicted and doctors would not prescribe her the amounts she felt she needed. ""Instead of going to another GP and explaining the situation, I started buying them on the black market,"" she says. Emma says the addiction ruined a decade of her life, causing her to underperform in her degree and postgraduate degree. And she is only now beginning to recover after being clean for almost a year. ""I don't remember most of my 20s, I don't remember anything,"" she says. The issue of people self-medicating for their mental health with diazepam illegally bought online has become so serious the Addiction to Online Medicine Service (Atom) has been established by the Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust. Its consultant psychiatrist, Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, said the main drug used by patients at the clinic was diazepam. ""The internet has been a game-changer,"" he said. Dr Owen Bowden-Jones ""People are experiencing high anxiety or severe depression or sometimes chronic pain and they find that these drugs make them feel better and their dose just goes up and up and up."" Dr Bowden-Jones said coming off high doses of diazepam could be more dangerous than heroin withdrawal. ""If people are addicted to it and they stop suddenly, then they are at risk of having a seizure and of course that could potentially be life-threatening,"" he said. It is not known how many people are buying illegal or fake diazepam online but it is significant enough for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to have made seizing it a priority in the past year. The Victoria Derbyshire programme visited a Border Force hub in central England where pills ordered online from across the globe arrive. Thousands of pills are seized and tested by UK Border Force at its hub in central England Officers there found some diazepam pills laced with fentanyl - a painkiller more potent than morphine and potentially fatal if taken without medical supervision. The MHRA said selling prescription-only medicines outside of the legal supply chain was a serious criminal offence. ""Diazepam is scheduled under the Misuse of Drugs Act and classified as a prescription-only medicine for a reason,"" it said. ""Prescription medicines are - by their very nature - potent and must be prescribed by a healthcare professional based on their clinical judgement and access to patient records."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""Border Force, the National Crime Agency, police and other law enforcement organisations work together with international partners to protect our borders from a range of threats, including harmful substances, and to disrupt and prosecute organised crime groups.""

"Cave diver says Elon Musk tweets 'humiliated' himVernon Unsworth tells a court that he felt ""ashamed"" after the Tesla founder dubbed him ""pedo guy"".US & Canada","Vernon Unsworth told a court that he felt branded by Mr Musk's posts A British cave expert has testified that he was left feeling ""humiliated, ashamed"" and ""dirtied"" after Elon Musk labelled him ""pedo guy"" online. Vernon Unsworth is suing the Tesla founder for defamation. The diver, who helped rescue 12 boys trapped in a Thai cave last year, told a Los Angeles court that comments Mr Musk made were ""very hurtful"". The pair got into a public war of words after Mr Unsworth dismissed an offer of help from the billionaire. The case of the Thai boys, members of a football team who became trapped deep inside a cave in northern Thailand, captured the world's attention in June 2018. Mr Musk sent Tesla engineers and a small submarine to help free the boys during the Thai rescue effort - but it was never used. The full story of Thailandâs extraordinary cave rescue Thai cave rescue a year on Elon Musk reveals brain-hacking plans Mr Unsworth later labelled it a ""PR stunt"" and suggested the billionaire could ""stick his submarine where it hurts"" during an interview with CNN. Mr Musk - who has almost 30m Twitter followers - responded with a series of posts about Mr Unsworth including one where he labelled him ""pedo guy"". Mr Musk was also quizzed about his wealth in court on Wednesday Mr Unsworth's legal team have described Mr Musk's now-deleted tweet as ""vile and false"" and are seeking unspecified punitive damages. US District Judge Stephen Wilson previously denied the defence's request to define Mr Unsworth as a ""public figure"" - meaning lawyers for Mr Unsworth do not have to prove Mr Musk acted with ""actual malice"" to win the case. Mr Unsworth, who court reporters said appeared on the verge of tears, said he felt Mr Musk had branded him a paedophile. ""It feels very raw. I feel humiliated. Ashamed. Dirtied,"" he told the court. ""Effectively, from day one, I was given a life sentence without parole. It hurts to talk about it,"" Mr Unsworth said.

"Labour pledges to cap class sizes at 30 pupilsThe party promises to recruit nearly 20,000 extra teachers in England over five years if it wins power.","This video can not be played Labour promises to recruit 20,000 new teachers Labour is promising to cap class sizes at 30 pupils across all schools in England if it wins next Thursday's general election. The pledge is an extension of the party's commitment in its manifesto to limit classes to this size at all primary schools. The party said it would fulfil the pledge by recruiting nearly 20,000 extra teachers over five years. The Conservatives said English schools were rising up international rankings. The party has pledgedan extra Â£7.1bn by 2022-23 for schools in England. Tories signal tax-cutting Budget if elected Seven charts on the Â£73,000 cost of educating a child A simple guide to the Labour Party See how the parties compare on education Labour's pledge to recruit nearly 20,000 teachers issimilar to a promise made two weeks ago by the Liberal Democrats. Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran accused the party of trying to ""copy"" them, but added that Labour had ""no hope of meeting this target"". She said Labour would not be able to ""square these promises"" with leaving the EU if voters back the party's Brexit deal in its planned referendum, due to ""thousands of EU teachers coming to work in schools each year"". Labour said the recruitment would be funded from an extra Â£25bn in schools spending over the next three years. The party has also committed to ensuring all teachers have formal teaching qualifications within five years. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner told BBC Breakfast a Labour government could not make changes ""overnight"", but they would ""reversing the trend"" of increasing class sizes and lack of spending under the Conservatives. ""The investment would go in immediately, so the money that schools have had cut they would instantly see,"" she said. ""On 13 December, I can't bring in 20,000 teachers, of course not. But what I can do through our National Education Service [is] bring in the training and skills. ""So, things will move. Will it happen immediately over night? Of course not. But immediately from day one of me being education secretary we will put it in place."" There is a teacher shortage in England, with the latest official statistics showing a 15% shortfall in numbers beginning training for secondary schools. But Labour's promise to recruit more may not be easy to deliver. In subjects such as physics, fewer than half the required graduates have begun to train. Schools hire teachers, not the government, and it is harder to attract and keep teachers to work in poorer areas. The party also says it would cap all class sizes at 30. At the moment, just over 12% of secondary pupils are taught in classes with between 31-35 pupils. In 2009, when Labour was last in government, it was just over 10%. While slightly smaller class sizes could appeal to parents, the international evidence suggests it may make less of a difference to results than the quality of teaching. Labour is also promising to train up 24,958 unqualified teachers.  Official statistics suggest 98.7% of the teachers in England have at least a degree-level qualification, so who is the party talking about? Some are trainees working towards becoming a qualified teacher. Some are teachers who qualified overseas. Others are described as instructors who bring a special skill from their previous working life. Some are working in smaller units with excluded children or in schools for children with special needs. But there have always been some teachers in these categories in England's schools. The National Association of Head Teachers said 47,000 secondary teachers and 8,000 primary teachers would be needed by 2024 to keep pace with an expected increase in pupil numbers. Its general secretary Paul Whiteman said: ""We need significantly more recruits than Labour are suggesting just to meet rising demand, never mind reduce current class sizes."" ""The new recruits we need will not magically appear, and nor will they stay if we don't also address the stress and unnecessary workload that is widespread in the system."" Pushed on whether Labour's pledges were enough, Ms Rayner said the party was being ""realistic"". ""We are promising a huge amount more than what the other parties are,"" she told Breakfast. ""Over the last seven years, the government has missed their recruitment and retention target. Under Labour, you would get 20,000 new teachers and 25,000 unqualified teachers getting qualified."" UK improving in international school rankings Who should I vote for? Election 2019 manifesto guide Schools minister Nick Gibb said that in government Labour would ""would wreck the economy, leaving no money for public services"". He added thatfigures this week from the OECD's international school rankingsshowed English schools had risen up the league tables. Mr Gibb added that schools in Wales, where schools are run by the Labour-led devolved government, were the lowest performing within the UK. ""Conservative education reforms are improving standards in our schools, meaning children can get a better start in life,"" he added. Labour is also announcing new plans to tackle homelessness, including Â£100m a year for emergency winter shelters, Â£600m to build new hostels, and Â£200m to refurbish existing ones. Shadow housing secretary John Healey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people living on the streets was not ""inevitable"", but a ""direct result of decisions the government has taken in the past 10 years"". ""Some of these things aren't political,"" he said.  ""It shames us all that we have people dying on our streets because they are homeless and shames Conservative ministers most of all. ""The tragedy is we know what needs to be done as we have done it before... It is a new moral mission for Britain."" A Conservative party spokesman said: ""There is record investment going in to tackling homelessness - Â£1.2bn until April 2020 with a further Â£422m for 2020-21."" The Conservatives, like Labour, have pledged to end rough sleeping within five years if elected to government.

Seizures of illegal diazepam double in a yearDoctors warn people cannot trust the authenticity of drugs bought from rogue online pharmacies or dealers.,"The number of illegal diazepam tablets seized entering the UK has more than doubled in a year, figures obtained by the Victoria Derbyshire programme show. Some 1.3 million were intercepted in the postal system by the UK's Border Force in 2018, up from 545,000 in 2017. Doctors warn the authenticity of diazepam bought online cannot be trusted. It is illegal to possess without a prescription. The medicines regulator said selling such drugs was a ""serious offence"". Its figures, for tablets that tested positive for diazepam, do not include the number of fake pills being seized. One woman who was addicted to the drug for a decade - fuelled by pills bought online - said it had ruined her life. Diazepam - also known by one of its brand names, Valium - is a class-C drug in the UK. It is commonly used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and seizures, working to calm the brain and nerves. On the NHS, the medication is not recommended to be taken for longer than four weeks, while possessing the drug without a prescription carries a maximum prison sentence of two years. Some people turn to rogue online pharmacies and dealers to buy it when they are unable to - or do not want to - get it from a doctor. Hardyal Dhindsa believes ""more must be done"" across the health service and enforcement agencies Hardyal Dhindsa, the national lead on drug and alcohol abuse for the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), said online sales needed better legislation and monitoring. ""It's hard to see how we'll tackle this because availability online is so easy,"" he said. ""More needs to be done through the health service, the enforcement agencies and public health departments."" As part of its investigation, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme bought three batches of diazepam online and had them tested by experts at St George's Hospital in south London. Two batches were found to contain diazepam but one contained flualprazolam - an unlicensed drug that is more powerful and addictive. ""Emma"" was first prescribed diazepam in her early 20s during a serious bout of anxiety. ""I went to the doctor crying and wanting to kill myself,"" she says. ""I just remember being given these pills and they made it all go away."" But Emma became addicted and doctors would not prescribe her the amounts she felt she needed. ""Instead of going to another GP and explaining the situation, I started buying them on the black market,"" she says. Emma says the addiction ruined a decade of her life, causing her to underperform in her degree and postgraduate degree. And she is only now beginning to recover after being clean for almost a year. ""I don't remember most of my 20s, I don't remember anything,"" she says. The issue of people self-medicating for their mental health with diazepam illegally bought online has become so serious the Addiction to Online Medicine Service (Atom) has been established by the Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust. Its consultant psychiatrist, Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, said the main drug used by patients at the clinic was diazepam. ""The internet has been a game-changer,"" he said. Dr Owen Bowden-Jones ""People are experiencing high anxiety or severe depression or sometimes chronic pain and they find that these drugs make them feel better and their dose just goes up and up and up."" Dr Bowden-Jones said coming off high doses of diazepam could be more dangerous than heroin withdrawal. ""If people are addicted to it and they stop suddenly, then they are at risk of having a seizure and of course that could potentially be life-threatening,"" he said. It is not known how many people are buying illegal or fake diazepam online but it is significant enough for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to have made seizing it a priority in the past year. The Victoria Derbyshire programme visited a Border Force hub in central England where pills ordered online from across the globe arrive. Thousands of pills are seized and tested by UK Border Force at its hub in central England Officers there found some diazepam pills laced with fentanyl - a painkiller more potent than morphine and potentially fatal if taken without medical supervision. The MHRA said selling prescription-only medicines outside of the legal supply chain was a serious criminal offence. ""Diazepam is scheduled under the Misuse of Drugs Act and classified as a prescription-only medicine for a reason,"" it said. ""Prescription medicines are - by their very nature - potent and must be prescribed by a healthcare professional based on their clinical judgement and access to patient records."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""Border Force, the National Crime Agency, police and other law enforcement organisations work together with international partners to protect our borders from a range of threats, including harmful substances, and to disrupt and prosecute organised crime groups.""

"Cave diver says Elon Musk tweets 'humiliated' himVernon Unsworth tells a court that he felt ""ashamed"" after the Tesla founder dubbed him ""pedo guy"".","Vernon Unsworth told a court that he felt branded by Mr Musk's posts A British cave expert has testified that he was left feeling ""humiliated, ashamed"" and ""dirtied"" after Elon Musk labelled him ""pedo guy"" online. Vernon Unsworth is suing the Tesla founder for defamation. The diver, who helped rescue 12 boys trapped in a Thai cave last year, told a Los Angeles court that comments Mr Musk made were ""very hurtful"". The pair got into a public war of words after Mr Unsworth dismissed an offer of help from the billionaire. The case of the Thai boys, members of a football team who became trapped deep inside a cave in northern Thailand, captured the world's attention in June 2018.

Mr Musk was also quizzed about his wealth in court on Wednesday Mr Unsworth's legal team have described Mr Musk's now-deleted tweet as ""vile and false"" and are seeking unspecified punitive damages. US District Judge Stephen Wilson previously denied the defence's request to define Mr Unsworth as a ""public figure"" - meaning lawyers for Mr Unsworth do not have to prove Mr Musk acted with ""actual malice"" to win the case. Mr Unsworth, who court reporters said appeared on the verge of tears, said he felt Mr Musk had branded him a paedophile. ""It feels very raw. I feel humiliated. Ashamed. Dirtied,"" he told the court.

France crippled by biggest national strike in years,"This video can not be played Some of the protests turned violent France's largest nationwide strike in years has severely disrupted schools and transport. Workers are angry about planned pension reforms that would see them retiring later or facing reduced payouts. More than 800,000 workers from a wide range of professions demonstrated against the changes. Some cities saw clashes between protesters and police. President Emmanuel Macron wants to introduce a universal points-based pension system. That would replace France's current system, which has 42 different pension schemes across its private and public sectors, with variations in retirement age and benefits. Why are French workers on a nationwide strike? In pictures: The pension protests rocking France How could French strikes affect UK travellers? ""What we've got to do is shut the economy down,"" said union official Christian Grolier of the Force OuvriÃ¨re (Workers' Force). ""People are spoiling for a fight."" There have been clashes between police and protesters in Nantes Since coming to power, Mr Macron has pushed through other reforms including relaxing labour laws and cutting taxes for businesses. More than 800,000 people had joined demonstrations in more than 100 cities across France, the interior ministry said. The CGT union said 1.5m people had turned out, including 250,000 in Paris. The CGT also said workers had blocked seven of the country's eight oil refineries, potentially causing fuel shortages if the strike continues. In Paris, popular tourist sites including the Eiffel Tower, the MusÃ©e d'Orsay and the Palace of Versailles were shut for the day. Allow Twitter content?

The group said this was because e-scooters - despite being widely viewed as an ecologically-friendly form of transport - actually required large quantities of energy and resources during their manufacture and had short life cycles. Teachers and transport workers were joined by police, lawyers, hospital and airport staff, and other professions for the general walkout. Train driver Cyril Romero from Toulouse told France Info he would reconsider his job if the reforms went through. ""I started in 2001 with a contract that allowed me to leave at 50. But like everyone else, I got the reforms which pushed back my early retirement age to 52-and-a-half and then, in reality, 57-and-a-half for full pension. Now they want to make us work even longer."" Demonstrations are taking place across France An unnamed history teacher, writing in HuffPost, was planning to strike on Friday as well as Thursday. ""For me, the pension reforms are one punch too many. We're fighting not to lose hundreds of euros of pension a month - after more than 40 years in a job. ""How can you even think of ending your career in front of pupils beyond the age of 70, in worsening conditions and on what for many of us is just a minimum wage?"" Some trade union leaders have vowed to strike until Mr Macron abandons his campaign promise to overhaul the retirement system. One opinion poll put public support for the strikes at 69%, with backing strongest among 18- to 34 year olds. However farmers, whose pensions are among the lowest in the country, are not taking part. Demonstrators blocked buses in Marseille The Macron administration will hope to avoid a repeat of the country's general strike over pension reforms in 1995, which crippled the transport system for three weeks and drew massive popular support, forcing a government climbdown. A number of ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protesters had said they planned to join the demonstrations. Anger of yellow vests grips France a year on Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? The movement, which emerged at the end of 2018, started with demonstrations against a sharp increase in diesel taxes, but has broadened to reflect anger over higher living costs and President Macron's economic policies. Mr Macron's unified system - which he says would be fairer - would reward employees for each day worked, awarding points that would later be transferred into future pension benefits. The official retirement age has been raised in the last decade from 60 to 62, but remains one of the lowest among the OECD group of rich nations - in the UK, for example, the retirement age for state pensions is 66 and is due to rise to at least 67. The move would remove the most advantageous pensions for a number of jobs ranging from sailors to lawyers and even opera workers. Meanwhile, those retiring before 64 would receive a lower pension. For example, someone retiring at 63 would receive 5% less, so unions fear it will mean having to work longer for a lower pension. A recent poll concluded that 75% of people thought that pension reforms were necessary, but only a third believed the government could deliver them. How could French strikes affect UK travellers?

Breaking|Breaking newsScottish Police Authority chief resignsProf Susan Deacon is leaving the police watchdog after two years as its chair.Scotland politics,"Susan Deacon was a Labour MSP for two terms, and served as health minister Susan Deacon has resigned as chairwoman of Scotland's police watchdog, saying the system is ""fundamentally flawed"". The former Labour MSP was appointed to the Scottish Police Authority in 2017. But in her resignation letter, she said there was ""little more"" she could do to make the governance and accountability of policing work effectively. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon rejected opposition claims the police service was ""in crisis"" and said the SPA would continue to make improvements. Prof Deacon was the third person to chair the SPA since it began work in April 2013 alongside the launch of Scotland's single police service. When she was appointed in 2017, then justice secretary Michael Matheson said she would ""bring a fresh perspective to the governance of Scottish policing"". Prof Deacon said she had worked ""tirelessly"" to ensure the SPA operated effectively, and that public confidence and trust in policing was maintained. ""In truth, however, I have increasingly become convinced that the governance and accountability arrangements for policing in Scotland are fundamentally flawed, in structure, culture and practice, and I conclude that there is little more I can do to make these arrangements work effectively,"" she said. ""I would suggest that the Scottish government thinks afresh about how the police service is scrutinised and held to account and how, or if, a better separation between politics and policing, and indeed between the police service and those who oversee it, can be achieved."" It has not been an easy two years for Susan Deacon as chairwoman of the Scottish Police Authority. She was appointed in December 2017 following turmoil in the authority, which was seen as lacking transparency in its dealings, and was rocked by accusations of bullying surrounding previous chairman Andrew Flanagan. The police service was also in turmoil, with aseries of allegations of gross misconductbeing investigated against the chief constable, Phil Gormley, who resigned in early 2018. The SPA's turbulent beginnings Police complaints system 'should be speeded up' 'Unacceptable' failings at police body Prof Deacon has been credited with making the actions of the authority, whose role is to hold Police Scotland to account, more transparent. But it is her criticism of the way the national force is scrutinised and held to account which will cause concern, particularly her view that current governance and accountability arrangements are fundamentally flawed. It was a view shared by HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland, Gill Imrie, who told Holyrood's justice committee on Tuesday that senior officers at Police Scotland had become ""frustrated"" by the lack of scrutiny. In anearlier report,external, she said there was ""no clear vision, strategy or plan in place"" for the SPA. Policing inevitably is a highly political matter, but Prof Deacon said the government must review the separation between politics and policing, and said she felt there was little more she could do in the role. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon responded to questions about the Scottish Police Authority Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said there had been ""significant improvement across many facets of the police service in Scotland"" during Prof Deacon's time at the SPA. ""As Ms Deacon herself acknowledges, our police service is in a much stronger place now than prior to her appointment,"" he said. At First Minister's Questions, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the police was ""in crisis once again"" and claimed there was a ""toxic mix of chaos and complacency"". Ms Sturgeon replied: ""The police is not in crisis and I think it does a disservice to police officers around our country who are working so hard to keep us safe to say so."" She said the SPA would continue with the improvements which were being made to governance and accountability. Audit Scotland has criticised the SPA for poor governance and a lack of transparency Scottish Labour said the resignation ""raises serious questions"" about the SPA's ability to oversee Police Scotland, while the Scottish Conservatives described the SPA as ""an organisation in crisis"". The SPA's vice chairman, David Crichton, will lead the SPA until a new appointment is made. He said: ""We believe that the system of governance and accountability for policing in Scotland that was envisaged by the founding legislation is a sound one and can work effectively,"" he added. ""While we respect this personal decision of the chair, our collective focus will be on working together with our dedicated staff team to build on recent progress, deliver the actions and improvements already identified, and redouble the SPA's focus on the issues of greatest importance to policing and the public."" However, the Scottish Police Federation said the resignation was not a surprise. Its chairwoman, Andrea MacDonald, said: ""It has been apparent to the Scottish Police Federation that the authority has not been operating effectively for some time. ""It is nonetheless disappointing that we now see the Scottish Police Authority looking for its fourth chair in six years."" Ms Deacon's predecessorAndrew Flanagan resigned in June 2017 after heavy criticismfrom two Holyrood committees over governance and transparency at the SPA. He said he was quitting to avoid being a ""distraction"" to the new 10-year policing strategy, and that the ""personalised"" debate had ""impacted on me and my family"". The SPA's first chairman, Vic Emery, stepped down in September 2015 after deciding not to seek an extension to his contract. He had been involved in a number of public spats with the first chief constable of the new police service, Sir Stephen House.

Unions to meet Smith as health crisis escalates,"This video can not be played ""That was a political, not a negotiating meeting"" - unions react after meeting with the secretary of state A new pay offer made to health workers in Northern Ireland amid ongoing industrial action has been rejected. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith said there had been positive discussions and an ""improved offer"" from the Department of Health. However, Anne Speed, Unison, said it fell short of what they had asked for and industrial action would continue. Richard Pengelly of the Department of Health said he was desperately disappointed the offer was turned down. Health workers across Northern Ireland are taking industrial action in protest at pay and staffing levels which they have said are ""unsafe"". Full details of the cancellations and advice for patients can be found on theHealth and Social Care Board website,external. Unions have been taking part in fresh talks with Stormont's health department in a bid to end workers' industrial action. Afterwards, Ms Speed made a statement on behalf of the unions involved, saying: ""The department has presented a new position, trade unions have jointly agreed this remains insufficient and falls short of our members' requirements and mandate that they have given us. Anne Speed said the offer fell short of what they had asked for ""Industrial action continues and joint planned trade union action remains in place for 18 December."" Later, she added: ""It is now clear that neither the Department of Health nor the secretary of state has acted in good faith today. Our worst fears have been realised. ""They are using the health service, health workers and patients alike as bargaining chips to force the return of Stormont."" Pat Cullen, the director of the Royal College of Nursing in Northern Ireland, said:  ""It is clear that Department of Health officials are still incapable of grasping either the severity of the crisis in our health service or the determination of nurses and other health staff to secure safe staffing and pay equality. ""Nurses are no longer prepared to listen to the same excuses from the Department of Health about budgets and/or not having the ministerial authority to deliver an acceptable pay award even if the money were available. ""Our health service is collapsing as we speak."" Safety warning as nurses take industrial action 'It feels like someone sawing into my hip' A limited number of outpatient appointments went ahead in hospitals across Belfast on Thursday. It follows days of disruption during which 10,000 outpatient appointments and surgeries were cancelled. Mr Pengelly, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, said over the last 24 hours colleagues in the Department of Finance had made more money available. ""We responded immediately by making the offer that unions had previously indicated would be sufficient to allow suspension of activities,"" he said. Richard Pengelly said he was desperately disappointed the pay offer was rejected ""The offer last week of 2.1% has been increased by Â£28m to make it a 3.1% increase in the pay bill. ""I have gone to the limit of my authority. The only thing remaining for me is to seek to overturn a decision taken by a previous democratically elected minister - I don't think it's appropriate that a civil servant overturns ministerial decisions."" The Department of Finance said the January monitoring round process is currently under way, during which government departments declare reduced requirements and surrender any funding no longer required so it can be reallocated. It said funding no longer required was given up by a number of departments on Wednesday as part of that process. ""Given the current pressures and extenuating circumstances, the Department of Finance has taken the unprecedented step to expedite the reallocation of Â£28m of this money to the Department of Health for immediate use,"" the department said. Secretary of state Mr Smith met members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), Unite and Unison on Thursday afternoon. Patricia McKeown, Unison's regional secretary, said the meeting had been positive and she expected there  would be ""movement"" as a result. Unison's Patricia McKeown says she expected ""movement"" after meeting Julian Smith Earlier, Mr Smith said the situation in the health service was unacceptable. ""I am extremely sorry this is affecting patients, families and workers,"" he said. ""We need to come together now to try to resolve this to make sure the impacts don't get worse - I will do whatever I can to move things forward."" Unison members in the health service say they want better pay and increased staffing levels Unison, which represents more than 6,500 registered nurses and 3,500 health care assistants, has called for ""compromise and money on the table"". Healthcare workers who are members of the Unite trade union are due to join strike action with members of other unions on 18 December. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since January 2017 when the power-sharing parties - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in - split after a bitter row. Mr Smith said he would have more conversations with both the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the unions in the coming days. ""This area of health is a devolved matter so the decisions have to be taken by the NI Civil Service - they are working in difficult circumstances because Stormont's not running. ""But I am working with them to see if we can find a way through."" The Health and Social Care Board, the health service operator in Northern Ireland, said patient care and safety was of ""paramount concern"". ""We sincerely apologise for the distress and anxiety caused to all those patients, service users and family members who have been or may be affected by the industrial action,"" it added.

"Labour pledges to cap class sizes at 30 pupilsThe party promises to recruit nearly 20,000 extra teachers in England over five years if it wins power.Election 2019Comments","This video can not be played Labour promises to recruit 20,000 new teachers Labour is promising to cap class sizes at 30 pupils across all schools in England if it wins next Thursday's general election. The pledge is an extension of the party's commitment in its manifesto to limit classes to this size at all primary schools. The party said it would fulfil the pledge by recruiting nearly 20,000 extra teachers over five years. The Conservatives said English schools were rising up international rankings. The party has pledgedan extra Â£7.1bn by 2022-23 for schools in England. Tories signal tax-cutting Budget if elected Seven charts on the Â£73,000 cost of educating a child A simple guide to the Labour Party See how the parties compare on education Labour's pledge to recruit nearly 20,000 teachers issimilar to a promise made two weeks ago by the Liberal Democrats. Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran accused the party of trying to ""copy"" them, but added that Labour had ""no hope of meeting this target"". She said Labour would not be able to ""square these promises"" with leaving the EU if voters back the party's Brexit deal in its planned referendum, due to ""thousands of EU teachers coming to work in schools each year"". Labour said the recruitment would be funded from an extra Â£25bn in schools spending over the next three years. The party has also committed to ensuring all teachers have formal teaching qualifications within five years. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner told BBC Breakfast a Labour government could not make changes ""overnight"", but they would ""reversing the trend"" of increasing class sizes and lack of spending under the Conservatives. ""The investment would go in immediately, so the money that schools have had cut they would instantly see,"" she said. ""On 13 December, I can't bring in 20,000 teachers, of course not. But what I can do through our National Education Service [is] bring in the training and skills. ""So, things will move. Will it happen immediately over night? Of course not. But immediately from day one of me being education secretary we will put it in place."" There is a teacher shortage in England, with the latest official statistics showing a 15% shortfall in numbers beginning training for secondary schools. But Labour's promise to recruit more may not be easy to deliver. In subjects such as physics, fewer than half the required graduates have begun to train. Schools hire teachers, not the government, and it is harder to attract and keep teachers to work in poorer areas. The party also says it would cap all class sizes at 30. At the moment, just over 12% of secondary pupils are taught in classes with between 31-35 pupils. In 2009, when Labour was last in government, it was just over 10%. While slightly smaller class sizes could appeal to parents, the international evidence suggests it may make less of a difference to results than the quality of teaching. Labour is also promising to train up 24,958 unqualified teachers.  Official statistics suggest 98.7% of the teachers in England have at least a degree-level qualification, so who is the party talking about? Some are trainees working towards becoming a qualified teacher. Some are teachers who qualified overseas. Others are described as instructors who bring a special skill from their previous working life. Some are working in smaller units with excluded children or in schools for children with special needs. But there have always been some teachers in these categories in England's schools. The National Association of Head Teachers said 47,000 secondary teachers and 8,000 primary teachers would be needed by 2024 to keep pace with an expected increase in pupil numbers. Its general secretary Paul Whiteman said: ""We need significantly more recruits than Labour are suggesting just to meet rising demand, never mind reduce current class sizes."" ""The new recruits we need will not magically appear, and nor will they stay if we don't also address the stress and unnecessary workload that is widespread in the system."" Pushed on whether Labour's pledges were enough, Ms Rayner said the party was being ""realistic"". ""We are promising a huge amount more than what the other parties are,"" she told Breakfast. ""Over the last seven years, the government has missed their recruitment and retention target. Under Labour, you would get 20,000 new teachers and 25,000 unqualified teachers getting qualified."" UK improving in international school rankings Who should I vote for? Election 2019 manifesto guide Schools minister Nick Gibb said that in government Labour would ""would wreck the economy, leaving no money for public services"". He added thatfigures this week from the OECD's international school rankingsshowed English schools had risen up the league tables. Mr Gibb added that schools in Wales, where schools are run by the Labour-led devolved government, were the lowest performing within the UK. ""Conservative education reforms are improving standards in our schools, meaning children can get a better start in life,"" he added. Labour is also announcing new plans to tackle homelessness, including Â£100m a year for emergency winter shelters, Â£600m to build new hostels, and Â£200m to refurbish existing ones. Shadow housing secretary John Healey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people living on the streets was not ""inevitable"", but a ""direct result of decisions the government has taken in the past 10 years"". ""Some of these things aren't political,"" he said.  ""It shames us all that we have people dying on our streets because they are homeless and shames Conservative ministers most of all. ""The tragedy is we know what needs to be done as we have done it before... It is a new moral mission for Britain."" A Conservative party spokesman said: ""There is record investment going in to tackling homelessness - Â£1.2bn until April 2020 with a further Â£422m for 2020-21.""

A Conservative party spokesman said: ""There is record investment going in to tackling homelessness - Â£1.2bn until April 2020 with a further Â£422m for 2020-21."" The Conservatives, like Labour, have pledged to end rough sleeping within five years if elected to government.

Simon JackBBC Business Editor Nationalising UK energy companies will delay the UK's move towards a zero carbon future according to the chief executive of Scottish Power, Keith Anderson. He says that investment by the private sector had seen the cost of renewable energy plummet over the last decade and that debates about nationalisation would only serve as a distraction from averting a climate emergency. ""We need to focus on hitting zero carbon by 2050. Anything else is a distraction. ""Having big arguments about who owns what is the worst thing we could do right now. It would slow everything down when what we need to do is speed up."" A Labour spokesman responds by saying Mr Anderson's comments are ""hardly surprising"" as they represent ""vested interests"". Read the full story here. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell tells the Financial Times that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would not negotiate deals with smaller parties in the event of a hung Parliament. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph launches its latest attack on Mr Corbyn for what it calls the anti-Semitism ""storm"" in his party. It's that time of the night when we get a preview of the next day's papers - and a number of them focus on Andrew Neil's challenge to Boris Johnson. The Metro says the ""BBC rottweiler"" hasthrown down the gauntlet with his request for an interview.The PM is the only main party leader not to face Neil in a one-on-one interview.  The same story also features on the front page of Friday's Guardian - although the paper's lead concerns the ""worldwide surge"" in measles cases. By BBC politics reporter Lucy Webster When you register to vote, your name and address are placed on the electoral roll - a public document that is available to all. For some, that can lead to a potentially dangerous dilemma. ""If I were being really cynical about it, one could argue that it's almost sexual discrimination by the back door,"" says a women we'll call Kate, as we talk about her struggle to access the vote after escaping an abusive relationship, with the two small boys. Kate was always politically engaged. She had been registered to vote by post at her previous address - but it was too dangerous for her to return there to pick up her ballot paper and she couldn't make her new address public for fear her abusive partner could catch up with her. But she still wanted to vote. So she began researching her options. Initially, she found nothing online to help her. Eventually, her mother suggested asking her local council. ""The first person she spoke to said she had no idea what my mother was talking about but when pressed did find a senior officer,"" Kate says. ""This officer knew that Icould register anonymously,externaland checked my current address and advised there was a special form that would be posted to me."" It was the first time Kate had heard of the system. It seems many others don't know it exists. Continue reading here.

Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt both died in the London Bridge attack last week In case you missed it, here's a bit more from the Labour leader's appearance on ITV earlier. Jeremy Corbyn warned the UK's
involvement in overseas wars has led to the development of breeding grounds for
""the most extreme kind of terrorists"". The Labour leader said there were
""vast, ungoverned spaces"" in Lybia and Syria as a consequence of
conflicts the UK had taken part in. Speaking on ITV Tonight's The Leader
Interviews, Mr Corbyn warned that ""no country could completely insulate itself
from the rest of the world"". Asked about the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan, who
had been released from prison half way through a terrorism sentence, Mr Corbyn said there were questions to
answer. ""I want to know exactly what deradicalisaiton programme he
undertook in prison, why the Parole Board was not involved in his
release."" He denied that his first instinct had been
to criticise the UK. ""My first instinct was the instinct of everybody else
to be shocked and appalled at what had happened and to resolve that we do
everything to keep everybody safe in the future,"" he added. You can tune in to BBC One from 22:45 GMT to watch. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That's it from Mr Corbyn's speech at the rally in Birmingham. He says ""everything will be thrown at us"" over the last week of the campaign. But ""we're going to be out there... with our message of hope, of inclusion, of a society that is based on the needs of all of us and the social justice of all"". He wraps things up by saying: ""I can't wait for next Thursday."" Hammering home his main message, Mr Corbyn says: ""It runs like a golden thread all the way through our manifesto - the need to bring people together, and the need to develop a society that genuinely works for all."" He references policies to improve workers' rights, to tackle the gender pay gap (for which he gets a loud cheer), to fight climate change and to ""save our planet"". He says he goes into the election campaign knowing there is great ""inequality"" and many ""injustices"" within regions across the country - and adds that a Labour government would ensure local communities get their ""fair share of transport and investment"". He says the West Midlands has made a ""massive contribution to this country"" and deserves to avoid ""another 10 years of austerity and cuts"". You can read more about Labour's policies - and compare them with all of the other major parties' pledges - here. The UK's main parties are gearing up for a general election on 12 December. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. So how has this happened? The answer to that and other questionscan be found in our really simple election guide. The Labour leader starts things off by reflecting on the school visits he's been on today. Mr Corbyn says he's ""inspired"" by the ambitions of the children he's met - but also saddened by the difficulties they and their ""stressed-out"" teachers have faced as they struggle with a ""lack of funds"". ""None of this is necessary, none of this is right,"" he says. All of this is part of Labour's promotion ofeducation plans they announced earlier today. Highlights of the pledges made include capping class sizes by recruiting 20,000 extra teachers. ... with the familar chants of ""oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" from his supporters. Once the singing dies down, he'll start his speech. Ahead of Jeremy Corbyn taking the stage at the Labour rally in Birmingham comes support from singer Jamelia. She talks about being a single mum, enjoying her education and having all three of her daughters in NHS hospitals. ""It's very important to support all of the services that have made me the woman I am,"" she says. She also talks about how her daughter almost died as a newborn - but because of the NHS, she is alive. She's going to turn two soon and ""all she wants for her birthday is a Labour government"". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon visited a Christmas market in Crieff, Scotland Supporters await Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at an event in Birmingham Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson plays ""topple Boris"" at a rally in Edinburgh Prime Minister Boris Johnson uses a sewing machine as he visits John Smedley Mill in Matlock The BBC's Andrew Neil has issued a challenge to Conservative leader Boris Johnson to take part in a half-hour general election interview with him.

France braced for biggest national strike in yearsTransport and schools are severely affected as millions threaten to strike over pension changes.,"This video can not be played Some of the protests turned violent France's largest nationwide strike in years has severely disrupted schools and transport. Workers are angry about planned pension reforms that would see them retiring later or facing reduced payouts. More than 800,000 workers from a wide range of professions demonstrated against the changes. Some cities saw clashes between protesters and police. President Emmanuel Macron wants to introduce a universal points-based pension system. That would replace France's current system, which has 42 different pension schemes across its private and public sectors, with variations in retirement age and benefits. Why are French workers on a nationwide strike? In pictures: The pension protests rocking France How could French strikes affect UK travellers? ""What we've got to do is shut the economy down,"" said union official Christian Grolier of the Force OuvriÃ¨re (Workers' Force). ""People are spoiling for a fight."" There have been clashes between police and protesters in Nantes Since coming to power, Mr Macron has pushed through other reforms including relaxing labour laws and cutting taxes for businesses. More than 800,000 people had joined demonstrations in more than 100 cities across France, the interior ministry said. The CGT union said 1.5m people had turned out, including 250,000 in Paris. The CGT also said workers had blocked seven of the country's eight oil refineries, potentially causing fuel shortages if the strike continues. In Paris, popular tourist sites including the Eiffel Tower, the MusÃ©e d'Orsay and the Palace of Versailles were shut for the day. Allow Twitter content?

The group said this was because e-scooters - despite being widely viewed as an ecologically-friendly form of transport - actually required large quantities of energy and resources during their manufacture and had short life cycles. Teachers and transport workers were joined by police, lawyers, hospital and airport staff, and other professions for the general walkout. Train driver Cyril Romero from Toulouse told France Info he would reconsider his job if the reforms went through. ""I started in 2001 with a contract that allowed me to leave at 50. But like everyone else, I got the reforms which pushed back my early retirement age to 52-and-a-half and then, in reality, 57-and-a-half for full pension. Now they want to make us work even longer."" Demonstrations are taking place across France An unnamed history teacher, writing in HuffPost, was planning to strike on Friday as well as Thursday. ""For me, the pension reforms are one punch too many. We're fighting not to lose hundreds of euros of pension a month - after more than 40 years in a job. ""How can you even think of ending your career in front of pupils beyond the age of 70, in worsening conditions and on what for many of us is just a minimum wage?"" Some trade union leaders have vowed to strike until Mr Macron abandons his campaign promise to overhaul the retirement system. One opinion poll put public support for the strikes at 69%, with backing strongest among 18- to 34 year olds. However farmers, whose pensions are among the lowest in the country, are not taking part. Demonstrators blocked buses in Marseille The Macron administration will hope to avoid a repeat of the country's general strike over pension reforms in 1995, which crippled the transport system for three weeks and drew massive popular support, forcing a government climbdown. A number of ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protesters had said they planned to join the demonstrations. Anger of yellow vests grips France a year on Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? The movement, which emerged at the end of 2018, started with demonstrations against a sharp increase in diesel taxes, but has broadened to reflect anger over higher living costs and President Macron's economic policies. Mr Macron's unified system - which he says would be fairer - would reward employees for each day worked, awarding points that would later be transferred into future pension benefits. The official retirement age has been raised in the last decade from 60 to 62, but remains one of the lowest among the OECD group of rich nations - in the UK, for example, the retirement age for state pensions is 66 and is due to rise to at least 67. The move would remove the most advantageous pensions for a number of jobs ranging from sailors to lawyers and even opera workers. Meanwhile, those retiring before 64 would receive a lower pension. For example, someone retiring at 63 would receive 5% less, so unions fear it will mean having to work longer for a lower pension. A recent poll concluded that 75% of people thought that pension reforms were necessary, but only a third believed the government could deliver them. How could French strikes affect UK travellers?

Mentally ill 'spend months on hidden waiting list',"Patients with mental health problems are being left in limbo on ""hidden"" waiting lists by England's NHS talking therapy service, the BBC can reveal. The service - called Improving Access to Psychological Therapies - provides therapy, such as counselling, to adults with conditions like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. It starts seeing nine in 10 patients within the target time of six weeks. But that masks the fact many then face long waits for regular treatment. Half of patients waited over 28 days, and one in six longer than 90 days, between their first and second sessions in the past year. For most, the first session is a combination of an assessment and basic advice, with the second appointment marking the start of the core treatment sessions. Charities said the headline target was giving a false impression of what was happening, warning that patients were facing ""hidden waits"" that were putting their health at risk. NHS England acknowledged the pressure on the system was causing delays, but pointed out that despite the delays, half of patients given treatment still recovered. This video can not be played While waiting for therapy, Paul tried to take his own life Paul Williams, 60, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following a violent incident he was involved with as a police officer in Devon. He had to retire on medical grounds from the service in 2013 and turned to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) for help. While waiting for therapy, he tried to take his own life. ""The treatment was really good when I got it, but the problem is you are kept in a holding pattern. ""Waiting is really hard when you are struggling mentally. ""I'm not saying the delays were the reason I tried to kill myself - I had lost my career and there was a lot going on - but they certainly didn't help."" Gemma, 30, a teacher from Portsmouth, is another patient who turned to the service when she was suffering panic attacks and anxiety two years ago. Demands on the service meant face-to-face therapy was not available quickly, so she ended up paying for treatment privately. She said: ""It's such an important service, but it was not there when I needed it. ""I fear people's lives are being put at risk by this. ""I was having suicidal thoughts and knew I needed seeing quickly. ""It cost me Â£60 a session. I had them every week for three months."" Like many NHS services, IAPT is expected to see patients quickly. It has been given a target of seeing 75% within six weeks of a referral. It achieved this in nearly 90% of cases in 2018-19. But it is the second appointment which kick-starts the regular treatment for most patients. This normally starts with weekly sessions before becoming less frequent. The numbers facing long waits for the second session have been growing. During 2018-19, of the 580,000 patients who went on to have a second session, half had waited more than 28 days from their first appointment for it. One in six patients - nearly 95,000 - waited over 90 days, a doubling in number in just three years. That is on top of their wait for the first appointment. The average overall wait from referral to second session is over two months. There is concern that the delays are leading to patients dropping out. Data analysed by NHS England suggests there around 100,000 patients a year who drop out between the first and second appointment, who need treatment. It is not known, however, just how many of these would be down to the waits. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said the findings ""gives the lie to current waiting time figures being a mark of success"". She said the fact that so many patients were facing these ""hidden waits"" was ""deeply concerning"". ""We fear these delays may leave some people more at risk than they were before. ""During the period the person is being assessed as needing help, their expectations are raised, only to be disappointed and lose faith that help is there. ""If that critical window passes, then it may be too late. Such experiences may trigger a patient into self-harm, or increase the risk they become suicidal."" Paul Farmer, of the charity Mind, agreed. ""IAPT has been the biggest driver of more people getting access to services over the last ten years. ""But there are problems. Being left without support can have life-threatening consequences. ""Whoever forms our next government needs to make sure that everyone with a mental health problem gets the right help and support at the right time."" IAPT has certainly been a victim of its own success. The numbers being referred into the service have been rising ever since it was launched. Last year more than 1.5 million referrals were made - up by more than 10% in a year. Most do not end up being given a course of treatment. But individual services have still reported there is a shortage of therapists to provide support to the growing number of patients. Steps are being made to tackle this. NHS England acknowledged there were pressures in the system and said it was now providing financial support to local services to cover the cost of training extra staff. But a spokesman said the service was still exceeding expectations, and helping ""hundreds of thousands overcome"" their problems. The spokesman said seven in 10 patients show a ""significant"" improvement in their condition, with half going on to recover so that they were no longer clinically classed as having a mental health problem. IAPT clinical director David Clark said these results were ""remarkable"". He acknowledged the service would like to make waits ""shorter"".

Huawei launches new legal challenge against US,"Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has launched a legal challenge to a decision by US regulators to classify it as a national security threat. It comes afterthe US Federal Communications Commission put curbs on rural mobile providersusing a $8.5bn (Â£6.5bn) government fund to buy Huawei equipment. The firm said evidence that it was a threat to security ""does not exist"". The move is the latest in a series of challenges between Huawei and the US. The company has asked the US Court of Appeal to overturn the decision. Speaking at a news conference at Huawei's headquarters in Shenzhen, the company's chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said: ""The US government has never presented real evidence to show that Huawei is a national security threat. That's because this evidence does not exist."" All you need to know about Huawei's problems Huawei: Trouble overseas but boom time in China Huawei employee wrongfully jailed for 251 days This is the second legal challenge this year by the company as it fights back against the Trump administration's policies. Huawei launched similar legal action in May, challenging a decision to ban US government agencies from buying its equipment. The company has been drawn into the disputes against the backdrop of the bitter trade war between the world's two biggest economies. It has a leading role in manufacturing and selling key technology for next generation 5G telecoms infrastructure. This video can not be played Will superfast 5G mobile be worth the money? Meanwhile, Washington has been pressuring other nations to not allow Huawei to build their critical 5G telecoms infrastructure. At the Nato summit in the UK on Wednesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the decision on whether to allow Huawei a role in building Britain's 5G networks would be based on ensuring continued co-operation with the US over intelligence sharing. ""On Huawei and 5G, I don't want this country to be unnecessarily hostile to investment from overseas,"" Mr Johnson said. ""On the other hand, we cannot prejudice our vital national security. Nor can we prejudice our ability to co-operate with other vital... security partners - and that will be the key criteria that informs our decision about Huawei.""
