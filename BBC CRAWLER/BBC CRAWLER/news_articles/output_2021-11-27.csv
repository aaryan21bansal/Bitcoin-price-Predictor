Dozens test positive on SA-Netherlands flights,"Sixty-one people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa have tested positive for Covid-19, Dutch officials say. They have been placed in isolation at a hotel near Schiphol airport. They were among some 600 passengers held for several hours after arrival while they were tested for the virus. Dutch health authorities said Omicron, labelled on Friday as a variant of concern, was ""probably found in a number of people"" who tested positive. Other European countries, including the UK and Germany, have confirmed cases of the Omicron variant. The variant was first reported to the World Health Organization from South Africa on Wednesday, with early evidence suggesting it has a higher re-infection risk. Many countries around the world have restricted travel from the southern African region. Meanwhile, the Netherlands is one of several European countries struggling to contain record numbers of infections. A partial lockdown will be extended on Sunday, with all hospitality and cultural venues forced to close between 17:00 and 05:00, at least until 19 December. The flights by Dutch national carrier KLM from Johannesburg arrived at 10:30 and 11:00 local time (09:30 and 10:00 GMT) on Friday. The Dutch government had by then already restricted travel from the region because of the new variant and arranged for the passengers to be tested and isolated. South Africans fear impact of new variant measures How worrying is the new Covid variant? Some expressed frustration about being kept on the plane without food or drink. Passengers travelling from Cape Town to Manchester via Amsterdam told the BBC that they were held on the tarmac at Schiphol airport for four hours, before eventually disembarking. New York Times correspondent Stephanie Nolen, who was on the flight,tweeted that the passengers were not even brought water,externalwhile they remained on the plane. When they were eventually allowed to leave, some passengers shared photos of themselves clustered together in a room with little ventilation. On Saturday, the Dutch health authority said 61 people on the flights had tested positive. Anyone who tested positive would have to quarantine at a hotel for seven days if showing symptoms and for five days if not, it added. Those that tested negative have been asked to isolate at home for five days and take further tests, while those in transit are allowed to continue their journeys. However, there are reports that some passengers have not received written proof of a negative test and are therefore unable to board onward flights.

"Vaughan 'sorry' for ex-cricketer Rafiq's hurtMichael Vaughan is ""sorry for all the hurt"" Azeem Rafiq went through in Yorkshire cricket racism scandal.BBC Sport","This video can not be played Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan speaks to BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker Former England captain Michael Vaughan says he is ""sorry for all the hurt"" Azeem Rafiq has gone through during the Yorkshire racism scandal. Vaughan wasnamed in the Yorkshire reportby ex-team-mate Rafiq, who alleged he made a racist comment to a group of Asian players. In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, Vaughan continued to deny the claim and said he never made racist comments while at Yorkshire. But he admitted his regret at some tweets he had sent in the past. ""It hurts deeply, hurts me that a player has gone through so much be treated so badly at the club that I love,"" Vaughan said. ""I have to take some responsibility for that because I played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club for 18 years and if in any way shape or form I'm responsible for any of his hurt, I apologise for that."" Asked if he ever made any racist comments during his time at Yorkshire, he said: ""No I didn't. No."" Vaughan captained England in Tests between 2003 and 2008. He played his entire domestic career at Yorkshire - between 1993 and 2009 - before becoming a summariser on BBC Test Match Special. In the interview with BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker, Vaughan, who willnot be part of the BBC's Ashes coverage this winter, said: Cricket had a problem with racism it needed to accept. He had never heard racist language used in the dressing room but had heard things that ""are not acceptable now"". He would ""love"" to play a part in helping Yorkshire move forward, alongside Rafiq. He hoped to return to commentating with the BBC next year. Rafiq alleged Vaughan said ""too many of you lot, we need to do something about it"" to him and three other players during a match for Yorkshire in 2009. Rafiq's account was supported by former Pakistan bowlerRana Naved-ul-Hasanand England leg-spinnerAdil Rashid, who said they heard the comment. The fourth player in the group - bowler Ajmal Shahzad - previouslytold the Daily Mail,externalhe had no recollection of the event and ""the senior guys were really good to me"". Vaughan, who did not participate with the original independent investigation, said he did not remember the incident or recognise the words it is claimed he used. ""I just remember it clearly that I was proud as punch that we had four Asian players representing Yorkshire County Cricket Club,"" he said. ""Nothing but a proud, senior, old pro just about to retire and absolutely delighted that Yorkshire had come so far in my time at the club."" Speaking in front of MPs, Rafiq claimed Vaughan might not remember the incident because ""it doesn't mean anything to him"". ""That hurts because I've always felt that every single team that I've been involved in, the biggest praise I've got as England captain for six years was that I was the kind of person that really galvanised the group,"" Vaughan said. ""I always felt that I was the person in the dressing room that really wanted everyone to feel included."" Asked if Rafiq, Rashid and Naved were lying, he said: ""The problem with this situation is that we've got too much 'he said, he said, she said, did they say' and I think we've got to move on from accusations of conversations from many years ago. ""There's a bigger picture here."" Historical Twitter posts by Vaughan have been widely shared on social media in recent weeks. In 2010 he tweeted ""Not many English people live in Londonâ¦ I need to learn a new language"" and in 2017, following the Manchester Arena bombing, he answered ""yes"" to a question whether England all-rounder Moeen Ali should ask Muslims if they are terrorists. Vaughan said he was embarrassed by the tweets and was now a different person. ""I apologise deeply to anyone that I've offended with those tweets,"" Vaughan said. ""Times have moved on and I regret those tweets. We all make mistakes and in my life I've made quite a few mistakes on Twitter, I apologise for that."" Walker:Does it embarrass you when read back those tweets? Vaughan:Yes. Walker:And you feel you're a different person now... Vaughan:Absolutely. Yorkshire players have also been criticised for referring to India batter Cheteshwar Pujara as 'Steve' - something Vaughan brought up on air in 2018, saying ""Steve as they call him in Yorkshire because they can't pronounce his first name"". ""Clearly we're in different times now,"" Vaughan said. ""That was three years ago - that's how much times have moved on in the three years. ""So when you start talking 12 years, 15 years, 20 years, everything is moving so quickly. ""We're in that situation now for the game, sporting dressing rooms not just cricket dressing rooms, where everyone needs to be educated."" Rafiq, who a report found was victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" while at Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018,told a committee of MPs English cricket is ""institutionally racist"". He said racist language, including terms aimed at his and others' Pakistani heritage, was used ""constantly"" and ""never stamped out"" during his time at Yorkshire. Vaughan, who retired during Rafiq's second season as a professional at Yorkshire, said he had never heard racist language used in the dressing room.

Two Omicron cases found in UK,"This video can not be played Watch Sajid Javid set out what action the government is taking Two people in the UK have been found to be infected with the new Covid variant, Omicron, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the cases in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham were confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency after genomic sequencing. They are linked and connected to travel in southern Africa, and both cases and their households were self-isolating. The new variant has also been identified in South Africa, Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is holding a press conference at Downing Street with the chief scientific adviser to the government, Sir Patrick Vallance, and the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty. How worrying is the new Covid variant? Do we need new vaccines yet? South Africans fear impact of new variant measures The new Omicron variant was first reported to the World Health Organization from South Africa on Wednesday.  Early evidence suggests it has a higher re-infection risk. Countries around the world are currently racing to introduce travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread. Ten countries are now on the UK's travel red list meaning, from Sunday at 04:00 GMT, all arrivals will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. On Friday, the UK placed South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini on the list. In his announcement on Saturday, the health secretary said Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia would be added. Mr Javid said: ""If anyone has travelled to these four countries or any of the other red-listed countries in the last 10 days then they must self isolate and take PCR tests."" He said: ""We've always been very clear that we won't hesitate to take further action if that is what is required. ""Today I can announce one thing that we are doing immediately is carrying out targeted testing and sequencing of positive cases in the two areas that are affected."" The Department of Health says testing is being carried out at locations where the positive cases were likely to have been infectious. ""Confirmed cases and contacts are being followed up and requested to isolate and get tested as necessary,"" it said. A spokesperson for Essex County Council said the case identified in Brentwood was ""linked to a single case from Nottingham involving international travel to South Africa"". A ""variant of concern"" is the World Health Organization's top category of worrying Covid variants. The decision adds weight to the mounting scientific worry about the potential of this new variant, but it doesn't change any of the facts. The variant has an astounding collection of mutations which are thought to increase its ability to spread and bypass some, but not all, of the protection from vaccines. However, we still don't have the clear real-world data. We don't know for sure that it spreads faster, makes vaccines or drugs less effective or whether it leads to more severe disease. Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist from the University of Warwick, said the UK cases were ""no surprise"" as ""once a variant is identified, particularly one that is likely to be more infectious, it will have spread beyond the few original cases and countries"". But he said it was ""very likely that current vaccines will protect against severe disease with Omicron as they do for all the previously identified virus variants"". The health secretary said the UK vaccine rollout programme was now ""even more important"". ""We know there's this new variant out there. We don't know enough about it yet but from what we do know, the protections that we have - especially the vaccines - are hugely important,"" he said. Asked about potential changes in Covid restrictions, Mr Javid said: ""We will do whatever is necessary to protect the progress we have made as a country. We've come a long way since the summer and we keep all of this under review and if we need to take further action, we will."" The chief medical adviser said the UK would be working closely with the international community to understand any possible increase in transmissibility or resistance to vaccines. Prof Whitty said: ""It is important that everyone takes sensible precautions - get a PCR test if you have symptoms, isolate when asked, wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces, ventilate rooms, get your vaccine and boosters as soon as you can."" The average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. Afurther 39,567 confirmed cases were announced on Saturday.

Mandatory face masks return to tackle Omicron,"This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson set out new measures after two cases of the Omicron variant were found in the UK Face coverings will become mandatory again in shops and on public transport in England from next week as part of measures to target the new coronavirus variant, Omicron, the PM has said. PCR tests for everyone entering the UK will be introduced and all contacts of new variant cases will have to self-isolate, even if fully jabbed. But Boris Johnson said Christmas would be ""considerably better"" than in 2020. The measures were ""temporary and precautionary"", he added. Mr Johnson announced the restrictions at a Downing Street news conference after it was confirmed that twoOmicron cases had been detected in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham. Officials said the cases were linked and connected to travel in southern Africa. How are England's Covid rules changing because of Omicron? How are masks rules being tightened? The UK's red list is back... which countries are on it? The new variant was first reported from South Africa on Wednesday, with early evidence suggesting it has a higher reinfection risk. Mr Johnson said: ""Our scientists are learning more hour by hour, and it does appear that Omicron spreads very rapidly and can be spread between people who are double vaccinated."" He added: ""We need to slow down the spread of this variant here in the UK, because measures at the border can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new variant rather than stop it all together."" The prime minister said the new measures would be reviewed in three weeks, by which time they should have better information about the ""continuing effectiveness"" of vaccines. The prime minister said the ""tightening up"" of the mask rules will be outlined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid ""in the next day or so"". He did not indicate when PCR tests would begin and in a press release the Department of Health only said it was among the measures being ""introduced from next week"". This video can not be played Watch the BBC's Iain Watson ask the prime minister whether people can keep their Christmas plans Covid restrictions were tightened across the UK days before Christmas last year amid a surge in cases. Asked by the BBC's Iain Watson if the prime minister could say with any confidence whether or not people could keep their Christmas plans this year, Mr Johnson replied: ""We continue to be in a strong position largely thanks to the speed of the vaccine rollout, another booster rollout, and... I'm pretty confident to absolutely confident this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas."" Countries around the world are introducing travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread. Under the plans: Everyone entering the UK (other than those coming from the Common Travel Area that covers the Channel Islands and Ireland) will have to take PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative result All contacts of suspected Omicron cases must self-isolate, regardless of whether or not they are fully jabbed Face coverings will be made compulsory in shops and on public transport - but hospitality settings will be exempt from the changes The health secretary is to ask advisers to consider rapidly extending boosters, including reducing the gap between the second dose of the vaccine and the booster The UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said there was a ""reasonable chance"" that vaccines could be less effective against the new variant but stressed people who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill. He said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation would now need to decide whether to extend the booster vaccine down to adults age 18, and whether a second dose should be offered to children aged 12-15. Do we need new vaccines yet? How worrying is the new Covid variant? The reintroduction of masks in shops and public transportbrings England back into line with the other UK nations. Paddy Lillis from the shopworkers' union Usdaw accused ministers of ""flip-flopping on basic and sensible Covid measures"" and said the face covering rules should have been kept in place when restrictions were relaxed in July. ""Retail staff working with the public every day are deeply worried about catching Covid-19 and the arrival of the Omicron variant is a further concern,"" he said. Carol Popplestone, chairwoman of the Royal College of Nursing, said face coverings were ""something we have already called for and it should not have been a new variant that forced the prime minister to act"". This is a moment the government had wanted to avoid. We've got used to restrictions in England being lifted. But for the first time in months, they're now being re-imposed in response to the new variant. And these restrictions could have a significant impact. For example, anyone who goes on holiday will now need to pay for a PCR test and self-isolate until they get a negative result. If Omicron spreads quickly, there could be a lot of people forced to self-isolate for 10 days as close contacts. But the government hasn't gone for its full plan B. Masks won't be mandatory in hospitality settings in England like they are in Scotland and Wales. People aren't being told to work from home - and there still aren't plans for vaccine passports. But it's a sign of the uncertainty and concern in Whitehall that Boris Johnson felt he had to announce these measures. Both the UK cases of the Omicron variant and their households are self-isolating.  Additional testing is being carried out at locations where those people were likely to have been infectious. ""Confirmed cases and contacts are being followed up and requested to isolate and get tested as necessary,"" the Department of Health said. Ten countries - South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia - are now on theUK's travel red listmeaning, from Sunday at 04:00 GMT, all arrivals will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Other countries are also introducing travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread.

Vaughan 'sorry' for ex-cricketer Rafiq's hurt,"This video can not be played Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan speaks to BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker Former England captain Michael Vaughan says he is ""sorry for all the hurt"" Azeem Rafiq has gone through during the Yorkshire racism scandal. Vaughan wasnamed in the Yorkshire reportby ex-team-mate Rafiq, who alleged he made a racist comment to a group of Asian players. In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, Vaughan continued to deny the claim and said he never made racist comments while at Yorkshire. But he admitted his regret at some tweets he had sent in the past. ""It hurts deeply, hurts me that a player has gone through so much be treated so badly at the club that I love,"" Vaughan said. ""I have to take some responsibility for that because I played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club for 18 years and if in any way shape or form I'm responsible for any of his hurt, I apologise for that."" Asked if he ever made any racist comments during his time at Yorkshire, he said: ""No I didn't. No."" Vaughan captained England in Tests between 2003 and 2008. He played his entire domestic career at Yorkshire - between 1993 and 2009 - before becoming a summariser on BBC Test Match Special. In the interview with BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker, Vaughan, who willnot be part of the BBC's Ashes coverage this winter, said: Cricket had a problem with racism it needed to accept. He had never heard racist language used in the dressing room but had heard things that ""are not acceptable now"". He would ""love"" to play a part in helping Yorkshire move forward, alongside Rafiq. He hoped to return to commentating with the BBC next year. Rafiq alleged Vaughan said ""too many of you lot, we need to do something about it"" to him and three other players during a match for Yorkshire in 2009. Rafiq's account was supported by former Pakistan bowlerRana Naved-ul-Hasanand England leg-spinnerAdil Rashid, who said they heard the comment. The fourth player in the group - bowler Ajmal Shahzad - previouslytold the Daily Mail,externalhe had no recollection of the event and ""the senior guys were really good to me"". Vaughan, who did not participate with the original independent investigation, said he did not remember the incident or recognise the words it is claimed he used. ""I just remember it clearly that I was proud as punch that we had four Asian players representing Yorkshire County Cricket Club,"" he said. ""Nothing but a proud, senior, old pro just about to retire and absolutely delighted that Yorkshire had come so far in my time at the club."" Speaking in front of MPs, Rafiq claimed Vaughan might not remember the incident because ""it doesn't mean anything to him"". ""That hurts because I've always felt that every single team that I've been involved in, the biggest praise I've got as England captain for six years was that I was the kind of person that really galvanised the group,"" Vaughan said. ""I always felt that I was the person in the dressing room that really wanted everyone to feel included."" Asked if Rafiq, Rashid and Naved were lying, he said: ""The problem with this situation is that we've got too much 'he said, he said, she said, did they say' and I think we've got to move on from accusations of conversations from many years ago. ""There's a bigger picture here."" Historical Twitter posts by Vaughan have been widely shared on social media in recent weeks. In 2010 he tweeted ""Not many English people live in Londonâ¦ I need to learn a new language"" and in 2017, following the Manchester Arena bombing, he answered ""yes"" to a question whether England all-rounder Moeen Ali should ask Muslims if they are terrorists. Vaughan said he was embarrassed by the tweets and was now a different person. ""I apologise deeply to anyone that I've offended with those tweets,"" Vaughan said. ""Times have moved on and I regret those tweets. We all make mistakes and in my life I've made quite a few mistakes on Twitter, I apologise for that."" Walker:Does it embarrass you when read back those tweets? Vaughan:Yes. Walker:And you feel you're a different person now... Vaughan:Absolutely. Yorkshire players have also been criticised for referring to India batter Cheteshwar Pujara as 'Steve' - something Vaughan brought up on air in 2018, saying ""Steve as they call him in Yorkshire because they can't pronounce his first name"". ""Clearly we're in different times now,"" Vaughan said. ""That was three years ago - that's how much times have moved on in the three years. ""So when you start talking 12 years, 15 years, 20 years, everything is moving so quickly. ""We're in that situation now for the game, sporting dressing rooms not just cricket dressing rooms, where everyone needs to be educated."" Rafiq, who a report found was victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" while at Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018,told a committee of MPs English cricket is ""institutionally racist"". He said racist language, including terms aimed at his and others' Pakistani heritage, was used ""constantly"" and ""never stamped out"" during his time at Yorkshire. Vaughan, who retired during Rafiq's second season as a professional at Yorkshire, said he had never heard racist language used in the dressing room. ""I heard plenty of things in my 18 years as a player in a dressing room which you would not even consider to be acceptable now,"" he said. ""I would say any sports person that's out there from that era that says otherwise, I don't think they're telling the truth. ""There were things said and back in the day. It wasn't deemed to be offensive. It would be now."" He added: ""I can apologise if I was involved in anyway shape or form with a dressing room that had a culture that wasn't inclusive for everyone. ""My recollections are all the dressing rooms that I played in that we were inclusive to everyone. But I'm more than happy for people to come forward and say you know what that wasn't the case."" The BBC announced last week Vaughan would not be part of its cricket coverage during the Ashes this winter. A statement said ""while he is involved in a significant story in cricket, for editorial reasons we do not believe that it would be appropriate"" for Vaughan to be involved. Vaughan said he ""understood"" the decision and he and the corporation are having ""ongoing conversations"" about his future. ""I just hope in time I get that chance to come back and the one thing that I've loved more than anything since I retired is talking cricket. ""I hope next year I can get back working with the team. ""I love being on Test Match Special and hopefully in time I get the chance to do it again.""

"Mandatory face masks return to tackle new variantBoris Johnson says ""temporary and precautionary"" measures will be introduced to slow the spread of Omicron.UK","This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson set out new measures after two cases of the Omicron variant were found in the UK Face coverings will become mandatory again in shops and on public transport in England from next week as part of measures to target the new coronavirus variant, Omicron, the PM has said. PCR tests for everyone entering the UK will be introduced and all contacts of new variant cases will have to self-isolate, even if fully jabbed. But Boris Johnson said Christmas would be ""considerably better"" than in 2020. The measures were ""temporary and precautionary"", he added. Mr Johnson announced the restrictions at a Downing Street news conference after it was confirmed that twoOmicron cases had been detected in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham. Officials said the cases were linked and connected to travel in southern Africa. How are England's Covid rules changing because of Omicron? How are masks rules being tightened? The UK's red list is back... which countries are on it? The new variant was first reported from South Africa on Wednesday, with early evidence suggesting it has a higher reinfection risk. Mr Johnson said: ""Our scientists are learning more hour by hour, and it does appear that Omicron spreads very rapidly and can be spread between people who are double vaccinated."" He added: ""We need to slow down the spread of this variant here in the UK, because measures at the border can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new variant rather than stop it all together."" The prime minister said the new measures would be reviewed in three weeks, by which time they should have better information about the ""continuing effectiveness"" of vaccines. The prime minister said the ""tightening up"" of the mask rules will be outlined by Health Secretary Sajid Javid ""in the next day or so"". He did not indicate when PCR tests would begin and in a press release the Department of Health only said it was among the measures being ""introduced from next week"". This video can not be played Watch the BBC's Iain Watson ask the prime minister whether people can keep their Christmas plans Covid restrictions were tightened across the UK days before Christmas last year amid a surge in cases. Asked by the BBC's Iain Watson if the prime minister could say with any confidence whether or not people could keep their Christmas plans this year, Mr Johnson replied: ""We continue to be in a strong position largely thanks to the speed of the vaccine rollout, another booster rollout, and... I'm pretty confident to absolutely confident this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas."" Countries around the world are introducing travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread. Under the plans: Everyone entering the UK (other than those coming from the Common Travel Area that covers the Channel Islands and Ireland) will have to take PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative result All contacts of suspected Omicron cases must self-isolate, regardless of whether or not they are fully jabbed Face coverings will be made compulsory in shops and on public transport - but hospitality settings will be exempt from the changes The health secretary is to ask advisers to consider rapidly extending boosters, including reducing the gap between the second dose of the vaccine and the booster The UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said there was a ""reasonable chance"" that vaccines could be less effective against the new variant but stressed people who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill. He said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation would now need to decide whether to extend the booster vaccine down to adults age 18, and whether a second dose should be offered to children aged 12-15. Do we need new vaccines yet? How worrying is the new Covid variant? The reintroduction of masks in shops and public transportbrings England back into line with the other UK nations. Paddy Lillis from the shopworkers' union Usdaw accused ministers of ""flip-flopping on basic and sensible Covid measures"" and said the face covering rules should have been kept in place when restrictions were relaxed in July. ""Retail staff working with the public every day are deeply worried about catching Covid-19 and the arrival of the Omicron variant is a further concern,"" he said. Carol Popplestone, chairwoman of the Royal College of Nursing, said face coverings were ""something we have already called for and it should not have been a new variant that forced the prime minister to act"". This is a moment the government had wanted to avoid. We've got used to restrictions in England being lifted. But for the first time in months, they're now being re-imposed in response to the new variant. And these restrictions could have a significant impact. For example, anyone who goes on holiday will now need to pay for a PCR test and self-isolate until they get a negative result. If Omicron spreads quickly, there could be a lot of people forced to self-isolate for 10 days as close contacts. But the government hasn't gone for its full plan B. Masks won't be mandatory in hospitality settings in England like they are in Scotland and Wales. People aren't being told to work from home - and there still aren't plans for vaccine passports. But it's a sign of the uncertainty and concern in Whitehall that Boris Johnson felt he had to announce these measures. Both the UK cases of the Omicron variant and their households are self-isolating.  Additional testing is being carried out at locations where those people were likely to have been infectious. ""Confirmed cases and contacts are being followed up and requested to isolate and get tested as necessary,"" the Department of Health said. Ten countries - South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia - are now on theUK's travel red listmeaning, from Sunday at 04:00 GMT, all arrivals will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Other countries are also introducing travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain the variant's spread. The average number of daily confirmed Covid cases in the UK began rising again in early November. Afurther 39,567 confirmed cases were announced on Saturday.

We don't know enough about it yet but from what we do know, the protections that we have - especially the vaccines - are hugely important,"" he said. Asked about potential changes in Covid restrictions, Mr Javid said: ""We will do whatever is necessary to protect the progress we have made as a country. We've come a long way since the summer and we keep all of this under review and if we need to take further action, we will."" The chief medical adviser said the UK would be working closely with the international community to understand any possible increase in transmissibility or resistance to vaccines. Prof Whitty said: ""It is important that everyone takes sensible precautions - get a PCR test if you have symptoms, isolate when asked, wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces, ventilate rooms, get your vaccine and boosters as soon as you can.""

Kurdish woman is first Channel victim to be namedMaryam Nuri Mohamed Amin was a 24-year-old Kurdish woman from northern Iraq.,"This video can not be played Watch: The family and friends of Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin react to her death A 24-year-old Kurdish woman from northern Iraq has become the first victim of this week's mass drowning in the Channel to be identified. Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin was one of 27 people who died while attempting to cross to Britain on Wednesday. Her fiancÃ©, who lives in the UK, told the BBC she was messaging him as the group's dinghy started deflating. She tried to reassure him that they would be rescued. But help came too late, and she and 17 men, six other women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children died after their inflatable boat sank into the sea off the northern French coast. There were only two survivors - an Iraqi and a Somali. The disaster marked the biggest loss of life by drowning in the Channel in many years. Her fiancÃ© said Maryam, nicknamed Baran, had been on the boat with a female relative. He had not known beforehand about the attempted Channel crossing and said Maryam's arrival in the UK was supposed to be a surprise. They were messaging each other on Snapchat just before the dinghy began to lose air, he said. Maryam told him that the boat was deflating and that they were trying to get the water out of it. He said she had been trying to reassure him in her last message, and give him hope that the authorities were on their way to rescue them. What's being done to stop Channel crossings? Why do migrants leave France for the UK? The migrant debate can't escape European politics Reports from Calais say the two survivors of Wednesday's sinking have been discharged from hospital and are due to be questioned about how many people were on the boat. Maryam's uncle confirmed to the BBC that she was one of the people who drowned in the English Channel. He said the family heard the news from two people who were with her, and the family were waiting for her body to be flown back to Iraq. Maryam's family said she had tried to reach the UK legally twice and that she had been to the British embassy but the process was ""delayed"", forcing her instead to take the route she did. Nuri Hamadamin, Maryam's father, told the BBC: ""The whole world talks about Europe as a place that is calm, that is pleasant, is this what calm means? Around 30 people dying in the middle of the sea? ""This is a sin to put people through this."" On Friday night her father, family and friends gathered at their home in northern Iraq to share their grief and remember her. Maryam's best friend Imann Hassan said that her friend was ""very humble"" and had ""a very big heart"". ""When she left Kurdistan she was very happy, she couldn't believe that she was going to meet her husband,"" Ms Hassan told the BBC on Friday night. ""At her engagement party she was telling me: 'I will buy a house and live nearby you ... we are going to live together.'"" Ms Hassan said that she wanted to send a message to the world ""that no one deserves to die likes this"". ""She tried to live a better life, she chose the UK, but she died.""

Expert seeks answer on pre-Grenfell cladding testsAn industry expert believes the Grenfell cladding was among products to fail fire tests 13 years earlier.UK,"Tests similar to this one showed the dangers of cladding in the early 2000s, it has emerged A fire safety expert is demanding ministers reveal whether ""highly dangerous"" cladding, secretly tested in the early 2000s, was the product used at Grenfell Tower. In September, the BBC uncovered details ofcladding products that failed safety tests some 13 years beforethe blaze. Dr Jonathan Evans believes among these was the aluminium and plastic cladding that spread the 2017 London fire. The government says a planned new law will improve building safety. Industry expert Dr Evans, a member of the British Standard 8414 committee set up to review the standards of testing, has written to Housing Secretary Michael Gove, demanding confirmation of his conclusions. ""There couldn't have been a clearer warning,"" he wrote. What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell cladding not 'uniquely dangerous' A document dated 2004 and leaked to the BBC detailed tests carried out in about 2002, on five unnamed cladding systems, all of which failed to meet the required standard. Dr Evans says the third system tested, produced results ""strikingly similar"" to the tests carried out on the Grenfell cladding after the fire in June 2017, as the government scrambled to understand the scale of the building safety crisis. The leaked document describes the system as ""aluminium"". Dr Evans notes that the Grenfell cladding was aluminium with a layer of plastic which was highly flammable. The supplier of the cladding panels used at Grenfell was Arconic (formerly Alcoa), a multinational metals manufacturer. The product name was Reynobond 55PE. Dr Evans points to the similar pattern in graphs of the way the temperatures rose in each test, suggesting they were conducted on the same product. In September, the Conservative government described the 2002 tests, carried out when Labour was in power, as ""experiments"" that were not designed to test the intrinsic safety of the products, but the criteria for the tests themselves. In his letter to Mr Gove, Dr Evans said the tests ""show that the State was specifically aware of how deadly cladding materials such as ACM [aluminium composite material] can be"". ""It was a clear forewarning of what would happen at Grenfell 15 years later, killing 72 people. It should have been avoided - there couldn't have been a clearer warning. ""Firefighters and residents have been in peril for many years due to the failure to heed the warnings of this test."" Dr Evans said there should never have been a policy of telling residents to ""stay put"" when fires broke out, if they were living in buildings with this sort of flammable aluminium cladding. Grenfell's ""stay put"" advice has been partially blamed for the high loss of life in the disaster. The Grenfell Tower public inquiry is expected to examine the earlier tests closely, and ask the Building Research Establishment, which carried them out, what was tested. Dr Evans said if the government had evidence of the risks of aluminium composite cladding, and did not take action to prevent it being used, the government should now fully fund the cost of removing it from buildings. United for Grenfell protesters wait for answers from the government, four years after the fatal fire at Grenfell Tower. The government has announced Â£5bn in funding to make buildings safe, but experts believe far more is needed. ""Without doubt,"" Dr Evans wrote to Michael Gove, ""observing this 2002 test would have been a shocking experience"", and the fact the third system tested allowed flames to spread ""should have been obvious"" to people watching the test, and those receiving the report of it. This document - dated 2004 and passed to the BBC in Sept 2021 - was marked ""commercial in confidence"" and never made public. The report's significance was ""either missed completely, or deliberately ignored... in a culture which permitted the use of cheaper materials,"" Dr Evans wrote. The leaked document was passed to the Grenfell Tower public inquiry following the BBC's story. In response, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said its Building Safety Bill would make the biggest improvements to building safety in 40 years, ""where successive governments have failed... with more rights and protections for residents and a Â£5bn investment to remove unsafe cladding. ""The new Building Safety Regulator will enforce a more stringent regulatory regime for buildings over 18m and oversee the safety and performance of all buildings, ensuring products are removed from the market if they do not meet regulation.""

South Africans fear impact,"Travellers to London from Johannesburg were being tested on Friday morning but flights have now been suspended South Africans have responded sharply to the news that the UK, and a growing list of other countries, have reacted to the emergence of a new Covid variant with red-listings and travel bans. While there is genuine pride here in the country's scientific expertise, and the speed with which South Africa has been able to identify and share information about new variants, there is also a strong sense that the nation is being unfairly punished for its successes. ""The world should provide support to South Africa and Africa and not discriminate or isolate it,"" said Prof Tulio de Oliveira, the Durban-based scientist leading efforts to understand the new variant. In a series of tweets,external, he pointed out that South Africa has been ""very transparent with scientific information. We did this to protect our country and the world in spite of potentially suffering massive discrimination."" South Africa has a sophisticated monitoring infrastructure that allows it to do the sequencing work effectively. Prof de Oliveira urged ""billionaires and financial institutions"" to help the country cope with the economic damage caused by new travel restrictions. South Africa's Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor was also quick to condemn the UK's travel ban, describing it as ""rushed"" and damaging to tourism and business, and urging the UK government ""to reconsider this decision"". News of the flight bans has caused inevitable frustration among many South Africans who had hoped to see visiting friends and family over the southern hemisphere summer holidays in December. South Africa was one of the last countries to have previously been removed from the red list last month. This video can not be played Travellers at Cape Town airport respond to new UK quarantine measures over Covid variant ""It's absolutely ridiculous that they've imposed it again so quickly without investigating this new variant,"" said one woman waiting for arrivals from London at Cape Town's international airport this morning. ""My sister just got on the flight [from London] but I think she'll be staying here for a long time. We were just getting on our feet again with tourism, and this is going to just kill it."" ""The new ban is a knee-jerk reaction of the UK government that puts airlines, hotels, travel businesses and travellers in a very difficult situation,'' said Otto de Vries, CEO of South Africa's travel agents' association, Asata. One industry analysis estimated that South Africa lost 26 million rand ($1.6m; Â£1.2m) for every day it spent on the UK's red list. ""The UK being our largest inbound international market, last night's news by the British government has caused widespread disbelief and disappointment amongst our hospitality industry as we enter our peak festive season period,"" said Rosemary Anderson, national chairperson of the Federated Hospitality Association of South Africa. Overall, tourism employs 2.8 million people and in 2018 it earned the country about $8bn (Â£6bn). The variant was first sequenced in neighbouring Botswana, and then in South Africa's capital, Pretoria. That was where a group of students, exactly how many is not known, took PCR tests which all contained an anomaly that prompted experts to send their samples to Prof de Oliviera's Durban laboratory for genome sequencing. ""His team then found all these mutations. So we've only know about it for a few days, and because it's a new variant we have no idea how it will actually behave,"" said Prof Salim Karim, former chair of the South African government's Covid advisory committee. ""All we can do is extrapolate some of the likely behaviour based on previous similar mutations. But we do know that it spreads fast - we've seen how rapidly it spread in Pretoria. It sky-rocketed."" From a relatively low base, the numbers of confirmed cases in South Africa have shot up this week - from less than 700 on Sunday to almost 2,500 on Thursday. It is believed the increase is largely down to the new variant. South Africa's vaccination programme has slowed in recent months - not because of a lack of supplies, but due to public indifference. An estimated 42% of the population has had at least one jab. But roughly two-thirds of those aged over 60 have been vaccinated. Experts are hopeful that the variant may help encourage more people to get jabbed. The government has urged people to come forward, saying: ""Let us crush the power of the new variant by vaccinating to limit the number of mutations."" ""It's going to be a shock to the system. I think it can have a positive effect [on vaccination rates],"" said Stavros Nicolaou, senior executive at Aspen Pharmacare Group. ""We know this variant is more contagious. My sense is that the current vaccines are likely to reduce morbidity. They might not be as effective in terms of preventing people getting infected. All the more reason, if you've got a more contagious variant, that you should go out and get vaccinated."" The bigger concern is the potential impact of the variant if it spreads to other parts of the continent where, on average, roughly 3% of the population has been vaccinated.

Dozens test positive on SA-Netherlands flightsThe results are being examined for cases of the new Omicron variant emerging in southern Africa.Europe,"Sixty-one people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa have tested positive for Covid-19, Dutch officials say. They have been placed in isolation at a hotel near Schiphol airport. They were among some 600 passengers held for several hours after arrival while they were tested for the virus. Dutch health authorities said Omicron, labelled on Friday as a variant of concern, was ""probably found in a number of people"" who tested positive. Other European countries, including the UK and Germany, have confirmed cases of the Omicron variant. The variant was first reported to the World Health Organization from South Africa on Wednesday, with early evidence suggesting it has a higher re-infection risk. Many countries around the world have restricted travel from the southern African region. Meanwhile, the Netherlands is one of several European countries struggling to contain record numbers of infections. A partial lockdown will be extended on Sunday, with all hospitality and cultural venues forced to close between 17:00 and 05:00, at least until 19 December. The flights by Dutch national carrier KLM from Johannesburg arrived at 10:30 and 11:00 local time (09:30 and 10:00 GMT) on Friday. The Dutch government had by then already restricted travel from the region because of the new variant and arranged for the passengers to be tested and isolated. South Africans fear impact of new variant measures How worrying is the new Covid variant? Some expressed frustration about being kept on the plane without food or drink. Passengers travelling from Cape Town to Manchester via Amsterdam told the BBC that they were held on the tarmac at Schiphol airport for four hours, before eventually disembarking. New York Times correspondent Stephanie Nolen, who was on the flight,tweeted that the passengers were not even brought water,externalwhile they remained on the plane. When they were eventually allowed to leave, some passengers shared photos of themselves clustered together in a room with little ventilation. On Saturday, the Dutch health authority said 61 people on the flights had tested positive. Anyone who tested positive would have to quarantine at a hotel for seven days if showing symptoms and for five days if not, it added. Those that tested negative have been asked to isolate at home for five days and take further tests, while those in transit are allowed to continue their journeys. However, there are reports that some passengers have not received written proof of a negative test and are therefore unable to board onward flights.

"Swinney claims Johnson wants to 'take back powers'Scotland's deputy first minister John Swinney will urge the SNP conference to ""stand up"" in defence of devolution.Scotland politics","John Swinney address SNP activists at an online conference Boris Johnson secretly wants to take back powers from the UK's devolved parliaments, Scotland's deputy first minister has told the SNP conference. John Swinney urged delegates to ""stand up and be counted before it's too late"" to defend devolution. His comments were dismissed as ""simply nonsense"" by the UK government. The conference, which is being held online, started on Friday and will end with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's speech on Monday. In his virtual speech on Saturday afternoon, Mr Swinney told members that the UK government wanted ""unfettered Westminster control on Scotland"" and was using Brexit to undermine devolution. SNP opens four-day virtual party conference Has Sturgeon delivered on her conference pledges? He argued that ""the only way to keep the gains of devolution is by becoming independent"" and suggested that decisions made at Holyrood ""can be routinely undermined at a whim by the Tories"". Mr Swinney said: ""We are now seeing a concerted attack on our parliament, from the very people who fought tooth and nail against it being established in the first place. ""In a grotesque irony, the Tories are using something that the people of Scotland voted overwhelmingly against - Brexit - to undermine something they voted overwhelmingly for - the Scottish Parliament. ""Through the Internal Market Act, the Tories have given themselves unfettered power to decide the rules of the internal market - and to completely ignore the devolution settlement if they want to."" The UK government denies that Mr Johnson wishes to reverse the devolution settlement Claiming that the prime minister could wish to reverse devolution, Mr Swinney added: ""There will be no sudden Big Bang moment, Boris Johnson is not going to stand up and announce to the cheering Tory faithful that he is dismantling the devolution settlement - much as I am sure he would like to. ""But make no mistake - piece by piece, devolution is quietly being filleted, hollowed out from the inside by a Tory Party which has always opposed the idea of anything other than unfettered Westminster control on Scotland. ""Much like the climate emergency, which is slowly creeping up on us every single day - we need to issue a code red for devolution. ""All of us who care so deeply about the Scottish Parliament and its role in Scottish public life need to stand up and be counted before it is too late."" The conference featured debates on issues including children's rights, street harassment against women and an independent Scottish civil service on Saturday. Responding to Ms Swinney's remarks, a UK government spokeswoman said: ""This is simply nonsense. ""The Internal Market Bill ensures that vital trade can continue seamlessly between all four corners of the UK. ""Now more than ever, people in Scotland want to see the UK and Scottish governments working together to protect lives and livelihoods. ""The pandemic, and our collective response - from the furlough scheme to vaccine procurement and the backing of our military personnel - has shown that we are at our strongest when we work together.""

Vaughan 'sorry' for Rafiq's hurt,"This video can not be played Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan speaks to BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker Former England captain Michael Vaughan says he is ""sorry for all the hurt"" Azeem Rafiq has gone through during the Yorkshire racism scandal. Vaughan wasnamed in the Yorkshire reportby ex-team-mate Rafiq, who alleged he made a racist comment to a group of Asian players. In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, Vaughan continued to deny the claim and said he never made racist comments while at Yorkshire. But he admitted his regret at some tweets he had sent in the past. ""It hurts deeply, hurts me that a player has gone through so much be treated so badly at the club that I love,"" Vaughan said. ""I have to take some responsibility for that because I played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club for 18 years and if in any way shape or form I'm responsible for any of his hurt, I apologise for that."" Asked if he ever made any racist comments during his time at Yorkshire, he said: ""No I didn't. No."" Vaughan captained England in Tests between 2003 and 2008. He played his entire domestic career at Yorkshire - between 1993 and 2009 - before becoming a summariser on BBC Test Match Special. In the interview with BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker, Vaughan, who willnot be part of the BBC's Ashes coverage this winter, said: Cricket had a problem with racism it needed to accept. He had never heard racist language used in the dressing room but had heard things that ""are not acceptable now"". He would ""love"" to play a part in helping Yorkshire move forward, alongside Rafiq. He hoped to return to commentating with the BBC next year. Rafiq alleged Vaughan said ""too many of you lot, we need to do something about it"" to him and three other players during a match for Yorkshire in 2009. Rafiq's account was supported by former Pakistan bowlerRana Naved-ul-Hasanand England leg-spinnerAdil Rashid, who said they heard the comment. The fourth player in the group - bowler Ajmal Shahzad - previouslytold the Daily Mail,externalhe had no recollection of the event and ""the senior guys were really good to me"". Vaughan, who did not participate with the original independent investigation, said he did not remember the incident or recognise the words it is claimed he used. ""I just remember it clearly that I was proud as punch that we had four Asian players representing Yorkshire County Cricket Club,"" he said. ""Nothing but a proud, senior, old pro just about to retire and absolutely delighted that Yorkshire had come so far in my time at the club."" Speaking in front of MPs, Rafiq claimed Vaughan might not remember the incident because ""it doesn't mean anything to him"". ""That hurts because I've always felt that every single team that I've been involved in, the biggest praise I've got as England captain for six years was that I was the kind of person that really galvanised the group,"" Vaughan said. ""I always felt that I was the person in the dressing room that really wanted everyone to feel included."" Asked if Rafiq, Rashid and Naved were lying, he said: ""The problem with this situation is that we've got too much 'he said, he said, she said, did they say' and I think we've got to move on from accusations of conversations from many years ago. ""There's a bigger picture here."" Historical Twitter posts by Vaughan have been widely shared on social media in recent weeks. In 2010 he tweeted ""Not many English people live in Londonâ¦ I need to learn a new language"" and in 2017, following the Manchester Arena bombing, he answered ""yes"" to a question whether England all-rounder Moeen Ali should ask Muslims if they are terrorists. Vaughan said he was embarrassed by the tweets and was now a different person. ""I apologise deeply to anyone that I've offended with those tweets,"" Vaughan said. ""Times have moved on and I regret those tweets. We all make mistakes and in my life I've made quite a few mistakes on Twitter, I apologise for that."" Walker:Does it embarrass you when read back those tweets? Vaughan:Yes. Walker:And you feel you're a different person now... Vaughan:Absolutely. Yorkshire players have also been criticised for referring to India batter Cheteshwar Pujara as 'Steve' - something Vaughan brought up on air in 2018, saying ""Steve as they call him in Yorkshire because they can't pronounce his first name"". ""Clearly we're in different times now,"" Vaughan said. ""That was three years ago - that's how much times have moved on in the three years. ""So when you start talking 12 years, 15 years, 20 years, everything is moving so quickly. ""We're in that situation now for the game, sporting dressing rooms not just cricket dressing rooms, where everyone needs to be educated."" Rafiq, who a report found was victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" while at Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018,told a committee of MPs English cricket is ""institutionally racist"". He said racist language, including terms aimed at his and others' Pakistani heritage, was used ""constantly"" and ""never stamped out"" during his time at Yorkshire. Vaughan, who retired during Rafiq's second season as a professional at Yorkshire, said he had never heard racist language used in the dressing room. ""I heard plenty of things in my 18 years as a player in a dressing room which you would not even consider to be acceptable now,"" he said. ""I would say any sports person that's out there from that era that says otherwise, I don't think they're telling the truth. ""There were things said and back in the day. It wasn't deemed to be offensive. It would be now."" He added: ""I can apologise if I was involved in anyway shape or form with a dressing room that had a culture that wasn't inclusive for everyone. ""My recollections are all the dressing rooms that I played in that we were inclusive to everyone. But I'm more than happy for people to come forward and say you know what that wasn't the case."" The BBC announced last week Vaughan would not be part of its cricket coverage during the Ashes this winter. A statement said ""while he is involved in a significant story in cricket, for editorial reasons we do not believe that it would be appropriate"" for Vaughan to be involved. Vaughan said he ""understood"" the decision and he and the corporation are having ""ongoing conversations"" about his future. ""I just hope in time I get that chance to come back and the one thing that I've loved more than anything since I retired is talking cricket. ""I hope next year I can get back working with the team. ""I love being on Test Match Special and hopefully in time I get the chance to do it again.""

US joins EU in restricting southern Africa flights,"The US will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other southern African countries to try to contain a new coronavirus variant spreading there. From Monday, only US citizens and residents will be allowed to travel from the region. This follows similar restrictions imposed by the EU and the UK. Canada is also introducing travel restrictions. The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier declared the new variant to be ""of concern"", naming it Omicron. US officials said travellers from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi will be blocked, mirroring earlier moves taken by the EU. The ban will come into effect on Monday. In a statement, President Joe Biden called the move a ""precautionary measure"" taken until more is known about the variant. Canada is also shutting its borders to foreign travellers who have recently been to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Foreign citizens will be banned from Canada if they have been to the seven nations in the past 14 days. The Omicron variant was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on 24 November, and has since been identified in other countries. South Africa's health ministry has criticised the rush to impose new travel restrictions, calling them ""draconian"", and contrary to WHO guidance. Scientists say they still have much to learn about the virus's new mutations, and the WHO has said it will take a few weeks to understand the impact of the new variant, as experts work to determine how transmissible it is. The WHO on Friday said preliminary evidence suggested the new variant carried a higher risk of reinfection than other variants. Scientists have said it is the most heavily mutated version yet, which means Covid vaccines, which were designed using the original strain from Wuhan, China, may not be as effective. What do we know about the new variant so far? South Africans fear impact of new variant measures Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The WHO says so far fewer than 100 sample sequences have been reported. Cases have mainly been confirmed in South Africa, but have also been detected in Hong Kong, Israel, Botswana and Belgium. Most of the cases in South Africa have been from its most populated province, Gauteng, of which Johannesburg is the capital city. The UK's red list is back... which countries are on it?

But health officials in the Netherlands warned that passengers on two KLM flights from South Africa to Amsterdam on Friday were likely infected. Tests were being done to determine whether it could be the new variant. Passengers travelling from Cape Town to Manchester via Amsterdam told the BBC that they were held on the tarmac at Schiphol Airport in the Dutch capital for four hours, before eventually disembarking to take PCR tests. Meanwhile, the flight bans threaten to separate families over the festive season. Ruth Daines-Slack, 70, had booked to fly from Cape Town to the UK next week for Christmas and her mother's 100th birthday celebration.She told the BBC she is ""beyond devastated""that she will no longer be able to make the trip, adding that the UK's travel ban is a ""knee-jerk reaction"".

Kurdish woman is first Channel victim to be namedMaryam Nuri Mohamed Amin was a 24-year-old Kurdish woman from northern Iraq.Europe,"This video can not be played Watch: The family and friends of Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin react to her death A 24-year-old Kurdish woman from northern Iraq has become the first victim of this week's mass drowning in the Channel to be identified. Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin was one of 27 people who died while attempting to cross to Britain on Wednesday. Her fiancÃ©, who lives in the UK, told the BBC she was messaging him as the group's dinghy started deflating. She tried to reassure him that they would be rescued. But help came too late, and she and 17 men, six other women - one of whom was pregnant - and three children died after their inflatable boat sank into the sea off the northern French coast. There were only two survivors - an Iraqi and a Somali. The disaster marked the biggest loss of life by drowning in the Channel in many years. Her fiancÃ© said Maryam, nicknamed Baran, had been on the boat with a female relative. He had not known beforehand about the attempted Channel crossing and said Maryam's arrival in the UK was supposed to be a surprise. They were messaging each other on Snapchat just before the dinghy began to lose air, he said. Maryam told him that the boat was deflating and that they were trying to get the water out of it. He said she had been trying to reassure him in her last message, and give him hope that the authorities were on their way to rescue them. What's being done to stop Channel crossings? Why do migrants leave France for the UK? The migrant debate can't escape European politics Reports from Calais say the two survivors of Wednesday's sinking have been discharged from hospital and are due to be questioned about how many people were on the boat. Maryam's uncle confirmed to the BBC that she was one of the people who drowned in the English Channel. He said the family heard the news from two people who were with her, and the family were waiting for her body to be flown back to Iraq. Maryam's family said she had tried to reach the UK legally twice and that she had been to the British embassy but the process was ""delayed"", forcing her instead to take the route she did. Nuri Hamadamin, Maryam's father, told the BBC: ""The whole world talks about Europe as a place that is calm, that is pleasant, is this what calm means? Around 30 people dying in the middle of the sea? ""This is a sin to put people through this."" On Friday night her father, family and friends gathered at their home in northern Iraq to share their grief and remember her. Maryam's best friend Imann Hassan said that her friend was ""very humble"" and had ""a very big heart"". ""When she left Kurdistan she was very happy, she couldn't believe that she was going to meet her husband,"" Ms Hassan told the BBC on Friday night. ""At her engagement party she was telling me: 'I will buy a house and live nearby you ... we are going to live together.'"" Ms Hassan said that she wanted to send a message to the world ""that no one deserves to die likes this"". ""She tried to live a better life, she chose the UK, but she died.""

Swiss vote on ending restrictions amid Covid surge,"Anti-vaccination protesters have taken to the streets of Bern ahead of the vote Swiss voters have backed the government's measures to tackle Covid, according to preliminary results. More than 60% opposed moves to remove some restrictions, including the Covid vaccination pass. Sunday's referendum came after organisers said the pass was an unnecessary restriction of freedoms. With just under two-thirds of the population fully vaccinated, the Swiss have one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe. Now, Covid-19 infections are rising exponentially, with case numbers up by 40-50% each week. From the start of the pandemic the Swiss government has performed a tricky balancing act, trying to introduce measures to control the spread of Covid while still staying true to Switzerland's system of direct democracy, in which the government has little formal power and the people have the final say. Yes-campaign posters urge the Swiss not to forget to vote to back the Covid law Switzerland's lockdowns were never as strict as its neighbours'. People were allowed outside for exercise whenever they wanted and the schools only closed for a few weeks. But last summer, with cases falling dramatically, Switzerland didn't have a celebratory, UK-style ""freedom"" day either. Instead, a Covid certificate was introduced with proof of vaccination, negative test, or immunity through having had the virus. In September it became obligatory in order to enter bars, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sporting events, and face-to-face university classes. But not everyone agrees. Vaccination has long been a sensitive issue here, especially in German-speaking Switzerland. A belief that natural immunity is best led to a drop in childhood measles vaccinations that sparked a surge in measles cases across Europe. Meanwhile, in the alpine communities, a historic pride in their own independence rooted, some say, in the time when the mountain villages were cut off from the world each winter, means there is resistance to the government issuing orders. And so, when the certificate was introduced and Covid tests stopped being free, life for the unvaccinated became difficult and even going out for a beer was suddenly expensive. The government hoped the measures would encourage people to get vaccinated. Instead, many took to the streets and others gathered enough signatures to challenge the Covid certificate in Sunday's referendum. No campaigners this week urged voters to reject the Covid laws For weeks there have been demonstrations. Some have turned violent, with police using water cannons and rubber bullets against protesters trying to storm parliament. At a rally in Bern this month, thousands turned out to hear speakers, including renowned anti-vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr, who hailed Switzerland as Europe's last great hope against what he claimed were sinister powers forcing people to get vaccinated, while at the same time, via the Covid certificate, introducing a draconian mass surveillance system. Robert F Kennedy Jr has called on voters to challenge the Swiss anti-Covid measures The crowd, huddled together, all mask-less, roared their approval. Some wore the insignia of the far right, others the far left. Health minister Alain Berset was depicted, complete with red horns, as the devil. How fast is worldwide progress? Among the crowds was part-time student Manuela. She refuses to get vaccinated because, she says, she is ""a healthy young woman"" for whom getting the virus poses little risk. In fact, the World Health Organization advises that, while young people are less likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19,they are still susceptible to infection,external, and with it the risk of serious and long term health consequences. And so, for fear of increasing opposition to the Covid certificate, the health minister was loath to introduce any new restrictions ahead of Sunday's crucial vote. Alain Berset and his science taskforce are convinced Switzerland needs infection control measures during this increasingly bleak Covid winter. Abolishing the certificate, they believe, could be a huge risk, especially as booster vaccinations have scarcely begun. Instead, as cases rise, the government has advised hospitals to increase their intensive care capacity. This has brought a bitter laugh from Switzerland's nurses, who point out that extra beds won't help when there aren't enough staff to look after the patients in them. It's estimated 10% of Swiss nurses and care workers have left the profession since the start of the pandemic. ""Everywhere we have too few staff,"" says MichÃ¨le Giroud, a nurse who's also president of the Swiss Federation of Nurse Anaesthetists. ""We are constantly working without breaks, doing overtime, extra shifts. A third of us have burn-out symptoms: anxiety or insomnia."" But unlike in other European countries going through similar health sector shortages, Swiss nurses have the power to change things. They have gathered the signatures for a nationwide referendum demanding more investment and better working conditions. On Sunday, Swiss voters backed them. So now the health minister will return to the grim business of counting the rising Covid cases, and he is likely to start thinking about what new restrictions might be necessary. He may also have to count out around CHF8bn (Â£6bn) for Switzerland's nurses. But the anger, fear and social division born of the pandemic cannot be solved by a referendum or two, and the demonstrations are sure to continue, in Switzerland and across Europe.

Expert seeks answer on pre-Grenfell cladding tests,"Tests similar to this one showed the dangers of cladding in the early 2000s, it has emerged A fire safety expert is demanding ministers reveal whether ""highly dangerous"" cladding, secretly tested in the early 2000s, was the product used at Grenfell Tower. In September, the BBC uncovered details ofcladding products that failed safety tests some 13 years beforethe blaze. Dr Jonathan Evans believes among these was the aluminium and plastic cladding that spread the 2017 London fire. The government says a planned new law will improve building safety. Industry expert Dr Evans, a member of the British Standard 8414 committee set up to review the standards of testing, has written to Housing Secretary Michael Gove, demanding confirmation of his conclusions. ""There couldn't have been a clearer warning,"" he wrote. What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell cladding not 'uniquely dangerous' A document dated 2004 and leaked to the BBC detailed tests carried out in about 2002, on five unnamed cladding systems, all of which failed to meet the required standard. Dr Evans says the third system tested, produced results ""strikingly similar"" to the tests carried out on the Grenfell cladding after the fire in June 2017, as the government scrambled to understand the scale of the building safety crisis. The leaked document describes the system as ""aluminium"". Dr Evans notes that the Grenfell cladding was aluminium with a layer of plastic which was highly flammable. The supplier of the cladding panels used at Grenfell was Arconic (formerly Alcoa), a multinational metals manufacturer. The product name was Reynobond 55PE. Dr Evans points to the similar pattern in graphs of the way the temperatures rose in each test, suggesting they were conducted on the same product. In September, the Conservative government described the 2002 tests, carried out when Labour was in power, as ""experiments"" that were not designed to test the intrinsic safety of the products, but the criteria for the tests themselves. In his letter to Mr Gove, Dr Evans said the tests ""show that the State was specifically aware of how deadly cladding materials such as ACM [aluminium composite material] can be"". ""It was a clear forewarning of what would happen at Grenfell 15 years later, killing 72 people. It should have been avoided - there couldn't have been a clearer warning. ""Firefighters and residents have been in peril for many years due to the failure to heed the warnings of this test."" Dr Evans said there should never have been a policy of telling residents to ""stay put"" when fires broke out, if they were living in buildings with this sort of flammable aluminium cladding. Grenfell's ""stay put"" advice has been partially blamed for the high loss of life in the disaster. The Grenfell Tower public inquiry is expected to examine the earlier tests closely, and ask the Building Research Establishment, which carried them out, what was tested. Dr Evans said if the government had evidence of the risks of aluminium composite cladding, and did not take action to prevent it being used, the government should now fully fund the cost of removing it from buildings. United for Grenfell protesters wait for answers from the government, four years after the fatal fire at Grenfell Tower. The government has announced Â£5bn in funding to make buildings safe, but experts believe far more is needed. ""Without doubt,"" Dr Evans wrote to Michael Gove, ""observing this 2002 test would have been a shocking experience"", and the fact the third system tested allowed flames to spread ""should have been obvious"" to people watching the test, and those receiving the report of it. This document - dated 2004 and passed to the BBC in Sept 2021 - was marked ""commercial in confidence"" and never made public. The report's significance was ""either missed completely, or deliberately ignored... in a culture which permitted the use of cheaper materials,"" Dr Evans wrote. The leaked document was passed to the Grenfell Tower public inquiry following the BBC's story. In response, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said its Building Safety Bill would make the biggest improvements to building safety in 40 years, ""where successive governments have failed... with more rights and protections for residents and a Â£5bn investment to remove unsafe cladding. ""The new Building Safety Regulator will enforce a more stringent regulatory regime for buildings over 18m and oversee the safety and performance of all buildings, ensuring products are removed from the market if they do not meet regulation.""

"Girl, 12, stabbed to death during city centre rowFour boys, aged between 13 and 15, are arrested on suspicion of murdering Ava White in Liverpool.Liverpool","Ava White died after being assaulted while out with friends A 12-year-old girl has been stabbed to death during an argument in a city centre. Ava White was with friends in Liverpool when she was assaulted at 20:40 GMT on Thursday, shortly after the city's Christmas lights switch-on. Merseyside Police said she suffered ""catastrophic injuries"" and a weapon was yet to be found. Four teenage boys, aged between 13 and 15 and from Toxteth, have been arrested on suspicion of her murder. Police said officers found Ava collapsed on the ground on Church Alley and a member of the public, who had witnessed the incident, was giving her first aid. Ava, who attended Notre Dame Catholic College in Everton, was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital with critical injuries but died a short time later. ""We know at the moment that Ava was with her friends in Liverpool city centre and there has been a verbal argument which has escalated to an assault on her involving a knife,"" Det Supt Sue Coombs said. ""We are able to say there has been a verbal argument and there has been an assault, and the offenders ran off up School Lane, across Hanover Street and into Fleet Street."" Assistant Chief Constable Ngaire Waine said police were not looking for anyone else in connection with Ava's death. ""It's very sad for the city but it is even sadder for her family, their lives are never going to be the same,"" she said. ""This is a very, very rare event, so I hope that will reassure people."" This video can not be played Assistant mayor of Liverpool, Sarah Doyle, said Ava's death was ""devastating"" Paying tribute to Ava, her head teacher Peter Duffy said the Year Eight pupil was a ""much loved, valued and unique member of the Notre Dame family"".

Peace campaigner Colin Parry, whose son Tim was killed in the Warrington bomb in 1993,tweeted that Ava,externalhad been given a peace ambassador award by his charity in 2019 and her death was a ""tragic loss"". Metro Mayor of Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram, said he was ""horrified"" by Ava's death. ""I am angry today for Ava and her family, for the parents across the region worrying about their children's safety and angry that such a heinous act should take place here,""he tweeted,external. Sarah Doyle, the assistant mayor of Liverpool, said she was ""heartbroken"" at the ""extremely devastating"" news. ""It's senseless and I know it will bring a lot of fear to communities across the city,"" she said. ""I just want to send a message of reassurance that our city is a safe place but I know this will be giving a lot of anxiety to people. We all share in [her family's] unimaginable grief."" Posting on Twitter,,externalDame Rachel de Souza, children's commissioner for England, said: ""This kind of violence involving a child and with such tragic consequences is shocking at any time, but when the victim is 12 it's particularly so."" Floral tributes to Ava have been left near the scene This video can not be played Det Supt Sue Coombs Mary Katilius, 65, from Limerick, said she had been nearby with her granddaughter when Ava was attacked. ""We heard screams and someone said to call an ambulance. We rushed over straight away but there was already a man helping her,"" she said.

Floral tributes have been left near the scene, with one message saying: ""Rest in peace angel."" Lacey, 17, who came to lay flowers and a balloon, said her younger sister had been close friends with Ava. ""She was just a bubbly character, so loving and caring,"" she added. By Andy Gill, BBC North West Tonight reporter There is a massive police presence in Liverpool with several of the city's main shopping streets taped off. Dozens of police vehicles are parked close to the scene where 12-year-old Ava was fatally attacked. Many shoppers and tourists are having to ask officers how they can get to their destinations as many are unaware of the tragedy which lies behind the disruption to their usual routine. Ava died on what is called White Ribbon Day, a worldwide campaign to end violence against women and girls. Civic leaders came together yesterday to mark it and start 16 days of activity to highlight the issue. The death of a girl, not yet in her teens, throws the need for the campaign into the starkest relief. Forensic teams could be seen carrying out fingertip searches The four boys - a 13-year-old, two 14-year-olds and a 15-year-old - remain in custody for questioning. They were arrested at different locations during Thursday evening and into the early hours of Friday, police said. A police cordon was in place surrounding Williamson Square, Tarleton Street, Church Street, Church Alley and School Lane crossing over Hanover Street on to Fleet Street. Several shops on Church Street, one of the city's main shopping streets, remained closed on Black Friday due to the cordon.
