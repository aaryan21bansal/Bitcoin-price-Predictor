Pub decision defended as new restrictions kick in,"Pubs in the Glasgow area will not need to close as part of the new restrictions Scotland's deputy first minister has defended a decision to keep pubs open in greater Glasgow despite new limits on social contact. Restrictions on visiting other householdswere reintroduced in Glasgow and two neighbouring areason Tuesday. John Swinney said a rise in Covid cases was driven by household contacts and not the hospitality sector. The new rules affect more than 800,000 people in Glasgow City, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire. A further 86 new coronavirus cases in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area were confirmed on Wednesday - accounting for more than half of the total for the whole of Scotland, which was 156. Mr Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that it was important to take ""early action"" in the three areas to avoid having to take ""more significant action"" later which could affect the economy and schools. Can my builder work during the indoor visits ban? He explained: ""It's necessary because we feel we have to nip this particular problem in the bud in the west of Scotland. ""Across the whole of the country the number of positive cases per 100,000 is 9.2. In West Dunbartonshire it's 32.6, in Glasgow it's 21.8 and in East Renfrewshire it's 18.8 - so we've got sizeably different position in these three local authority areas."" These figures compare to a rate of 67.8 in Pendle, Lancashire, which was top of Public Health England's watchlistin its latest surveillance report,external. The weekly rate of 32.6 in West Dunbartonshire is similar to the rates in Salford and Bury in Greater Manchester, which sit in the top third of the watchlist. The restrictions are different toones introduced in Aberdeenin August, which included a five-mile travel limit for leisure and holidays, as well as the closure of pubs and restaurants. The contrast has been criticised by Douglas Lumsden, the co-leader of Aberdeen City Council and Conservative group leader. In a series of tweets, he said: I hope that @NicolaSturgeon will explain to businesses in Aberdeen that were forced to close, why Glasgow businesses are not being forced to close. ""Aberdeen was locked down for 3 weeks, no hospitality, no travel, no visiting. Glasgow lockdown = no visiting."" He added: ""Glasgow lockdown. No household gatherings so meet your pals in the pub instead."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Glasgow city, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire people are being told not to host people from other households in their own homes or visit another person's home. Therestrictions,externalcame into effect from midnight. They will last for two weeks, but will be reviewed after a week. People living in those areas should also not visit someone else's home, no matter where it is. Mr Swinney said he understood Mr Lumsden's frustration, but said the councillor should be ""careful with some of his language"". ""The problem in Aberdeen stemmed from the hospitality sector, so we had to focus on the hospitality sector,"" he said. ""Here in Glasgow, we don't have evidence of that taking its course, so it would be inappropriate and disproportionate to take that action. ""We have got evidence from the contact tracing that has been undertaken on an extensive basis that this is predominantly emanating from household contacts."" Mr Swinney said the Scottish government needed to get on top of the rise in cases before it led to a more ""widespread problem"" in the west of Scotland and the whole country. Announcing the restrictions on Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, said they should be a ""wake-up call"" for the whole country to stick to government guidelines on preventing the spread of coronavirus. The first minister added that Covid-19 continued to be a dangerous and potentially deadly virus which was spreading in the Glasgow area ""primarily as a result of household gatherings"".

U-turn over lockdown easing after cases rise,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""swift and decisive action"" had been needed Parts of Greater Manchester will not have lockdown restrictions eased as planned following a government U-turn. Measures in Bolton and Trafford were due to be eased overnight after a fall in cases earlier in August. But they will ""now remain under existing restrictions"" following ""a significant change in the level of infection rates over the last few days"", the government announced. The region's mayor Andy Burnham said the U-turn had been ""complete chaos"". The boroughs had been due to allow people from different households to meet indoors and businesses to offer close contact services such as facials, but that has now been halted. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision was made ""in collaboration with local leaders after reviewing the latest data"" which showed infection rates had more than trebled in Bolton in under a week and doubled in Trafford since the last review. ""We have always been clear we will take swift and decisive action where needed to contain outbreaks,"" he added. A spokesman for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the U-turn as ""utterly chaotic"" and it gave people ""no confidence in the government's approach"". What are the new local lockdown rules? Greater Manchester Mayor Mr Burnham compared the government's weekly announcements on local coronavirus restrictions as ""like waiting for the white smoke out of the Vatican"". ""It's not working, it's confusing people, it's causing anger and resentment,"" he added. ""In my view, it's local councils that need to be in the driving seat here, working then in consultation with the government."" Trafford's Labour council leader Andrew Western tweeted: ""We should never have been put in this mess in the first place; this has massively damaged public confidence in measures.""

Bolton Council leader David Greenhalgh said it would have been ""irresponsible not to recognise the unpredicted spike we have seen in Bolton"". He said he recognised ""many people will be extremely frustrated and annoyed by this decision"" but the borough had recorded the second highest increase in positive cases in the country. A Covid-19 spike in Bolton and Trafford promptedcouncil bosses to ask for restrictions to remain in placea day before they were due to be lifted. Bolton currently has one of the highest rates of new virus cases per 100,000 residents in England. Chris Green, Conservative MP for Bolton West, had argued that restrictions should be eased in his constituency. But, following the U-turn, he said the government had based its decision on recent data which he hadn't seen. He has since tweeted to say he was""disappointed at how this important decision has been communicated,externalbecause of the impact this will have on people's lives"". Lockdown restrictions were eased on Wednesday in Stockport,Burnley, Hyndburn,parts of Bradford, excluding Bradford city and Keighley town, parts of Calderdale, excluding Halifax, and parts of Kirklees, excluding Dewsbury and Batley. According to government rules,external, people living in these areas can now: Socialise in groups of up to two households indoors or in private gardens Stay overnight at somebody else's home but must try to social distance Book close contact services such as facials and brow or eyelash treatments Visit bowling alleys, roller rinks, soft play centres and casinos Measureswere imposedat the end of July amid a rise in cases. Stockport has joined Wigan in being allowed to have two households socialise indoors. But in Bolton, Trafford, Manchester, Salford, Rochdale, Bury and Tameside it is still banned. In Oldham people are advised not to meet up with other households outdoors as well. By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit The rise in cases in Trafford and Bolton shows how quickly the situation with coronavirus can change. On Friday the government announced it was easing the localised lockdown restrictions in parts of Greater Manchester from Wednesday - a decision it has now reversed in those two areas. Pointing to data for the week to 20 August, it said ""cases in Bolton and Stockport fell from 25.6 (per 100,000 residents) to 18.9, and 23 to 15.1 respectively, and Trafford fell from 27.1 to 17.8."" Yet even then, there was concern that the rate was rising. The Labour leader of Trafford Council, Andrew Western, said the more recent data had shown a ""slight increase"". By Tuesday, the spike in Bolton had also become apparent and council leaders in both areas were calling for the easing of restrictions to not go ahead. According to data released on Tuesday evening, Trafford's rate for the week to 29 August was more than 35 cases per 100,000. In Bolton it was 59 cases per 100,000, driven in particular by high numbers of cases on 27, 28 and 29 August. Catalina Sastra, who runs the Party and Play, funhouse in Bolton was planning to re-open next week but said the changes were confusing. ""We're teetering on the edge... we are due to open with an online booking system, temperature reading, we've had all the screens put up... but it's just if it's on or if it's off"", she said. ""It's a bit like playing hokey-cokey. Are we in or are we out?"" Bolton has had its highest seven-day rate since late May A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""We are working closely with leaders and local authorities across Greater Manchester and Lancashire in response to the changing situation and we keep all local restrictions under constant consideration.""

Series of failings in terror supervision condemned,"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed by a knifeman who had been released from jail on licence A catalogue of failings have been found in the way people convicted of terror-related offences are monitored by the authorities in England and Wales. An independent review,externalfound ""gaps"" in the powers used to check up on such offenders. And it highlighted an ""unreliable"" flow of information about their behaviour, such as remarks ""glorifying"" terrorism. The review was launched after convicted terrorist Usman Khan killed two peoplein an attack in Londonin November. Khan had been on licence from prison when he fatally stabbed Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt at Fishmongers' Hall near London Bridge on 29 November last year. Justice Minister Chris Philp said the government was legislating to require terrorism offenders to take lie detector tests - a measure the report endorses - and said other proposals were being considered. London Bridge: What we know Emergency terror law clears parliamentary hurdles Terror suspects could face indefinite curbs Jonathan Hall QC, who conducted the review, said the authorities tended to ""over-focus"" on the impact of restrictions on offenders when they were let out - rather than considering the ""overall risk"" they posed. He said meetings involving different public protection agencies, such as the police, the prison service and probation officers, were ""dominated by information exchange rather than active management"", with a single case taking two hours to discuss. Mr Hall criticised a risk assessment tool used by the Prison and Probation Service in England and Wales, which he said ""seriously minimised"" the severity of terrorism offences and ""accepted the offender's characterisation (and in some cases denials)"" of their crimes. ""It was suggested to me that one possible reason was that [the risk assessment tool] is often completed by a prison psychologist, in a therapeutic context in which the offender's 'buy-in' to the process is deemed to be particularly important,"" he said. Among other problems the report found a ""significant gap"" in the authorities' ability to monitor the risk of terrorism posed by ""dangerous"" offenders convicted of non-terror related offences. It also said opportunities to reduce the risk offenders posed was ""lost"" because of an ""unreliable"" flow of information about their behaviour in prison, such as comments ""glorifying"" terrorism, overheard by jail staff. Mr Hall added that there was a ""surprisingly limited"" circle of knowledge about terrorism offenders in the community, with police borough commanders in London ""not always aware"" of the identity of such individuals in their area. He called for a ""cultural shift"" so that information was shared more widely. The report, which makes 45 recommendations, was completed in May - three months aftera second attackinvolving a released terrorism prisoner. Sudesh Amman, had recently been freed from prison when he stabbed two people on Streatham High Road, in south London in February.

Cheap steroids save lives from severe Covid,"Cheap steroids can save the lives of patients who are critically ill with Covid-19, studies show. The findings confirm the results of an earlier trial, which has already led to steroids being used widely for Covid patients in intensive care. The new results,published in JAMA,external, show eight lives would be saved for every 100 patients treated. The researchers said the findings were impressive, but stressed steroids were not a coronavirus cure. What progress are we making on treatments? In June,the UK's Recovery trialfound the first drug - a steroid called dexamethasone - that could save the lives of people with severe Covid. The latest study brings together all clinical trials involving steroids on coronavirus patients around the world. It confirms dexamethasone works and that another steroid, hydrocortisone, is equally effective. This video can not be played Katherine Millbank spent 15 days in hospital and was part of the Recovery trial ""At the beginning of the year, at times it felt almost hopeless knowing that we had no specific treatments,"" said Prof Anthony Gordon, from Imperial College London. ""It was a very worrying time, yet less than six months later we've found clear, reliable evidence in high quality clinical trials of how we can tackle this devastating disease."" The results on 1,703 critically ill patients showed: 40% died when given only standard treatment 32% died when given steroids The studies were on only the sickest hospital patients. Most people recover having only experienced mild symptoms. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? VIRUS FATIGUE:Is it time to move on? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters COMPARING COUNTRIES:The pitfalls of doing so RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? Steroids calm down inflammation and the immune system, which is why they are already used in conditions like arthritis and asthma, as well as in some severe infections. The drugs are not thought to be helpful in the early stages of a coronavirus infection - when symptoms include a cough, fever or a sudden loss of taste or smell. But as the disease develops, the immune system can go into overdrive, damaging the lungs and other organs. It is this stage of Covid that steroids are thought to help with. ""At the point at which you reach for an oxygen cylinder for a patient with Covid, you probably should be reaching for the prescription for corticosteroids,"" said Prof Martin Landray, from the University of Oxford. ""These results are instantly useable; they are widely available, cheap, well-understood drugs that reduce mortality."" Doctors are already using dexamethasone after the results earlier in the year, but the hope is that having the choice of different drugs will increase access to the treatment around the world. The drugs can either be swallowed as tablets or given via intravenous drip. The research so far has focused on low doses of steroids. There is no evidence that higher doses would be more effective. New guidelines for doctors are expected to be released by the World Health Organization. In the UK, NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: ""Just as we did with dexamethasone, the NHS will now take immediate action to ensure that patients who could benefit from treatment with hydrocortisone do so, adding a further weapon in the armoury in the worldwide fight against Covid-19.""

Ofqual said grading system 'fundamental mistake',"England's exams regulator, Ofqual, says it was a ""fundamental mistake"" to think the public would accept an emergency grading system instead of exam results. Chairman Roger Taylor said Ofqual advised ministers to hold socially-distanced exams or delay them. If these two options were unworkable, then calculated grades could be used, he said Ofqual had advised. Mr Taylor said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson cancelled exams without further reference to Ofqual. Labour said it was ""now clear"" that Mr Williamson was responsible for the exams chaos and that he should not blame Ofqual. But a spokesman for the Department for Education said that the decision to cancel exams had been a ""necessary step to fight the spread of coronavirus"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used Prime Minister's Questions to challenge Boris Johnson over when he first knew there was a problem with the algorithm for deciding grades. Mr Johnson defended his government's record, accusing Sir Keir of being ""Captain Hindsight"". Ofqual chief Sally Collier steps down after exam chaos Boris Johnson blames 'mutant algorithm' for exam problems How did the algorithm decide exam grades? ""We did institute a change, we did act,"" and students did get their grades, said the prime minister. Sally Collier resigned over the exams chaos But Mr Taylor told MPs on the Commons education select committee: ""The fundamental mistake was to believe this [system] would ever be acceptable to the public."" Mr Williamson took the decision to cancel exams when schools were closed by the coronavirus and increasing number of teachers were shielding. Ofqual had to develop a system to award grades for exams which pupils could no longer take. This produced a moderation process that saw 40% of A-level grades being lower than the grades estimated by their schools. But Mr Taylor defended Ofqual's approach to calculating grades, saying it was trying to carry out ministerial guidelines. He argued that the system of standardising grades, the so-called ""algorithm"", would on the whole have helped disadvantaged pupils. Students were left uncertain about grades in U-turns over exam results The Ofqual chairman said that in March the regulator had been consulted by the Department for Education about the implications of cancelling exams. At this point, Ofqual said there were four options: to delay exams until the virus crisis passed conduct socially distanced exams use some form of teacher and school-assessed certificates or to combine school-based assessments with the standardisation model to produce estimated grades Mr Taylor said that he and his officials had repeatedly warned the Department for Education of the risks of using estimated grades. Julie Swann, Ofqual's executive director for general qualifications, said a paper on May 1 ""highlighted the risk of widespread dissatisfaction"" from students, schools and colleges. But after problems and inconsistencies emerged with grades, the moderation process was ditched in a U-turn, and teachers' grades were used instead. The chief regulator, Sally Collier, resigned and the Department for Education's most senior civil servant, Jonathan Slater, stepped down following the exams chaos. Mr Taylor, also revealed Ofqual guidance on using ""valid mock"" exam results to widen the appeals process, was removed from the Ofqual website after an intervention from England's education secretary. Results for this year's exams were caught up in confusion Mr Williamson had decided to allow mock exam results to be used as evidence in appeals over grades. Mr Taylor said Mr Williamson telephoned the chief regulator, Sally Collier, late on a Saturday night, August 15, after Ofqual published new appeals guidance, saying it was not consistent with the education secretary's policy. Ofqual, which is independent from government, had been trying to formulate a way for such appeals to work, while meeting its statutory duty to ensure exams were fair. Mr Taylor said the board then met in emergency session to try to find a way through a situation which was rapidly ""spinning out of control"". ""We advised the Secretary of State at this point that we could not be confident that this could be delivered within the statutory duties of Ofqual to ensure that valid and trustworthy grades were being issued."" Discussions followed throughout Sunday, in which it became clear that a move to ""centre assessed grades"", which had been submitted by schools and colleges, was all but inevitable. Mr Williamson went on to announce that results would use these centre assessed grades in a major U-turn. A Department for Education spokesman said the ""government never wanted to cancel exams because they are the best and fairest form of assessment. ""We listened to views from a range of parties, including Ofqual, and given the public health requirements at the time, made what was a very difficult decision on the basis that it was a necessary step to fight the spread of coronavirus.""

Covid families reject PM's reason for not meeting,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he will meet bereaved families when litigation from the group against the government âis concludedâ. Boris Johnson says he will meet a group of families bereaved by coronavirus when their ""litigation"" with the government has ""concluded"". But Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice say it is ""simply not true"" they are in litigation with the government and it is a ""poor excuse"". They have repeated their demand for a meeting with the PM to discuss their call for an inquiry into the pandemic. Downing Street said it had nothing to add to the PM's comments. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice say they have written five times to Mr Johnson to request a meeting. Start Covid-19 inquiry now, say bereaved families PM promises an independent coronavirus inquiry Bereaved Covid families ask for meeting with PM Asked about the letters, in a live TV interview last week, the prime minister said he would ""of course"" meet anyone bereaved by Covid-19. But days later he wrote to the group to say he was ""unable"" to meet them. The group, which says it represents 1,600 families, said it was ""devastated"" to receive the letter,which it has made public,external. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer - who met the group in July - asked if Mr Johnson would change his mind, saying the PM ""will understand the frustration and the hurt of those families that he said one thing to camera and another thing to them"". Mr Johnson said: ""Of course I would be very happy to meet the families of the bereaved and sympathise deeply with all those who have lost loved ones throughout this pandemic and we all feel their pain and their grief. ""It turns out that this particular group are currently in litigation with the government. I will certainly meet them once that litigation is concluded."" This video can not be played Bereaved relatives call for inquiry: ""It wasn't good enough for our loved ones"" Elkan Abrahamson, a lawyer for Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, said it was ""simply not true"" that the group is in litigation with the government. The group is considering seeking a judicial review of the decision not to hold an immediate inquiry into the pandemic. On 26 August, it sent the government's legal department a ""letter before action"" calling for a meeting with the PM, which says ""the families wish to resolve these issues without the need to resort to litigation"". Mr Abrahamson said the group had yet to receive a reply to this letter. ""Even if there was litigation parties are always encouraged to meet in person to try and resolve their differences so I don't really see that as an excuse,"" he added. In his letter to the group, Mr Johnson said that because they had instructed solicitors, and were ""engaged in pre-action correspondence"", all further correspondence on the issue ""should pass through the respective legal teams"". ""I understand that the Government Legal Department will be responding to your most recent letter on this topic within the timeframe you requested,"" he added. Jo Goodman, co-founder of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, who lost her dad Stuart to the virus, said: ""It feels like we're the wrong kind of bereaved people - like the prime minister only wants to meet with bereaved people who won't ask difficult questions. ""There's no legal action happening, so that can't be the reason he's not meeting with us. ""So will he now commit to meet with us so we can share our experiences of serious issues - from deaths in care homes to inadequate protective equipment - that can help him learn crucial lessons and save lives?"" Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice is calling for an independent, judge-led, statutory public inquiry into coronavirus deaths, which it wants to begin imminently. This video can not be played The PM said last week he would ""meet anybody"" bereaved due to Covid-19 A Downing Street spokesperson said earlier that the PM remained committed to meeting people who have been bereaved as a result of Covid-19, and that he was ""resolute in his determination to beat this virus"" to prevent further ""dreadful loss"". In Julythe prime minister committed to an independent inquiryinto the pandemic, but has repeatedly said now was not the right time. Independent inquiries can take many forms - from full public inquiries that can take years, or in some cases decades, and cost millions of pounds; to smaller scale, more fleet-footed investigations. The idea is to hold the powerful to account and try to learn lessons from decisions that have gone wrong, and how to avoid repeating scandals and tragic events in the future. Recent examples of judge-led inquiries include the Leveson inquiry into media standards, or the ongoing inquiry into the Grenfell Tower catastrophe. Other inquiries, such as 2009 Iraq inquiry, headed by a retired senior civil servant Sir John Chilcot, do not take evidence under oath. The government of the day is normally expected to adopt many, if not all, of the recommendations of an official inquiry, although it does not always work out like that in practice.

Covid fears over Zante tourists' social distancing,"Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said people returning from Zante posed a public health risk Premises are being contacted over claims holidaymakers - who have suspected coronavirus symptoms - came home from Zante and mixed with others. People who went out in Maesteg, Bridgend county, at the weekendhave been urged to be alert to the symptoms. A local councillor claimed someone had returned from Zakynthos and had been socialising before testing positive. Bridgend council said it was liaising with ""establishments where it is alleged these individuals were out"". The authority's leader, Huw David, said: ""We need to be very clear with people - they are risking other people's health and other people's lives, if they're asymptomatic and going out and mixing in the local community. ""They could be putting their family members and friends at risk. We are urging them to be careful and think about other members of the community."" Travellers arriving to Wales from the Greek island have since been asked toself-isolate after a cluster of cases. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said tracing could not reach everyone because of people providing false information. It comes after criticism that some passengers returning to Cardiff from Zante were not informed for a week that they had to self-isolate. Council officials are contacting venues in Maesteg about their concerns A Bridgend council spokesman said: ""We have been made aware of social media stories circulating of individuals in the Maesteg area who have returned from Zante and who are potentially showing Covid-19 symptoms. ""Anyone who may believe they have come into contact with individuals who have returned from Zante must be alert to the signs of symptoms of Covid-19."" Public Health Wales said its investigations into cases of coronavirus in Wales ""have indicated that a lack of social distancing, in particular by a minority of the 20-30 year age group, has resulted in the spread of the virus to other groups of people"". ""We would make a direct appeal to young people to remember that even if they feel that they would not be badly affected by Covid-19 were they to test positive, should they pass it on to older or more vulnerable family members, friends or colleagues it could be extremely serious, and even fatal,"" a statement said. Beautician Kelly John has closed her shop while she awaits the results of a covid test Maesteg East councillor Keith Edwards said he had been told one holidaymaker had returned ""but before waiting for the result, he socialised in and around the town, then was notified he was positive"". ""Some pubs have had companies in to clean - staff being tested,"" he added. Kelly John, who owns a beauty salon in the town, has decided to close temporarily after one of her clients was with a man who tested positive after returning from Zante. She said: ""Yesterday, I had my afternoon client here and she received a message while having her nails done basically saying a boy she was with on the weekend had tested positive for coronavirus but he did land from Zante on Thursday. I had to close instantly then. ""Only a month ago I opened, so I'm back to square one again now. ""I've just had my coronavirus test done and they've told me I have to wait 72 hours for the results so I'll have to remain closed until then."" Maesteg Harelquins cancelled Tuesday's session as a result of the concerns that people who had tested positive may have mixed with players over the weekend. Allow Twitter content?

And Maesteg Celtic rugby clubtweeted,externalto say it was bringing in a cleaning company due to the ""current situation"" and following advice from the council. Ogmore MP Chris Elmore and Member of the Senedd Huw Irranca-Davies issued a joint statement saying they were pleased the council was ""contacting various local establishments where it is alleged that individuals were out over the weekend and are also providing clear advice and support"". Travel companyTui has cancelled all holidays to the resort of Laganason the Greek island, because of customers failing to follow coronavirus safety measures. Travellers arriving into Wales from Zante arebeing asked to self-isolate for 14 daysfollowing six clusters of cases, amounting to 30 infections, linked to flights from there. They will also be offered two Covid-19 tests - one in 48 hours and another in eight days. Testing passengers at Cardiff Airport is now being considered. Victoria Webb said she was concerned she only found out about the outbreak from a media report Some passengers on board a Zante to Cardiff flight last week have complained they were not told to self-isolate straight away. Lee Evans said ""someone needs to be held to account"" after an email telling him and his family to self-isolate came almost a week after the flight. Another passenger, Victoria Webb, said she only became aware of the outbreak when her mother sent her a link to the BBC News story as she travelled home to London from Cardiff. Mr Gething said the contact tracing system was reaching more than 90% of people. ""The reason we're never going to have 100% contact tracing over the whole service is because some people don't want to be contacted and have given deliberately misleading information to the service,"" he said. ""The contact tracing service does rely on people being responsible and giving honest information. ""If they don't, then those people are risking their health and the health of those around them and in their community. ""There is a back-stop and anyone we don't speak to on the phone within a couple of days is written to. But people need to do the right thing if we're going to avoid another big wave as we saw in the spring."" How does test and trace work? Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? 'Test, trace, protect' system launches in Wales Welsh Conservative Senedd memberAndrew RT Davies,externalcalled for the health minister to ""get his act together"" and introduce testing for arriving passengers at Cardiff Airport. The airport's chief executive, Spencer Birns, has asked the UK government for clarity on testing and backed calls for a ""robust testing system... to help give airline passengers confidence to travel again"". The health minister said he had not ruled out further travel restrictions on Greece with theScottish government imposing quarantine restrictionson people arriving from the country from Thursday. Mr Gething said he was expecting a report from the UK government's Joint Biosecurity Centre on Greece later on Wednesday and he had sought a meeting with other UK ministers to discuss possible quarantine rules. He added: ""Anyone who is going abroad needs to accept they are taking a risk, and the rules could change whilst they're abroad or whilst they're in the air."" However the Welsh Government's approach of targeting specific outbreak areas, rather than blanket bans on entire countries, has been praised. Travel expert Simon Calder said the policy could set the benchmark for the rest of the UK. ""The Welsh health minister has done exactly what the travel industry has been calling for and that's to have targeted measures aimed at specific hot spots rather than whole countries being written off over-night,"" he said. ""It's extraordinarily confusing for travellers because we have the bizarre situation where everything is fragmented between the four home nations. ""The UK government has been trying to hold things together but the move by Wales last night took everyone by surprise and could become the model of what we see in the future."" The advice changed while Lucy Griffiths and her daughter were flying to Greece Lucy Griffiths, of Cardiff, had just arrived in Zante with her children when the announcement was made. ""We discovered that [the rules had changed] when we landed and turned our phones on, and discovered that everyone had sent us messages,"" she said. ""Covid is everywhere, so I could contract it going to the supermarket at home. I don't see the difference being in another country. ""Sadly I was made redundant during the lockdown, so I haven't actually got a job to go home to, but my children are going to miss more of school than we had originally planned."" Ellis and Jennifer Roberts on holiday on Zante Ellis and Jennifer Roberts, from Anglesey, are due to fly back to Liverpool on Thursday but said they felt safe on holiday. ""Laganas is the area they are most concerned about, that's where all the young people go. But we're staying in a small village, Alykes, and it's possibly safer than on Anglesey,"" said Mrs Roberts. ""We don't regret going on holiday. We cancelled going to Skiathos last month and found things were getting better so decided to come. I'll have to ask the boss if I can work from home for another two weeks.""

"No tax rise 'horror show', Sunak tells Tory MPs","This video can not be played The government âcannot carry on doing exactly what we did this year foreverâ, says the chancellor Chancellor Rishi Sunak has reassured recently-elected Tory MPs there will not be a ""horror show of tax rises with no end in sight"", as the government deals with the costs of coronavirus. He urged the 2019 Conservative intake to show trust to overcome the ""short-term challenges"" the party faces. Some MPs have expressed fears U-turns are hurting the government's standing. Mr Sunak accidentally revealed the wording of his statement while holding his notes outside 11 Downing Street. Johnson accused of 'governing in hindsight' Covid families reject PM's meeting excuse What tasks lie ahead on the return to Westminster? The Conservative Party, which won an 80-seat majority at December's general election, has seen its opinion poll lead over Labour cut in recent weeks. This has led to concerns among some MPs who won seats in traditional Labour heartlands in the Midlands and northern England, known previously as its ""red wall"". An unnamed ""red wall"" Conservative told the Press Association MPs in these areas, and others in marginal seats, were ""jittery"" following a series of U-turns on subjects including exam results, the wearing of face coverings and school meal funding. They described the situation as a ""megadisaster"". And Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, treasurer of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, warned against ""own goals"", saying: ""We may have a big majority but that still doesn't mean to say that we shouldn't be as competent as possible as a government."" A photographer picked up the words in Rishi Sunak's statement It was reported at the weekend that substantialcorporation tax rises and capital gains tax changes,externalare being considered by the Treasury to deal with the enormous costs of coronavirus. But the government dismissed this as ""speculation"". The wording of Mr Sunak's statement, read out during a meeting in Parliament on Wednesday with Tory MPs first elected in 2019, which the prime minister also attended, was revealed when a photographer noticed the chancellor holding a script sheet while leaving 11 Downing Street. It read: ""We will need to do some difficult things, but I promise you, if we trust one another we will be able to overcome the short-term challenges."" Referring to the reports that there could be tax increases to pay for costs incurred during the pandemic, including the furlough scheme, it added: ""Now this doesn't mean a horror show of tax rises with no end in sight."" It continued: ""But it does mean treating the British people with respect, being honest with them about the challenges we face and showing them how we plan to correct our public finances and give our country the dynamic, low-tax economy we all want to see."" By Leila Nathoo, political correspondent With more MPs back at Westminster, the prime minister and his chancellor took the opportunity to reassure restless Tory backbenchers about the government's strategy. How to pay for the huge package of interventions to deal with the pandemic and its effects is at the forefront of Rishi Sunak's mind ahead of the Budget later this autumn. Borrowing has ballooned and the prime minister has already promised there will be no return to austerity. But there is nervousness among Tory MPs about rumours of tax rises and about the government's decision-making and messaging more broadly. Mr Sunak told his Conservative colleagues that ministers needed to show people the plan for correcting public finances. He faces difficult choices while devising it. Government sources denied the revelation of the chancellor's words in this way was ""embarrassing"", adding that they would have become a matter of public record anyway. Discussing the coronavirus crisis, Boris Johnson told the MPs: ""I know it's been tough. I've got to warn you, it's about to get tougher. The waters are about to get choppier. But we are going to deal with it."" The prime minister later addressed a meeting of all backbench Conservative MPs, with the 1922 Committee getting together for the first time since Parliament's summer recess. One MP present said he had been ""full of beans"", while a minister added that both the day's meetings had been about ""calming the troops"".

US sanctions staff at top war crimes court,"This video can not be played ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda told the BBC in 2017 she was ""looking at allegations from all parties"" in Afghanistan The US has imposed sanctions on senior officials in the International Criminal Court (ICC), including chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused the court of ""illegitimate attempts to subject Americans to its jurisdiction"". The Hague-based ICC is currently investigating whether US forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan. The US has criticised the court since its foundation and is one of a dozen states which have not signed up. Balkees Jarrah, senior counsel at the non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch, condemned the sanctions as a ""shameful new low for US commitments to justice for victims of the worst crimes"". Mr Pompeo's move marked a ""stunning perversion of US sanctions, devised to penalize rights abusers and kleptocrats, to target those prosecuting war crimes"", she tweeted. Created by a UN treaty in 2002, the ICC investigates and brings to justice those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, intervening when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute. What is the International Criminal Court? The treaty has been ratified by 123 countries, including the UK. But the US - along with China, India and Russia - has refused to join, whilesome African nations have accused the body of being unfairly focused on Africans. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in June, which allows the US to block the assets of ICC employees and stop them entering the country. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Mr Pompeo said Ms Bensouda and Phakiso Mochochoko, the head of the Jurisdiction, Complementarity and Cooperation Division, were to be sanctioned under this order. Dismissing the ICC as a ""thoroughly broken and corrupted institution"", he said those who continued to ""materially support those individuals risk exposure to sanctions as well"". The US state department has also restricted the issuance of visas for ICC staff involved in ""efforts to investigate US personnel"". This video can not be played 'ICC will not be deterred by US coercion' When President Trump issued his executive order in June, the ICC denounced what it called ""further threats and coercive actions"" against it. ""An attack on the ICC also represents an attack against the interests of victims of atrocity crimes, for many of whom the Court represents the last hope for justice,""its statement read,external. As a former justice minister in The Gambia, her home country, Ms Bensouda was ideally placed to succeed Luis Moreno-Ocampo as ICC chief prosecutor, as she had been his deputy throughout his term. She had also previously been a senior legal adviser at a UN-backed tribunal which prosecuted the alleged ringleaders in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. While she broadened ICC investigations to look at conflicts elsewhere, which has now earned her the wrath of the US, Africa remained her major focus. All ICC trials have so far focused only on Africans - and a militia leader from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Thomas Lubanga, became the first person to be sentenced for war crimes by the ICC in 2012. But Ms Bensouda also faced a string of defeats, including the acquittal of Ivory Coast's ex-President Laurent Gbagbo on war crimes charges in 2019 and the dropping of crimes against humanity charges against Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2014. The ICC began investigating alleged war crimes committed by the US and others in the Afghan conflict earlier this year. According tothe ICC's legal process,external, the court can issue arrest warrants or a summons to appear once prosecutors have gathered sufficient evidence and identified suspects. From there, they will decided if there is enough evidence for a case to go to trial. At the time, Mr Pompeo vowed to protect Americans from the probe, calling it ""a truly breathtaking action by an unaccountable, political institution masquerading as a legal body"". A 2016 report from the ICC said there was a reasonable basis to believe the US military had committed torture,externalat secret detention sites operated by the CIA. Afghanistan: the long road to peace The Afghan war: The short and long story The actions of the Taliban, the Afghan government and US troops since May 2003 are expected to be examined by the court.

Pair fatally stabbed factory supervisor 100 times,"Earnshaw (left) and Gaukroger took part in the ""frenzied and senseless"" attack A factory supervisor died after being stabbed more than 100 times by two youths wielding a samurai sword, a court has heard. Robert Wilson, 53, was attacked after he asked the pair to leave the car park of a factory in Huddersfield on 16 January, Leeds Crown Court was told. Kiyran Earnshaw, 18, and Luke Gaukroger, 16, both admitted murder. Earnshaw was jailed for a minimum of 22 years and Gaukroger was ordered to serve 16 years and eight months. Mr Justice Lavender said both youths had been heavily intoxicated at the time they had carried out the ""frenzied and senseless attack"". Robert Wilson was brutally attacked outside the factory where he worked He said Mr Wilson had done them ""no wrong"". More news and stories from Yorkshire Peter Makepeace QC, prosecuting, earlier told the court the youths had been seen in the factory car park and Mr Wilson, from Birstall, and two other colleagues went to move them on. At one point Mr Wilson put his phone to his ear to talk to the remote security firm, and Earnshaw started shouting at him, claiming he was being filmed. He then pulled a samurai sword from his trousers and pursued Mr Wilson as and he and his colleagues tried to get away.

Terror supervision failings in England and Wales,"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed by a knifeman who had been released from jail on licence A catalogue of failings have been found in the way people convicted of terror-related offences are monitored by the authorities in England and Wales. An independent review,externalfound ""gaps"" in the powers used to check up on such offenders. And it highlighted an ""unreliable"" flow of information about their behaviour, such as remarks ""glorifying"" terrorism. The review was launched after convicted terrorist Usman Khan killed two peoplein an attack in Londonin November. Khan had been on licence from prison when he fatally stabbed Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt at Fishmongers' Hall near London Bridge on 29 November last year. Justice Minister Chris Philp said the government was legislating to require terrorism offenders to take lie detector tests - a measure the report endorses - and said other proposals were being considered. London Bridge: What we know Emergency terror law clears parliamentary hurdles Terror suspects could face indefinite curbs Jonathan Hall QC, who conducted the review, said the authorities tended to ""over-focus"" on the impact of restrictions on offenders when they were let out - rather than considering the ""overall risk"" they posed. He said meetings involving different public protection agencies, such as the police, the prison service and probation officers, were ""dominated by information exchange rather than active management"", with a single case taking two hours to discuss. Mr Hall criticised a risk assessment tool used by the Prison and Probation Service in England and Wales, which he said ""seriously minimised"" the severity of terrorism offences and ""accepted the offender's characterisation (and in some cases denials)"" of their crimes. ""It was suggested to me that one possible reason was that [the risk assessment tool] is often completed by a prison psychologist, in a therapeutic context in which the offender's 'buy-in' to the process is deemed to be particularly important,"" he said. Among other problems the report found a ""significant gap"" in the authorities' ability to monitor the risk of terrorism posed by ""dangerous"" offenders convicted of non-terror related offences. It also said opportunities to reduce the risk offenders posed was ""lost"" because of an ""unreliable"" flow of information about their behaviour in prison, such as comments ""glorifying"" terrorism, overheard by jail staff. Mr Hall added that there was a ""surprisingly limited"" circle of knowledge about terrorism offenders in the community, with police borough commanders in London ""not always aware"" of the identity of such individuals in their area. He called for a ""cultural shift"" so that information was shared more widely. The report, which makes 45 recommendations, was completed in May - three months aftera second attackinvolving a released terrorism prisoner. Sudesh Amman, had recently been freed from prison when he stabbed two people on Streatham High Road, in south London in February.

Johnson accused of 'governing in hindsight',"This video can not be played Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson must extend the job retention scheme as it was âdesperately neededâ. Boris Johnson was accused of ""governing in hindsight"" over a series of U-turns, as he appeared before MPs at PMQs for the first time since July. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed the prime minister was ""making it up as he goes along"". And he said even Mr Johnson's own MPs had ""run out of patience"" after what he claimed was 12 U-turns over the summer. The PM hit back by calling Sir Keir ""captain hindsight"" over the exam results debacle. He accused the Labour leader of ""leaping on a bandwagon, opposing a policy that he supported two weeks ago"". PMQs: As it happened Covid families reject PM's meeting excuse Why have there been so many U-turns? The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford claimed Mr Johnson had made eight U-turns this year - and he called for a ninth to extend the government's job retention scheme, which ends next month, echoing a call made by Sir Keir. The PM insisted ""indefinite furlough"" was not the answer to help the economy through the pandemic. With grumblings on the Tory benches about the government's recent performance Boris Johnson needed a good PMQs to mark the return to parliament. His political opponents - perhaps unsurprisingly - criticised the number of policy U-turns in recent months. While ministers have repeatedly said they're responding to changing science as the pandemic progresses, the speed and frequency of policy shifts is the crux of concern among some Conservative backbenchers. Keir Starmer returned to what some supporters have called a ""forensic"" style of questioning in pushing the prime minister for detail on the exam results crisis. Boris Johnson responded with a wide-ranging attack on the Labour leader which led to a tetchy exchange. But withanother shift in policy- this time on local lockdowns in Trafford and Bolton - taking place as the prime minister was at the dispatch box, it seems unlikely his performance was enough to silence critics - including those within his own party. In heated exchanges, Sir Keir told the PM: ""This has been a wasted summer. The government should have spent it preparing for the autumn and winter. ""Instead, they have lurched from crisis to crisis, U-turn to U-turn."" He accused the government of ""serial incompetence"", and asked: ""Will the prime minister take responsibility and finally get a grip?"" This video can not be played Ian Blackford calls on the government to âchange tack for a ninth timeâ and extend the job retention scheme. Mr Johnson hit back by citing a series of alleged U-turns made by Sir Keir in the past and - in a reference to his predecessor as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - accusing him of supporting ""an IRA-condoning politician who wanted to get out of Nato"". Speaker Sir Lindsey Hoyle intervened to warn the prime minster ""to answer the questions that have been put"" to him.

"BBC reverses Proms decision on Rule, Britannia!","The BBC has reversed its decision not to have Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory sung at The Last Night of the Proms. The U-turn follows fierce criticism sparked by reports that the lyrics were being dropped due to associations with colonialism and slavery. Last week, the BBC said the decision to perform orchestral-only versions was prompted by Covid-19 restrictions. However, a ""select"" group of singers will now perform the songs after all. ""The pandemic means a different Proms this year and one of the consequences, under Covid-19 restrictions, is we are not able to bring together massed voices,"" the BBC said in a new statement. ""For that reason we took the artistic decision not to sing Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory in the Hall."" But, the statement added, the BBC had been ""looking hard at what else might be possible"" and had found ""a solution"". The socially-distanced BBC Singers took part in the First Night of the Proms ""Both pieces will now include a select group of BBC Singers. This means the words will be sung in the Hall, and as we have always made clear, audiences will be free to sing along at home."" At The First Night of the Proms,18 socially-distanced members of the BBC Singers performed in the Royal Albert Hall's otherwise empty stalls, with the orchestra on stage. The BBC's original decision to play instrumental versions on the Last Night on 12 September prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene. ""I cannot believe... that the BBC is saying that they will not sing the words of Land of Hope And Glory or Rule Britannia! as they traditionally do at the end of The Last Night of The Proms,"" he told reporters last week. ""I think it's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general bout of self-recrimination and wetness."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""Confident forward-looking nations don't erase their history, they add to it."" On Wednesday, a Number 10 spokesman said the prime minister ""welcomes the decision"" to backtrack. Speaking to Conservative MPs, Mr Johnson said: ""I do think this country is going through an orgy of national embarrassment about some of the things that other people around the world love most about us. ""People love our traditions and our history with all its imperfections. It's crazy for us to go around trying to censor it. It's absolutely absurd and I think we should speak out loud and proud for the UK and our history."" Mr Dowden also gave his reaction. Allow Twitter content?

A spokesman for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was the ""right decision"", but added: ""Enjoying patriotic songs does not and should not be a barrier to examining our past and learning lessons from it."" Last week, the BBC said the move to drop the lyrics was down to the fact fewer performers could appear on stage because of social distancing rules. The songs would be performed as usual next year, the corporation pledged. Outgoing director general Tony Hall defended the ""creative conclusion"" that was reached, but admitted the question of dropping songs had been discussed. Lord Hall handed over to new director general Tim Davie on Tuesday. Those arguing that songs like Land of Hope and Glory shouldn't be performed included Chi-chi Nwanoku, who runs the Chineke! Orchestra, which performed at the Proms in 2017 and 2019. She told the BBC: ""We find it offensive. For any conscious black person who is aware of their history, the empire and colonialism, for example, they will struggle to enjoy the patriotic jingoism of these songs."" Broadcaster and choirmaster Gareth Malone also suggested the anthems were outdated, tweeting: ""It's time for Rule Britannia! to go.""

Moon booster rocket fired up in critical test,"This video can not be played Ignition: This solid rocket booster will be used for missions to the Moon Engineers have fired a booster rocket that will help send Americans back to the Moon in 2024. At 20:05 BST (15:05 EDT) the booster, which was secured to the ground, expelled an immense column of flame for two minutes. Two of these booster types will form part of Nasa's huge Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the biggest launcher built since the Saturn V in the 1960s. Wednesday's rocket firing was carried out at a test site in Promontory, Utah. The facility is operated by aerospace giant Northrop Grumman. The huge Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) provide most of the thrust in the first two minutes of the SLS's ride to space. The test was designed to investigate the performance and manufacturing quality of the booster's rocket motor. It will also help teams evaluate potential new materials, processes, and improvements for the boosters beyond the first landing on the Moon in 2024. Measuring 54m (177ft) long and 4m (12ft) wide, the SLS booster is the largest and most powerful solid propellant booster ever built. Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond Nasa crew describe rumbles and jolts of return Nasa astronauts make landmark splashdown Two SRBs sit on either side of the SLS core stage Designed to send the Orion spacecraft, astronauts and cargo to the Moon Consists of a core stage with two attached solid rocket boosters Four RS-25 engines sit at the base of the core stage; they're the same engines used on the space shuttle orbiter The core stage stands 98m (322ft) tall in its initial, or Block 1, configuration. The Block 1 SLS can send more than 27 metric tonnes (59,500 pounds) to orbits beyond the Moon. SLS will produce 8.8 million pounds (39.5 Meganewtons) of maximum thrust, 15% more than the Saturn V rocket used for the Apollo missions It burns around six tonnes of propellant every second, generating more thrust than 14 four-engine jumbo commercial airliners. Charles Precourt, vice president, propulsion systems at Northrop Grumman and a former Nasa astronaut, said: ""It's important to me to ensure we have what is necessary to establish a presence on the Moon and then go on to Mars. ""Testing our rocket boosters is how we can help ensure astronauts can explore space safely."" The SLS consists of a huge core stage with four engines at its base. Two SRBs are attached on each side of the core and provide 75% of the thrust during the first two minutes of the ascent to space. Both the core and boosters are derived from technology used in the space shuttle, which was retired in 2011. Able to produce a total thrust of more than eight million pounds, the SLS will supply the power necessary to launch crewed missions to the Moon, and eventually - it is hoped - Mars. Nasa plans to launch the giant rocket on its maiden flight next year. This mission, called Artemis 1, will see an unpiloted Orion capsule sent on a loop around the Moon. Teams at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center are already assembling the solid rocket boosters for this mission. For Artemis 2, four astronauts will travel around the Moon in 2023, followed a year later by the first crewed landing since 1972. Meanwhile, engineers in Mississippi have resumed their ""Green Run"" testing of the massive SLS core stage, after operations were paused in response to the threat from tropical storms Marco and Laura. The B-2 test stand at Nasa's Stennis Space Center, where the SLS core stage is being put through its paces The Green Run consists of eight tests, four of which have been completed since the core stage arrived at Nasa's Stennis Space Center near Bay St Louis in January. The fifth, which has just started, will aim to check out rocket controls and hydraulics. Nasa's head of human spaceflight Kathy Lueders said she hoped the programme could stay on track for a ""hot fire"" test in October. During the hot fire, all four of the powerful RS-25 engines at the base of the core stage are fired for about eight minutes - the time it takes for the SLS to get from the ground to orbit.

The most powerful elected US Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, has visited a hair salon in San Francisco, breaking rules that only allow service outdoors, in order to control the spread of coronavirus. Ms Pelosi was also seen with a face mask around her neck rather than over her mouth. She has criticised President Donald Trump for not wearing a mask. A spokesman said she did not realise she was breaking her home city's rules. Mr Trump said she was being ""decimated"" after lecturing everyone else. Thousands of California businesses have shut as part of measures to fight coronavirus.

Why men are less likely to wear face masks Defending her visit, spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement: ""This business offered for the Speaker to come in on Monday and told her they were allowed by the city to have one customer at a time in the business."" ""The Speaker complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment."" Mrs Pelosi has herself previously cited US Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommending that Americans wear face masks in public, especially when physical distancing measures are difficult. After Monday's appointment, the House speaker appeared on MSNBC with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. She told the network that Mr Trump had ""slapped science right in the face"" last week by allowing an audience of mainly mask-less invitees on the White House lawn to watch his speech to the Republican convention.

Fourteen on trial over Charlie Hebdo massacre,"Two gunmen killed 12 people in an attack on the magazine's office in 2015 Fourteen people are on trial in France over the deadly attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015. Most of the alleged accomplices are in court in Paris, but three are being tried in absentia. They are accused of helping the militant Islamist attackers who shot dead 12 people in and around Charlie Hebdo's Paris office in January 2015. In a related attack, a third gunman shot dead a policewoman, then attacked a Jewish store, killing four people. The 17 victims were killed over a period of three days. All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead. France marks five years since Paris massacre Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror How Europe deals with freed terror offenders Paris attacks: 'I am not Charlie' In the days following the January 2015 attacks, millions of people took part in solidarity marches across France and around the world under the slogan ""Je suis Charlie"" (I am Charlie). The magazine has marked the start of the trial by reprinting controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked protests in several Muslim countries. President Emmanuel Macron has since defended the freedom of the press and the French ""freedom to blaspheme, which is linked to freedom of conscience"". Eleven of the defendants were present in the courtroom on Wednesday. They gave their names and occupations, and all confirmed they intended to answer questions from the court. Survivors and relatives of the victims were also in court. Gala Renaud, the wife of one of the journalists killed, told reporters that you could ""already feel the tension"". ""I wanted to see the defendants in the box to see what they look like,"" she said, adding that she wanted to know ""what their motivations were, why this complicity and of course why innocent people were killed"". The trial is taking place amid tight security The trial has been delayed by almost four months because of the coronavirus pandemic. In March, the presiding judge said France's lockdown measures had made it impossible to bring together ""all the parties, witnesses and experts under the necessary sanitary conditions"". The alleged accomplices are accused of obtaining weapons and providing logistical support for the attack on Charlie Hebdo's office on 7 January 2015, as well as the subsequent attacks on a police officer and the Hyper Cacher supermarket. Three of the suspects are believed to have disappeared in northern Syria and Iraq and will be tried in absentia. Some reports suggest at least two of them were killed in bombing campaigns against the Islamic State group (IS). All three remain the subject of international arrest warrants. There are about 200 plaintiffs in the trial and survivors of the attacks are expected to testify. Millions of people joined solidarity rallies following the attacks in January 2015 On Monday, anti-terror prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard dismissed the suggestion that it was just ""little helpers"" who were facing justice. ""It is about individuals who are involved in the logistics, the preparation of the events, who provided means of financing, operational material, weapons [and] a residence,"" he told France Info radio. ""All this is essential to the terrorist action."" Among those present in court is Lassana Bathily, a Malian-born Muslim employee of the Jewish supermarketwho hid customers from the attackand was later granted French citizenship. The trial is expected to last until November. Eleven defendants are in the courtroom at the start of this 49-day trial, sitting under heavy guard in two glassed cubicles. All are in masks, so it is hard to read their emotions. For family members of the 17 victims, these are emotional moments. More than five years have passed, but much remains to be explained about how the attacks were prepared. The full extent of any co-operation between the Charlie Hebdo attackers and the supermarket gunman, for example, is not at all apparent. Nor is it clear what co-ordination there was with leaders of the groups to whom they paid allegiance - al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Islamic State. Another aspect that will be highlighted is the link between Islamist terror and petty delinquency in the high-immigration suburbs. On 7 January that year, two French Muslim gunmen - brothers ChÃ©rif and SaÃ¯d Kouachi - stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo in the Rue Nicolas-Appert before opening fire on its staff. The magazine's editor at the time,StÃ©phane Charbonnier, better known as Charb,was among four celebrated cartoonists who were killed. This video can not be played Footage taken from a rooftop in Paris shows two gunmen firing shots The gunmen were eventually killed by security forces after a lengthy manhunt. Their victims were eight journalists, two police officers, a caretaker and a visitor. In a related attack just days later, jihadist gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed three customers and an employee in a hostage siege at the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket in Porte de Vincennes in the east of Paris. He had earlier shot dead a policewoman in the city. Security forces eventually stormed the supermarket before killing him and freeing the remaining hostages. They include 35-year-oldAli Reza Polat, who is seen as the main link between the two attacks and is believed to have had a key role in obtaining the weapons used. He subsequently attempted to flee to Dubai, Lebanon and Syria but without success. MickaÃ«l Pastor Alwatik'sDNA was found on two guns discovered at Coulibaly's home and a glove at the scene.Mohamed Fareshas told investigators he was a middleman involved in the sale of the assault rifle used in the supermarket attack, whileAmir Ramdani, Samir Makhlouf,Willy PrevostandChristophe Raumelare accused of having provided support. Hayat Boumedienne was reportedly seen in Syria last year Two people in Belgium - garage ownerMetin Karasularand his associateMichel Catino,an unemployed Italian in his 60s - and two more in north-eastern France - garage ownerMiguel Martinezand his associateAbdelaziz Abbad- are accused of supplying ""assault rifles, automatic pistols, rocket launchers, chargers and ammunition, bulletproof vests"" to the three gunmen. On trial in absentia isHayat Boumedienne, Coulibaly's partner. She fled France for Syria a week before the attack. Previously believed killed in a US air strike last year, French media reports now suggest she may still be alive. A female French jihadist questioned by security services as she tried to re-enter France told them that she had seen Hayat Boumedienne in the al-Hol camp for IS detainees last October and that Hayat Boumedienne had then escaped from the camp. Mohamed and Mehdi Belhoucineare accused of helping Hayat Boumedienne get to Syria. Both are believed to have been killed in Syria or Iraq. Mohamed Belhoucine also provided email addresses used by the other defendants. The radical weekly magazine was well known for taking swipes at the French establishment and religion and has long drawn controversy. Cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad brought Charb death threats as well as 24-hour police protection prior to his death. There was also a petrol bomb attack on the magazine's offices in 2011. The issue of depicting the Prophet Muhammad The publication has also been seen as a beacon for free speech, with many of its defenders using the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie to defend it. Editor StÃ©phane Charbonnier was among four celebrated cartoonists who were killed Charb strongly defended the Prophet Muhammad cartoons as symbolic of freedom of speech. ""I don't blame Muslims for not laughing at our drawings,"" he told the Associated Press in 2012. ""I live under French law. I don't live under Koranic law."" And on Tuesday,the magazine republished the cartoons that made them a target in 2015. ""We have always refused to do so, not because it is prohibited... but because there was a need for a good reason to do it,"" an editorial said. It added: ""To reproduce these cartoons in the week the trial begins over the January 2015 terrorist attacks seemed essential to us."" On Wednesday, Egypt's top Islamic authority, al-Azhar University, said publishing the ""offensive cartoons"" was a ""criminal act"". Their publication ""reinforces hate speech and will whip up the feelings of believers"", al-Azhar's Observatory for Combating Extremism said. The observatory also reiterated its ""strong condemnation"" of the Charlie Hebdo attack.

"Ofqual said grading system 'fundamental mistake""","England's exams regulator, Ofqual, says it was a ""fundamental mistake"" to think the public would accept an emergency grading system instead of exam results. Chairman Roger Taylor said Ofqual advised ministers to hold socially-distanced exams or delay them. If these two options were unworkable, then calculated grades could be used, he said Ofqual had advised. Mr Taylor said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson cancelled exams without further reference to Ofqual. Labour said it was ""now clear"" that Mr Williamson was responsible for the exams chaos and that he should not blame Ofqual. But a spokesman for the Department for Education said that the decision to cancel exams had been a ""necessary step to fight the spread of coronavirus"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used Prime Minister's Questions to challenge Boris Johnson over when he first knew there was a problem with the algorithm for deciding grades. Mr Johnson defended his government's record, accusing Sir Keir of being ""Captain Hindsight"". Ofqual chief Sally Collier steps down after exam chaos Boris Johnson blames 'mutant algorithm' for exam problems How did the algorithm decide exam grades? ""We did institute a change, we did act,"" and students did get their grades, said the prime minister. Sally Collier resigned over the exams chaos But Mr Taylor told MPs on the Commons education select committee: ""The fundamental mistake was to believe this [system] would ever be acceptable to the public."" Mr Williamson took the decision to cancel exams when schools were closed by the coronavirus and increasing number of teachers were shielding. Ofqual had to develop a system to award grades for exams which pupils could no longer take. This produced a moderation process that saw 40% of A-level grades being lower than the grades estimated by their schools. But Mr Taylor defended Ofqual's approach to calculating grades, saying it was trying to carry out ministerial guidelines. He argued that the system of standardising grades, the so-called ""algorithm"", would on the whole have helped disadvantaged pupils. Students were left uncertain about grades in U-turns over exam results The Ofqual chairman said that in March the regulator had been consulted by the Department for Education about the implications of cancelling exams. At this point, Ofqual said there were four options: to delay exams until the virus crisis passed conduct socially distanced exams use some form of teacher and school-assessed certificates or to combine school-based assessments with the standardisation model to produce estimated grades Mr Taylor said that he and his officials had repeatedly warned the Department for Education of the risks of using estimated grades. Julie Swann, Ofqual's executive director for general qualifications, said a paper on May 1 ""highlighted the risk of widespread dissatisfaction"" from students, schools and colleges. But after problems and inconsistencies emerged with grades, the moderation process was ditched in a U-turn, and teachers' grades were used instead. The chief regulator, Sally Collier, resigned and the Department for Education's most senior civil servant, Jonathan Slater, stepped down following the exams chaos. Mr Taylor, also revealed Ofqual guidance on using ""valid mock"" exam results to widen the appeals process, was removed from the Ofqual website after an intervention from England's education secretary. Results for this year's exams were caught up in confusion Mr Williamson had decided to allow mock exam results to be used as evidence in appeals over grades. Mr Taylor said Mr Williamson telephoned the chief regulator, Sally Collier, late on a Saturday night, August 15, after Ofqual published new appeals guidance, saying it was not consistent with the education secretary's policy. Ofqual, which is independent from government, had been trying to formulate a way for such appeals to work, while meeting its statutory duty to ensure exams were fair. Mr Taylor said the board then met in emergency session to try to find a way through a situation which was rapidly ""spinning out of control"". ""We advised the Secretary of State at this point that we could not be confident that this could be delivered within the statutory duties of Ofqual to ensure that valid and trustworthy grades were being issued."" Discussions followed throughout Sunday, in which it became clear that a move to ""centre assessed grades"", which had been submitted by schools and colleges, was all but inevitable. Mr Williamson went on to announce that results would use these centre assessed grades in a major U-turn. A Department for Education spokesman said the ""government never wanted to cancel exams because they are the best and fairest form of assessment. ""We listened to views from a range of parties, including Ofqual, and given the public health requirements at the time, made what was a very difficult decision on the basis that it was a necessary step to fight the spread of coronavirus.""

Record 400-plus migrants cross Channel in one day,"Small children were among those arriving in Dover after crossing the English Channel More than 400 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats - a record for a single day. Border Force has intercepted 416 people, including young children, on board 28 boats, the Home Office has confirmed. Some of the migrants were carrying children too young to walk. Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier on Wednesday said the UK had become ""a target and a magnet for those who would exploit vulnerable people in this way"". More than 100 migrants arrived in Dover after being picked up by Border Force and RNLI vessels A further 53 people were rescued by French authorities after getting into difficulties before reaching British waters. Some 145 people had crossed the Channel in 18 small boats on Tuesday. Rough seas brought on by Storm Francis made crossings impossible at the end of August, but conditions have improved in the first two days of September. French authorities rescued 53 people on Wednesday Speaking in the Commons during Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""I have a great deal of sympathy with those who are desperate as to put their children in dinghies or in children's paddling pools and try to cross the channel. ""But I have to say what they're doing is falling prey to criminal gangs and they are breaking the law."" He added: ""It also undermines the legitimate claims of others who seek asylum in this country. ""We will address the rigidities in our laws that make this country, I'm afraid, a target and a magnet for those who would exploit vulnerable people in this way."" One group landed at Shakespeare Beach in Dover More than 1,468 migrants made the crossing by small boat in August despite a vow from Home Secretary Priti Patel to make the dangerous route ""unviable"". The Home Office does not provide information on how many children are making the crossing on small boats. Home Office minister Chris Philp told the Commons on Wednesday the government was attempting to return 1,000 people who had arrived in the UK, having ""previously claimed asylum in European countries, and under the regulations legally should be returned there"".

Back to school after the long summer shutdown,"The first day back for pupils at Riverside School in east London Millions of pupils in England and Wales are returning to school after the unprecedented shutdown during the coronavirus pandemic. Schools will look different, with one-way systems, screens keeping pupils apart and staggered start times. Many pupils will be given inductions so they understand the new rules, such as staying in their ""bubble"" groups and where to use social distancing. Teachers will assess how much pupils need to catch up after a long absence. Schools are beginning to return in England Wales this week - although there will be a mix of starting dates, with some schools having training days as staff prepare for new safety measures. In Scotland and Northern Ireland schools have already opened for the new academic year. Pupils wearing masks to school - but will not be expected to wear them in the classroom Godsway Dzoboku, principal of Outwood Academy Portland, in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, has re-organised classroom desks into rows, with each child being given a personalised pack of rulers, pens and other classroom equipment. ""The only way we can make bubbles work is to keep them [the pupils] in year groups - so we have a bubble of 300,"" Mr Dzoboku said. Parents get advice for first-day nerves at school I'm back at school - can I hug my friends? What your children will see when they return to school In pictures: Mixed feelings as pupils go back Pupils in Whitley Bay heading to school for first day back Each bubble will stick together, go to a staggered lunch and a staggered break together, he added, and each group has been allocated a corridor within the school in which they will stay and be taught. By Judith Burns education reporter There's something of a party atmosphere outside the gates of Riverside School in Barking, east London. Nervous Year 7s say goodbye to their parents who have accompanied them to their first day at their new secondary school. Pupils make their way inside Riverside School in Barking, east London Parents are not allowed inside and the children line up in the playground in single file and in silence. Year 11s and Year 13s greet each other and then head inside to begin two days of diagnostic exams. ""It may sound a bit cruel but we need to know where we're at,"" says head Andrew Roberts. The exam years are the ones he's most concerned about, he says. ""Today we're assessing them,"" he says. ""To get an idea of the impact on each individual."" Head teacher Andrew Roberts says the exam years will be a priority He says they have missed three months of learning since the lockdown began - and they need to be ready for crucial GCSEs and A-levels in less than a year's time. Delani, aged 11 says he is feeling ""pretty OK"" about his first day. ""I was quite scared but I've seen a lot of familiar faces,"" he says. Getting ready for the new term after months out of school He has a face mask in his pocket but the school has decided they're not needed. His mum, Heather, a university administrator says she's fairly confident that the benefits of being back at school outweigh the risks. From what she has read, she says the pandemic could go on for a very long time. So the children need to be back in school and the parents need to get back to work. Imole, aged 11, says coronavirus ""messed everything up"". He was sorry to miss most of his last year in primary school, even the end of year SATs tests. He's standing at the gates of his new secondary school - a bit apprehensive. ""A lot of stuff is going to change,"" he says. Aisha, also 11, is ""nervous and excited"". ""It's scary moving from a school where I knew everyone to a school where I don't,"" she says. Mum Rasheedat says she's ""confident"" her daughter will be safe from the virus at her new school: ""I'm not really worried"". PPE at lunch and one-way systems â the new school term What are the risks that schools will spread coronavirus? Portable loos and PPE: Teachers on the return to school It has been almost six months since schools were closed by the lockdown. They soon reopened to vulnerable pupils and key worker children, but only a fraction of the national school population returned to any form of face-to-face lessons over the summer term. Hand washing at the beginning of school in Doncaster The rest were required to carry on learning from home, but levels of support and interactive teaching have been very different from place to place. It is not clear how many parents will have sent their children back, with no official figures yet, although attendance is compulsory. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union said that, thanks to the preparations by school staff, ""the signs are at the moment that it's a very calm and managed and positive return"". ""There will be lots of nervous children and young people this morning,"" she said. ""I'm sure when they get into school they will be reassured by the routines and be really glad to be back with their teachers and their friends."" Children with a new classroom lay out at a school in Southwark, south London But teachers and head teachers have criticised the lack of funding for safety measures, such as hand-washing stations, sanitiser, and screens. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said it was ""hugely disappointing"" that these changes had to be paid for out of ""hard-pressed budgets"". England's schools minister Nick Gibb has said funding for safety measures is ""under review"", although Ms Bousted said the government was acting too slowly. Pupils lining up for a new year in Barking, east London Mr Gibb has also urged parents to send their children back to catch up on missed lesssons, saying: ""Schools are doing everything they can to make sure that their pupils and their staff are safe."" Some recent polls suggest families are keen to see children back in class, but others have not been so positive. In Scotland, where pupils returned several weeks ago,official statistics show one in 10 pupils is absent, although ministers and teachers have suggested cold and flu viruses are mostly to blame. But there are parents who are worried. Mother of two, Sally, has a chronic form of blood cancer and has been shielding since March. She told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme she was keen for her children to get back to school to continue their education and see their friends. ""But I do have concerns that it's exposing me to additional risks."" Back to school -but not as you know it When they return home school, she said: ""I won't be giving them a hug, unfortunately - I'll be keeping my distance as much as I can, otherwise it will be life as normal, hopefully."" Pupils returning to secondary schools will find whole sections of school buildings cordoned off to some groups, but open to others as head teachers strive to keep groups apart. Screens have been erected to keep pupils separate And there will be reduced movement of pupils around schools, with classes and year groups staying in a small number of rooms, while their individual subject teachers come to them to teach. Pupils can be required to wear face coverings in busy areas, such as corridors, and lessons like physical education will be very different, with all contact sports still banned. Many will already be wearing face coverings on public transport to school. And there are concerns about the impact on schools if there are further local outbreaks. If a school has a positive case it will work with local health officials to assess how many other pupils should go home and isolate. It could be just those who have been in close contact with the pupil, or an entire ""bubble"" group, which could be an entire year group in secondary schools.

Cosmic signal rattles Earth after 7 billion years,"An artist's impression of the last moments before the merger of two black holes Imagine the energy of eight Suns released in an instant. This is the gravitational ""shockwave"" that spread out from the biggest merger yet observed between two black holes. The signal from this event travelled for some seven billion years to reach Earth but was still sufficiently strong to rattle laser detectors in the US and Italy in May last year. Researchers say the colliding black holes produced a single entity with a mass 142 times that of our Sun. This is noteworthy. Science has long traced the presence of black holes on the sky that are quite a bit smaller or even very much larger. But this new observation inaugurates a novel class of so-called intermediate-sized black holes in the range of 100-1,000 Sun (or solar) masses. The analysis is the latest to come out of the internationalLIGO,external-VIRGO,externalcollaboration, which operates three super-sensitive gravitational wave-detection systems in America and Europe. 'Black neutron star' discovery changes astronomy Breathtaking new map of the X-ray Universe Dancing gargantuan black holes perform on cue This video can not be played Simulation: The black hole collision produced a train of gravitational waves A black hole is a region of space where matter has collapsed in on itself The gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape Black holes will emerge from the explosive demise of certain large stars But some are truly gargantuan and are billions of times the mass of our Sun How these monsters - found at galaxy centres - formed is unknown Black holes are detected from the way they influence their surroundings They produce observable gravitational waves as they spiral in to each other The collaboration's laser interferometer instruments ""listen"" for the vibrations in space-time that are generated by truly cataclysmic cosmic events - and on 21 May, 2019, they were all triggered by a sharp signal lasting just one-tenth of a second. Computer algorithms determined the source to be the end-stage moments of two in-spiralling black holes - one with a mass 66 times that of our Sun, and the other with 85 solar masses. The distance to the merger was calculated to be the equivalent of 150 billion trillion km. ""It's astounding, really,"" said Prof Nelson Christensen from the CÃ´te d'Azur Observatory in France. ""This signal propagated for seven billion years. So this event happened 'just before halftime' for the Universe, and now it's mechanically moved our detectors here on Earth,"" he explained to BBC News. The European VIRGO laser lab is based in Italy's province of Pisa Gravitational waves are a prediction of the General Theory of Relativity It took decades to develop the technology to directly detect them They are ripples in the fabric of space-time generated by violent events Accelerating masses will produce waves that propagate at the speed of light Detectable sources include merging black holes and neutron stars LIGO-VIRGO fire lasers into long, L-shaped tunnels; the waves disturb the light Detecting the waves opens up the Universe to completely new investigations The involvement of an 85-solar-mass object in the collision has made collaboration scientists sit up because their understanding of how black holes form from the death of a star can't really account for something on this scale. Stars, when they exhaust their nuclear fuel, will experience an explosive core collapse to produce a black hole - if they're sufficiently big. But the physics that's assumed to operate inside stars suggests the production of black holes in the particular mass range between 65 and 120 solar masses is impossible. Dying stars that might yield such entities actually tear themselves apart and leave nothing behind. If the science is correct on this point then the most likely explanation for the existence of an 85-solar-mass object is that it was itself the result of an even earlier black hole union. And that, believes Prof Martin Hendry, from Glasgow University, UK, has implications for how the Universe evolved. ""We're talking here about a hierarchy of mergers, a possible pathway to make bigger and bigger black holes,"" he said. ""So, who knows? This 142-solar-mass black hole may have gone on to have merged with other very massive black holes - as part of a build-up process that goes all the way to those supermassive black holes we think are at the heart of galaxies."" The discovery suggests there is a hierarchy of mergers that lead to ever bigger black holes The LIGO-VIRGO collaboration is reporting the 21 May, 2019, event (catalogued as GW190521) in two scholarly papers. One isin the journal Physical Review Letters,externaland describes the discovery. The second can be foundin The Astrophysical Journal Letters,external, and discusses the signal's physical properties and scientific implications. GW190521 is one of over 50 gravitational wave triggers presently being investigated at the laser laboratories. The pace of research has increased rapidly since the collaboration made its first,Nobel-Prize-winning detection of gravitational waves in 2015. ""We are increasing the sensitivity of the detectors and, yes, we could end up making more than one detection a day. We will have a rain of black holes! But this is beautiful because we will learn so much more about them,"" Prof Alessandra Buonanno, director at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, told BBC News. Hubble delivers stunning 30th birthday picture Twisting jet observed at supermassive black hole Gravitational waves: So many new toys to unwrap A laser is fed into the machine and its beam is split along two paths The separate paths bounce back and forth between damped mirrors Eventually, the two light parts are recombined and sent to a detector Gravitational waves passing through the lab should disturb the set-up Theory holds they should very subtly stretch and squeeze its space This ought to show itself as a change in the lengths of the light arms The photodetector captures this signal in the recombined beam The laser labs are constantly being upgraded to improve their sensitivity Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Back to school after the long summer shutdownPupils are back at school in England and Wales this week, but are finding changes to make them safer.","The first day back for pupils at Riverside School in east London Millions of pupils in England and Wales are returning to school after the unprecedented shutdown during the coronavirus pandemic. Schools will look different, with one-way systems, screens keeping pupils apart and staggered start times. Many pupils will be given inductions so they understand the new rules, such as staying in their ""bubble"" groups and where to use social distancing. Teachers will assess how much pupils need to catch up after a long absence. Schools are beginning to return in England Wales this week - although there will be a mix of starting dates, with some schools having training days as staff prepare for new safety measures. In Scotland and Northern Ireland schools have already opened for the new academic year. Pupils wearing masks to school - but will not be expected to wear them in the classroom Godsway Dzoboku, principal of Outwood Academy Portland, in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, has re-organised classroom desks into rows, with each child being given a personalised pack of rulers, pens and other classroom equipment. ""The only way we can make bubbles work is to keep them [the pupils] in year groups - so we have a bubble of 300,"" Mr Dzoboku said. Parents get advice for first-day nerves at school I'm back at school - can I hug my friends? What your children will see when they return to school In pictures: Mixed feelings as pupils go back Pupils in Whitley Bay heading to school for first day back Each bubble will stick together, go to a staggered lunch and a staggered break together, he added, and each group has been allocated a corridor within the school in which they will stay and be taught. By Judith Burns education reporter There's something of a party atmosphere outside the gates of Riverside School in Barking, east London. Nervous Year 7s say goodbye to their parents who have accompanied them to their first day at their new secondary school. Pupils make their way inside Riverside School in Barking, east London Parents are not allowed inside and the children line up in the playground in single file and in silence. Year 11s and Year 13s greet each other and then head inside to begin two days of diagnostic exams. ""It may sound a bit cruel but we need to know where we're at,"" says head Andrew Roberts. The exam years are the ones he's most concerned about, he says. ""Today we're assessing them,"" he says. ""To get an idea of the impact on each individual."" Head teacher Andrew Roberts says the exam years will be a priority He says they have missed three months of learning since the lockdown began - and they need to be ready for crucial GCSEs and A-levels in less than a year's time. Delani, aged 11 says he is feeling ""pretty OK"" about his first day. ""I was quite scared but I've seen a lot of familiar faces,"" he says. Getting ready for the new term after months out of school He has a face mask in his pocket but the school has decided they're not needed. His mum, Heather, a university administrator says she's fairly confident that the benefits of being back at school outweigh the risks. From what she has read, she says the pandemic could go on for a very long time. So the children need to be back in school and the parents need to get back to work. Imole, aged 11, says coronavirus ""messed everything up"". He was sorry to miss most of his last year in primary school, even the end of year SATs tests. He's standing at the gates of his new secondary school - a bit apprehensive. ""A lot of stuff is going to change,"" he says. Aisha, also 11, is ""nervous and excited"". ""It's scary moving from a school where I knew everyone to a school where I don't,"" she says. Mum Rasheedat says she's ""confident"" her daughter will be safe from the virus at her new school: ""I'm not really worried"". PPE at lunch and one-way systems â the new school term What are the risks that schools will spread coronavirus? Portable loos and PPE: Teachers on the return to school It has been almost six months since schools were closed by the lockdown. They soon reopened to vulnerable pupils and key worker children, but only a fraction of the national school population returned to any form of face-to-face lessons over the summer term. Hand washing at the beginning of school in Doncaster The rest were required to carry on learning from home, but levels of support and interactive teaching have been very different from place to place. It is not clear how many parents will have sent their children back, with no official figures yet, although attendance is compulsory. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union said that, thanks to the preparations by school staff, ""the signs are at the moment that it's a very calm and managed and positive return"". ""There will be lots of nervous children and young people this morning,"" she said. ""I'm sure when they get into school they will be reassured by the routines and be really glad to be back with their teachers and their friends."" Children with a new classroom lay out at a school in Southwark, south London But teachers and head teachers have criticised the lack of funding for safety measures, such as hand-washing stations, sanitiser, and screens. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said it was ""hugely disappointing"" that these changes had to be paid for out of ""hard-pressed budgets"". England's schools minister Nick Gibb has said funding for safety measures is ""under review"", although Ms Bousted said the government was acting too slowly. Pupils lining up for a new year in Barking, east London Mr Gibb has also urged parents to send their children back to catch up on missed lesssons, saying: ""Schools are doing everything they can to make sure that their pupils and their staff are safe."" Some recent polls suggest families are keen to see children back in class, but others have not been so positive. In Scotland, where pupils returned several weeks ago,official statistics show one in 10 pupils is absent, although ministers and teachers have suggested cold and flu viruses are mostly to blame. But there are parents who are worried. Mother of two, Sally, has a chronic form of blood cancer and has been shielding since March. She told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme she was keen for her children to get back to school to continue their education and see their friends. ""But I do have concerns that it's exposing me to additional risks."" Back to school -but not as you know it When they return home school, she said: ""I won't be giving them a hug, unfortunately - I'll be keeping my distance as much as I can, otherwise it will be life as normal, hopefully."" Pupils returning to secondary schools will find whole sections of school buildings cordoned off to some groups, but open to others as head teachers strive to keep groups apart. Screens have been erected to keep pupils separate And there will be reduced movement of pupils around schools, with classes and year groups staying in a small number of rooms, while their individual subject teachers come to them to teach. Pupils can be required to wear face coverings in busy areas, such as corridors, and lessons like physical education will be very different, with all contact sports still banned. Many will already be wearing face coverings on public transport to school. And there are concerns about the impact on schools if there are further local outbreaks. If a school has a positive case it will work with local health officials to assess how many other pupils should go home and isolate. It could be just those who have been in close contact with the pupil, or an entire ""bubble"" group, which could be an entire year group in secondary schools.

Navalny 'Novichok poisoning' a test for the West,"Alexei Navalny was flown to Berlin for treatment in August after falling ill The German government's announcement on Wednesday that Russian opposition figureAlexei Navalny has been poisoned by a sophisticated nerve agent known as a Novichokmakes this case even more serious than it already was. Most importantly, it will increase suspicions that, despite its denials, the Russian state was behind his poisoning. Novichok - meaning ""newcomer"" in Russian - applies to a group of synthetically produced nerve agents originally developed by the Soviet Union in a laboratory in Uzbekistan before the USSR disintegrated in 1991. Western intelligence agencies believe that Novichok has since been refined into a hard-to-detect assassination weapon in covert techniques practised by operatives of the GRU, Russian military intelligence, including being smeared on to door handles. Novichok can be deployed in both liquid and solid forms. What are Novichok nerve agents? Two of those operatives were widely believed to have poisoned the Russian defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in 2018 using Novichok. A local Wiltshire resident, Dawn Sturgess, subsequently died after handling the contents of the discarded perfume bottle used to disguise the nerve agent. This video can not be played On the trail of Russians Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who UK police believe carried out a nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018 Western governments reacted forcefully to this failed assassination attempt on British soil. In a co-ordinated move, 20 countries expelled more than a hundred Russian diplomats and spies, dealing a huge blow to Moscow's intelligence-gathering networks in the West. Even covert agents in deep cover inside Britain, whom Moscow believed were operating undetected by MI5, the security service, were ordered to leave. This was all in marked contrast to the mild British government response - since criticised - to the poisoning of former KGB officer and defector Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. After the agonising death in a London hospital by radioactive Polonium poisoning of this former Russian colonel, branded as a traitor by the Kremlin, an investigation dragged on for years while the two Russian suspects remained at large in Russia. Critics believe the lack of a forceful response by the West encouraged hardliners in the Kremlin to sanction the targeting abroad of those considered traitors to the Russian state. This video can not be played Alexei Navalny: 'Putin is the tsar of corruption' Today, Alexei Navalny has no shortage of enemies. As a vigorous campaigner against corruption, he has amassed millions of young followers but also angered those people whose nefarious activities have been exposed in his popular videos. There are plenty of people both in government and in business circles who would like to see him removed from the public sphere. But Novichok, unlike naturally occurring toxins that can be refined from natural products found in the countryside, is not something casually cooked up by amateurs. It is a military-grade chemical weapon that tends to point the finger of suspicion towards the Russian state. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Although Mr Navalny appeared to be poisoned on Russian soil, rather than in a Nato member country, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""there were now very serious questions which only the Russian government could and must answer"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab echoed that comment, saying that the Russian government had a clear case to answer about what happened to Mr Navalny. He said Britain would now work closely with Germany and other allies to show there were consequences for using banned chemical weapons. In Washington, the White House National Security Council issued a statement saying it would work with allies to hold those in Russia accountable. The former British Army officer and chemical weapons expert, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, has been warning for years that the unchecked use of chemical weapons against rebels and civilians alike in populated areas by the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria sends a dangerous signal. How governments now react to this latest use of a Novichok nerve agent against a public political figure will be influenced in part by the findings of the global chemical watchdog, the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons, the OPCW. The chairman of Britain's Parliamentary Defence Committee, Tobias Ellwood MP, tweeted: ""Russia/Novichok - again. A test for the West on how we collectively respond.""

Navalny and Russiaâs arsenal of exotic poisons,"An emergency airlift to Berlin from Omsk was organised for Mr Navalny Several prominent critics of Kremlin policies - ex-spies, journalists and politicians - have been poisoned in the past two decades. In the UK, two Russian ex-secret service agents were targeted: Alexander Litvinenko fatally with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006, and Sergei Skripal with the toxic nerve agent Novichok in 2018. The Kremlin denied any involvement. Alexei Navalny, who has been physically attacked before, appears to be the latest victim. Yet much remains unclear. Mysterious poisonings involving Russians often remain mysterious - a distinct advantage for assassins, compared with say an old-fashioned shooting in the street. Prof Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC that ""poison has two characteristics: subtlety and theatricality"". ""It's so subtle that you can deny it, or make it harder to prove. And it takes time to work, there's all kinds of agony, and the poisoner can deny it with a sly wink, so everyone gets the hint."" Alexei Navalny is Russia's best-known anti-corruption campaigner and opposition activist. His slick, hard-hitting videos on social media have drawn many millions of views, and made him a thorn in the side of the Kremlin. For years Mr Navalny has rallied his supporters across Russia A victim poisoned before a long flight can be stuck in the air long enough for the assassin to make an easy getaway. Mr Navalny, 44, fell acutely ill on a flight from Tomsk in Siberia on 20 August - so ill that it had to be diverted to Omsk. Russian investigative reporter and Putin critic Anna Politkovskaya, shot dead in 2006, claimed to have been poisoned on a flight to the North Caucasus in 2004, when she felt sick and fainted. Similarly, a slow-acting poison - polonium-210 - killed Litvinenko excruciatingly and it was weeks before the rare toxin was identified. As an alpha-particle emitter its radiation was not detected by a Geiger counter. The two alleged Russian killers - state agents, according to the subsequent UK inquiry - had plenty of time to fly home unsuspected. Mr Navalny has accumulated many enemies in Russia, not just among supporters of President Vladimir Putin, whose United Russia party he labels ""the party of crooks and thieves"". Mr Putin was a secret service officer in the Soviet KGB before becoming president in 2000. Kremlin dismisses claims Putin poisoned Navalny Mr Galeotti says that in this case ""the Russian state seems to have been caught off-balance, which implies it wasn't a centrally planned operation"". ""This suggests it was the act of a powerful Russian, but not necessarily the state."" Now fighting for his life in Berlin's CharitÃ© hospital, Mr Navalny is in an induced coma, being treated for ""poisoning with a substance from the group of cholinesterase inhibitors"". The hospital says the specific toxin remains unknown - tests are being done to identify it. But the poison's effect - inhibition of the enzyme cholinesterase in the body - ""was confirmed by multiple tests in independent laboratories"". That is the effect of military nerve agents, such as sarin, VX or the even more toxic Novichok. They interfere with the brain's chemical signals to the muscles, causing spasms, shortness of breath, heart palpitations and collapse. Germany has imposed tight security at Berlin's CharitÃ© hospital Mr Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh suspects that poison was slipped into the cup of black tea he drank at a Tomsk airport cafe. He had not eaten anything before the flight, she says. That ominously echoes the case of Litvinenko, who drank poisoned tea in a London hotel. A deadly trail of polonium Skripal poisoning: Third man 'commanded attack' A prominent anti-Putin activist based in the US, Vladimir Kara-Murza, says he suffered similar symptoms to Mr Navalny's in 2015 and 2017. His alleged poisoning remains a mystery. Poison, he told the BBC, ""is becoming sort of a favoured tool of Russian security services"" and ""a sadistic tool"". ""It is excruciating to go through this... I had to learn to walk again after the first poisoning and coma."" This video can not be played Vladimir Kara-Murza on the dangers to President Putin's critics When the plane landed in Omsk on 20 August medics rushed Mr Navalny into intensive care already comatose, and put him on a ventilator. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov says the Berlin doctors' diagnosis of poisoning is not yet conclusive, so it is too early to launch an official investigation. Earlier he said the Kremlin wished Mr Navalny well, when permission was granted to fly him to Berlin. There is speculation that the delay in Omsk, before Mr Navalny's transfer to Berlin, could have helped erase traces of the poison. The Omsk doctors have also been criticised for suggesting that the problem was a ""low blood sugar level"" and apparently failing to spot nerve agent symptoms. Dr Konstantin Balonov, a US-based anaesthesiologist, told BBC Russian that that failure was ""strange, to say the least"". Moscow toxicologists also consulted the Omsk doctors and ""they must have concluded that it was a toxin from that [chemical] group"". There are suspicions of a cover-up, as unidentified police were quickly on the scene, blocking access. The doctors insisted that no poison was detected in Mr Navalny's urine.

But Mikhail Fremderman, previously an intensive care specialist in St Petersburg, said that ""in poisoning cases such as this, atropine must be given intravenously, for a long period"". That may not have happened in Omsk, he told BBC Russian, adding that the medical data has not been released. Prof Alastair Hay, a leading British toxicologist and chemical weapons expert, says this type of nerve agent is at the ""extremely toxic"" end of a broad spectrum of organophosphates. That large group of possible poisons makes the agent already hard to identify. Some much milder organophosphates are used in insecticide and in medical therapies. ""It only requires a small dose to kill someone, which can be effectively disguised in a drink,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played Work carried out at Porton Down is normally highly classified There are yet more advantages, from the assassin's point of view. ""A simple blood test doesn't tell you what the agent is - you need a more sophisticated test, very expensive equipment. Many hospital labs don't have that expertise,"" Prof Hay said. In the UK, that capability is restricted to Porton Down, a high-security chemical and biological research centre. The UK and Russia are among 190 signatories to the global Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans chemical weapons use and research, beyond small quantities allowed for developing antidotes and protective equipment. After the Cold War Russia destroyed its vast chemical weapons stockpile - about 40,000 tonnes - under international supervision, Prof Hay noted. A biopsy on Georgi Markov revealed this tiny pellet, believed to have contained ricin Exotic chemicals were also used in some Cold War ""hits"" - for example the notorious umbrella killing of Bulgarian anti-communist journalist Georgi Markov in London in 1978. At the time Bulgaria was an ally of the Soviet Union. The suspected poison was ricin, released from a tiny pellet found in the autopsy. The killer had stabbed it straight into Markov's bloodstream with the umbrella - a far more potent delivery method than if he had swallowed it.

Russia's vociferous Putin critic,"Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny was long the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin. The 47-year-old blogger had survived poisoning attempts and years in some of Russia's most notorious jails, after his group had exposed corruption at almost every level of the Russian state - frequently targeting President Putin himself. Even from behind bars, unable to challenge the president at the ballot box, his voice had retained power. But in February 2024, it fell silent. According to the prison service, he had gone for a walk when he lost consciousness and died. Navalny was often asked: Do you fear for your life? Navalnyâs life in 'Polar Wolf' remote penal colony In the immediate aftermath, the Kremlin simply said that it was aware of his death, and the president had been informed. Across the world, however, there was shock and anger, as tributes were paid to a man who some said gave his life standing up to Russia's all-powerful leader. Alexei Navalny was born in 1976, in a village just to the west of Moscow. He grew up in Obninsk, a town 100km (62 miles) south-west of Moscow, eventually graduating in law at Moscow's Peoples' Friendship University of Russia in 1998. But it was another decade before he began his rise as a force in Russian politics, making his name as a grassroots anti-corruption campaigner. His blog took aim at alleged malpractice and corruption at some of Russia's big state-controlled corporations. One of his tactics was to become a minority shareholder in major oil companies, banks and ministries, and to ask awkward questions about holes in state finances. His consistent message was a simple one: that Mr Putin's party was full of ""crooks and thieves"". UKRAINECAST:Navalny: What next for Russia? He accused the president of ""sucking the blood out of Russia"" through a ""feudal state"" concentrating power in the Kremlin. That patronage system, he claimed, was like tsarist Russia. It helped that Navalny spoke the street language of younger Russians, and used it to powerful effect on social media. His Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) made detailed claims about official corruption. Then, in 2011, he would lead large street protests against President Putin. Navalny's wife Yulia, pictured with him in 2015, was at most court cases to support him For the rest of his life, he would be in and out of jail, while his organisations would be banned as ""extremist"". In 2017, he was barred from standing in the general election. At the time, he was widely regarded as the only candidate with a chance of challenging President Putin. He would also survive several suspected - and one confirmed - attempts on his life. The first time Navalny suspected he had been poisoned, he was in prison serving a sentence for calling for unauthorised protests. Then 43, he was taken to hospital with a swollen face, eye problems and rashes on his body. At the time, reports suggested it was an allergic reaction - something he and his doctor were quick to question. Officially, he was diagnosed with ""contact dermatitis"". Navalny - who had previously suffered chemical burns to an eye after been targeted with antiseptic green dye in 2017 - later wrote that the doctors who treated him acted ""like they had something to hide"". But it was the second alleged poisoning a year later which really caught the attention of the international media. In August 2020, Navalny collapsed on a flight over Siberia and was rushed to hospital in Omsk. That emergency landing saved his life. A German-based charity persuaded Russian officials to allow him to be airlifted to Berlin for treatment. Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life In September, the German government revealed that tests carried out by the military found ""unequivocal proof of a chemical nerve warfare agent of the Novichok group,external"". The Kremlin denied any involvement and rejected the Novichok finding. The EU then imposed sanctions on six top Russian officials and a Russian chemical weapons research centre, accusing them of direct involvement in the poisoning. Russiaretaliated with tit-for-tat sanctions. Novichok was the chemical weapon which nearly killed former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England, in March 2018. A local woman later died from contact with Novichok. Mr Putin admitted that the state was keeping Navalny under surveillance - it was justified, he alleged, because US spies were helping the blogger. Navalny - pictured with his family - was taken to Berlin for treatment after the Novichok poisoning in 2020 Recovered, Navalny returned to Moscow on 17 January 2021 and was immediately detained, as he knew he would be. He said on Instagram that he felt he had never left - so there was no choice but to return. He would never be free again, despite his supporters staging mass protests across Russia. Police responded to the protests with force, detaining thousands for attending the unauthorised rallies. The arrests did not deter his team from their mission. A video of""Putin's palace"" on YouTube,externalwas quickly published, focusing on a vast luxury Black Sea palace, allegedly gifted to Mr Putin by rich associates. The video has been viewed well over 100 million times. The Kremlin dismissed it as a ""pseudo-investigation"" and Mr Putin called it ""boring"", denying the claims. Later billionaire businessman Arkady Rotenberg, one of Mr Putin's closest friends, said it was his own palace. Putin: Russia's action man president The court case which followed allowed Navalny to make public his allegations against President Putin, in what was now an intensely personal battle: he accused the president of ordering state agents to poison him - and repeated that in court. ""His main gripe with me is that he'll go down in history as a poisoner,"" Navalny told the court scornfully. ""We had Alexander the Liberator, Yaroslav the Wise, and we will have Vladimir the Underpants Poisoner."" Underpants had become a social media meme in Russia after Navalny carried out a telephone sting in December 2020 on a Russian FSB state security agent, who revealed that Novichok, a highly toxic Russian chemical weapon, had been smeared on Navalny's underwear. But while it highlighted once more the Kremlin's alleged attempts on his life, it did not stop the court finding him guilty. On 2 February 2021, a Moscow court jailed Navalny for violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence for fraud - a case which he said had been politically motivated in the first place. Meanwhile, he and his anti-corruption team - all banned from standing in parliamentary elections - were still fighting the Kremlin, this time creating a ""smart voting"" app that encouraged voters to back candidates who had a chance of defeating Mr Putin's United Russia party in September 2021. This video can not be played Hundreds of protesters in Moscow were detained by police But Navalny was not a simple hero, battling against a powerful regime. He has been accused of xenophobia. In videos dating back to 2007, he is seen appearing to compare ethnic conflict to tooth decay and likened immigrants to cockroaches. He also said the Crimea peninsula ""de facto belongs to Russia"", despite international condemnation of Russia's 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian territory. The comments led - controversially - to Amnesty International revoking his status as a ""prisoner of conscience"" in February 2021, before conceding it had been subjected to an ""orchestrated campaign"" to ""delist"" him and then reversing its decision. Millions watch jailed critic's 'Putin palace' film Kremlin critic Navalny recalls near-death torment Meanwhile, the Russian government continued to punish Navalny. In March 2022, his sentence was increased by nine-years after he was found guilty on new charges of embezzlement and contempt of court. He was moved to a new penal colony at Melekhovo, around 250km (150 miles) east of Moscow. In June 2022, his allies raised the alarm after they discovered he was no longer in that prison. Federal prison authorities later admitted he had been moved to a penal colony with a tough reputation, the IK-6 prison, more than 155 miles (249km) east of Moscow, where he said he was repeatedly placed in solitary confinement. His last sentence, handed down by judges in August 2023 and which extended his jail term to 19 years, saw him moved to a maximum security penal colony usually reserved for Russia's most dangerous criminals. This video can not be played Watch: Navalny jokes in court a day before his death His harsh treatment reflected the fact that Mr Putin and his regime feared the influence that Navalny's campaigns had been gaining, Prof Nina Khrushcheva, the great-granddaughter of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and international affairs experts, told the BBC at the time. ""Putin doesn't even mention his name, anybody in the Kremlin can't his mention name,"" she said, drawing a comparison with the fictional Harry Potter character Voldemort - who is also referred to as ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"". ""Navalny is a threat to Putin's personal power, Putin's personal reputation of himself. And Putin doesn't really treat his enemies lightly and Navalny unfortunately took this - as they say in Russian - this ticket to be Putin's personal enemy."" Yet despite the confinement of his last years, Navalny became one of the leading domestic voices against the war in Ukraine. During a court appearance in May 2022, he accused Mr Putin of starting a ""stupid war"" with ""no purpose or meaning"". And in September, he accused Russian elites of having a ""bloodthirsty obsession with Ukraine"" in an article for the Washington Post. His foundation also continued to oppose the government throughout his imprisonment, speaking out against the mobilisation of some 300,000 civilians to fight in Ukraine and pledging to be a ""partisan underground"" movement inside Russia. Navalny told the BBC that the best thing Western states could do for justice in Russia was to crack down on ""dirty money"". ""I want people involved in corruption and persecution of activists to be barred from entering these countries, to be denied visas."" The news of his death on 16 February was immediately greeted by a wave of tributes from around the world. He had made the ""ultimate sacrifice"" in his fight ""for the values of freedom and democracy"", said the European Union Council president Charles Michel, while French foreign minister StÃ©phane SÃ©journÃ© said he had ""paid with his life for his resistance to a system of oppression"". However, exactly how - or why - he died has yet to be established. He leaves behind his wife, Yulia, and two children. According to his team, they had not been informed directly of his death when it broke in newspapers across the world. ""I don't know whether or not to believe the news, the terrible news"", Yulia Navlanaya said at the Munich Security Conference, hours after news of her husband's death broke. ""You all know this - we can't believe Putin and Putin's government. They're always lying,"" she added. ""But if this is true, I want Putin and all of his entourage, Putin's friends and his government to know that they will be held accountable for what they have done to our country, to my family and to my husband."" She left the stage to a standing ovation.

Girl Guides: Digitally-enhanced photos need labels,"Influencers and advertisers should be forced to declare digitally altered photos on social media, the body representing UK girl guides has said. The Girlguiding charity has backed a proposed law by a backbench MP that would force social media users and advertisers to label images where bodies or faces have been edited. The bill is designed to address unrealistic portrayals of beauty in the media and online. Critics have said it is unenforceable. The Girlguiding Advocate panel, whose members are aged 14 to 25, welcomed the proposals. The panel cited its own researchwhich suggests around half of young women aged between 11 and 21 regularly use apps or filters to make photos of themselves look better online. This video can not be played Do you retouch your selfies? ""The 'perfect' images girls are encountering in their daily lives are having a devastating impact on self-esteem and confidence,"" said 15-year-old panel member Alice. ""These enhanced images create a false society where how girls look is perceived to be the most important aspect about them."" Dr Luke Evans MP, a Tory member of the Health and Social Care Committee and a GP, was inspired to introduce the bill after seeing first-hand the effects of these images on people's mental health. ""We know how damaging this is, as you're warping people's perspective of reality, whether that's slimming down for women or bulking up for men,"" he added. The law would require advertisers, broadcasters or publishers to display a warning label when bodies or faces are digitally altered. Similar legislationalready exists in France.There, any commercial image that has been enhanced must feature a label of ""edited photograph"", or companies face a fine. The stock images agency Getty has also banned retouched images from its commercial category. Dr Evans has met the Advertising Standards Agency -which has previously banned some airbrushed advertisements- and hopes to have talks with social media firms soon. He said he would like to see rule-breakers apologise and issue a correction, or be fined. Technology reporter Cristina Criddle edited this photo on a free app in under 10 minutes to illustrate extreme editing Some have said this would be difficult to enforce on social media, as it would rely on users policing themselves or others reporting them. ""While some pictures look obviously edited, there are still fine tweaks anyone can make, which can be hard to identify,"" commented Unsah Malik, author of Slashed: The Ultimate Social Media and Influencer Marketing Guide. ""This begs the question to what extent the new rules will be put in place, and how much we can trust influencers to tell the truth. ""This then leaves us in the same position of setting unrealistic beauty standards."" Unsah Malik said it was hard to identify subtle editing Nick Ede, a brand expert, said there should be flexibility in the rules. ""If you are specifically using a product that you are promoting, and don't declare that you have manipulated an image, that is false advertising - for example, a face cream and you've smoothed out your skin,"" he explained. ""But if you are posting generic images that are part of your brand, then I don't think you should have to have any kind of accountability. ""Treating people like they are a packet of cigarettes with what basically is a government health warning is just ridiculous."" Dr Evans accepts that his recommendations would be hard to enforce. ""Just because it's difficult in principle, doesn't mean we should not do it,"" he responded. ""Social media companies have a role to play, allowing people to see what is true reality. ""These influencers have large audiences and need to be transparent - labelling content is not a huge ask."" Rahi Chadda says people should be free to edit their own images Influencers have spoken out against the proposals, saying it puts too much pressure on them. One model with more than 700,000 followers said people can follow at their own discretion. ""It is an individual's choice how they wish to represent themselves through social media,"" Rahi Chadda added. ""It impacts their own mental health also. If by editing the photos they feel more confident, then that's a personal choice which shouldn't be judged. ""Transparency is something which influencers are working toward at their own pace."" The Ten Minute Rule Bill will be heard in Parliament on 15 September. If it passes, it can be incorporated into existing legislation or debated in the House of Commons.

Boy died after allergic reaction to cinema popcorn,"Ruben Bousquet had eaten the popcorn at the same cinema before, the inquest heard A 14-year-old boy died after suffering an allergic reaction to popcorn he ate at a cinema, a coroner has ruled. Ruben Bousquet was with his parents at the Odeon in Greenwich, south east London, on 18 April 2019, when he became unwell. He was ""exquisitely sensitive to food allergies"" including cow's milk, raw egg and soya, the inquest heard. Coroner Andrew Harris said the popcorn had been cross-contaminated with milk, triggering Ruben's fatal reaction. On the evening Ruben fell ill his family rushed home to get his EpiPen, which he had left behind, but they were too late, the inquest heard. Southwark Coroner's Court was told Ruben had regularly visited the same IMAX cinema and had eaten the same brand of sweet popcorn before. Mr Harris said the cinema's food supplier Thomas Tucker Ltd had failed to carry out risk assessments when changing factory locations. Ruben Bousquet was watching a film with his parents at Odeon cinema in Greenwich when he suffered his attack In September 2019 the company went into administration after the Food Standards Agency launched an allergy alertwhen it was revealed the firm's popcorn products may have contained undeclared milk. Odeon ""terminated"" its contract with Thomas Tucker Ltd in the same month, the court heard. In his ruling, Mr Harris said he could not be sure whether the cross-contamination happened in the production process or at the kiosk where it was bought. Ruben's mum, Judith Bousquet, said the family were ""disappointed"" the coroner was unable to determine when the popcorn had been contaminated. Mr Harris said: ""He ate some sweet unpackaged popcorn purchased from a cinema in Greenwich and began to feel unwell. ""He was driven home to access his emergency treatment for anaphylaxis and became distressed about 15 minutes after consumption, about three minutes from home. ""Ruben then collapsed and was given adrenaline injections twice and effective CPR."" Ruben Bousquet had many food allergies principally milk protein food Ruben was taken to Evelina Children's Hospital and found to ""have irretrievable brain damage"". Mr Harris gave Ruben's cause of death as ""an acute anaphylaxis to cow's milk allergen from cross contamination of popcorn"". He added: ""The popcorn manufactured and was free from milk protein but had become cross contaminated at some stage. ""Ruben was under the impression it was free of allergens and had he asked staff then that is what they would have believed too."" Mr Harris said he will decide whether to make a report to prevent future deaths later this month. Speaking after the ruling, Mrs Bousquet said: ""To not put food labels as an advisory for the public to make a choice would seem to put profit before consumers. ""Ruben was in that 1% bracket of being affected - are they waiting for another death to make any changes?"" Cinema popcorn supplier enters administration Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death? Odeon said: ""The popcorn ordered from our supplier, Thomas Tucker Ltd, was specified as 'allergen-free'. ""Once we were informed in June 2019 that certain popcorn samples sourced from this supplier tested positive for milk proteins, we immediately opened an investigation and introduced additional allergen advice to all of our cinemas. ""We have confidence in the robust procedures we have in place concerning food safety and the sourcing of products, and our teams use careful processes to protect popcorn and all other products from cross contamination in our cinemas.""

Nancy Pelosi 'breaks rules' with hair salon visit,"This video can not be played US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi says her salon visit was a ""setup"" and they her an apology. The most powerful elected US Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, has visited a hair salon in San Francisco, breaking rules that only allow service outdoors, in order to control the spread of coronavirus. Ms Pelosi was also seen with a face mask around her neck rather than over her mouth. She has criticised President Donald Trump for not wearing a mask. A spokesman said she did not realise she was breaking her home city's rules. Mr Trump said she was being ""decimated"" after lecturing everyone else. Thousands of California businesses have shut as part of measures to fight coronavirus. Security camera footage from eSalon SF shows Nancy Pelosi without a mask on The footage obtained by Fox News,externalshowed the House of Representatives speaker inside the premises of eSalon SF on Monday. A stylist, who was wearing a mask, was shown following her. Mrs Pelosi - who always wears masks in public - often admonishes Republicans to ""listen to the science"" on the pandemic. Why we should all be wearing face masks Why are Americans so angry about masks? Why men are less likely to wear face masks Defending her visit, spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement: ""This business offered for the Speaker to come in on Monday and told her they were allowed by the city to have one customer at a time in the business."" ""The Speaker complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment."" Mrs Pelosi has herself previously cited US Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommending that Americans wear face masks in public, especially when physical distancing measures are difficult. After Monday's appointment, the House speaker appeared on MSNBC with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. She told the network that Mr Trump had ""slapped science right in the face"" last week by allowing an audience of mainly mask-less invitees on the White House lawn to watch his speech to the Republican convention.

This video can not be played 'They want to throw God's wonderful breathing system out' They tweeted: ""Speaker Pelosi has pushed policies that would keep our economy closed and our small businesses shut down. ""But for herself? A salon visit whenever she pleases."" The House speaker has previously said Republicans could help create the conditions to safely reopen if they would only ""listen to the scientists"". Mrs Pelosi has also repeatedly criticised Mr Trump's decision to largely spurn face coverings, calling him a ""coward"" and saying: ""Real men wear masks.""

Blind student compensated for Oxford Union removal,"This video can not be played Footage of security appearing to grapple with Mr Azamati was filmed in the chamber A blind student who was ""violently"" removed from the Oxford Union debating society has been paid compensation. Ebenezer Azamati was ""accosted"" by a security guard when he tried to return to a seat he had reserved at a debate on 17 October 2019. The postgraduate student was accused of being dishonest and violent before the union later accepted the allegations were ""wholly unfounded and untrue"". It also agreed the allegations caused ""serious harm to his reputation"". The Oxford Union, which is independent from the university, has a tradition of hosting debates and speakers stretching back to 1823. Ahead of a debate in the union's chamber in Frewin Court last year, Mr Azamati, who is a member of the society, was ""forcibly and violently prevented"" from taking his reserved seat. The St John's College international relations student had been initially turned away from the debate before he was allowed in and then removed. Video footage showed an argument between security and Mr Azamati in the chamber before staff appeared to manhandle him. The Oxford Union intentionally resembles the House of Commons The union ""wrongly"" brought disciplinary proceedings against Mr Azamati before theywithdrew allegations of violence and dishonesty and he was cleared of any wrongdoing. Mr Azamati, from Ghana, sought legal advice after the incident which he said made him feel ""unwelcome in the union, Oxford and even the country"". In a statement released on Twitter, the union said: ""What happened to Mr Azamati was fundamentally wrong. ""We apologise to him unreservedly and have made a compensatory payment to him in recognition of this."" The amount of compensation has not been disclosed. The Oxford Union is one of the most prestigious societies in the world and its debating chamber intentionally resembles the House of Commons. Former prime minister Harold Macmillan once said the union is ""the last bastion of free speech in the Western world"". The union invites world leaders, politicians, celebrities and controversial speakers to give speeches to its members, who are mostly current or former Oxford students. Past presidents include Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the former prime minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto and former Liberal Partyy leader Jeremy Thorpe. The fall out and response to Mr Azamati's removal led to a motion of impeachment andresignation of Brendan McGrath, the union's president at the time. The student previously said he was ""treated as not being human enough to deserve justice and fair treatment"". The union said it accepted calls for ""root and branch changes"" to be made at the society. It said following discussions with Mr Azamati's legal team, the society had agreed to commission a review by two lawyers to ""closely examine our rules, policies, procedures, practices, staff roles and responsibilities"". The review will produce a report with recommendations and be published publicly, the union said. ""We must ensure that we become an institution in which such an incident can never recur. We are committed to that change,"" it added.

"Ofqual said grading system 'fundamental mistake""MPs are told by the exam watchdog how decisions over grades were ""spinning out of control"".Family & EducationComments","England's exams regulator, Ofqual, says it was a ""fundamental mistake"" to think the public would accept an emergency grading system instead of exam results. Chairman Roger Taylor said Ofqual advised ministers to hold socially-distanced exams or delay them. If these two options were unworkable, then calculated grades could be used, he said Ofqual had advised. Mr Taylor said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson cancelled exams without further reference to Ofqual. Labour said it was ""now clear"" that Mr Williamson was responsible for the exams chaos and that he should not blame Ofqual. But a spokesman for the Department for Education said that the decision to cancel exams had been a ""necessary step to fight the spread of coronavirus"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used Prime Minister's Questions to challenge Boris Johnson over when he first knew there was a problem with the algorithm for deciding grades. Mr Johnson defended his government's record, accusing Sir Keir of being ""Captain Hindsight"". Ofqual chief Sally Collier steps down after exam chaos Boris Johnson blames 'mutant algorithm' for exam problems How did the algorithm decide exam grades? ""We did institute a change, we did act,"" and students did get their grades, said the prime minister. Sally Collier resigned over the exams chaos But Mr Taylor told MPs on the Commons education select committee: ""The fundamental mistake was to believe this [system] would ever be acceptable to the public."" Mr Williamson took the decision to cancel exams when schools were closed by the coronavirus and increasing number of teachers were shielding. Ofqual had to develop a system to award grades for exams which pupils could no longer take. This produced a moderation process that saw 40% of A-level grades being lower than the grades estimated by their schools. But Mr Taylor defended Ofqual's approach to calculating grades, saying it was trying to carry out ministerial guidelines. He argued that the system of standardising grades, the so-called ""algorithm"", would on the whole have helped disadvantaged pupils. Students were left uncertain about grades in U-turns over exam results The Ofqual chairman said that in March the regulator had been consulted by the Department for Education about the implications of cancelling exams. At this point, Ofqual said there were four options: to delay exams until the virus crisis passed conduct socially distanced exams use some form of teacher and school-assessed certificates or to combine school-based assessments with the standardisation model to produce estimated grades Mr Taylor said that he and his officials had repeatedly warned the Department for Education of the risks of using estimated grades. Julie Swann, Ofqual's executive director for general qualifications, said a paper on May 1 ""highlighted the risk of widespread dissatisfaction"" from students, schools and colleges. But after problems and inconsistencies emerged with grades, the moderation process was ditched in a U-turn, and teachers' grades were used instead. The chief regulator, Sally Collier, resigned and the Department for Education's most senior civil servant, Jonathan Slater, stepped down following the exams chaos. Mr Taylor, also revealed Ofqual guidance on using ""valid mock"" exam results to widen the appeals process, was removed from the Ofqual website after an intervention from England's education secretary. Results for this year's exams were caught up in confusion Mr Williamson had decided to allow mock exam results to be used as evidence in appeals over grades. Mr Taylor said Mr Williamson telephoned the chief regulator, Sally Collier, late on a Saturday night, August 15, after Ofqual published new appeals guidance, saying it was not consistent with the education secretary's policy. Ofqual, which is independent from government, had been trying to formulate a way for such appeals to work, while meeting its statutory duty to ensure exams were fair. Mr Taylor said the board then met in emergency session to try to find a way through a situation which was rapidly ""spinning out of control"". ""We advised the Secretary of State at this point that we could not be confident that this could be delivered within the statutory duties of Ofqual to ensure that valid and trustworthy grades were being issued."" Discussions followed throughout Sunday, in which it became clear that a move to ""centre assessed grades"", which had been submitted by schools and colleges, was all but inevitable. Mr Williamson went on to announce that results would use these centre assessed grades in a major U-turn. A Department for Education spokesman said the ""government never wanted to cancel exams because they are the best and fairest form of assessment. ""We listened to views from a range of parties, including Ofqual, and given the public health requirements at the time, made what was a very difficult decision on the basis that it was a necessary step to fight the spread of coronavirus.""

Navalnyâs team sees Kremlin behind attack,"Mr Navalny was eventually airlifted to Berlin's CharitÃ© clinic after initial treatment in Omsk in Siberia Joining Team Navalny is asking for trouble. Like the opposition politician himself, activists linked to Alexei Navalny have been jailed, handed crippling fines, attacked and sent death threats. So as the Kremlin's biggest critic lies in an induced coma in Berlin, with doctors trying to identify the substance they believe poisoned him a week ago, Mr Navalny's friends and allies have no doubt that he was targeted for his political activity. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman says German medics have ""rushed"" to their conclusion of foul play with no proof - and the Kremlin has always refused even to utter Mr Navalny's name in an attempt to diminish his significance. But over the last couple of years his network of young activists across Russia have faced intense and increasing pressure that tells a different story. Sergei Boiko drank tea with Alexei Navalny two days before he collapsed on his flight home from Siberia. They met in Novosibirsk, where Mr Boiko is one of 33 people challenging pro-Kremlin candidates at next month's local elections. Mr Navalny was with Sergei Boiko in Novosibirsk two days before he collapsed on a flight back home It's part of a ""smart voting"" strategy that proved surprisingly successful at Moscow city elections last summer: Team Navalny identifies candidates most likely to beat Mr Putin's United Russia and campaigns hard for them. That plan - or perhaps Mr Navalny himself - apparently bothers someone powerful. ""There were people following us; many resources invested,"" Mr Boiko tells me. Whilst Alexei Navalny was in town, he says each of their cars was followed constantly. When the team moved about on foot, each person had their own, dedicated tail. ""It was from the start of the day to the end,"" Mr Boiko says. ""I think it was [the] secret service."" The Kremlin spokesman claims such ""operations"" are not co-ordinated with the presidential administration. When I asked what danger the opposition politician presented to merit such tight surveillance, Dmitry Peskov retorted: ""No danger at all."" But his allies are harassed on a regular basis. ""As soon as I got involved, I realised how it would be,"" says Vitaly Kolesnikov, recalling how days into his job as camera and video editor on Alexei Navalny's anti-corruption investigations, his new boss was attacked with a green dye that burned his eye. This video can not be played Footage appears to show Mr Navalny being attacked with a green liquid in 2017 ""Since then, I've been interrogated, threatened, had money stolen,"" Mr Kolesnikov says. ""It's been quite a journey."" Last year, police searched the editor's home and confiscated over two million roubles ($26,500; Â£20,000) in cash he had from selling his flat. It was part of a criminal investigation into Mr Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation in which dozens of other activists had their bank accounts frozen. Sergei Boiko, in Siberia, has faced two police searches in as many years and spent 74 days in custody, mainly for breaking Russia's strict laws on protests. ""They are trying to make your life as hard as they possibly can,"" Vitaly Kolesnikov says. He mentions getting death threats almost in passing. On Monday, another of Alexei Navalny's friends published a YouTube video blaming President Vladimir Putin directly for his condition. Speaking straight to camera, a trend set by Mr Navalny himself, Ilya Yashin argued that the politician had not only uncovered high-level corruption and corralled multiple mass protests, his ""smart voting"" system openly challenges Mr Putin's allies for power. ""Why do these tragedies only happen to critics of the president?"" Mr Yashin demanded to know. Vladimir Putin's spokesman dismissed the statement as ""empty noise"". Navalny and Russiaâs arsenal of exotic poisons Putin critic Navalny 'probably poisoned' - doctors Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Pro-Kremlin press, meanwhile, have been on the counter-offensive. From suggesting that ""the blogger"" Navalny poisoned himself with drink and pills, they then cast doubt on whether there was any toxin at all. Finally, they've cited claims that the whole thing is a dastardly Western plot against Russia. Alexei Navalny has made enemies by openly targeting corruption as well as allies of the president Elsewhere, one analyst fears this could be the work of radical, freelance ""protectors"" of Russia - sidestepping the Kremlin to deal with a security threat. Others speculate that he could be the victim of a revenge attack for one of his muck-raking investigations: the team still haven't revealed what he was filming in Novosibirsk. But many suspect even that would need a nod, at least, from the very top. ""No-one could make such a decision besides the Kremlin,"" Sergei Boiko argues. In Novosibirsk, the activist has a table set up against a turquoise wall where he records his alternative newscasts for YouTube, just like Alexei Navalny. He's captured the look with the same, smartly buttoned shirt and even similar intonation. Above the hashtag ""Alexei, live!"", Sergei Boiko adopts the pro-president slogan: ""If not Putin, then who?"" The office Sergei Boiko heads is one of dozens of regional headquarters Alexei Navalny opened in 2017 ahead of his failed bid to run for president. They now generate their own investigations into local corruption. Sergei Boiko thinks that new, national reach could have prompted an attack, especially with mass protests in the Russian far east and the country's so-called near-abroad. ""Alexei is a problem for the authorities, but now we have Khabarovsk, we have Belarus and we have elections with a not-good position for United Russia,"" he argues. ""So many problems at one time. So they could decide it's easier to do such a thing."" Alexei Navalny's team always knew he was in danger. ""You realise anything can happen, but you always hope they wouldn't go this far,"" Vitaly Kolesnikov explains. ""Of course I was shocked and very worried."" But he hasn't contemplated quitting Team Navalny. Sergei Boiko agrees. In three weeks' time, he'll be standing for a seat in the Novosibirsk parliament. ""We're going to the elections, we're still working for change,"" he insists. ""In Russia we say, if not us - then who?""

Girl Guides: Digitally-enhanced photos need labelsThe charity has backed proposals to make labelling on these images compulsory.,"Influencers and advertisers should be forced to declare digitally altered photos on social media, the body representing UK girl guides has said. The Girlguiding charity has backed a proposed law by a backbench MP that would force social media users and advertisers to label images where bodies or faces have been edited. The bill is designed to address unrealistic portrayals of beauty in the media and online. Critics have said it is unenforceable. The Girlguiding Advocate panel, whose members are aged 14 to 25, welcomed the proposals. The panel cited its own researchwhich suggests around half of young women aged between 11 and 21 regularly use apps or filters to make photos of themselves look better online. This video can not be played Do you retouch your selfies? ""The 'perfect' images girls are encountering in their daily lives are having a devastating impact on self-esteem and confidence,"" said 15-year-old panel member Alice. ""These enhanced images create a false society where how girls look is perceived to be the most important aspect about them."" Dr Luke Evans MP, a Tory member of the Health and Social Care Committee and a GP, was inspired to introduce the bill after seeing first-hand the effects of these images on people's mental health. ""We know how damaging this is, as you're warping people's perspective of reality, whether that's slimming down for women or bulking up for men,"" he added. The law would require advertisers, broadcasters or publishers to display a warning label when bodies or faces are digitally altered. Similar legislationalready exists in France.There, any commercial image that has been enhanced must feature a label of ""edited photograph"", or companies face a fine. The stock images agency Getty has also banned retouched images from its commercial category. Dr Evans has met the Advertising Standards Agency -which has previously banned some airbrushed advertisements- and hopes to have talks with social media firms soon. He said he would like to see rule-breakers apologise and issue a correction, or be fined. Technology reporter Cristina Criddle edited this photo on a free app in under 10 minutes to illustrate extreme editing Some have said this would be difficult to enforce on social media, as it would rely on users policing themselves or others reporting them. ""While some pictures look obviously edited, there are still fine tweaks anyone can make, which can be hard to identify,"" commented Unsah Malik, author of Slashed: The Ultimate Social Media and Influencer Marketing Guide. ""This begs the question to what extent the new rules will be put in place, and how much we can trust influencers to tell the truth. ""This then leaves us in the same position of setting unrealistic beauty standards."" Unsah Malik said it was hard to identify subtle editing Nick Ede, a brand expert, said there should be flexibility in the rules. ""If you are specifically using a product that you are promoting, and don't declare that you have manipulated an image, that is false advertising - for example, a face cream and you've smoothed out your skin,"" he explained. ""But if you are posting generic images that are part of your brand, then I don't think you should have to have any kind of accountability. ""Treating people like they are a packet of cigarettes with what basically is a government health warning is just ridiculous."" Dr Evans accepts that his recommendations would be hard to enforce. ""Just because it's difficult in principle, doesn't mean we should not do it,"" he responded. ""Social media companies have a role to play, allowing people to see what is true reality. ""These influencers have large audiences and need to be transparent - labelling content is not a huge ask."" Rahi Chadda says people should be free to edit their own images Influencers have spoken out against the proposals, saying it puts too much pressure on them. One model with more than 700,000 followers said people can follow at their own discretion. ""It is an individual's choice how they wish to represent themselves through social media,"" Rahi Chadda added. ""It impacts their own mental health also. If by editing the photos they feel more confident, then that's a personal choice which shouldn't be judged. ""Transparency is something which influencers are working toward at their own pace."" The Ten Minute Rule Bill will be heard in Parliament on 15 September. If it passes, it can be incorporated into existing legislation or debated in the House of Commons.

"Blind student compensated for Oxford Union removalEbenezer Azamati said he felt ""unwelcome"" in Britain after being ""violently removed"" from the Oxford Union.","This video can not be played Footage of security appearing to grapple with Mr Azamati was filmed in the chamber A blind student who was ""violently"" removed from the Oxford Union debating society has been paid compensation. Ebenezer Azamati was ""accosted"" by a security guard when he tried to return to a seat he had reserved at a debate on 17 October 2019. The postgraduate student was accused of being dishonest and violent before the union later accepted the allegations were ""wholly unfounded and untrue"". It also agreed the allegations caused ""serious harm to his reputation"". The Oxford Union, which is independent from the university, has a tradition of hosting debates and speakers stretching back to 1823. Ahead of a debate in the union's chamber in Frewin Court last year, Mr Azamati, who is a member of the society, was ""forcibly and violently prevented"" from taking his reserved seat. The St John's College international relations student had been initially turned away from the debate before he was allowed in and then removed. Video footage showed an argument between security and Mr Azamati in the chamber before staff appeared to manhandle him. The Oxford Union intentionally resembles the House of Commons The union ""wrongly"" brought disciplinary proceedings against Mr Azamati before theywithdrew allegations of violence and dishonesty and he was cleared of any wrongdoing. Mr Azamati, from Ghana, sought legal advice after the incident which he said made him feel ""unwelcome in the union, Oxford and even the country"". In a statement released on Twitter, the union said: ""What happened to Mr Azamati was fundamentally wrong. ""We apologise to him unreservedly and have made a compensatory payment to him in recognition of this."" The amount of compensation has not been disclosed. The Oxford Union is one of the most prestigious societies in the world and its debating chamber intentionally resembles the House of Commons. Former prime minister Harold Macmillan once said the union is ""the last bastion of free speech in the Western world"". The union invites world leaders, politicians, celebrities and controversial speakers to give speeches to its members, who are mostly current or former Oxford students. Past presidents include Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the former prime minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto and former Liberal Partyy leader Jeremy Thorpe. The fall out and response to Mr Azamati's removal led to a motion of impeachment andresignation of Brendan McGrath, the union's president at the time. The student previously said he was ""treated as not being human enough to deserve justice and fair treatment"". The union said it accepted calls for ""root and branch changes"" to be made at the society. It said following discussions with Mr Azamati's legal team, the society had agreed to commission a review by two lawyers to ""closely examine our rules, policies, procedures, practices, staff roles and responsibilities"". The review will produce a report with recommendations and be published publicly, the union said. ""We must ensure that we become an institution in which such an incident can never recur. We are committed to that change,"" it added.

Apple more valuable than the entire FTSE 100,"The valuation of US tech giant Apple has continued to surge, surpassing the entire value of all the members of the UK's top share index. Apple's shares rose 4% on Tuesday, valuing it at $2.3 trillion (Â£1.7tn), compared to the Â£1.5tn value of all the companies in the FTSE 100. Apple shares fell back on Wednesday, but remained ahead of the London index at the close of trading on Wednesday. It is just two weeks sinceApple became the first US firm to be valued at $2tn. Investors have been snapping up US tech stocks as demand for tech goods has surged amid the coronavirus pandemic. More people are relying on technology to work and shop from home, and Apple has been one of the major beneficiaries. The iPhone-maker has seen its share price more than double since March, when panic about the coronavirus pandemic swept the world's stock markets. Demand for Apple's shares was also said to be boosted on Tuesday by company's decision to divide its shares, swapping four new ones for every old one investors held. The move is expected to make it easier for individuals to invest. By contrast, market-watchers said London-listed companies, which include lockdown-hit oil companies and banks, have performed sluggishly compared to the runaway share prices of big US-listed tech firms. ""The FTSE 100 is a dinosaur, full of rather lumbering old-world stocks with precious little growth to offer,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com. He added that it is also ""a very good proxy for the global economy, which we know is on its knees"". With the exception of Ocado, ""there is no tech to speak of, which is where the real money has been made this year,"" he added. ""Whilst the US has Zoom, we have BT and Vodafone. The US boasts Netflix and Amazon - the FTSE can muster ITV and Sainsbury's."" The FTSE 100 is trading at 5,972 points, down 22% from its 2020 high of 7,675 in January. By contrast, the Nasdaq index in the US, which includes many large tech companies, hit a fresh record on Tuesday. It has almost doubled since the collapse in share prices in the immediate aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak. Some investors have warned that that all markets - including those trading in stocks, bonds and commodities - are overvalued at the moment. Stimulus from central banks to support struggling economies - including quantitative easing and historic low interest rates - have buoyed the value of many companies and assets. In another sign of booming tech valuations, Tesla's 12% stock gain propelled founder Elon Musk's personal fortune to $115bn this week, briefly making him the third-richest person in the world,according to Bloomberg,external. He temporarily overtook Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

England under pressure to impose Greece quarantine,"Clusters of coronavirus cases have been linked to the Greek island of Zakynthos, also known as Zante Ministers are facing pressure to decide whether tourists returning to England from Greece should quarantine, after Scotland and Wales introduced their own measures. Scotland has said travellers arriving from Greecemust quarantine for 14 days after 04:00 BST on Thursday. And Wales has askedarrivals from the Greek island Zakynthos to quarantine. It comes as travel company Tui cancelled all holidays to a resort on the Greek island after virus clusters. Tui calls for 'regional travel corridors' Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? The firm said it would no longer be offering trips to the resort of Laganas, on Zakynthos, from Thursday because of customers failing to follow coronavirus safety measures. Six clusters of cases have been linked to flights from the island - also known as Zante. Greece has insisted it is doing ""everything in our power"" to keep UK holidaymakers safe. The country's tourism minister, Haris Theoharis, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We're taking specific targeted measures where we see specific concentrations of cases. Measures that have been successful and have been working in the past few days."" Numbers in bars and restaurants on Zakynthos are being limited to reduce the spread of the virus Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there were six clusters of cases, amounting to more than 30 infections, linked to flights from the Greek island in the past week - including two flights which landed in England. He called for an ""early meeting with the UK government and devolved nations"" to discuss changing the rules. His comments came shortly after the Scottish government announced its own decision. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""With Scotland's relatively low infection rate, importation of new cases from Greece is a significant risk to public health."" Struggling to keep up? You're not alone! The UK government's travel quarantine has been a messy affair. There was real chaos when restrictions were re-imposed on arrivals from Spain at the height of a busy summer weekend. After that, ministers tried to bring in a more structured approach by reviewing each country's infection rate throughout each week and announcing any changes on Thursdays or Fridays. However the picture has been complicated further by the fact that the quarantine is a public health policy and so the Welsh and Scottish Governments can diverge from Westminster and classify countries differently. Now the Welsh government is bringing in testing on arrival for passengers too. That's awkward for the UK government because, for months, the aviation sector has been asking ministers to give their backing to testing at airports so people who test negative wouldn't have to quarantine for the full 14 days. Aviation bosses are frustrated about the delay over any announcement on that. And all the twists and turns over quarantine makes life for any foreign travel business incredibly hard. Meanwhile, the UK's biggest tour operator Tui is suspending its holidays in the resort of Laganas on Zakynthos. Andrew Flintham, managing director of Tui UK and Ireland, said anyone who had booked to go the resort after 3 September would be refunded for the cancellation, but that trips to all other resorts on Zakynthos would continue as normal. He said: ""The health and safety of our colleagues and customers is our primary concern and recent cases show that some customers are not following social distancing and Covid safety measures. ""It is therefore the right thing to do to protect and reduce a now identified potential risk to others by no longer offering holidays to this specific resort."" Nearly 200 people faced self-isolation after at least 16 passengers on a Tui flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff Airport tested positive for the virus. Some people claimed passengerswere not following Covid-19 rules. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic When a country surpasses 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past week, the UK government normally imposes 14 days of self-isolation on returning travellers. There were 14.3 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in Greece in the seven days to 1 September, up from 14.1 a week earlier. But several cases of the virus in Scotland have been traced back to Greece,including a passenger on a Tui flight from Zante to Glasgowon 23 August. Tui said customers due to travel to Greece from Scotland would be able to amend or cancel their holiday in light of the quarantine announcement. This video can not be played Tui boss Andrew Flintham says the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" Meanwhile, ministers areconsidering reimposing quarantine measures for those arriving in the UK from Portugalas coronavirus cases rise, sources have told the BBC. It has been less than two weeks since a travel corridor was established between Portugal and the UK, following a sustained period of falling cases in the country that put it below 20 cases per 100,000 people. But in the seven days up to 1 September, the seven-day rate has increased from 14.2 to 22.7. Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal, making up the largest number of overseas tourists to the country. Over May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed. The government has not commented on whether requirements for arrivals from Portugal will change again. Last week, Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic joined France, Spain and other destinations on the UK's quarantine list.

Numbers in bars and restaurants on Zakynthos are being limited to reduce the spread of the virus Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there were six clusters of cases, amounting to more than 30 infections, linked to flights from the Greek island in the past week - including two flights which landed in England. He called for an ""early meeting with the UK government and devolved nations"" to discuss changing the rules. His comments came shortly after the Scottish government announced its own decision. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""With Scotland's relatively low infection rate, importation of new cases from Greece is a significant risk to public health."" Struggling to keep up? You're not alone! The UK government's travel quarantine has been a messy affair. There was real chaos when restrictions were re-imposed on arrivals from Spain at the height of a busy summer weekend. After that, ministers tried to bring in a more structured approach by reviewing each country's infection rate throughout each week and announcing any changes on Thursdays or Fridays. However the picture has been complicated further by the fact that the quarantine is a public health policy and so the Welsh and Scottish Governments can diverge from Westminster and classify countries differently. Now the Welsh government is bringing in testing on arrival for passengers too. That's awkward for the UK government because, for months, the aviation sector has been asking ministers to give their backing to testing at airports so people who test negative wouldn't have to quarantine for the full 14 days. Aviation bosses are frustrated about the delay over any announcement on that. And all the twists and turns over quarantine makes life for any foreign travel business incredibly hard. Meanwhile, the UK's biggest tour operator Tui is suspending its holidays in the resort of Laganas on Zakynthos. Andrew Flintham, managing director of Tui UK and Ireland, said anyone who had booked to go the resort after 3 September would be refunded for the cancellation, but that trips to all other resorts on Zakynthos would continue as normal. He said: ""The health and safety of our colleagues and customers is our primary concern and recent cases show that some customers are not following social distancing and Covid safety measures. ""It is therefore the right thing to do to protect and reduce a now identified potential risk to others by no longer offering holidays to this specific resort."" Nearly 200 people faced self-isolation after at least 16 passengers on a Tui flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff Airport tested positive for the virus. Some people claimed passengerswere not following Covid-19 rules. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic When a country surpasses 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past week, the UK government normally imposes 14 days of self-isolation on returning travellers. There were 14.3 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in Greece in the seven days to 1 September, up from 14.1 a week earlier. But several cases of the virus in Scotland have been traced back to Greece,including a passenger on a Tui flight from Zante to Glasgowon 23 August. Tui said customers due to travel to Greece from Scotland would be able to amend or cancel their holiday in light of the quarantine announcement. This video can not be played Tui boss Andrew Flintham says the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" Meanwhile, ministers areconsidering reimposing quarantine measures for those arriving in the UK from Portugalas coronavirus cases rise, sources have told the BBC. It has been less than two weeks since a travel corridor was established between Portugal and the UK, following a sustained period of falling cases in the country that put it below 20 cases per 100,000 people. But in the seven days up to 1 September, the seven-day rate has increased from 14.2 to 22.7. Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal, making up the largest number of overseas tourists to the country. Over May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed. The government has not commented on whether requirements for arrivals from Portugal will change again. Last week, Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic joined France, Spain and other destinations on the UK's quarantine list.

Hundreds of animals saved in 'harrowing' rescue,"Insp Rob Taylor, who leads the rural crime team, said all of the animals were in a ""terrible condition"" Hundreds of animals kept in ""harrowing conditions"" have been rescued from land in Gwynedd. More than 91 horses, 122 geese, ducks and chickens and three rabbits were removed from land in the Pwllheli area on Tuesday, North Wales Police said. Two horses had to be put down, and a woman was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an officer. Rob Taylor, from North Wales Rural Crime Team, described it as an ""appalling day"". Sgt Rob Taylor said the conditions were ""terrible"" One of the horses destroyed had suffered a broken leg when it was a foal, which had not been properly treated, leaving it lame for the whole of its adult life, police said. Another was blind. The ""large scale cruelty case"" was a joint operation between the RSPCA and North Wales Police. Mr Taylor said all the animals rescued were in a ""terrible condition"" but were now being cared for elsewhere. ""A truly harrowing day for all of the team and a case will be taken against the person responsible,"" he said. ""All cruelty is horrendous, but this rates on a high scale because of the numbers of animals involved."" The woman arrested has been released on police bail pending further investigation.

Strictly to feature first ever same-sex pair,"Nicola Adams won gold medals at the Olympics in 2012 and 2016 Olympic boxer Nicola Adams will make Strictly Come Dancing history by becoming the first contestant to be part of a same-sex pairing. She told BBC Breakfast she was the one who suggested having a female partner when producers asked her to take part. ""I think it's really important,"" she said. ""It's definitely time for change. ""It's definitely time to move on and be more diverse, and this is a brilliant step in the right direction."" Her dance partner has not yet been revealed. Adams said she didn't mind who she's paired up with, but added: ""I'd only be wanting somebody who's maybe a little bit on the short side because I'm a little bit small.""

'Four in 10 officers were assaulted last year',"Policing protests and spitting incidents during the pandemic have contributed to a rise in assaults A survey of more than 40,000 police officers in England and Wales found that almost four in ten said they had been assaulted in the last year. The research by the College of Policing also found 88% of officers said they had been assaulted during their career. Three-quarters of police officers said they wanted to carry Taser stun guns every day. But police chiefs are investigating racial disparities in Taser use. National Police Chiefs Council head Martin Hewitt, who commissioned the research, said he was shocked by the scale of the assaults and that a third of officers said they were unhappy with the personal safety training they received. Police chiefs are calling for a new offence of targeting police officers with a vehicle, as well as for spitting and hate crimes to be considered as aggravating factors when suspects are brought to court. Assaults on Met officers jump 40% during lockdown 'We are not punch bags' Coughing and spitting incidents during the pandemic, protests and illegal raves have driven a rise in attacks in recent months, with provisional data showing attacks up 24% year-on-year in the four weeks to 7 June. In 2018-19, there were 31,000 assaults on officers - equivalent to 328 assaults per 1,000 constables, up from 284 per 1,000 the previous year. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the increase in assaults on officers was ""simply unacceptable"", adding that the government was consulting on doubling the maximum sentence for assaulting an emergency worker to two years. Che Donald, vice-chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said officers and the majority of the public were ""appalled by the atrocious levels of violence colleagues have faced recently"" and police chiefs must take ""swift action"". The report found that 87% believed all frontline officers should have the option to deploy with Tasers. Three-quarters of police officers said that they personally wanted to carry a Taser. At the moment,only around 17,000 of the 123,000 police officers in England and Walesare trained to carry the stun guns. This major study of violence and policing reveals worrying disparities in the preparation given to officers - with some on the frontline receiving just a quarter of the training of colleagues elsewhere in England and Wales. But one of today's studies from the College of Policing reveals an apparent racial disparity in how officers themselves use force. The study of more than 45,000 incidents across 16 forces looked for patterns in when officers resort to force - including Tasers - when detaining suspects. It found that the odds of officers drawing equipment or weapons, but not using them, was higher when the suspect was identified as black. The research also found that white suspects were in fact more likely to end up injured. The upshot is that the data doesn't answer all the questions about the apparent racial disparities - as it also indicates that other factors may be influencing decisions to use force, such as mental illness. Chiefs have ordered more research into this very complex area - because they don't know why these disparities exist - and therefore it's not clear how to minimise them. Kent Chief Constable Alan Pughsley, the NPCC lead on officer safety, said that Tasers are ""fallible"" and officers should not be ""over-reliant"" on them. Almost all officers said they thought Tasers were ""very effective"" or ""fairly effective"" but research into the use of the weapons found that although drawing a Taser may act as a deterrent, assaults and injuries were no more or less likely when they were carried. Figures show Tasers and other ""less lethal"" weapons are more likely to be used against black people, and the NPCC is commissioning research to find out why. The College of Policing report also said: More than two in five police officers killed between 2008 and 2019 died while travelling to and from work. Police chiefs are researching links between shift work and road accidents Every chief constable will review whether frontline officers and staff have enough Tasers, body armour, spit and bite guards, protective gloves and high-visibility clothing Trials of new technology and equipment to prevent assaults will be speeded up, including changes in police vehicles and remotely operated devices to immobilise vehicles A ""hard-line"" approach will be taken into investigations of assaults against officers, with the default position that the alleged offender will be arrested.

Cosmic signal rattles Earth after 7 billion yearsGravitational waves arrive from a black hole collision that occurred half-way across the Universe.,"An artist's impression of the last moments before the merger of two black holes Imagine the energy of eight Suns released in an instant. This is the gravitational ""shockwave"" that spread out from the biggest merger yet observed between two black holes. The signal from this event travelled for some seven billion years to reach Earth but was still sufficiently strong to rattle laser detectors in the US and Italy in May last year. Researchers say the colliding black holes produced a single entity with a mass 142 times that of our Sun. This is noteworthy. Science has long traced the presence of black holes on the sky that are quite a bit smaller or even very much larger. But this new observation inaugurates a novel class of so-called intermediate-sized black holes in the range of 100-1,000 Sun (or solar) masses. The analysis is the latest to come out of the internationalLIGO,external-VIRGO,externalcollaboration, which operates three super-sensitive gravitational wave-detection systems in America and Europe. 'Black neutron star' discovery changes astronomy Breathtaking new map of the X-ray Universe Dancing gargantuan black holes perform on cue This video can not be played Simulation: The black hole collision produced a train of gravitational waves A black hole is a region of space where matter has collapsed in on itself The gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape Black holes will emerge from the explosive demise of certain large stars But some are truly gargantuan and are billions of times the mass of our Sun How these monsters - found at galaxy centres - formed is unknown Black holes are detected from the way they influence their surroundings They produce observable gravitational waves as they spiral in to each other The collaboration's laser interferometer instruments ""listen"" for the vibrations in space-time that are generated by truly cataclysmic cosmic events - and on 21 May, 2019, they were all triggered by a sharp signal lasting just one-tenth of a second. Computer algorithms determined the source to be the end-stage moments of two in-spiralling black holes - one with a mass 66 times that of our Sun, and the other with 85 solar masses. The distance to the merger was calculated to be the equivalent of 150 billion trillion km. ""It's astounding, really,"" said Prof Nelson Christensen from the CÃ´te d'Azur Observatory in France. ""This signal propagated for seven billion years. So this event happened 'just before halftime' for the Universe, and now it's mechanically moved our detectors here on Earth,"" he explained to BBC News. The European VIRGO laser lab is based in Italy's province of Pisa Gravitational waves are a prediction of the General Theory of Relativity It took decades to develop the technology to directly detect them They are ripples in the fabric of space-time generated by violent events Accelerating masses will produce waves that propagate at the speed of light Detectable sources include merging black holes and neutron stars LIGO-VIRGO fire lasers into long, L-shaped tunnels; the waves disturb the light Detecting the waves opens up the Universe to completely new investigations The involvement of an 85-solar-mass object in the collision has made collaboration scientists sit up because their understanding of how black holes form from the death of a star can't really account for something on this scale. Stars, when they exhaust their nuclear fuel, will experience an explosive core collapse to produce a black hole - if they're sufficiently big. But the physics that's assumed to operate inside stars suggests the production of black holes in the particular mass range between 65 and 120 solar masses is impossible. Dying stars that might yield such entities actually tear themselves apart and leave nothing behind. If the science is correct on this point then the most likely explanation for the existence of an 85-solar-mass object is that it was itself the result of an even earlier black hole union. And that, believes Prof Martin Hendry, from Glasgow University, UK, has implications for how the Universe evolved. ""We're talking here about a hierarchy of mergers, a possible pathway to make bigger and bigger black holes,"" he said. ""So, who knows? This 142-solar-mass black hole may have gone on to have merged with other very massive black holes - as part of a build-up process that goes all the way to those supermassive black holes we think are at the heart of galaxies."" The discovery suggests there is a hierarchy of mergers that lead to ever bigger black holes The LIGO-VIRGO collaboration is reporting the 21 May, 2019, event (catalogued as GW190521) in two scholarly papers. One isin the journal Physical Review Letters,externaland describes the discovery. The second can be foundin The Astrophysical Journal Letters,external, and discusses the signal's physical properties and scientific implications. GW190521 is one of over 50 gravitational wave triggers presently being investigated at the laser laboratories. The pace of research has increased rapidly since the collaboration made its first,Nobel-Prize-winning detection of gravitational waves in 2015. ""We are increasing the sensitivity of the detectors and, yes, we could end up making more than one detection a day. We will have a rain of black holes! But this is beautiful because we will learn so much more about them,"" Prof Alessandra Buonanno, director at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, told BBC News.

Cheap steroids save lives from severe CovidEight lives would be saved for every 100 critically ill patients given steroids.Health,"Cheap steroids can save the lives of patients who are critically ill with Covid-19, studies show. The findings confirm the results of an earlier trial, which has already led to steroids being used widely for Covid patients in intensive care. The new results,published in JAMA,external, show eight lives would be saved for every 100 patients treated. The researchers said the findings were impressive, but stressed steroids were not a coronavirus cure. What progress are we making on treatments? In June,the UK's Recovery trialfound the first drug - a steroid called dexamethasone - that could save the lives of people with severe Covid. The latest study brings together all clinical trials involving steroids on coronavirus patients around the world. It confirms dexamethasone works and that another steroid, hydrocortisone, is equally effective. This video can not be played Katherine Millbank spent 15 days in hospital and was part of the Recovery trial ""At the beginning of the year, at times it felt almost hopeless knowing that we had no specific treatments,"" said Prof Anthony Gordon, from Imperial College London. ""It was a very worrying time, yet less than six months later we've found clear, reliable evidence in high quality clinical trials of how we can tackle this devastating disease."" The results on 1,703 critically ill patients showed: 40% died when given only standard treatment 32% died when given steroids The studies were on only the sickest hospital patients. Most people recover having only experienced mild symptoms. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? VIRUS FATIGUE:Is it time to move on? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters COMPARING COUNTRIES:The pitfalls of doing so RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? Steroids calm down inflammation and the immune system, which is why they are already used in conditions like arthritis and asthma, as well as in some severe infections. The drugs are not thought to be helpful in the early stages of a coronavirus infection - when symptoms include a cough, fever or a sudden loss of taste or smell. But as the disease develops, the immune system can go into overdrive, damaging the lungs and other organs. It is this stage of Covid that steroids are thought to help with. ""At the point at which you reach for an oxygen cylinder for a patient with Covid, you probably should be reaching for the prescription for corticosteroids,"" said Prof Martin Landray, from the University of Oxford. ""These results are instantly useable; they are widely available, cheap, well-understood drugs that reduce mortality."" Doctors are already using dexamethasone after the results earlier in the year, but the hope is that having the choice of different drugs will increase access to the treatment around the world. The drugs can either be swallowed as tablets or given via intravenous drip. The research so far has focused on low doses of steroids. There is no evidence that higher doses would be more effective. New guidelines for doctors are expected to be released by the World Health Organization. In the UK, NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: ""Just as we did with dexamethasone, the NHS will now take immediate action to ensure that patients who could benefit from treatment with hydrocortisone do so, adding a further weapon in the armoury in the worldwide fight against Covid-19.""

Fourteen on trial over Charlie Hebdo massacreThey are accused of helping Islamist militants stage the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack that killed 12.Europe,"Two gunmen killed 12 people in an attack on the magazine's office in 2015 Fourteen people are on trial in France over the deadly attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015. Most of the alleged accomplices are in court in Paris, but three are being tried in absentia. They are accused of helping the militant Islamist attackers who shot dead 12 people in and around Charlie Hebdo's Paris office in January 2015. In a related attack, a third gunman shot dead a policewoman, then attacked a Jewish store, killing four people. The 17 victims were killed over a period of three days. All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead. France marks five years since Paris massacre Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror How Europe deals with freed terror offenders Paris attacks: 'I am not Charlie' In the days following the January 2015 attacks, millions of people took part in solidarity marches across France and around the world under the slogan ""Je suis Charlie"" (I am Charlie). The magazine has marked the start of the trial by reprinting controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked protests in several Muslim countries. President Emmanuel Macron has since defended the freedom of the press and the French ""freedom to blaspheme, which is linked to freedom of conscience"". Eleven of the defendants were present in the courtroom on Wednesday. They gave their names and occupations, and all confirmed they intended to answer questions from the court. Survivors and relatives of the victims were also in court. Gala Renaud, the wife of one of the journalists killed, told reporters that you could ""already feel the tension"". ""I wanted to see the defendants in the box to see what they look like,"" she said, adding that she wanted to know ""what their motivations were, why this complicity and of course why innocent people were killed"". The trial is taking place amid tight security The trial has been delayed by almost four months because of the coronavirus pandemic. In March, the presiding judge said France's lockdown measures had made it impossible to bring together ""all the parties, witnesses and experts under the necessary sanitary conditions"". The alleged accomplices are accused of obtaining weapons and providing logistical support for the attack on Charlie Hebdo's office on 7 January 2015, as well as the subsequent attacks on a police officer and the Hyper Cacher supermarket. Three of the suspects are believed to have disappeared in northern Syria and Iraq and will be tried in absentia. Some reports suggest at least two of them were killed in bombing campaigns against the Islamic State group (IS). All three remain the subject of international arrest warrants. There are about 200 plaintiffs in the trial and survivors of the attacks are expected to testify. Millions of people joined solidarity rallies following the attacks in January 2015 On Monday, anti-terror prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard dismissed the suggestion that it was just ""little helpers"" who were facing justice. ""It is about individuals who are involved in the logistics, the preparation of the events, who provided means of financing, operational material, weapons [and] a residence,"" he told France Info radio. ""All this is essential to the terrorist action."" Among those present in court is Lassana Bathily, a Malian-born Muslim employee of the Jewish supermarketwho hid customers from the attackand was later granted French citizenship. The trial is expected to last until November. Eleven defendants are in the courtroom at the start of this 49-day trial, sitting under heavy guard in two glassed cubicles. All are in masks, so it is hard to read their emotions. For family members of the 17 victims, these are emotional moments. More than five years have passed, but much remains to be explained about how the attacks were prepared. The full extent of any co-operation between the Charlie Hebdo attackers and the supermarket gunman, for example, is not at all apparent. Nor is it clear what co-ordination there was with leaders of the groups to whom they paid allegiance - al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Islamic State. Another aspect that will be highlighted is the link between Islamist terror and petty delinquency in the high-immigration suburbs. On 7 January that year, two French Muslim gunmen - brothers ChÃ©rif and SaÃ¯d Kouachi - stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo in the Rue Nicolas-Appert before opening fire on its staff. The magazine's editor at the time,StÃ©phane Charbonnier, better known as Charb,was among four celebrated cartoonists who were killed. This video can not be played Footage taken from a rooftop in Paris shows two gunmen firing shots The gunmen were eventually killed by security forces after a lengthy manhunt. Their victims were eight journalists, two police officers, a caretaker and a visitor. In a related attack just days later, jihadist gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed three customers and an employee in a hostage siege at the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket in Porte de Vincennes in the east of Paris. He had earlier shot dead a policewoman in the city. Security forces eventually stormed the supermarket before killing him and freeing the remaining hostages. They include 35-year-oldAli Reza Polat, who is seen as the main link between the two attacks and is believed to have had a key role in obtaining the weapons used. He subsequently attempted to flee to Dubai, Lebanon and Syria but without success. MickaÃ«l Pastor Alwatik'sDNA was found on two guns discovered at Coulibaly's home and a glove at the scene.Mohamed Fareshas told investigators he was a middleman involved in the sale of the assault rifle used in the supermarket attack, whileAmir Ramdani, Samir Makhlouf,Willy PrevostandChristophe Raumelare accused of having provided support.

On trial in absentia isHayat Boumedienne, Coulibaly's partner. She fled France for Syria a week before the attack. Previously believed killed in a US air strike last year, French media reports now suggest she may still be alive. A female French jihadist questioned by security services as she tried to re-enter France told them that she had seen Hayat Boumedienne in the al-Hol camp for IS detainees last October and that Hayat Boumedienne had then escaped from the camp. Mohamed and Mehdi Belhoucineare accused of helping Hayat Boumedienne get to Syria. Both are believed to have been killed in Syria or Iraq. Mohamed Belhoucine also provided email addresses used by the other defendants. The radical weekly magazine was well known for taking swipes at the French establishment and religion and has long drawn controversy.

"No tax rise 'horror show', Sunak tells Tory MPsThe chancellor addresses recently elected Conservatives, amid some MPs' concerns over government U-turns.UK Politics","This video can not be played The government âcannot carry on doing exactly what we did this year foreverâ, says the chancellor Chancellor Rishi Sunak has reassured recently-elected Tory MPs there will not be a ""horror show of tax rises with no end in sight"", as the government deals with the costs of coronavirus. He urged the 2019 Conservative intake to show trust to overcome the ""short-term challenges"" the party faces. Some MPs have expressed fears U-turns are hurting the government's standing. Mr Sunak accidentally revealed the wording of his statement while holding his notes outside 11 Downing Street. Johnson accused of 'governing in hindsight' Covid families reject PM's meeting excuse What tasks lie ahead on the return to Westminster? The Conservative Party, which won an 80-seat majority at December's general election, has seen its opinion poll lead over Labour cut in recent weeks. This has led to concerns among some MPs who won seats in traditional Labour heartlands in the Midlands and northern England, known previously as its ""red wall"". An unnamed ""red wall"" Conservative told the Press Association MPs in these areas, and others in marginal seats, were ""jittery"" following a series of U-turns on subjects including exam results, the wearing of face coverings and school meal funding. They described the situation as a ""megadisaster"". And Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, treasurer of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, warned against ""own goals"", saying: ""We may have a big majority but that still doesn't mean to say that we shouldn't be as competent as possible as a government."" A photographer picked up the words in Rishi Sunak's statement It was reported at the weekend that substantialcorporation tax rises and capital gains tax changes,externalare being considered by the Treasury to deal with the enormous costs of coronavirus. But the government dismissed this as ""speculation"". The wording of Mr Sunak's statement, read out during a meeting in Parliament on Wednesday with Tory MPs first elected in 2019, which the prime minister also attended, was revealed when a photographer noticed the chancellor holding a script sheet while leaving 11 Downing Street. It read: ""We will need to do some difficult things, but I promise you, if we trust one another we will be able to overcome the short-term challenges."" Referring to the reports that there could be tax increases to pay for costs incurred during the pandemic, including the furlough scheme, it added: ""Now this doesn't mean a horror show of tax rises with no end in sight."" It continued: ""But it does mean treating the British people with respect, being honest with them about the challenges we face and showing them how we plan to correct our public finances and give our country the dynamic, low-tax economy we all want to see."" By Leila Nathoo, political correspondent With more MPs back at Westminster, the prime minister and his chancellor took the opportunity to reassure restless Tory backbenchers about the government's strategy. How to pay for the huge package of interventions to deal with the pandemic and its effects is at the forefront of Rishi Sunak's mind ahead of the Budget later this autumn. Borrowing has ballooned and the prime minister has already promised there will be no return to austerity. But there is nervousness among Tory MPs about rumours of tax rises and about the government's decision-making and messaging more broadly. Mr Sunak told his Conservative colleagues that ministers needed to show people the plan for correcting public finances. He faces difficult choices while devising it. Government sources denied the revelation of the chancellor's words in this way was ""embarrassing"", adding that they would have become a matter of public record anyway. Discussing the coronavirus crisis, Boris Johnson told the MPs: ""I know it's been tough. I've got to warn you, it's about to get tougher. The waters are about to get choppier. But we are going to deal with it."" The prime minister later addressed a meeting of all backbench Conservative MPs, with the 1922 Committee getting together for the first time since Parliament's summer recess. One MP present said he had been ""full of beans"", while a minister added that both the day's meetings had been about ""calming the troops"".

Fourteen on trial over Charlie Hebdo massacreThey are accused of helping Islamist militants stage the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack that killed 12.,"Two gunmen killed 12 people in an attack on the magazine's office in 2015 Fourteen people are on trial in France over the deadly attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015. Most of the alleged accomplices are in court in Paris, but three are being tried in absentia. They are accused of helping the militant Islamist attackers who shot dead 12 people in and around Charlie Hebdo's Paris office in January 2015. In a related attack, a third gunman shot dead a policewoman, then attacked a Jewish store, killing four people. The 17 victims were killed over a period of three days. All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead. France marks five years since Paris massacre Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror How Europe deals with freed terror offenders Paris attacks: 'I am not Charlie' In the days following the January 2015 attacks, millions of people took part in solidarity marches across France and around the world under the slogan ""Je suis Charlie"" (I am Charlie). The magazine has marked the start of the trial by reprinting controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked protests in several Muslim countries. President Emmanuel Macron has since defended the freedom of the press and the French ""freedom to blaspheme, which is linked to freedom of conscience"".

Russia opposition leader 'poisoned with Novichok',"There is ""unequivocal proof"" that Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, Germany has said. Chancellor Angela Merkel said he was a victim of attempted murder and the world would look to Russia for answers. Mr Navalny was flown to Berlin after falling ill on a flight in Siberia last month, and remains in a coma. His team says he was poisoned on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The Kremlin has dismissed the allegation. The Kremlin spokesman called on Germany for a full exchange of information and foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova complained the Novichok allegations were not backed up by evidence. ""Where are the facts, where are the formulas, at least some kind of information?"" she asked. Navlany 'Novichok poisoning' test for the West What are Novichok agents and what do they do? Navalny and Russiaâs arsenal of exotic poisons A Novichok nerve agent was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018. While they survived, a British woman later died in hospital. The UK accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack. Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the latest attack,externalas ""outrageous"". ""The Russian government must now explain what happened to Mr Navalny - we will work with international partners to ensure justice is done,"" he tweeted. After the government in Berlin released results of toxicology tests carried out at a military laboratory, Chancellor Merkel said there were now ""serious questions that only the Russian government can and must answer"". ""Someone tried to silence [Mr Navalny] and in the name of the whole German government I condemn that in the strongest terms."" Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Navalnyâs team sees Kremlin behind attack Chancellor Merkel said Germany's Nato and EU partners had been informed of the results of the investigation and they would decide on a common and appropriate response based on Russia's reaction. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya and Russia's ambassador to Germany would also be informed of the findings, the Berlin government said. The European Union has demanded a ""transparent"" investigation by the Russian government. ""Those responsible must be brought to justice,""a statement read,external. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also called for an inquiryin a tweet,external, while the US National Security Council (NSC) said the suspected poisoning was ""completely reprehensible"". ""We will work with allies and the international community to hold those in Russia accountable, wherever the evidence leads, and restrict funds for their malign activities,""an NSC spokesman said,external. Alexei Navalny is a name President Putin refuses to say out loud. It's an attempt to diminish his political significance, but the endless prosecutions, police detentions and giant fines Mr Navalny's faced over the years tell a different story about his impact. He's certainly annoyed a lot of people, from those targeted by his anti-corruption investigations to Vladimir Putin himself. So it is possible someone wanted to resolve the ""Navalny problem"" for good. The timing is largely irrelevant. Why now? Well, why not. But if whoever did this hoped to contain the fallout - a mysterious collapse, never explained by Russian doctors - the fact Navalny's team got him to Germany has blown that calculation. The ""collapse"" is now a deliberate attack, and a major international scandal. The Kremlin response so far is familiar: deny, obfuscate, demand proof. Mr Putin's spokesman has even hinted that if Mr Navalny had been poisoned, then it must have happened in Germany because doctors here detected nothing suspicious. Expect to hear a lot more along those lines in the days to come. Mr Navalny fell ill on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea at Tomsk airport. The flight of the prominent Putin critic was diverted to Omsk, where doctors treated him for three days before he was transferred to the CharitÃ© hospital in Berlin. Mr Navalny's transfer to Germany came after three days in hospital in Omsk The Kremlin says Russian doctors administered atropine - which can be used to treat the effects of nerve agents - but found no evidence of poisoning. Mrs Navalnaya said she feared Russian doctors had delayed his transfer as authorities were trying to wait for evidence of any chemical substance to disappear. Doctors at CharitÃ© hospital have said his condition is continuing to improve but he remains in an intensive care unit on a ventilator. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of advanced nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Novichok agents have similar effects to other nerve agents - they act by blocking messages from the nerves to the muscles, causing a collapse of many bodily functions. While some Novichok agents are liquids, others are thought to exist in solid form. This means they can be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Novichoks were designed to be more toxic than other chemical weapons, so some versions begin to take effect rapidly - in the order of 30 seconds to two minutes. In 2018, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left critically ill in the British city of Salisbury, after Russian suspects were alleged to have smeared the nerve agent on the door handle of the former Russian spy's home. What is the Salisbury poisoning's legacy? Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. Her partner became critically ill but recovered. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has led nationwide protests against the Russian authorities. He has called Mr Putin's party a place of ""crooks and thieves"" that is ""sucking the blood out of Russia"". However, he has been banned from standing against Mr Putin in elections because of a conviction for embezzlement. He denies the crime, saying his legal troubles are Kremlin reprisals for his fierce criticism. There have been a number of previous attacks on high-profile critics or opponents of President Putin, including politicians, intelligence officers and journalists. The Kremlin has always denied involvement. In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko - an ex-Russian intelligence officer who became a Kremlin critic and fled to the UK - died after his tea was poisoned by radioactive polonium-210. More recently, journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza alleged he was poisoned twice by Russian security services. He nearly died after suffering kidney failure in 2015 and two years later went into a coma for a week. Another Kremlin critic, Pyotr Verzilov, accused Russia's intelligence services of poisoning him in 2018, when he fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. He too was treated by Berlin's CharitÃ© hospital, and asked the Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation to arrange Mr Navalny's airlift there.

"Breaking|Breaking newsRussia opposition leader 'poisoned with Novichok'Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was poisoned with Novichok nerve agent, German government says.Europe","There is ""unequivocal proof"" that Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, Germany has said. Chancellor Angela Merkel said he was a victim of attempted murder and the world would look to Russia for answers. Mr Navalny was flown to Berlin after falling ill on a flight in Siberia last month, and remains in a coma. His team says he was poisoned on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The Kremlin has dismissed the allegation. The Kremlin spokesman called on Germany for a full exchange of information and foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova complained the Novichok allegations were not backed up by evidence. ""Where are the facts, where are the formulas, at least some kind of information?"" she asked. Navlany 'Novichok poisoning' test for the West What are Novichok agents and what do they do? Navalny and Russiaâs arsenal of exotic poisons A Novichok nerve agent was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018. While they survived, a British woman later died in hospital. The UK accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack. Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the latest attack,externalas ""outrageous"". ""The Russian government must now explain what happened to Mr Navalny - we will work with international partners to ensure justice is done,"" he tweeted. After the government in Berlin released results of toxicology tests carried out at a military laboratory, Chancellor Merkel said there were now ""serious questions that only the Russian government can and must answer"". ""Someone tried to silence [Mr Navalny] and in the name of the whole German government I condemn that in the strongest terms."" Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Navalnyâs team sees Kremlin behind attack Chancellor Merkel said Germany's Nato and EU partners had been informed of the results of the investigation and they would decide on a common and appropriate response based on Russia's reaction. Mr Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya and Russia's ambassador to Germany would also be informed of the findings, the Berlin government said. The European Union has demanded a ""transparent"" investigation by the Russian government. ""Those responsible must be brought to justice,""a statement read,external. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also called for an inquiryin a tweet,external, while the US National Security Council (NSC) said the suspected poisoning was ""completely reprehensible"". ""We will work with allies and the international community to hold those in Russia accountable, wherever the evidence leads, and restrict funds for their malign activities,""an NSC spokesman said,external. Alexei Navalny is a name President Putin refuses to say out loud. It's an attempt to diminish his political significance, but the endless prosecutions, police detentions and giant fines Mr Navalny's faced over the years tell a different story about his impact. He's certainly annoyed a lot of people, from those targeted by his anti-corruption investigations to Vladimir Putin himself. So it is possible someone wanted to resolve the ""Navalny problem"" for good. The timing is largely irrelevant. Why now? Well, why not. But if whoever did this hoped to contain the fallout - a mysterious collapse, never explained by Russian doctors - the fact Navalny's team got him to Germany has blown that calculation. The ""collapse"" is now a deliberate attack, and a major international scandal. The Kremlin response so far is familiar: deny, obfuscate, demand proof. Mr Putin's spokesman has even hinted that if Mr Navalny had been poisoned, then it must have happened in Germany because doctors here detected nothing suspicious. Expect to hear a lot more along those lines in the days to come. Mr Navalny fell ill on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea at Tomsk airport. The flight of the prominent Putin critic was diverted to Omsk, where doctors treated him for three days before he was transferred to the CharitÃ© hospital in Berlin. Mr Navalny's transfer to Germany came after three days in hospital in Omsk The Kremlin says Russian doctors administered atropine - which can be used to treat the effects of nerve agents - but found no evidence of poisoning. Mrs Navalnaya said she feared Russian doctors had delayed his transfer as authorities were trying to wait for evidence of any chemical substance to disappear. Doctors at CharitÃ© hospital have said his condition is continuing to improve but he remains in an intensive care unit on a ventilator. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of advanced nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works Novichok agents have similar effects to other nerve agents - they act by blocking messages from the nerves to the muscles, causing a collapse of many bodily functions. While some Novichok agents are liquids, others are thought to exist in solid form. This means they can be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Novichoks were designed to be more toxic than other chemical weapons, so some versions begin to take effect rapidly - in the order of 30 seconds to two minutes. In 2018, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left critically ill in the British city of Salisbury, after Russian suspects were alleged to have smeared the nerve agent on the door handle of the former Russian spy's home. What is the Salisbury poisoning's legacy? Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. Her partner became critically ill but recovered. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has led nationwide protests against the Russian authorities. He has called Mr Putin's party a place of ""crooks and thieves"" that is ""sucking the blood out of Russia"". However, he has been banned from standing against Mr Putin in elections because of a conviction for embezzlement. He denies the crime, saying his legal troubles are Kremlin reprisals for his fierce criticism. There have been a number of previous attacks on high-profile critics or opponents of President Putin, including politicians, intelligence officers and journalists. The Kremlin has always denied involvement. In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko - an ex-Russian intelligence officer who became a Kremlin critic and fled to the UK - died after his tea was poisoned by radioactive polonium-210. More recently, journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza alleged he was poisoned twice by Russian security services. He nearly died after suffering kidney failure in 2015 and two years later went into a coma for a week. Another Kremlin critic, Pyotr Verzilov, accused Russia's intelligence services of poisoning him in 2018, when he fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. He too was treated by Berlin's CharitÃ© hospital, and asked the Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation to arrange Mr Navalny's airlift there.

UK under pressure to impose Greece quarantineRising coronavirus cases prompted Scotland and Wales to introduce their own self-isolation rules.UKComments,"Clusters of coronavirus cases have been linked to the Greek island of Zakynthos, also known as Zante Ministers are facing pressure to decide whether tourists returning to England from Greece should quarantine, after Scotland and Wales introduced their own measures. Scotland has said travellers arriving from Greecemust quarantine for 14 days after 04:00 BST on Thursday. And Wales has askedarrivals from the Greek island Zakynthos to quarantine. It comes as travel company Tui cancelled all holidays to a resort on the Greek island after virus clusters. Tui calls for 'regional travel corridors' Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? The firm said it would no longer be offering trips to the resort of Laganas, on Zakynthos, from Thursday because of customers failing to follow coronavirus safety measures. Six clusters of cases have been linked to flights from the island - also known as Zante. Greece has insisted it is doing ""everything in our power"" to keep UK holidaymakers safe. The country's tourism minister, Haris Theoharis, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We're taking specific targeted measures where we see specific concentrations of cases. Measures that have been successful and have been working in the past few days."" Numbers in bars and restaurants on Zakynthos are being limited to reduce the spread of the virus Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there were six clusters of cases, amounting to more than 30 infections, linked to flights from the Greek island in the past week - including two flights which landed in England. He called for an ""early meeting with the UK government and devolved nations"" to discuss changing the rules. His comments came shortly after the Scottish government announced its own decision. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""With Scotland's relatively low infection rate, importation of new cases from Greece is a significant risk to public health."" Struggling to keep up? You're not alone! The UK government's travel quarantine has been a messy affair. There was real chaos when restrictions were re-imposed on arrivals from Spain at the height of a busy summer weekend. After that, ministers tried to bring in a more structured approach by reviewing each country's infection rate throughout each week and announcing any changes on Thursdays or Fridays. However the picture has been complicated further by the fact that the quarantine is a public health policy and so the Welsh and Scottish Governments can diverge from Westminster and classify countries differently. Now the Welsh government is bringing in testing on arrival for passengers too. That's awkward for the UK government because, for months, the aviation sector has been asking ministers to give their backing to testing at airports so people who test negative wouldn't have to quarantine for the full 14 days. Aviation bosses are frustrated about the delay over any announcement on that. And all the twists and turns over quarantine makes life for any foreign travel business incredibly hard. Meanwhile, the UK's biggest tour operator Tui is suspending its holidays in the resort of Laganas on Zakynthos. Andrew Flintham, managing director of Tui UK and Ireland, said anyone who had booked to go the resort after 3 September would be refunded for the cancellation, but that trips to all other resorts on Zakynthos would continue as normal. He said: ""The health and safety of our colleagues and customers is our primary concern and recent cases show that some customers are not following social distancing and Covid safety measures. ""It is therefore the right thing to do to protect and reduce a now identified potential risk to others by no longer offering holidays to this specific resort."" Nearly 200 people faced self-isolation after at least 16 passengers on a Tui flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff Airport tested positive for the virus. Some people claimed passengerswere not following Covid-19 rules. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic When a country surpasses 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past week, the UK government normally imposes 14 days of self-isolation on returning travellers. There were 14.3 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in Greece in the seven days to 1 September, up from 14.1 a week earlier. But several cases of the virus in Scotland have been traced back to Greece,including a passenger on a Tui flight from Zante to Glasgowon 23 August. Tui said customers due to travel to Greece from Scotland would be able to amend or cancel their holiday in light of the quarantine announcement. This video can not be played Tui boss Andrew Flintham says the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" Meanwhile, ministers areconsidering reimposing quarantine measures for those arriving in the UK from Portugalas coronavirus cases rise, sources have told the BBC. It has been less than two weeks since a travel corridor was established between Portugal and the UK, following a sustained period of falling cases in the country that put it below 20 cases per 100,000 people. But in the seven days up to 1 September, the seven-day rate has increased from 14.2 to 22.7. Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal, making up the largest number of overseas tourists to the country. Over May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed. The government has not commented on whether requirements for arrivals from Portugal will change again. Last week, Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic joined France, Spain and other destinations on the UK's quarantine list.

Pub decision defended as new restrictions kick inJohn Swinney responds to criticism that pubs will remain open despite a surge in Covid cases in Greater Glasgow and Clyde.ScotlandComments,"Pubs in the Glasgow area will not need to close as part of the new restrictions Scotland's deputy first minister has defended a decision to keep pubs open in greater Glasgow despite new limits on social contact. Restrictions on visiting other householdswere reintroduced in Glasgow and two neighbouring areason Tuesday. John Swinney said a rise in Covid cases was driven by household contacts and not the hospitality sector. The new rules affect more than 800,000 people in Glasgow City, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire. A further 86 new coronavirus cases in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area were confirmed on Wednesday - accounting for more than half of the total for the whole of Scotland, which was 156. Mr Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that it was important to take ""early action"" in the three areas to avoid having to take ""more significant action"" later which could affect the economy and schools. Can my builder work during the indoor visits ban? He explained: ""It's necessary because we feel we have to nip this particular problem in the bud in the west of Scotland. ""Across the whole of the country the number of positive cases per 100,000 is 9.2. In West Dunbartonshire it's 32.6, in Glasgow it's 21.8 and in East Renfrewshire it's 18.8 - so we've got sizeably different position in these three local authority areas."" These figures compare to a rate of 67.8 in Pendle, Lancashire, which was top of Public Health England's watchlistin its latest surveillance report,external. The weekly rate of 32.6 in West Dunbartonshire is similar to the rates in Salford and Bury in Greater Manchester, which sit in the top third of the watchlist. The restrictions are different toones introduced in Aberdeenin August, which included a five-mile travel limit for leisure and holidays, as well as the closure of pubs and restaurants. The contrast has been criticised by Douglas Lumsden, the co-leader of Aberdeen City Council and Conservative group leader. In a series of tweets, he said: I hope that @NicolaSturgeon will explain to businesses in Aberdeen that were forced to close, why Glasgow businesses are not being forced to close. ""Aberdeen was locked down for 3 weeks, no hospitality, no travel, no visiting. Glasgow lockdown = no visiting."" He added: ""Glasgow lockdown. No household gatherings so meet your pals in the pub instead."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Glasgow city, West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire people are being told not to host people from other households in their own homes or visit another person's home. Therestrictions,externalcame into effect from midnight. They will last for two weeks, but will be reviewed after a week. People living in those areas should also not visit someone else's home, no matter where it is. Mr Swinney said he understood Mr Lumsden's frustration, but said the councillor should be ""careful with some of his language"". ""The problem in Aberdeen stemmed from the hospitality sector, so we had to focus on the hospitality sector,"" he said. ""Here in Glasgow, we don't have evidence of that taking its course, so it would be inappropriate and disproportionate to take that action. ""We have got evidence from the contact tracing that has been undertaken on an extensive basis that this is predominantly emanating from household contacts."" Mr Swinney said the Scottish government needed to get on top of the rise in cases before it led to a more ""widespread problem"" in the west of Scotland and the whole country. Announcing the restrictions on Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, said they should be a ""wake-up call"" for the whole country to stick to government guidelines on preventing the spread of coronavirus. The first minister added that Covid-19 continued to be a dangerous and potentially deadly virus which was spreading in the Glasgow area ""primarily as a result of household gatherings"".

Lockdown measures eased in Burnley and Hyndburn,"Enhanced Covid-19 measures have been lifted in Burnley and Hyndburn Lockdown measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 have been eased in parts of Lancashire. People living in Burnley and Hyndburn can now socialise indoors in groups of up to two households. Tightened measureswere imposedat the end of July amid a rise in cases. The Department of Health and Social Care said it would continue to work with local leaders to ""keep all local restrictions under constant consideration"". Councillor Miles Parkinson OBE, leader of Hyndburn Borough Council, previously welcomed the news the enhanced restrictions were to be lifted but warned that residents must not become complacent. Leader of Burnley Council, Charlie Briggs, also called on residents to remain vigilant, adding ""I know it has been tough but your sacrifice has paid off"". By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit Hyndburn recorded a rate of just under 25 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 29 August. While that was up on the week before, it is still lower than two weeks earlier, when it recorded over 38 cases per 100,000. Burnley's rate is 28 per 100,000, up from 25 per 100,000 but still down on two weeks before, when it was about 48 per 100,000. Both areas are still well above the overall rate for England, which stands at about 12 cases per 100,000 people in a week, which is why public health chiefs are urging caution. The measures have also been lifted in Stockport, parts of Bradford, excluding Bradford city and Keighley town, parts of Calderdale, excluding Halifax, and parts of Kirklees, excluding Dewsbury and Batley. According to government rules,external, people living in these areas can now: Socialise in groups of up to two households indoors or in private gardens Stay overnight at somebody else's home but must try to social distance Book close contact services such as facials and brow or eyelash treatments Visit bowling alleys, roller rinks, soft play centres and casinos But the government has made aU-turn on its decision to ease measures in Trafford and Boltonfollowing a rise in coronavirus cases. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""We are working closely with leaders and local authorities across Greater Manchester and Lancashire in response to the changing situation and we keep all local restrictions under constant consideration.""

Ofqual warned public would not trust exam grades,"England's exams regulator, Ofqual, says it was a ""fundamental mistake"" to think the public would accept an emergency grading system instead of exam results. Chairman Roger Taylor said Ofqual advised ministers to hold socially-distanced exams or delay them. If these two options were unworkable, then calculated grades could be used, he said Ofqual had advised. Mr Taylor said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson cancelled exams without further reference to Ofqual. Labour said it was ""now clear"" that Mr Williamson was responsible for the exams chaos and that he should not blame Ofqual. But a spokesman for the Department for Education said that the decision to cancel exams had been a ""necessary step to fight the spread of coronavirus"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used Prime Minister's Questions to challenge Boris Johnson over when he first knew there was a problem with the algorithm for deciding grades. Mr Johnson defended his government's record, accusing Sir Keir of being ""Captain Hindsight"". Ofqual chief Sally Collier steps down after exam chaos Boris Johnson blames 'mutant algorithm' for exam problems How did the algorithm decide exam grades? ""We did institute a change, we did act,"" and students did get their grades, said the prime minister. Sally Collier resigned over the exams chaos But Mr Taylor told MPs on the Commons education select committee: ""The fundamental mistake was to believe this [system] would ever be acceptable to the public."" Mr Williamson took the decision to cancel exams when schools were closed by the coronavirus and increasing number of teachers were shielding. Ofqual had to develop a system to award grades for exams which pupils could no longer take. This produced a moderation process that saw 40% of A-level grades being lower than the grades estimated by their schools. But Mr Taylor defended Ofqual's approach to calculating grades, saying it was trying to carry out ministerial guidelines. He argued that the system of standardising grades, the so-called ""algorithm"", would on the whole have helped disadvantaged pupils. Students were left uncertain about grades in U-turns over exam results The Ofqual chairman said that in March the regulator had been consulted by the Department for Education about the implications of cancelling exams. At this point, Ofqual said there were four options: to delay exams until the virus crisis passed conduct socially distanced exams use some form of teacher and school-assessed certificates or to combine school-based assessments with the standardisation model to produce estimated grades Mr Taylor said that he and his officials had repeatedly warned the Department for Education of the risks of using estimated grades. Julie Swann, Ofqual's executive director for general qualifications, said a paper on May 1 ""highlighted the risk of widespread dissatisfaction"" from students, schools and colleges. But after problems and inconsistencies emerged with grades, the moderation process was ditched in a U-turn, and teachers' grades were used instead. The chief regulator, Sally Collier, resigned and the Department for Education's most senior civil servant, Jonathan Slater, stepped down following the exams chaos. Mr Taylor, also revealed Ofqual guidance on using ""valid mock"" exam results to widen the appeals process, was removed from the Ofqual website after an intervention from England's education secretary. Results for this year's exams were caught up in confusion Mr Williamson had decided to allow mock exam results to be used as evidence in appeals over grades. Mr Taylor said Mr Williamson telephoned the chief regulator, Sally Collier, late on a Saturday night, August 15, after Ofqual published new appeals guidance, saying it was not consistent with the education secretary's policy. Ofqual, which is independent from government, had been trying to formulate a way for such appeals to work, while meeting its statutory duty to ensure exams were fair. Mr Taylor said the board then met in emergency session to try to find a way through a situation which was rapidly ""spinning out of control"". ""We advised the Secretary of State at this point that we could not be confident that this could be delivered within the statutory duties of Ofqual to ensure that valid and trustworthy grades were being issued."" Discussions followed throughout Sunday, in which it became clear that a move to ""centre assessed grades"", which had been submitted by schools and colleges, was all but inevitable. Mr Williamson went on to announce that results would use these centre assessed grades in a major U-turn. A Department for Education spokesman said the ""government never wanted to cancel exams because they are the best and fairest form of assessment. ""We listened to views from a range of parties, including Ofqual, and given the public health requirements at the time, made what was a very difficult decision on the basis that it was a necessary step to fight the spread of coronavirus.""

"BBC reverses Proms decision on Rule, Britannia!There had been fierce criticism after the lyrics were dropped for The Last Night of the Proms.Entertainment & Arts","The BBC has reversed its decision not to have Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory sung at The Last Night of the Proms. The U-turn follows fierce criticism sparked by reports that the lyrics were being dropped due to associations with colonialism and slavery. Last week, the BBC said the decision to perform orchestral-only versions was prompted by Covid-19 restrictions. However, a ""select"" group of singers will now perform the songs after all. ""The pandemic means a different Proms this year and one of the consequences, under Covid-19 restrictions, is we are not able to bring together massed voices,"" the BBC said in a new statement. ""For that reason we took the artistic decision not to sing Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory in the Hall."" But, the statement added, the BBC had been ""looking hard at what else might be possible"" and had found ""a solution"". The socially-distanced BBC Singers took part in the First Night of the Proms ""Both pieces will now include a select group of BBC Singers. This means the words will be sung in the Hall, and as we have always made clear, audiences will be free to sing along at home."" At The First Night of the Proms,18 socially-distanced members of the BBC Singers performed in the Royal Albert Hall's otherwise empty stalls, with the orchestra on stage. The BBC's original decision to play instrumental versions on the Last Night on 12 September prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene. ""I cannot believe... that the BBC is saying that they will not sing the words of Land of Hope And Glory or Rule Britannia! as they traditionally do at the end of The Last Night of The Proms,"" he told reporters last week. ""I think it's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general bout of self-recrimination and wetness."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""Confident forward-looking nations don't erase their history, they add to it."" On Wednesday, a Number 10 spokesman said the prime minister ""welcomes the decision"" to backtrack. Speaking to Conservative MPs, Mr Johnson said: ""I do think this country is going through an orgy of national embarrassment about some of the things that other people around the world love most about us. ""People love our traditions and our history with all its imperfections. It's crazy for us to go around trying to censor it. It's absolutely absurd and I think we should speak out loud and proud for the UK and our history."" Mr Dowden also gave his reaction. Allow Twitter content?

First-day nerves advice for parents,"It's more than 160 days since schools sent home pupils at the beginning of the lockdown. No-one at the time, in those bewildering March days, could have known when children would return. The leaves that were starting to appear on the trees when children hurried home are now about to turn brown. It's been a long and strange summer. Exams were cancelled and there were replacement results. And then those results were cancelled too. There was constant confusion over whether or not pupils were going back to school. Home-schooling didn't always really happen and rites of passage such as leaving events had to be called off. There were more u-turns than a handwriting text book. Many pupils will not have been to school since they were brought home in March But children are now going back full-time for the new school year. The ""new normal"" became a lockdown cliche, but going back to school in September is a rare case of the old normal. So what's it going to be like for these returning pupils? What should parents be saying to them? Are they going to be able to get back to learning after months of lie-ins and Netflix? ""I think there's a real need to recognise the physical, mental and emotional impact of going back,"" says leading educational psychologist, Daniel O'Hare. Sadness for pupils who may never go back to their schools 'Final year like no other' PM tells school leavers 'He's not getting up until one o'clock', say parents Children are likely to be ""drained"" by the sudden ""overload"" of being in school after being cocooned at home for so long, says Dr O'Hare, joint chair-elect of the British Psychological Society's education and child psychology division. ""It will be very new to go back into that full-on setting with 30 children in a class,"" he says. What makes it more complicated, says Dr O'Hare, is that the lockdown has been experienced by families in such different ways. School dinners will be back on the menu as the new term starts For some children, there will have been worries about their families catching the virus, or facing pressures over money, insecure jobs and lack of space. ""But on the other hand, there will be a population of children who have experienced lockdown as very positive,"" says Dr O'Hare. PPE at lunch and one-way systems â the new school term First primary pupils go back to school How did going back to school lose the plot? They will not have had the stresses of school and they might have enjoyed spending more time together with their parents. The lockdown saw a temporary reinvention of family life, with those parents working from home seeing more of their children than would ever usually be possible. When this finishes, children and perhaps also their parents could miss this closeness. Schools have been getting their safety plans ready for when pupils return Dr O'Hare says it would be a misunderstanding to think this follows socio-economic lines, with middle class families having had a better time during the lockdown. ""We have spoken to children from disadvantaged families and they said that they really enjoyed spending so much time with mum and they loved playing games and that it was better than before,"" he said. ""You know there's a real mix of stories coming from children about going back to school."" It means many different, contradictory responses which schools will have to address. Some researchers have warned ofincreased mental health worrieswhile at the same time others have said teenagers'anxiety levels have gone down during the pandemic. ""Children have missed school and all of the social benefits that it brings,"" says Dr O'Hare, who works with the local education authority in Gloucestershire and at the University of Bristol. For children who have ""challenging home circumstances"", he says there might be a relief at being back at school. But uncertainty also creates stress and the new school year could look very different. What will it be like getting up for school after months of lie-ins and without a routine? Dr O'Hare says parents can help to reduce anxiety by letting children know what changes to expect - how they will be in separate ""bubbles"", the one-way systems, the transport arrangements, the changes to timetables and the hand washing. Another educational psychologist, Will Shield, based at the University of Exeter, says children should be told that it's ""absolutely ok to be concerned"" about going back and to talk about any particular worries. ""It is important that teachers and parents let pupils know it is perfectly normal to be concerned about being away from home or worried about learning they may have missed, alongside feeling excited and happy about returning to school,"" said Dr Shield. Dr O'Hare says research shows children might be frightened of catching coronavirus and putting their family at risk. Hand washing is going to be an important part of the new school routine Friendship groups could have changed and there might be anxiety about falling behind with school work after so much missed time, he says, The children's charity Barnardos has published research suggesting that 4% of children might try to refuse to return to school at all. A survey for Netmums suggested a fifth of parents were still worried about the safety of going back to school, while a YouGov poll suggested about one in six parents was ""seriously considering"" keeping their children out of school. But Dr O'Hare says not to predict or expect problems, because the biggest reaction might be about seeing friends again. There was a first wave of school returns for primary pupils in June ""The conversation can also be positive. What are they looking forward to? Who are they looking forward to seeing? I think it's about trying to promote that sense of excitement,"" he says. He recommends ""watchful waiting - just being aware of the different reactions that children can have"" and keeping talking to them about how they feel about going back. ""Because some children might seem fine and it's not until three or four weeks later that they have a massive outburst.""

Will schools spread coronavirus?,"All pupils in England - and many in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - can now be taught face-to-face in school classrooms. What is known about how the virus is transmitted among children and the risk to pupil, teachers and the rest of the community? The risk of children becoming seriously ill from the virus is tiny. This hasn't changed even with a new, more contagious variant of coronavirus circulating. Despite a rise in the number of children infected during the winter, there was not a substantial rise in hospital admissions. ""As cases in the community rise there will be a small increase in the number of children we see with Covid-19, but the overwhelming majority of children and young people have no symptoms or very mild illness only,"" says Prof Russell Viner, president of Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Among pupils in primary schools, evidence shows that there is limited spread of coronavirus. But teenagers - particularly older teens - are probably more like adults in the way they transmit the virus. In the second wave of England's epidemic in the autumn and early winter,schoolchildren and young adults experienced a much faster rise in infectionsthan other age groups - most likely because they had more opportunities to mingle. During England's November lockdown, schools remained open and operated normally, when many other places had shut down. This is difficult to say. When schools are open, there is more spread among schoolchildren, particularly those at secondary level. There have also been signs that transmission dips after school holidays, such as half-term. But it's hard to say whether children are catching the virus in the classroom, or on the bus or hanging out with friends after school. Rates of infection in schools tend to reflect rates of infection elsewhere. An ONS survey of 100 schools in England, which tested random pupils and staff without symptoms, found 1.24% of pupils and 1.29% of staff tested positive for the infection in November, mirroring an estimated 1.2% infection rate in the general population. Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, has said schools are ""not a significant driver"" of cases of Covid in communities, although she said children could definitely transmit the infection in schools and elsewhere. Sage, the government's scientific advisory group, has suggested opening schools could increase the virus'sreproduction rate or R numberby as much as 30%. But this is highly uncertain and depends a lot in factors like testing, masks and ventilation. Teachers do not seem to be at significantly higher risk than other occupations. In December, 15% of teaching and support staff tested positive for antibodies, giving them an average risk for their age. In contrast, between 25% and 50% of hospital staff had antibodies, while in care homes that had at least one Covid outbreak, two-thirds (66%) of staff had antibodies by the end of the first wave. And overall, teaching and education professionals are no more likely to die of Covid than their peers. Teachers 'not at higher risk' from Covid When will I get a Covid vaccine? Nurses, cleaners, social workers, restaurant staff, taxi drivers and security workers are all at greater risk than teachers, according to the Office for National Statistics. That doesn't tell the whole story, of course - your ethnic background, underlying health conditions, where you live and who you live with are all factors too. Teachers tend to be younger and healthier on average than some other occupations and they're also more likely to be female - all factors which put them in lower risk groups. According to Dr Shamez Ladhani, the chief investigator of the ONS schools survey and a consultant at Public Health England, the long-term harm of keeping children out of school is ""enormous"", but adds that ""the risks are not zero"". Sage says policymakers need to weigh up the benefits and harms of closing schools. This includes reducing the direct health risks to staff, and the negative impact on children's mental health, education, development and wellbeing. Many experts agree this is a difficult balancing act. Covid: What is the mental health cost to the young?

Tui halts trips to Zante resort after virus cases,"Clusters of coronavirus cases have been linked to the Greek island of Zakynthos, also known as Zante Ministers are facing pressure to decide whether tourists returning to England from Greece should quarantine, after Scotland and Wales introduced their own measures. Scotland has said travellers arriving from Greecemust quarantine for 14 days after 04:00 BST on Thursday. And Wales has askedarrivals from the Greek island Zakynthos to quarantine. It comes as travel company Tui cancelled all holidays to a resort on the Greek island after virus clusters. Tui calls for 'regional travel corridors' Can I still go on holiday to Portugal or Greece? The firm said it would no longer be offering trips to the resort of Laganas, on Zakynthos, from Thursday because of customers failing to follow coronavirus safety measures. Six clusters of cases have been linked to flights from the island - also known as Zante. Greece has insisted it is doing ""everything in our power"" to keep UK holidaymakers safe. The country's tourism minister, Haris Theoharis, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We're taking specific targeted measures where we see specific concentrations of cases. Measures that have been successful and have been working in the past few days."" Numbers in bars and restaurants on Zakynthos are being limited to reduce the spread of the virus Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there were six clusters of cases, amounting to more than 30 infections, linked to flights from the Greek island in the past week - including two flights which landed in England. He called for an ""early meeting with the UK government and devolved nations"" to discuss changing the rules. His comments came shortly after the Scottish government announced its own decision. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""With Scotland's relatively low infection rate, importation of new cases from Greece is a significant risk to public health."" Struggling to keep up? You're not alone! The UK government's travel quarantine has been a messy affair. There was real chaos when restrictions were re-imposed on arrivals from Spain at the height of a busy summer weekend. After that, ministers tried to bring in a more structured approach by reviewing each country's infection rate throughout each week and announcing any changes on Thursdays or Fridays. However the picture has been complicated further by the fact that the quarantine is a public health policy and so the Welsh and Scottish Governments can diverge from Westminster and classify countries differently. Now the Welsh government is bringing in testing on arrival for passengers too. That's awkward for the UK government because, for months, the aviation sector has been asking ministers to give their backing to testing at airports so people who test negative wouldn't have to quarantine for the full 14 days. Aviation bosses are frustrated about the delay over any announcement on that. And all the twists and turns over quarantine makes life for any foreign travel business incredibly hard. Meanwhile, the UK's biggest tour operator Tui is suspending its holidays in the resort of Laganas on Zakynthos. Andrew Flintham, managing director of Tui UK and Ireland, said anyone who had booked to go the resort after 3 September would be refunded for the cancellation, but that trips to all other resorts on Zakynthos would continue as normal. He said: ""The health and safety of our colleagues and customers is our primary concern and recent cases show that some customers are not following social distancing and Covid safety measures. ""It is therefore the right thing to do to protect and reduce a now identified potential risk to others by no longer offering holidays to this specific resort."" Nearly 200 people faced self-isolation after at least 16 passengers on a Tui flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff Airport tested positive for the virus. Some people claimed passengerswere not following Covid-19 rules. JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic When a country surpasses 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past week, the UK government normally imposes 14 days of self-isolation on returning travellers. There were 14.3 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in Greece in the seven days to 1 September, up from 14.1 a week earlier. But several cases of the virus in Scotland have been traced back to Greece,including a passenger on a Tui flight from Zante to Glasgowon 23 August. Tui said customers due to travel to Greece from Scotland would be able to amend or cancel their holiday in light of the quarantine announcement. This video can not be played Tui boss Andrew Flintham says the government should consider ""regional travel corridors"" Meanwhile, ministers areconsidering reimposing quarantine measures for those arriving in the UK from Portugalas coronavirus cases rise, sources have told the BBC. It has been less than two weeks since a travel corridor was established between Portugal and the UK, following a sustained period of falling cases in the country that put it below 20 cases per 100,000 people. But in the seven days up to 1 September, the seven-day rate has increased from 14.2 to 22.7. Every year, more than two million Britons visit Portugal, making up the largest number of overseas tourists to the country. Over May and June, the Portuguese government reopened its restaurants, coffee shops, museums and beaches. Hotels have mainly reopened, but nightclubs remain closed. The government has not commented on whether requirements for arrivals from Portugal will change again. Last week, Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic joined France, Spain and other destinations on the UK's quarantine list.

David Byrne apologises for 1984 blackface video,"""I have changed since then,"" said Byrne Talking Heads frontman David Byrne has apologised for a video in which he impersonates people of colour using black and brownface. The promotional video for 1984's concert film Stop Making Sense, sees the star interviewing himself, while playing several different reporters. After the clip resurfaced on social media, Byrne issued a statement expressing his regret and dismay. ""I acknowledge it was a major mistake in judgement,"" he wrote. Admitting that the sketch showed ""a real lack of understanding"", he added: ""It's like looking in a mirror and seeing someone else - you're not, or were not, the person you thought you were.""

Byrne joins a number of performers and comedians who have been forced to acknowledge blackface performances in recent months, as protests over the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and, more recently, the shooting of Jacob Blake, led to broader calls for accountability. Ant and Decsaid they were ""sincerely sorry""for impersonating people of colour on past episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway, and US chat show hostJimmy Kimmel apologisedfor his ""thoughtless"" portrayals of black stars like Snoop Dogg, Oprah Winfrey and basketball player Karl Malone. Comedian Tina Feywithdrew four episodes of her show 30 Rockwhich portrayed characters in blackface, adding in a letter that she was sorry ""for the pain they have caused"". Matt Lucas and David Walliams also issued a statement about the sketch show Little Britain, saying: ""we regret that we played characters of other races"". Byrne said his apology came after a journalist highlighted the existence of the Stop Making Sense sketch. ""We have huge blind spots about ourselves- well, I certainly do,"" he said.

"Ofqual warned public would not trust exam gradesMinisters were warned replacement results would be ""enormously difficult"" and unlikely to win support.","England's exams regulator, Ofqual, says it was a ""fundamental mistake"" to think the public would accept an emergency grading system instead of exam results. Chairman Roger Taylor said Ofqual advised ministers to hold socially-distanced exams or delay them. If these two options were unworkable, then calculated grades could be used, he said Ofqual had advised. Mr Taylor said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson cancelled exams without further reference to Ofqual. Labour said it was ""now clear"" that Mr Williamson was responsible for the exams chaos and that he should not blame Ofqual. But a spokesman for the Department for Education said that the decision to cancel exams had been a ""necessary step to fight the spread of coronavirus"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used Prime Minister's Questions to challenge Boris Johnson over when he first knew there was a problem with the algorithm for deciding grades. Mr Johnson defended his government's record, accusing Sir Keir of being ""Captain Hindsight"". Ofqual chief Sally Collier steps down after exam chaos Boris Johnson blames 'mutant algorithm' for exam problems How did the algorithm decide exam grades? ""We did institute a change, we did act,"" and students did get their grades, said the prime minister. Sally Collier resigned over the exams chaos But Mr Taylor told MPs on the Commons education select committee: ""The fundamental mistake was to believe this [system] would ever be acceptable to the public."" Mr Williamson took the decision to cancel exams when schools were closed by the coronavirus and increasing number of teachers were shielding. Ofqual had to develop a system to award grades for exams which pupils could no longer take. This produced a moderation process that saw 40% of A-level grades being lower than the grades estimated by their schools. But Mr Taylor defended Ofqual's approach to calculating grades, saying it was trying to carry out ministerial guidelines. He argued that the system of standardising grades, the so-called ""algorithm"", would on the whole have helped disadvantaged pupils. Students were left uncertain about grades in U-turns over exam results The Ofqual chairman said that in March the regulator had been consulted by the Department for Education about the implications of cancelling exams. At this point, Ofqual said there were four options: to delay exams until the virus crisis passed conduct socially distanced exams use some form of teacher and school-assessed certificates or to combine school-based assessments with the standardisation model to produce estimated grades Mr Taylor said that he and his officials had repeatedly warned the Department for Education of the risks of using estimated grades. Julie Swann, Ofqual's executive director for general qualifications, said a paper on May 1 ""highlighted the risk of widespread dissatisfaction"" from students, schools and colleges. But after problems and inconsistencies emerged with grades, the moderation process was ditched in a U-turn, and teachers' grades were used instead. The chief regulator, Sally Collier, resigned and the Department for Education's most senior civil servant, Jonathan Slater, stepped down following the exams chaos. Mr Taylor, also revealed Ofqual guidance on using ""valid mock"" exam results to widen the appeals process, was removed from the Ofqual website after an intervention from England's education secretary. Results for this year's exams were caught up in confusion Mr Williamson had decided to allow mock exam results to be used as evidence in appeals over grades. Mr Taylor said Mr Williamson telephoned the chief regulator, Sally Collier, late on a Saturday night, August 15, after Ofqual published new appeals guidance, saying it was not consistent with the education secretary's policy. Ofqual, which is independent from government, had been trying to formulate a way for such appeals to work, while meeting its statutory duty to ensure exams were fair. Mr Taylor said the board then met in emergency session to try to find a way through a situation which was rapidly ""spinning out of control"". ""We advised the Secretary of State at this point that we could not be confident that this could be delivered within the statutory duties of Ofqual to ensure that valid and trustworthy grades were being issued."" Discussions followed throughout Sunday, in which it became clear that a move to ""centre assessed grades"", which had been submitted by schools and colleges, was all but inevitable. Mr Williamson went on to announce that results would use these centre assessed grades in a major U-turn. A Department for Education spokesman said the ""government never wanted to cancel exams because they are the best and fairest form of assessment. ""We listened to views from a range of parties, including Ofqual, and given the public health requirements at the time, made what was a very difficult decision on the basis that it was a necessary step to fight the spread of coronavirus.""

Pompidou and Dome architect Richard Rogers retiresHe overcame controversy to become one of a handful of architects credited with shaping modern cities.,"Richard Rogers with a model of the Lloyds building in 1995 Richard Rogers, one of the world's most successful and influential architects, has stepped down from his firm after more than 40 years. Lord Rogers, 87, designed landmark buildings including the Pompidou Centre in Paris, the Millennium Dome in London and the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff. He is one of a handful of architects credited with shaping modern cities. He has retired from Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, which he founded as the Richard Rogers Partnership in 1977. The Pompidou Centre and other buildings were controversial when they opened Inside the Lloyds building in London, which opened in 1986 He has won most of architecture's major honours, including the prestigious Pritzker Prize in 2007 and the Stirling Prize twice. He was knighted in 1991. He came to prominence in the 1970s and 80s with two buildings that were controversial at the time for putting amenities like lifts and air conditioning ducts on the outside - the Pompidou, which he designed with Renzo Piano, and the Lloyds building in London. His critics have included Prince Charles, who has spoken about his dislike of Lord Rogers' designs on several occasions. But that did not prevent the architect from going to strength to strength around the world. His other creations included the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff, Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport and Terminal 4 of Madrid's Barajas Airport. The Welsh Assembly building opened in 2006 The Millennium Dome is now the O2 Arena The piazza as a public meeting place is often central to his ideas. ""The concept that cities contain places where people can exchange ideas and meet others - that's the most exciting thing,"" he told the BBC World Service in 2013. More recently, he built 3 World Trade Center in New York, an 80-storey skyscraper on the site of the former Twin Towers. But he has said his favourite project was one of his first, and the most personal -the modernist house he designed for his parents in Wimbledon,externalin the late 1960s. Lord Rogers was behind the design for Heathrow Terminal 5 He also advised on urban planning in cities including London and Barcelona. He chaired the influential Urban Task Force on the state of the UK's cities from 1998-2001. His company will now be led by partners Ivan Harbour and Graham Stirk, and under its constitution will drop Rogers' name within the next two years,according to Building Design,external.

Christopher Nolan's spy thriller is the first major studio release since cinemas began reopening in July. Tenet opened in more than 600 UK and Irish cinemas last week having had its launch delayed several times. The Showcase cinema chain said its ticket sales increased by 75% ahead of the film's eagerly anticipated release.

The initiative will pay employers Â£1,500 for every 16-24 year old they train - the aim being to help those people build the skills they need to find a job. It comes as the UK furlough scheme, referred to earlier at PMQs, ends next month. Lois Johnson-Smith, from Lincolnshire, graduated from college this year after completing a course in musical theatre and was due to start work in July in a local entertainment venue.

The 83-year-old media tycoon has suffered other health setbacks in recent years - a severe heart attack in 2016 and emergency bowel surgery in 2019. He has been beset by financial scandals with a conviction for tax fraud in 2013 - which saw him ejected from the Italian Senate - and another conviction in 2015. Despite being temporarily banned from holding public office, he led his centre-right Forza Italia party to moderate electoral success in 2018.

A year later, with his ban lifted, he won himself a seat in the European Parliament at the age of 82. His staff say he is isolating at his home and he will continue to support candidates of Forza Italia. Italian news agency Ansa quoted Forza Italia politician Sestino Giacomoni telling other party members that, ""despite everything, he is fine and he wanted to let you know that he will continue to campaign"". Read more on Silvio Berlusconi's eventful career here. A senior Bank of England official has cast doubt on the UK government's drive to get workers back to the office as coronavirus curbs are eased. Alex Brazier, the bank's executive director for financial stability, told a committee of MPs that a ""sharp return"" to ""dense office environments"" should not be expected.

""If a teacher didnât have the coronavirus when they arrived, they will be infected now,"" said one queuing teacher, quoted in El Confidencial on Wednesday. School staff received the request on Tuesday to go to one of five testing centres in the city between Wednesday and Monday. But by midday on Wednesday, the queues were so long that most tests had to be suspended.  Antibody testing is one of the new measures for Madrid's return to school Esteban Ãlvarez, president of the Madrid Association of High School Principals, toldEl Pais,external: âThere are thousands of us, itâs crazy to bring us all together.â As we reported earlier, at least a quarter of Spain's new infections are in the capital. The city has seen 14,871 new cases in the past week. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK is slowly rising, UK government statistics show. There have been a
further 1,508 cases reported in the UK and 10 deaths,according to the daily figures,external. A total of 41,514 people who have tested positive for coronavirus have died in the UK.

There's some good news from Iceland after a study of 30,000 citizens found that antibodies giving immunity to Covid-19 can last for at least four months after the initial infection. This is far longer than previous studies have suggested. The study, carried out by the Icelandic biotech company deCODE Genetics, measured the antibody levels in Icelanders who became infected earlier this year. Of a group that received a laboratory-tested confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19, more than 90% saw antibody levels rise during the first two months before they plateaued, remaining stable for four months. The results, published in The New England Journal of Medicine,external, contrasts with smaller studies which suggested antibodies disappeared quickly. An editorial accompanying the article said the results provided hope that ""immunity to this unpredictable and highly contagious virus may not be fleeting"". England is under pressure to reconsider quarantine rules for Greece after Scotland and Wales introduced new measures over concerns about rising coronavirus cases. From tomorrow anyone from Scotland who travels to Greece will need to self-isolate on their return. Welsh passengers arriving back from the island of Zakynthos will have to do the same. Meanwhile, ministers areconsidering reimposing quarantine measures for those arriving in the UK from Portugalas coronavirus cases rise, sources have told the BBC. No announcement on travel rules for Greece or for Portugal is expected today. Travel announcements usually take place on a Thursday or Friday, Transport correspondent Tom Burridge says. Our correspondent says the UK government's rules ""has been a messy affair"". ""The picture has been complicated further by the fact that the quarantine is a public health policy and so the Welsh and Scottish Governments can diverge from Westminster and classify countries differently,"" he says. ""Now the Welsh government is bringing in testing on arrival for passengers too. ""That's awkward for the UK government because, for months, the aviation sector has been asking ministers to give their backing to testing at airports so people who test negative wouldn't have to quarantine for the full 14 days.""

South Africa's auditor general finds authorities paying five times the recommended price for PPE An investigation into the use of the South African government's Covid-19 relief fund has revealed ""frightening findings"", the country's auditor general has said. A report by Kimi Makwetu, who has been tracking the spending of 500 billion rand ($26bn; Â£19bn), detailed overpricing and ""potential fraud"". He said in some cases personal protective equipment (PPE) was bought for five times more than the price the national treasury had advised. The report also flagged up 30,000 relief grants which ""require further investigation"". The allocated funds were meant to help vulnerable households with food parcels, unemployment grants, support small business, farmers and to also procure PPE. Readmore on this story here. The UK's Chancellor Rishi Sunak has reassured recently elected Tory MPs there will not be a ""horror show of tax rises with no end in sight"", as the government deals with the costs of the coronavirus pandemic. He urged the 2019 Conservative intake to show trust to overcome the ""short-term challenges"" the party faces. Some MPs have expressed fears U-turns are hurting the government's standing.

Over two weeks, more than 1.4 million applicants will take the three-hour exam sitting at desks on the running tracks or walkways of sports arenas.

The massive exercise began on Wednesday, with tens of thousands of youngsters turning up at stadiums. They are competing for about 150,000 places under a centralised admissions system. Uzbekistan - a former Soviet republic in Central Asia - has just ended its second national lockdown after a surge in cases over the summer threatened to buckle its healthcare system. The country has so far reported 42,370 coronavirus cases with 324 confirmed deaths. Bosses of the Eden Project in Cornwall, England, have confirmed 169 people will lose their jobs at the attraction because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Eden Project said in July it had lost more than Â£7m this financial year. Bosses said they were ""gutted"" to make the decision following a six-week consultation period during July and August. The cuts will see the equivalent of 122 full-time jobs go, out of a total 375 full-time equivalent roles. The project confirmed 72 of those leaving took voluntary redundancy. Three Paris St-Germain players have tested positive for coronavirus, the Ligue 1 football club said on Wednesday. The French champions, who lost in the Champions League final last month, have not named the players. ""All of the players and coaching staff will continue to undergo tests in the coming days,"" a club statement said. More on this story here. Allow Twitter content?

Tenet gives shot in arm to UK and Ireland cinemas,"John David Washington plays the unnamed 'Protagonist' in Nolan's film Sci-fi blockbuster Tenet has given a welcome shot in the arm to the UK and Ireland's cinemas, taking Â£5.33 million in its first week on release. Christopher Nolan's sci-fi spy thriller is the first major studio release since cinemas began reopening in July. Tenet opened in more than 600 UK and Irish cinemas last week having had its launch delayed several times. The Showcase cinema chain said its ticket sales increased by 75% ahead of the film's eagerly anticipated release. Tenet also performed well internationally, taking $53.6m (Â£40m) from sites in the Middle East, Europe and South Korea. The film, a time-bending action drama set in numerous countries, will open in the US, Russia and China later this week. Critics laud Nolan's 'mind-bending wonder' Tenet Tenet: The film hoping to get us back into cinemas Warner Bros chairman Toby Emmerich said the studio ""couldn't be more pleased"" by the film's ""fantastic start"". He said British film-maker Nolan had ""once again delivered an event-worthy motion picture that demands to be seen on the big screen"". Face masks are currently mandatory in UK and Irish cinemas, which are operating at a reduced capacity due to social distancing guidelines. Takings have been modest since they began reopening in July, with only one other title making more than Â£1m over that period. That film was theRussell Crowe road rage thriller Unhinged, whose takings now stand at Â£1.2m after five weeks on release. Unhinged sees Russell Crowe play a driver with anger management issues Tenet's closest official competitor over the weekend was Onward, which opened in cinemas before the coronavirus lockdown in March. The fantastical Pixar animation made Â£185,028 last weekend, bringing its overall takings since release to Â£6.65m. Technically, though, it was outperformed by The New Mutants, which had a weekend of previews ahead of its release on Friday. The X-Men spin-off made Â£222,000 from those preview screenings, according to figures postedby the Box Office Mojo website,external. Tenet's box office performance will be keenly scrutinised by rival studios as they prepare to unveil their own Covid-affected product. That includes James Bond film No Time to Die, which is due to open in November having had its earlier release date in April put back. A new trailer for the film, which will see Daniel Craig make his final appearance as secret agent 007, will be released on Thursday. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Rule Britannia will be sung at Proms, BBC confirms","The BBC has reversed its decision not to have Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory sung at The Last Night of the Proms. The U-turn follows fierce criticism sparked by reports that the lyrics were being dropped due to associations with colonialism and slavery. Last week, the BBC said the decision to perform orchestral-only versions was prompted by Covid-19 restrictions. However, a ""select"" group of singers will now perform the songs after all. ""The pandemic means a different Proms this year and one of the consequences, under Covid-19 restrictions, is we are not able to bring together massed voices,"" the BBC said in a new statement. ""For that reason we took the artistic decision not to sing Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory in the Hall."" But, the statement added, the BBC had been ""looking hard at what else might be possible"" and had found ""a solution"". The socially-distanced BBC Singers took part in the First Night of the Proms ""Both pieces will now include a select group of BBC Singers. This means the words will be sung in the Hall, and as we have always made clear, audiences will be free to sing along at home."" At The First Night of the Proms,18 socially-distanced members of the BBC Singers performed in the Royal Albert Hall's otherwise empty stalls, with the orchestra on stage. The BBC's original decision to play instrumental versions on the Last Night on 12 September prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene. ""I cannot believe... that the BBC is saying that they will not sing the words of Land of Hope And Glory or Rule Britannia! as they traditionally do at the end of The Last Night of The Proms,"" he told reporters last week. ""I think it's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general bout of self-recrimination and wetness."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""Confident forward-looking nations don't erase their history, they add to it."" On Wednesday, a Number 10 spokesman said the prime minister ""welcomes the decision"" to backtrack. Speaking to Conservative MPs, Mr Johnson said: ""I do think this country is going through an orgy of national embarrassment about some of the things that other people around the world love most about us. ""People love our traditions and our history with all its imperfections. It's crazy for us to go around trying to censor it.

See you next week! Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent With grumblings on the Tory benches about the governmentâs
recent performance Boris Johnson needed a good PMQs to mark the return to
parliament. His political opponents â perhaps unsurprisingly â criticised the
number of policy U-turns in recent months. While ministers have repeatedly said
theyâre responding to changing science as the pandemic progresses, the speed
and frequency of policy shifts is the crux of concern among some Conservative
backbenchers. Keir Starmer returned to what some supporters have called a
âforensicâ style of questioning in pushing the prime minister for detail on the
exam results crisis. Boris Johnson responded with a wide-ranging attack on the
Labour leader which led to a tetchy exchange. But with another shift in
policy â this time on local lockdowns in Trafford and Bolton â taking place as
the prime minister was at the dispatch box, it seems unlikely his performance
was enough to silence critics - including those within his own party. Reality Check Prime Minister
Boris Johnson said that the UK âhas now conducted more tests than any other
country in Europeâ. This isnât
entirely straightforward to judge, because each country may record figures
slightly differently or, in some cases, release statistics less regularly. What is clear is
that, compared to many European countries, the UK has recorded a high number of
tests. As of September
1, the UK has processed 16.3m tests. This compares with 11m tests in Germany. Another way to
look at this is how many tests have been conducted relative to the size of the
population. It would be unfair, for example, to expect a small country like
Iceland to conduct 16m tests in a population a fraction of the size of the
UKâs. On per capita
tests, Our World In Data â a University of Oxford backed project â suggests
that, using the best data available, the UK is high compared to other European
countries with almost 198 tests carried out for every 1,000 people. Germany has
carried out 134 per 1,000 people, Spain has done 137 and Italy has done 87
tests. However, some
countries have done more per capita, including:  Reality Check Prime
Minister Boris Johnson challenged the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to say
that it was safe for children to return to school. When
he did, Mr Johnson said âThatâs
the first time in four months heâs said itâ. On 23 June, Sir
Keir said in the Commons: ""On schools,
I do think that it is safe for some children to return. I completely support
that; the question is how quickly we can get all children back to school
safely, the sooner the better.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As PMQs ends, Sir Lindsay Hoyle says he had granted a point of order from the SNP's Ian Blackford. Mr Blackford raises a story in the Daily Mail last month showing a photograph of the Scottish holiday home where the PM had been staying. Mr Blackford says the government created a ""smear"", by saying he had been involved in releasing the information about where Mr Johnson was. This, Mr Blackford adds, has led to threats against himself. He decries ""false briefings"" and says he has not received a reply to a letter he sent to the government. The PM says he had a ""wonderful staycation"" in Wester Ross. He adds that he accepts Mr Blackford's ""assurances and protestations"" that he had no involvement in revealing the location of his holiday. Tory MP Lee Anderson says the asylum system in the UK is ""broken and being abused"", with people smuggling ""poor souls"" over on boats. He calls on the PM to ""fix the asylum system"" and ""save lives"" by ""taking back control"" post-Brexit. Mr Johnson says he has a ""great deal of sympathy with those so desperate to put children in dinghys"" to get them to the UK. But he says they are ""falling prey to criminal gangs, breaking the law and undermining legitimate claims"" to asylum. The PM says the UK will ""take advantage of leaving the EU"" by changing the rules and addressing the ""rigidities in our laws"" that make the UK a ""magnet for those who would exploit vulnerable people"". And with that, the first PMQs back comes to an end. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tory MP Andrew Lewer uses his question to take ask about the BBC license fee. He says: ""When I buy a Daily Mirror, Mail or Telegraph, I am not forced to buy a Guardian. ""But when I buy Netflix or Amazon Prime, I am forced to pay for the BBC."" Lewer asks the PM if this model is ""sustainable"". The PM says he is sure the MP's view is ""shared by many people in this country"". But while not commenting directly, he reveals ""a roadmap for reform of the BBC"" will be coming soon and ""addressing the issue he mentions"". Asking his question by video link, SNP MP Neil Gray urges the PM to rule out a public sector pay freeze, saying it would be a ""betrayal"" of key workers fighting coronavirus. Mr Johnson says there's been an ""inflation-busting"" rise recently and that Mr Gray should acknowledge this. Tory MP James Davies brings a bit of reality TV to the Commons... He says: ""One positive among the gloom is this year's 'I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here' will not be filmed in New South Wales, Australia, but in our own North Wales."" He says he may not be able to tempt the PM to ""take part in a Welsh-tucker trial"", but asked him to praise the relocation. Johnson says he is ""right to draw attention to the attractions of North Wales"". The SNP's Owen Thompson asks what he should tell companies in the creative industries facing collapse when furlough ends. The PM denies an accusation that the government has ""given up"" on them. Conservative Damian Green urges the prime minister to encourage the rail industry to bring in flexible rail ticketing, to help commuters get to work and ""help save the rail industry"". Mr Johnson says the government is working ""at pace"" to get things moving. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The
government have repeatedly said position shifts are inevitable in a global
pandemic when the science changes â but both Labour and the SNP are pushing
hard on the number of U-turns. They know itâs highly uncomfortable for the PM
given some of his own backbenchers are concerned. Next to question the prime minister is the SNP's leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford. He quotes Johnson on u-turns, saying the PM had admitted his government was ""all at sea"". But Blackford calls on him to make another u-turn and extend to furlough scheme for workers Johnson says the scheme cost Â£40bn and supported 11 miliion people, but claimed it kept them ""in suspended animation"". He adds: ""What we want to do is get people back to work"". On his second question, Mr Blackford points to places like France and Germany where similar schemes have been extended, saying their governments ""made a moral choice [as they were] not prepared to punish their people"". But Johnson says it was time to get people back into work. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Keir Starmerâs line of attack on government competence on
U-turns echoes the concern of some Tory backbenchers in recent days â lots will
be looking to the PMâs performance today and throughout the week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lockdown easing U-turn after rise in cases,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""swift and decisive action"" had been needed Parts of Greater Manchester will not have lockdown restrictions eased as planned following a government U-turn. Measures in Bolton and Trafford were due to be eased overnight after a fall in cases earlier in August. But they will ""now remain under existing restrictions"" following ""a significant change in the level of infection rates over the last few days"", the government announced. The region's mayor Andy Burnham said the U-turn had been ""complete chaos"". The boroughs had been due to allow people from different households to meet indoors and businesses to offer close contact services such as facials, but that has now been halted.

By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit The rise in cases in Trafford and Bolton shows how quickly the situation with coronavirus can change. On Friday the government announced it was easing the localised lockdown restrictions in parts of Greater Manchester from Wednesday - a decision it has now reversed in those two areas. Pointing to data for the week to 20 August, it said ""cases in Bolton and Stockport fell from 25.6 (per 100,000 residents) to 18.9, and 23 to 15.1 respectively, and Trafford fell from 27.1 to 17.8."" Yet even then, there was concern that the rate was rising. The Labour leader of Trafford Council, Andrew Western, said the more recent data had shown a ""slight increase"". By Tuesday, the spike in Bolton had also become apparent and council leaders in both areas were calling for the easing of restrictions to not go ahead. According to data released on Tuesday evening, Trafford's rate for the week to 29 August was more than 35 cases per 100,000.

Lockdown easing U-turn after rise in casesPlans to eases restrictions in Bolton and Trafford are scrapped after a spike in Covid-19 cases.ManchesterComments,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""swift and decisive action"" had been needed Parts of Greater Manchester will not have lockdown restrictions eased as planned following a government U-turn.

"House prices at all-time high, says Nationwide","House prices continued their post-lockdown recovery in August, notching up their highest monthly rise in more than 16 years, says the Nationwide. ""House prices have now reversed the losses recorded in May and June and are at a new all-time high,"" said its chief economist, Robert Gardner. Prices rose by 2% last month, it said, taking the average price to Â£224,123. However, forecasters expect a drop in prices again when the economic impact of the virus is felt on jobs. This is likely to coincide with the easing of pent-up demand from lockdown, which is part of the reason for the latest rise in prices. The Nationwide said the recovery in housing market activity had been ""unexpectedly rapid"". It said the increase in August was the highest since February 2004, when house prices rose by 2.7%. As a result, annual house price growth accelerated to 3.7%, from 1.5% in July. Rival mortgage lender, the Halifax, had already suggested a similar rise in prices over the summer. The recent increase in prices has been the result of a range of factors, including demand carried over from lockdown or brought forward owing tothe temporary suspension of stamp duty for some homes in England and Northern Ireland. In addition, the number of sales is still comparatively low, making prices more volatile. First-time buyers will not welcome any rise in prices, and many will struggle with securing a mortgage as lenders tighten their criteria for offering a loan. Anyone unable to offer a relatively large deposit and whose job is a risk amid the economic effects of the virus is likely to find it harder to get a home loan than before the outbreak. When does the stamp duty holiday end? Pent-up demand 'leading to quicker home sales' 'Living in a glass box was soul-destroying' First-time buyers: Four ways the property market 'will be tougher' ""This rebound reflects a number of factors. Pent-up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing,"" said Mr Gardner. He added that ""behavioural shifts"" could be boosting activity, with people reassessing their housing needs after life in lockdown. ""These trends look set to continue in the near term, further boosted by the recently announced stamp duty holiday, which will serve to bring some activity forward. ""However, most forecasters expect labour market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the after-effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. ""If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead."" The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has predicted house price falls, particularly next year. The Resolution Foundation think tank has warned that these predicted price falls could lead to some existing owners becoming trapped by negative equity - when the property is worth less than the mortgage secured on it. Market commentators said the short-term boom in the market had been surprising, but many do not expect it to last. Lucy Pendleton, director of estate agents James Pendleton, said: ""Buyers emboldened by the stamp duty holiday have been engaged in a pitched battle for property, delivering a barnstorming recovery for the market. ""A stunning proportion of properties are now going for asking price or more, and offers are flooding in. It's like lockdown was a bad dream."" But Andrew Montlake, managing director of mortgage broker Coreco, said: ""Two words: reality check. As strong as the property market is right now, it will not last. ""Demand is understandably strong after lockdown and the added bonus of the stamp duty holiday, but unemployment is rising by the day and the economic outlook is highly uncertain as the furlough scheme ends. ""In the final months of the year we will start to see a reversal in the current rate of house price growth."" The figures were published as the UK's biggest housebuilder, Barratt, said its pre-tax profit fell 46% to Â£491.8m in the year to the end of June. It completed 5,252 fewer homes than the previous year, a drop of 29%, as building sites were forced to close for weeks during the pandemic. However, it said forward sales were more positive.

Pompidou and Dome architect Richard Rogers retires,"Richard Rogers with a model of the Lloyds building in 1995 Richard Rogers, one of the world's most successful and influential architects, has stepped down from his firm after more than 40 years. Lord Rogers, 87, designed landmark buildings including the Pompidou Centre in Paris, the Millennium Dome in London and the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff. He is one of a handful of architects credited with shaping modern cities. He has retired from Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, which he founded as the Richard Rogers Partnership in 1977. The Pompidou Centre and other buildings were controversial when they opened Inside the Lloyds building in London, which opened in 1986 He has won most of architecture's major honours, including the prestigious Pritzker Prize in 2007 and the Stirling Prize twice. He was knighted in 1991. He came to prominence in the 1970s and 80s with two buildings that were controversial at the time for putting amenities like lifts and air conditioning ducts on the outside - the Pompidou, which he designed with Renzo Piano, and the Lloyds building in London. His critics have included Prince Charles, who has spoken about his dislike of Lord Rogers' designs on several occasions. But that did not prevent the architect from going to strength to strength around the world. His other creations included the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff, Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport and Terminal 4 of Madrid's Barajas Airport. The Welsh Assembly building opened in 2006 The Millennium Dome is now the O2 Arena The piazza as a public meeting place is often central to his ideas. ""The concept that cities contain places where people can exchange ideas and meet others - that's the most exciting thing,"" he told the BBC World Service in 2013. More recently, he built 3 World Trade Center in New York, an 80-storey skyscraper on the site of the former Twin Towers. But he has said his favourite project was one of his first, and the most personal -the modernist house he designed for his parents in Wimbledon,externalin the late 1960s. Lord Rogers was behind the design for Heathrow Terminal 5 He also advised on urban planning in cities including London and Barcelona. He chaired the influential Urban Task Force on the state of the UK's cities from 1998-2001. His company will now be led by partners Ivan Harbour and Graham Stirk, and under its constitution will drop Rogers' name within the next two years,according to Building Design,external.

"Rolls-Royce launches Â£250,000 car as demand rebounds","Torsten MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s said business was back to ""far more normal"" levels The boss of carmaker Rolls-Royce has said global demand for luxury vehicles is rebounding despite the pandemic. Boss Torsten MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s told the BBC that markets in Asia, Europe and the US were now ""more or less back to normal"". Mr MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s was speaking at the launch of the new Rolls-Royce Ghost, the company's latest model, which is expected to retail at around Â£250,000. He said sales for the first half of 2020 were down 30%, but now ""times are starting to become better and better"". Mr MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s described the launch of the new Rolls-Royce Ghost, a complete redesign of the most successful car in the firm's history, as a ""seminal moment"". At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Rolls-Royce shut down production for a couple of weeks, while dealerships around the world followed suit. The slump in sales came after a bumper year in 2019, which Mr MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s described as ""the best-ever year in the 116-year history of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars"". ""But of course, then Covid happened,"" he added. New car registrations see first rise this year Hundreds of job losses at Mini car plant Since then, the firm had seen an ""upward trend"", he said. ""Business is coming back to what I would call far more normal."" The Rolls-Royce boss rejected suggestions that the carmaker was overly dependent on one region for its sales, saying it was ""well balanced worldwide"". Although the US was its biggest market and China was important, there was also strong demand in countries such as the UK, which accounted for 10% of its sales, he said.

"PM 'heartless' for not meeting bereaved familiesBoris Johnson declines to meet campaigners, after saying he would meet anyone bereaved by Covid-19.UK","This video can not be played Covid families: The PM will not look us in the eye Campaigners representing families whose loved ones have died from coronavirus have accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of being ""heartless"" in declining to meet them. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice said it wrote to Mr Johnson five times to request a meeting. Asked by reporters about the letters, the PM said he would ""of course"" meet anyone bereaved by Covid-19. But days later he wrote to the group to say he was ""unable"" to meet them. The group, which says it represents 1,600 families, said it was ""devastated"" to receive the letter,which it has made public,external. Start Covid-19 inquiry now, say bereaved families PM promises an independent coronavirus inquiry Bereaved Covid families ask for meeting with PM Jo Goodman, co-founder of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: ""The prime minister has done a 360 - dodging five letters, then agreeing on live TV to meet with us, and now quietly telling us he's too busy. It's heartless. ""Of course we know the prime minister can't meet every bereaved person, but we really feel he should be meeting one of the largest groups of bereaved families in the country."" Ms Goodman, who lost her father Stuart to the virus, added: ""It feels like we're the wrong type of bereaved people - like the prime minister only wants to meet with people who will smile and not ask difficult questions."" Labour said refusing to meet the group was ""a new low"" for Mr Johnson. A Downing Street spokesperson said the PM remained committed to meeting people who have been bereaved as a result of Covid-19, and that he was ""resolute in his determination to beat this virus"" to prevent further ""dreadful loss"". This video can not be played Bereaved relatives call for inquiry: ""It wasn't good enough for our loved ones"" Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice is calling for an independent, judge-led, statutory public inquiry into coronavirus deaths, which it wants to begin imminently. Unlike other inquiries, a statutory public inquiry has the power to subpoena people and take evidence under oath. In a TV interview on 26 August, Mr Johnson was asked about the group's claim to have written to him five times to request a meeting. Mr Johnson said he was not aware of the letters but that he would meet with ""anybody"" who has lost a loved one to the virus. ""I will write back to every letter we get and of course I will meet anybodyâ¦ the bereaved who've suffered from Covid. Of course I'll do that,"" he said. This video can not be played The PM said last week he would ""meet anybody"" bereaved due to Covid-19 In a letter from 29 August, published by the group, the prime minister offered his ""sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones"". But he added: ""As much as I would wish to be able to offer my condolences in person to all those who have suffered loss, that is regrettably not possible and so I am unable to meet with you and members of Bereaved Families for Justice."" Mr Johnson went on to say there would be an ""independent inquiry at the appropriate time"", and that as the campaign group has instructed solicitors, any further correspondence relating to an inquiry ""should pass through the respective legal teams."" In Julythe prime minister committed to an independent inquiryinto the pandemic, but has repeatedly said now was not the right time. Labour's shadow cabinet minister, Rachel Reeves, condemned the PM for not meeting the family, saying: ""For him to privately go back on his public word and refuse [is] astounding, and upsetting for so many whose families and lives have been impacted by Covid in this way. ""41,504 people have tragically lost their lives to this virus. The very least the prime minister could do is respond truthfully to their families, and have the heart to meet some of them and their representatives."" Independent inquiries can take many forms - from full public inquiries that can take years, or in some cases decades, and cost millions of pounds; to smaller scale, more fleet-footed investigations. The idea is to hold the powerful to account and try to learn lessons from decisions that have gone wrong, and how to avoid repeating scandals and tragic events in the future. Recent examples of judge-led inquiries include the Leveson inquiry into media standards, or the ongoing inquiry into the Grenfell Tower catastrophe. Other inquiries, such as 2009 Iraq inquiry, headed by a retired senior civil servant Sir John Chilcot, do not take evidence under oath. The government of the day is normally expected to adopt many, if not all, of the recommendations of an official inquiry, although it does not always work out like that in practice.

PM 'heartless' for not meeting bereaved families,"This video can not be played Covid families: The PM will not look us in the eye Campaigners representing families whose loved ones have died from coronavirus have accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of being ""heartless"" in declining to meet them. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice said it wrote to Mr Johnson five times to request a meeting. Asked by reporters about the letters, the PM said he would ""of course"" meet anyone bereaved by Covid-19. But days later he wrote to the group to say he was ""unable"" to meet them. The group, which says it represents 1,600 families, said it was ""devastated"" to receive the letter,which it has made public,external. Start Covid-19 inquiry now, say bereaved families PM promises an independent coronavirus inquiry Bereaved Covid families ask for meeting with PM Jo Goodman, co-founder of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: ""The prime minister has done a 360 - dodging five letters, then agreeing on live TV to meet with us, and now quietly telling us he's too busy. It's heartless. ""Of course we know the prime minister can't meet every bereaved person, but we really feel he should be meeting one of the largest groups of bereaved families in the country."" Ms Goodman, who lost her father Stuart to the virus, added: ""It feels like we're the wrong type of bereaved people - like the prime minister only wants to meet with people who will smile and not ask difficult questions."" Labour said refusing to meet the group was ""a new low"" for Mr Johnson. A Downing Street spokesperson said the PM remained committed to meeting people who have been bereaved as a result of Covid-19, and that he was ""resolute in his determination to beat this virus"" to prevent further ""dreadful loss"". This video can not be played Bereaved relatives call for inquiry: ""It wasn't good enough for our loved ones"" Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice is calling for an independent, judge-led, statutory public inquiry into coronavirus deaths, which it wants to begin imminently. Unlike other inquiries, a statutory public inquiry has the power to subpoena people and take evidence under oath. In a TV interview on 26 August, Mr Johnson was asked about the group's claim to have written to him five times to request a meeting. Mr Johnson said he was not aware of the letters but that he would meet with ""anybody"" who has lost a loved one to the virus. ""I will write back to every letter we get and of course I will meet anybodyâ¦ the bereaved who've suffered from Covid. Of course I'll do that,"" he said. This video can not be played The PM said last week he would ""meet anybody"" bereaved due to Covid-19 In a letter from 29 August, published by the group, the prime minister offered his ""sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones"". But he added: ""As much as I would wish to be able to offer my condolences in person to all those who have suffered loss, that is regrettably not possible and so I am unable to meet with you and members of Bereaved Families for Justice."" Mr Johnson went on to say there would be an ""independent inquiry at the appropriate time"", and that as the campaign group has instructed solicitors, any further correspondence relating to an inquiry ""should pass through the respective legal teams."" In Julythe prime minister committed to an independent inquiryinto the pandemic, but has repeatedly said now was not the right time. Labour's shadow cabinet minister, Rachel Reeves, condemned the PM for not meeting the family, saying: ""For him to privately go back on his public word and refuse [is] astounding, and upsetting for so many whose families and lives have been impacted by Covid in this way. ""41,504 people have tragically lost their lives to this virus. The very least the prime minister could do is respond truthfully to their families, and have the heart to meet some of them and their representatives."" Independent inquiries can take many forms - from full public inquiries that can take years, or in some cases decades, and cost millions of pounds; to smaller scale, more fleet-footed investigations. The idea is to hold the powerful to account and try to learn lessons from decisions that have gone wrong, and how to avoid repeating scandals and tragic events in the future. Recent examples of judge-led inquiries include the Leveson inquiry into media standards, or the ongoing inquiry into the Grenfell Tower catastrophe. Other inquiries, such as 2009 Iraq inquiry, headed by a retired senior civil servant Sir John Chilcot, do not take evidence under oath. The government of the day is normally expected to adopt many, if not all, of the recommendations of an official inquiry, although it does not always work out like that in practice.

MSPs call for Scottish Labour leader to quit,"Richard Leonard's leadership has been criticised by some sections of the party since he took over from Kezia Dugdale three years ago Four Scottish Labour MSPs have called on the party's leader, Richard Leonard, to quit ahead of next year's Scottish Parliament election. James Kelly resigned as the party's justice spokesman, saying he had no confidence in Mr Leonard's leadership. Social security spokesman Mark Griffinhas also quit,external, with backbenchers Jenny Marra and Daniel Johnson adding their voices to calls for Mr Leonard to go. Mr Leonard has vowed to lead the party into the election. He accused the MSPs of waging an ""internal war"" against him, and said he would be fighting the election on a platform of ""building a National Care Service, establishing a quality Jobs Guarantee scheme and reviving Scotland's economy with a Green New Deal"". Mr Leonard added: ""If any party representative thinks an internal faction fight is more important than this agenda, then they will have to answer to party members and the voters whom we serve"". He took over the leadership from Kezia Dugdale in 2017 - but there have been concerns about his performance from some senior party figures ever since. Opinion polls suggest Scottish Labour is trailing a distant third behind the SNP and Scottish Conservatives ahead of the election next May. The partyslumped to fifthin last year's European elections after winning just 9.3% of the votes - down from 26% in the previous election in 2014. Jenny Marra said Mr Leonard's leadership had been tied to that of Mr Corbyn, and it was now time for him to go In hisresignation statement,external, Mr Kelly said that Mr Leonard's personal polling ratings were particularly low - even among the party's own supporters. He added: ""Such poor ratings would produce a catastrophic result from which the party would struggle to recover. ""I have no confidence in your ability to shape the party's message, strategy and organisation. I know that this is a view shared by other parliamentarians, party members and indeed many members of the public. ""It is clear that after nearly three years in charge you are not able to take the party forward. I firmly and sincerely believe that it is in the best interests of the party that you stand down as leader."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His views were echoed by Ms Marra, who toldThe Times,externalthat the party risked ""catastrophe"" if it did not change course. She described Mr Leonard, who was seen as being a close ally of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, as being ""utterly committed to the party, the cause and is liked by everyone"". But she added: ""Richard is a stalwart of our party but he cannot lead us. That's the unavoidable truth and change is our best hope. ""Richard's leadership was tied from the start to the disaster of Jeremy Corbyn's project. It remains so in the public's view and they simply will not give the party a hearing as things stand. ""We need new energy, a new approach and to turn a new page."" James Kelly has resigned as the party's justice spokesman over Mr Leonard's leadership A third MSP, Daniel Johnson, tweeted his support for Ms Marra and Mr Kelly - saying: ""It is time to recognise the situation we are in and for Richard to step down."" Mr Johnson said he had attempted to raise his concerns and make constructive suggestions but claimed that these had gone unheeded, and there had been no change in approach or performance. He added: ""Continuing like this will be disastrous for our party and is why I no longer have confidence in Richard Leonard's leadership."" Meanwhile, Mr Griffin said polls suggested that fewer than half of the voting public knows who Mr Leonard is - and that most of those who do, including a majority of Scottish Labour voters, have a negative opinion of him. He added: ""We cannot hope to improve when any criticism, public or private, is dismissed as factional"". However, Mr Leonard was backed by Scottish Labour MSP Neil Findlay, who is also on the left of the party. Mr Findlay tweeted that the colleagues who were calling for Mr Leonard's head were ""pathetic"" and guilty of ""treachery with a snarl"". This is an attempt to topple the Scottish Labour leader - and it may not be over yet. Before he quit as the party's justice spokesman, James Kelly privately approached Richard Leonard to ask him to stand down. I am told he did so on behalf of a sizeable group of Labour MSPs, certainly more than the four who have now spoken out publicly. What's less clear is if any of them would be prepared to challenge him to a formal leadership contest. Mr Leonard has told the BBC he intends to lead the party into the 2021 Holyrood election and has questioned the suitability of his critics to stand in that contest. The party has yet to make its list selections and it's understood Mr Leonard favours a gender balanced system that may squeeze out some existing MSPs. Mr Kelly insists his concern is not for himself but for the future of the Scottish Labour party, which has lost ground in elections and opinion polls while Richard Leonard has been in charge.

Lifting lockdown 'illogical' as virus cases rise,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""swift and decisive action"" had been needed Parts of Greater Manchester will not have lockdown restrictions eased as planned following a government U-turn. Measures in Bolton and Trafford were due to be eased overnight after a fall in cases earlier in August. But they will ""now remain under existing restrictions"" following ""a significant change in the level of infection rates over the last few days"", the government announced. The region's mayor Andy Burnham said the U-turn had been ""complete chaos"". The boroughs had been due to allow people from different households to meet indoors and businesses to offer close contact services such as facials, but that has now been halted. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision was made ""in collaboration with local leaders after reviewing the latest data"" which showed infection rates had more than trebled in Bolton in under a week and doubled in Trafford since the last review. ""We have always been clear we will take swift and decisive action where needed to contain outbreaks,"" he added. A spokesman for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the U-turn as ""utterly chaotic"" and it gave people ""no confidence in the government's approach"". What are the new local lockdown rules? Greater Manchester Mayor Mr Burnham compared the government's weekly announcements on local coronavirus restrictions as ""like waiting for the white smoke out of the Vatican"". ""It's not working, it's confusing people, it's causing anger and resentment,"" he added. ""In my view, it's local councils that need to be in the driving seat here, working then in consultation with the government."" Trafford's Labour council leader Andrew Western tweeted: ""We should never have been put in this mess in the first place; this has massively damaged public confidence in measures.""

Bolton Council leader David Greenhalgh said it would have been ""irresponsible not to recognise the unpredicted spike we have seen in Bolton"". He said he recognised ""many people will be extremely frustrated and annoyed by this decision"" but the borough had recorded the second highest increase in positive cases in the country. A Covid-19 spike in Bolton and Trafford promptedcouncil bosses to ask for restrictions to remain in placea day before they were due to be lifted. Bolton currently has one of the highest rates of new virus cases per 100,000 residents in England. Chris Green, Conservative MP for Bolton West, had argued that restrictions should be eased in his constituency. But, following the U-turn, he said the government had based its decision on recent data which he hadn't seen. He has since tweeted to say he was""disappointed at how this important decision has been communicated,externalbecause of the impact this will have on people's lives"". Lockdown restrictions were eased on Wednesday in Stockport,Burnley, Hyndburn,parts of Bradford, excluding Bradford city and Keighley town, parts of Calderdale, excluding Halifax, and parts of Kirklees, excluding Dewsbury and Batley. According to government rules,external, people living in these areas can now: Socialise in groups of up to two households indoors or in private gardens Stay overnight at somebody else's home but must try to social distance Book close contact services such as facials and brow or eyelash treatments Visit bowling alleys, roller rinks, soft play centres and casinos Measureswere imposedat the end of July amid a rise in cases. Stockport has joined Wigan in being allowed to have two households socialise indoors. But in Bolton, Trafford, Manchester, Salford, Rochdale, Bury and Tameside it is still banned. In Oldham people are advised not to meet up with other households outdoors as well. By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit The rise in cases in Trafford and Bolton shows how quickly the situation with coronavirus can change. On Friday the government announced it was easing the localised lockdown restrictions in parts of Greater Manchester from Wednesday - a decision it has now reversed in those two areas. Pointing to data for the week to 20 August, it said ""cases in Bolton and Stockport fell from 25.6 (per 100,000 residents) to 18.9, and 23 to 15.1 respectively, and Trafford fell from 27.1 to 17.8."" Yet even then, there was concern that the rate was rising. The Labour leader of Trafford Council, Andrew Western, said the more recent data had shown a ""slight increase"". By Tuesday, the spike in Bolton had also become apparent and council leaders in both areas were calling for the easing of restrictions to not go ahead. According to data released on Tuesday evening, Trafford's rate for the week to 29 August was more than 35 cases per 100,000. In Bolton it was 59 cases per 100,000, driven in particular by high numbers of cases on 27, 28 and 29 August. Catalina Sastra, who runs the Party and Play, funhouse in Bolton was planning to re-open next week but said the changes were confusing. ""We're teetering on the edge... we are due to open with an online booking system, temperature reading, we've had all the screens put up... but it's just if it's on or if it's off"", she said. ""It's a bit like playing hokey-cokey. Are we in or are we out?"" Bolton has had its highest seven-day rate since late May A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""We are working closely with leaders and local authorities across Greater Manchester and Lancashire in response to the changing situation and we keep all local restrictions under constant consideration.""

Fourteen face trial over Paris magazine massacre,"Two gunmen killed 12 people in an attack on the magazine's office in 2015 Fourteen people are on trial in France over the deadly attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015. Most of the alleged accomplices are in court in Paris, but three are being tried in absentia. They are accused of helping the militant Islamist attackers who shot dead 12 people in and around Charlie Hebdo's Paris office in January 2015. In a related attack, a third gunman shot dead a policewoman, then attacked a Jewish store, killing four people. The 17 victims were killed over a period of three days. All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead. France marks five years since Paris massacre Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror How Europe deals with freed terror offenders Paris attacks: 'I am not Charlie' In the days following the January 2015 attacks, millions of people took part in solidarity marches across France and around the world under the slogan ""Je suis Charlie"" (I am Charlie). The magazine has marked the start of the trial by reprinting controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked protests in several Muslim countries. President Emmanuel Macron has since defended the freedom of the press and the French ""freedom to blaspheme, which is linked to freedom of conscience"". Eleven of the defendants were present in the courtroom on Wednesday. They gave their names and occupations, and all confirmed they intended to answer questions from the court. Survivors and relatives of the victims were also in court. Gala Renaud, the wife of one of the journalists killed, told reporters that you could ""already feel the tension"". ""I wanted to see the defendants in the box to see what they look like,"" she said, adding that she wanted to know ""what their motivations were, why this complicity and of course why innocent people were killed"". The trial is taking place amid tight security The trial has been delayed by almost four months because of the coronavirus pandemic. In March, the presiding judge said France's lockdown measures had made it impossible to bring together ""all the parties, witnesses and experts under the necessary sanitary conditions"". The alleged accomplices are accused of obtaining weapons and providing logistical support for the attack on Charlie Hebdo's office on 7 January 2015, as well as the subsequent attacks on a police officer and the Hyper Cacher supermarket. Three of the suspects are believed to have disappeared in northern Syria and Iraq and will be tried in absentia. Some reports suggest at least two of them were killed in bombing campaigns against the Islamic State group (IS). All three remain the subject of international arrest warrants. There are about 200 plaintiffs in the trial and survivors of the attacks are expected to testify. Millions of people joined solidarity rallies following the attacks in January 2015 On Monday, anti-terror prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard dismissed the suggestion that it was just ""little helpers"" who were facing justice. ""It is about individuals who are involved in the logistics, the preparation of the events, who provided means of financing, operational material, weapons [and] a residence,"" he told France Info radio. ""All this is essential to the terrorist action."" Among those present in court is Lassana Bathily, a Malian-born Muslim employee of the Jewish supermarketwho hid customers from the attackand was later granted French citizenship. The trial is expected to last until November. Eleven defendants are in the courtroom at the start of this 49-day trial, sitting under heavy guard in two glassed cubicles. All are in masks, so it is hard to read their emotions. For family members of the 17 victims, these are emotional moments. More than five years have passed, but much remains to be explained about how the attacks were prepared. The full extent of any co-operation between the Charlie Hebdo attackers and the supermarket gunman, for example, is not at all apparent. Nor is it clear what co-ordination there was with leaders of the groups to whom they paid allegiance - al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Islamic State. Another aspect that will be highlighted is the link between Islamist terror and petty delinquency in the high-immigration suburbs. On 7 January that year, two French Muslim gunmen - brothers ChÃ©rif and SaÃ¯d Kouachi - stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo in the Rue Nicolas-Appert before opening fire on its staff. The magazine's editor at the time,StÃ©phane Charbonnier, better known as Charb,was among four celebrated cartoonists who were killed. This video can not be played Footage taken from a rooftop in Paris shows two gunmen firing shots The gunmen were eventually killed by security forces after a lengthy manhunt. Their victims were eight journalists, two police officers, a caretaker and a visitor. In a related attack just days later, jihadist gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed three customers and an employee in a hostage siege at the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket in Porte de Vincennes in the east of Paris. He had earlier shot dead a policewoman in the city. Security forces eventually stormed the supermarket before killing him and freeing the remaining hostages. They include 35-year-oldAli Reza Polat, who is seen as the main link between the two attacks and is believed to have had a key role in obtaining the weapons used. He subsequently attempted to flee to Dubai, Lebanon and Syria but without success. MickaÃ«l Pastor Alwatik'sDNA was found on two guns discovered at Coulibaly's home and a glove at the scene.Mohamed Fareshas told investigators he was a middleman involved in the sale of the assault rifle used in the supermarket attack, whileAmir Ramdani, Samir Makhlouf,Willy PrevostandChristophe Raumelare accused of having provided support. Hayat Boumedienne was reportedly seen in Syria last year Two people in Belgium - garage ownerMetin Karasularand his associateMichel Catino,an unemployed Italian in his 60s - and two more in north-eastern France - garage ownerMiguel Martinezand his associateAbdelaziz Abbad- are accused of supplying ""assault rifles, automatic pistols, rocket launchers, chargers and ammunition, bulletproof vests"" to the three gunmen. On trial in absentia isHayat Boumedienne, Coulibaly's partner. She fled France for Syria a week before the attack. Previously believed killed in a US air strike last year, French media reports now suggest she may still be alive. A female French jihadist questioned by security services as she tried to re-enter France told them that she had seen Hayat Boumedienne in the al-Hol camp for IS detainees last October and that Hayat Boumedienne had then escaped from the camp. Mohamed and Mehdi Belhoucineare accused of helping Hayat Boumedienne get to Syria. Both are believed to have been killed in Syria or Iraq. Mohamed Belhoucine also provided email addresses used by the other defendants. The radical weekly magazine was well known for taking swipes at the French establishment and religion and has long drawn controversy. Cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad brought Charb death threats as well as 24-hour police protection prior to his death. There was also a petrol bomb attack on the magazine's offices in 2011. The issue of depicting the Prophet Muhammad The publication has also been seen as a beacon for free speech, with many of its defenders using the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie to defend it. Editor StÃ©phane Charbonnier was among four celebrated cartoonists who were killed Charb strongly defended the Prophet Muhammad cartoons as symbolic of freedom of speech. ""I don't blame Muslims for not laughing at our drawings,"" he told the Associated Press in 2012. ""I live under French law. I don't live under Koranic law."" And on Tuesday,the magazine republished the cartoons that made them a target in 2015. ""We have always refused to do so, not because it is prohibited... but because there was a need for a good reason to do it,"" an editorial said. It added: ""To reproduce these cartoons in the week the trial begins over the January 2015 terrorist attacks seemed essential to us."" On Wednesday, Egypt's top Islamic authority, al-Azhar University, said publishing the ""offensive cartoons"" was a ""criminal act"". Their publication ""reinforces hate speech and will whip up the feelings of believers"", al-Azhar's Observatory for Combating Extremism said. The observatory also reiterated its ""strong condemnation"" of the Charlie Hebdo attack.

See you next week! Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent With grumblings on the Tory benches about the governmentâs
recent performance Boris Johnson needed a good PMQs to mark the return to
parliament. His political opponents â perhaps unsurprisingly â criticised the
number of policy U-turns in recent months. While ministers have repeatedly said
theyâre responding to changing science as the pandemic progresses, the speed
and frequency of policy shifts is the crux of concern among some Conservative
backbenchers. Keir Starmer returned to what some supporters have called a
âforensicâ style of questioning in pushing the prime minister for detail on the
exam results crisis. Boris Johnson responded with a wide-ranging attack on the
Labour leader which led to a tetchy exchange. But with another shift in
policy â this time on local lockdowns in Trafford and Bolton â taking place as
the prime minister was at the dispatch box, it seems unlikely his performance
was enough to silence critics - including those within his own party. Reality Check Prime Minister
Boris Johnson said that the UK âhas now conducted more tests than any other
country in Europeâ. This isnât
entirely straightforward to judge, because each country may record figures
slightly differently or, in some cases, release statistics less regularly. What is clear is
that, compared to many European countries, the UK has recorded a high number of
tests. As of September
1, the UK has processed 16.3m tests. This compares with 11m tests in Germany. Another way to
look at this is how many tests have been conducted relative to the size of the
population. It would be unfair, for example, to expect a small country like
Iceland to conduct 16m tests in a population a fraction of the size of the
UKâs. On per capita
tests, Our World In Data â a University of Oxford backed project â suggests
that, using the best data available, the UK is high compared to other European
countries with almost 198 tests carried out for every 1,000 people. Germany has
carried out 134 per 1,000 people, Spain has done 137 and Italy has done 87
tests. However, some
countries have done more per capita, including:  Reality Check Prime
Minister Boris Johnson challenged the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to say
that it was safe for children to return to school. When
he did, Mr Johnson said âThatâs
the first time in four months heâs said itâ. On 23 June, Sir
Keir said in the Commons: ""On schools,
I do think that it is safe for some children to return. I completely support
that; the question is how quickly we can get all children back to school
safely, the sooner the better.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As PMQs ends, Sir Lindsay Hoyle says he had granted a point of order from the SNP's Ian Blackford. Mr Blackford raises a story in the Daily Mail last month showing a photograph of the Scottish holiday home where the PM had been staying. Mr Blackford says the government created a ""smear"", by saying he had been involved in releasing the information about where Mr Johnson was. This, Mr Blackford adds, has led to threats against himself. He decries ""false briefings"" and says he has not received a reply to a letter he sent to the government. The PM says he had a ""wonderful staycation"" in Wester Ross. He adds that he accepts Mr Blackford's ""assurances and protestations"" that he had no involvement in revealing the location of his holiday. Tory MP Lee Anderson says the asylum system in the UK is ""broken and being abused"", with people smuggling ""poor souls"" over on boats. He calls on the PM to ""fix the asylum system"" and ""save lives"" by ""taking back control"" post-Brexit. Mr Johnson says he has a ""great deal of sympathy with those so desperate to put children in dinghys"" to get them to the UK. But he says they are ""falling prey to criminal gangs, breaking the law and undermining legitimate claims"" to asylum. The PM says the UK will ""take advantage of leaving the EU"" by changing the rules and addressing the ""rigidities in our laws"" that make the UK a ""magnet for those who would exploit vulnerable people"". And with that, the first PMQs back comes to an end. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tory MP Andrew Lewer uses his question to take ask about the BBC license fee. He says: ""When I buy a Daily Mirror, Mail or Telegraph, I am not forced to buy a Guardian. ""But when I buy Netflix or Amazon Prime, I am forced to pay for the BBC."" Lewer asks the PM if this model is ""sustainable"". The PM says he is sure the MP's view is ""shared by many people in this country"". But while not commenting directly, he reveals ""a roadmap for reform of the BBC"" will be coming soon and ""addressing the issue he mentions"". Asking his question by video link, SNP MP Neil Gray urges the PM to rule out a public sector pay freeze, saying it would be a ""betrayal"" of key workers fighting coronavirus. Mr Johnson says there's been an ""inflation-busting"" rise recently and that Mr Gray should acknowledge this. Tory MP James Davies brings a bit of reality TV to the Commons... He says: ""One positive among the gloom is this year's 'I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here' will not be filmed in New South Wales, Australia, but in our own North Wales."" He says he may not be able to tempt the PM to ""take part in a Welsh-tucker trial"", but asked him to praise the relocation. Johnson says he is ""right to draw attention to the attractions of North Wales"". The SNP's Owen Thompson asks what he should tell companies in the creative industries facing collapse when furlough ends. The PM denies an accusation that the government has ""given up"" on them. Conservative Damian Green urges the prime minister to encourage the rail industry to bring in flexible rail ticketing, to help commuters get to work and ""help save the rail industry"". Mr Johnson says the government is working ""at pace"" to get things moving. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The
government have repeatedly said position shifts are inevitable in a global
pandemic when the science changes â but both Labour and the SNP are pushing
hard on the number of U-turns. They know itâs highly uncomfortable for the PM
given some of his own backbenchers are concerned. Next to question the prime minister is the SNP's leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford. He quotes Johnson on u-turns, saying the PM had admitted his government was ""all at sea"". But Blackford calls on him to make another u-turn and extend to furlough scheme for workers Johnson says the scheme cost Â£40bn and supported 11 miliion people, but claimed it kept them ""in suspended animation"". He adds: ""What we want to do is get people back to work"". On his second question, Mr Blackford points to places like France and Germany where similar schemes have been extended, saying their governments ""made a moral choice [as they were] not prepared to punish their people"". But Johnson says it was time to get people back into work. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Keir Starmerâs line of attack on government competence on
U-turns echoes the concern of some Tory backbenchers in recent days â lots will
be looking to the PMâs performance today and throughout the week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"David Byrne apologises for 1984 blackface video""I have changed since then,"" says the Talking Heads star after a clip from the 1980s resurfaces.","""I have changed since then,"" said Byrne Talking Heads frontman David Byrne has apologised for a video in which he impersonates people of colour using black and brownface. The promotional video for 1984's concert film Stop Making Sense, sees the star interviewing himself, while playing several different reporters. After the clip resurfaced on social media, Byrne issued a statement expressing his regret and dismay. ""I acknowledge it was a major mistake in judgement,"" he wrote. Admitting that the sketch showed ""a real lack of understanding"", he added: ""It's like looking in a mirror and seeing someone else - you're not, or were not, the person you thought you were.""

Byrne joins a number of performers and comedians who have been forced to acknowledge blackface performances in recent months, as protests over the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and, more recently, the shooting of Jacob Blake, led to broader calls for accountability. Ant and Decsaid they were ""sincerely sorry""for impersonating people of colour on past episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway, and US chat show hostJimmy Kimmel apologisedfor his ""thoughtless"" portrayals of black stars like Snoop Dogg, Oprah Winfrey and basketball player Karl Malone. Comedian Tina Feywithdrew four episodes of her show 30 Rockwhich portrayed characters in blackface, adding in a letter that she was sorry ""for the pain they have caused"". Matt Lucas and David Walliams also issued a statement about the sketch show Little Britain, saying: ""we regret that we played characters of other races"". Byrne said his apology came after a journalist highlighted the existence of the Stop Making Sense sketch. ""We have huge blind spots about ourselves- well, I certainly do,"" he said.

Rolls-Royce sees demand for luxury cars rebound,"Torsten MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s said business was back to ""far more normal"" levels The boss of carmaker Rolls-Royce has said global demand for luxury vehicles is rebounding despite the pandemic. Boss Torsten MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s told the BBC that markets in Asia, Europe and the US were now ""more or less back to normal"". Mr MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s was speaking at the launch of the new Rolls-Royce Ghost, the company's latest model, which is expected to retail at around Â£250,000. He said sales for the first half of 2020 were down 30%, but now ""times are starting to become better and better"". Mr MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s described the launch of the new Rolls-Royce Ghost, a complete redesign of the most successful car in the firm's history, as a ""seminal moment"". At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Rolls-Royce shut down production for a couple of weeks, while dealerships around the world followed suit. The slump in sales came after a bumper year in 2019, which Mr MÃ¼ller-ÃtvÃ¶s described as ""the best-ever year in the 116-year history of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars"". ""But of course, then Covid happened,"" he added. New car registrations see first rise this year Hundreds of job losses at Mini car plant Since then, the firm had seen an ""upward trend"", he said. ""Business is coming back to what I would call far more normal."" The Rolls-Royce boss rejected suggestions that the carmaker was overly dependent on one region for its sales, saying it was ""well balanced worldwide"". Although the US was its biggest market and China was important, there was also strong demand in countries such as the UK, which accounted for 10% of its sales, he said.

""The Speaker complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment."" Mrs Pelosi has herself previously cited US Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommending that Americans wear face masks in public, especially when physical distancing measures are difficult. After Monday's appointment, the House speaker appeared on MSNBC with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. She told the network that Mr Trump had ""slapped science right in the face"" last week by allowing an audience of mainly mask-less invitees on the White House lawn to watch his speech to the Republican convention.

Tenet gives shot in arm to UK and Ireland cinemasChristopher Nolan's time-bending spy thriller takes Â£5.33 million in its first week on release.Entertainment & Arts,"John David Washington plays the unnamed 'Protagonist' in Nolan's film Sci-fi blockbuster Tenet has given a welcome shot in the arm to the UK and Ireland's cinemas, taking Â£5.33 million in its first week on release. Christopher Nolan's sci-fi spy thriller is the first major studio release since cinemas began reopening in July. Tenet opened in more than 600 UK and Irish cinemas last week having had its launch delayed several times. The Showcase cinema chain said its ticket sales increased by 75% ahead of the film's eagerly anticipated release. Tenet also performed well internationally, taking $53.6m (Â£40m) from sites in the Middle East, Europe and South Korea. The film, a time-bending action drama set in numerous countries, will open in the US, Russia and China later this week. Critics laud Nolan's 'mind-bending wonder' Tenet Tenet: The film hoping to get us back into cinemas Warner Bros chairman Toby Emmerich said the studio ""couldn't be more pleased"" by the film's ""fantastic start"". He said British film-maker Nolan had ""once again delivered an event-worthy motion picture that demands to be seen on the big screen"". Face masks are currently mandatory in UK and Irish cinemas, which are operating at a reduced capacity due to social distancing guidelines. Takings have been modest since they began reopening in July, with only one other title making more than Â£1m over that period. That film was theRussell Crowe road rage thriller Unhinged, whose takings now stand at Â£1.2m after five weeks on release. Unhinged sees Russell Crowe play a driver with anger management issues Tenet's closest official competitor over the weekend was Onward, which opened in cinemas before the coronavirus lockdown in March. The fantastical Pixar animation made Â£185,028 last weekend, bringing its overall takings since release to Â£6.65m. Technically, though, it was outperformed by The New Mutants, which had a weekend of previews ahead of its release on Friday. The X-Men spin-off made Â£222,000 from those preview screenings, according to figures postedby the Box Office Mojo website,external. Tenet's box office performance will be keenly scrutinised by rival studios as they prepare to unveil their own Covid-affected product. That includes James Bond film No Time to Die, which is due to open in November having had its earlier release date in April put back. A new trailer for the film, which will see Daniel Craig make his final appearance as secret agent 007, will be released on Thursday. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Fourteen face trial for Paris magazine massacre,"Two gunmen killed 12 people in an attack on the magazine's office in 2015 Fourteen people are on trial in France over the deadly attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015. Most of the alleged accomplices are in court in Paris, but three are being tried in absentia. They are accused of helping the militant Islamist attackers who shot dead 12 people in and around Charlie Hebdo's Paris office in January 2015. In a related attack, a third gunman shot dead a policewoman, then attacked a Jewish store, killing four people. The 17 victims were killed over a period of three days. All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead. France marks five years since Paris massacre Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror How Europe deals with freed terror offenders Paris attacks: 'I am not Charlie' In the days following the January 2015 attacks, millions of people took part in solidarity marches across France and around the world under the slogan ""Je suis Charlie"" (I am Charlie). The magazine has marked the start of the trial by reprinting controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked protests in several Muslim countries. President Emmanuel Macron has since defended the freedom of the press and the French ""freedom to blaspheme, which is linked to freedom of conscience"". Eleven of the defendants were present in the courtroom on Wednesday. They gave their names and occupations, and all confirmed they intended to answer questions from the court. Survivors and relatives of the victims were also in court. Gala Renaud, the wife of one of the journalists killed, told reporters that you could ""already feel the tension"". ""I wanted to see the defendants in the box to see what they look like,"" she said, adding that she wanted to know ""what their motivations were, why this complicity and of course why innocent people were killed"". The trial is taking place amid tight security The trial has been delayed by almost four months because of the coronavirus pandemic. In March, the presiding judge said France's lockdown measures had made it impossible to bring together ""all the parties, witnesses and experts under the necessary sanitary conditions"". The alleged accomplices are accused of obtaining weapons and providing logistical support for the attack on Charlie Hebdo's office on 7 January 2015, as well as the subsequent attacks on a police officer and the Hyper Cacher supermarket. Three of the suspects are believed to have disappeared in northern Syria and Iraq and will be tried in absentia. Some reports suggest at least two of them were killed in bombing campaigns against the Islamic State group (IS). All three remain the subject of international arrest warrants. There are about 200 plaintiffs in the trial and survivors of the attacks are expected to testify. Millions of people joined solidarity rallies following the attacks in January 2015 On Monday, anti-terror prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard dismissed the suggestion that it was just ""little helpers"" who were facing justice. ""It is about individuals who are involved in the logistics, the preparation of the events, who provided means of financing, operational material, weapons [and] a residence,"" he told France Info radio. ""All this is essential to the terrorist action."" Among those present in court is Lassana Bathily, a Malian-born Muslim employee of the Jewish supermarketwho hid customers from the attackand was later granted French citizenship. The trial is expected to last until November. Eleven defendants are in the courtroom at the start of this 49-day trial, sitting under heavy guard in two glassed cubicles. All are in masks, so it is hard to read their emotions. For family members of the 17 victims, these are emotional moments. More than five years have passed, but much remains to be explained about how the attacks were prepared. The full extent of any co-operation between the Charlie Hebdo attackers and the supermarket gunman, for example, is not at all apparent. Nor is it clear what co-ordination there was with leaders of the groups to whom they paid allegiance - al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Islamic State. Another aspect that will be highlighted is the link between Islamist terror and petty delinquency in the high-immigration suburbs. On 7 January that year, two French Muslim gunmen - brothers ChÃ©rif and SaÃ¯d Kouachi - stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo in the Rue Nicolas-Appert before opening fire on its staff. The magazine's editor at the time,StÃ©phane Charbonnier, better known as Charb,was among four celebrated cartoonists who were killed. This video can not be played Footage taken from a rooftop in Paris shows two gunmen firing shots The gunmen were eventually killed by security forces after a lengthy manhunt. Their victims were eight journalists, two police officers, a caretaker and a visitor. In a related attack just days later, jihadist gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed three customers and an employee in a hostage siege at the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket in Porte de Vincennes in the east of Paris. He had earlier shot dead a policewoman in the city. Security forces eventually stormed the supermarket before killing him and freeing the remaining hostages. They include 35-year-oldAli Reza Polat, who is seen as the main link between the two attacks and is believed to have had a key role in obtaining the weapons used. He subsequently attempted to flee to Dubai, Lebanon and Syria but without success. MickaÃ«l Pastor Alwatik'sDNA was found on two guns discovered at Coulibaly's home and a glove at the scene.Mohamed Fareshas told investigators he was a middleman involved in the sale of the assault rifle used in the supermarket attack, whileAmir Ramdani, Samir Makhlouf,Willy PrevostandChristophe Raumelare accused of having provided support. Hayat Boumedienne was reportedly seen in Syria last year Two people in Belgium - garage ownerMetin Karasularand his associateMichel Catino,an unemployed Italian in his 60s - and two more in north-eastern France - garage ownerMiguel Martinezand his associateAbdelaziz Abbad- are accused of supplying ""assault rifles, automatic pistols, rocket launchers, chargers and ammunition, bulletproof vests"" to the three gunmen. On trial in absentia isHayat Boumedienne, Coulibaly's partner. She fled France for Syria a week before the attack. Previously believed killed in a US air strike last year, French media reports now suggest she may still be alive. A female French jihadist questioned by security services as she tried to re-enter France told them that she had seen Hayat Boumedienne in the al-Hol camp for IS detainees last October and that Hayat Boumedienne had then escaped from the camp. Mohamed and Mehdi Belhoucineare accused of helping Hayat Boumedienne get to Syria. Both are believed to have been killed in Syria or Iraq. Mohamed Belhoucine also provided email addresses used by the other defendants. The radical weekly magazine was well known for taking swipes at the French establishment and religion and has long drawn controversy. Cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad brought Charb death threats as well as 24-hour police protection prior to his death. There was also a petrol bomb attack on the magazine's offices in 2011. The issue of depicting the Prophet Muhammad The publication has also been seen as a beacon for free speech, with many of its defenders using the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie to defend it. Editor StÃ©phane Charbonnier was among four celebrated cartoonists who were killed Charb strongly defended the Prophet Muhammad cartoons as symbolic of freedom of speech. ""I don't blame Muslims for not laughing at our drawings,"" he told the Associated Press in 2012. ""I live under French law. I don't live under Koranic law."" And on Tuesday,the magazine republished the cartoons that made them a target in 2015. ""We have always refused to do so, not because it is prohibited... but because there was a need for a good reason to do it,"" an editorial said. It added: ""To reproduce these cartoons in the week the trial begins over the January 2015 terrorist attacks seemed essential to us."" On Wednesday, Egypt's top Islamic authority, al-Azhar University, said publishing the ""offensive cartoons"" was a ""criminal act"". Their publication ""reinforces hate speech and will whip up the feelings of believers"", al-Azhar's Observatory for Combating Extremism said. The observatory also reiterated its ""strong condemnation"" of the Charlie Hebdo attack.

Will schools stay open in another outbreak?,"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

Trump visits Kenosha to back police after shooting,"This video can not be played Trump on police: 'They choke sometimes' US President Donald Trump has visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, to back law enforcement after the police shooting of a black man sparked civil strife. The Republican president blamed ""domestic terror"" for the ""destruction"" in the Midwestern city. Kenosha saw days of violence after police shot Jacob Blake in the back and left him paralysed on 23 August. Mr Trump has been lagging behind Joe Biden in opinion polls, although some polls have tightened in recent weeks. The president is pushing a campaign message of ""law and order"" - however, Mr Biden has accused Mr Trump of stoking racial division. ""Fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames rather than fighting the flames,"" the former US vice-president said ahead of Mr Trump's trip on Tuesday. A police officer shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back during an arrest as the 29-year-old tried to get into a car where his three children were seated. The president visited areas damaged in the protests, including a burnt-out furniture store and camera shop destroyed in the upheaval. ""These are not acts of peaceful protest, but really domestic terror,"" he later told local business leaders at a round table meeting in a high school gym. Mr Trump defended the actions of US police and accused the media of focusing only on ""bad"" incidents involving officers. ""You have people that choke,"" he said. ""They are under tremendous pressure. And they may be there for 15 years and have a spotless record and all of a sudden they're faced with a decision. They have a quarter of a second to make a decision. And if they make a wrong decision, one way or the other, they're either dead or they're in big trouble. ""And people have to understand that. They choke sometimes."" The president also expressed sympathy for those hurt in confrontations with police, saying he felt ""terribly for anybody who goes through that"". But he said he did not believe there was systemic racism in law enforcement. As part of his ""law and order"" messaging, Mr Trump said he sent the National Guard into Kenosha. However, in reality they were deployed by Wisconsin's governor and supported by 200 federal law enforcement officials ordered in by the president. Mr Trump also said his administration would provide nearly $4m (Â£3m) to help Kenosha businesses that had been damaged in the riots and $1m for city law enforcement. Demonstrators have accused outside agitators of violently hijacking their protests. Kenosha police said at the weekend that 105 out of 175 suspects arrested during the unrest came from outside the city. Jacob Blake's father said his son was ""holding on for dear life"" The president said he did not meet Jacob Blake's family because they had wanted lawyers present. Mr Trump instead said he was honoured to have the African-American co-pastors of Mr Blake's mother at the roundtable. Co-pastor Sharon Ward said: ""I think it's important to have black people at the table to help solve the problem."" Earlier inan interview with CNN,external, Mr Blake's father, Jacob Blake Snr, said his son's life was more important than a meeting with President Trump. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' ""I'm not getting into politics. It's all about my son, man. It has nothing to do with a photo op,"" he said. Mr Blake Snr said his son was still paralysed from the waist down, ""holding on for dear life"". Jacob Blake shooting: What we know Two incidents, two different police responses Mr Trump's visit to Kenosha went ahead despite appeals from the Democratic mayor and governor to stay away. Over the weekend Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian said it was not a good time for Mr Trump to visit. ""Realistically, from our perspective, our preference would have been for him not to be coming at this point in time,"" he told National Public Radio. Wisconsin's Democratic Governor Tony Evers also warned against the visit, saying it would ""hinder our healing"". Mr Trump posed in front of a burned down camera shop with a man he wrongly claimed to be the business owner Congressman Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat who grew up in Kenosha, said on Twitter the president visited the city ""to spread hate"". Kenosha business owner Tom Gram, whose century-old camera shop was destroyed in the riots, said that he had refused a request from the White House to appear with Mr Trump when he toured the ruined buildings. ""I think everything he does turns into a circus and I just didn't want to be involved in it,""Mr Gram told WTMJ-TV,external. Mr Trump later appeared at the building with the property owner, who he wrongly told reporters was the business owner. Mr Gram said the footage shocked him, and that he disagreed with the message Mr Trump was sending. ""I think he needs to bring this country together rather than divide it,"" he said, adding: ""I think there's a lot of good people in this community and to say that only law enforcement is correct is not the message we need to hear right now."" President Trump flew straight into the latest hotspot in this incendiary summer of racial reckoning, even though the governor asked him not to come. Democrats have accused the president of fanning the flames of unrest. He has focused on the violence that's accompanied some protests rather than the grievances of the anti-racism demonstrators. Mr Trump told us he thought his message was helping to bridge racial divides because black and Hispanic Americans were also against crime and he was about ""law and order"". Almost certainly the president sees a political opportunity by visiting this Midwestern town in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin. Kenosha has emerged as the new epicentre of the debate over race and violence and how each presidential candidate will handle this explosive issue. Trump defends supporters accused in deadly clashes Trump plans to visit city of Jacob Blake shooting Should Wisconsin police have used different tactics?

The most powerful elected US Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, has visited a hair salon in San Francisco, breaking rules that only allow service outdoors, in order to control the spread of coronavirus. Ms Pelosi was also seen with a face mask around her neck rather than over her mouth. She has criticised President Donald Trump for not wearing a mask. A spokesman said she did not realise she was breaking her home city's rules. Mr Trump said she was being ""decimated"" after lecturing everyone else.

Mrs Pelosi has herself previously cited US Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommending that Americans wear face masks in public, especially when physical distancing measures are difficult. After Monday's appointment, the House speaker appeared on MSNBC with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background.

"Kickstart: Firms offered Â£1,500 to hire under-24s","Lois Johnson-Smith, from Lincolnshire, graduated from college this year after completing a course in musical theatre and was due to start work in July in a local entertainment venue. But the job was put on hold as the coronavirus crisis shuttered theatres and concert halls across the country. ""I must admit I was completely thrown off track,"" the 19-year-old told the BBC. Young people are one of the groups hardest hit by the pandemic as jobs have dried up in some sectors. The government is launching a scheme called Kickstart to create work placements for unemployed young people, and is urging firms to sign up from Wednesday. It will pay employers Â£1,500 for every 16-24 year old they train, the aim being to help those people build the skills they need to find a job. The young jobless of '09 - did a cash boost help them? But some business groups warn the scheme will not be enough in itself to create long-term jobs and want the government to go further. Lois likes the idea of Kickstart - which offers its first placements from November - having been unable to find work for months. ""It's really hard to get a job at the moment,"" she said. ""I'm trying my best."" Selected out-of-work young people will be offered six-month work placements, for at least 25 hours a week, to help them gain experience, skills and confidence. The scheme is designed to be a stepping stone to further employment. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was an ""opportunity to kickstart the careers of thousands of young people who could otherwise be left behind as a result of the pandemic"". Anyone between the age of 16 and 24 who is out-of-work and claiming Universal Credit may be eligible. Government figures suggest that there are already more than half a million people who fall into this category. Jobcentre staff will identify people at risk of long-term unemployment to refer to the scheme, and Jobcentre work coaches will support candidates before and after their placement. The government aims to have the first placements on offer from November. Speaking at the launch event, Mr Sunak said: ""It's a difficult time for everyone, but it's especially difficult for the youngest in our country. You are about to enter a jobs markets that is going to be really challenging."" This video can not be played 'I've applied for more than 2,000 jobs with no success' The government will fund each Kickstart job - paying 100% of the age-relevant National Minimum Wage, National Insurance and pension contributions for a 25-hour a week. Employers can top up pay out of their own pockets, or extend the hours if they wish. In addition, the government is offering employers Â£1,500 to set up support and training for those taking part, or other set-up costs such as buying uniforms. The government has put a Â£2bn price tag on the scheme, which it says could fund over 250,000 placements. But Mr Sunak hinted there could be more money. ""If [Kickstart] works and people think it is doing a good job, I'm very happy to do more,"" he said. Tesco has confirmed it plans to take part in Kickstart From 2 September larger employers can visit www.gov.uk/kickstart to register their interest. Employers interested in offering fewer than 30 Kickstart roles should apply through a representative organisation, the Treasury said. Tesco and Network Rail are among the companies who have said they will take part, with Tesco offering 1,000 placements. The scheme will run until at least December 2021 and covers the whole of the UK. How to recession-proof your job hunt A million under-25s face unemployment, study warns ""I think the scheme has got some merit,"" John Nollett, chief executive or Pressmark Pressings, an engineering firm, told the BBC's Wake Up to Money programme. ""We'd be keen to get people into work who haven't been in work before."" He said he liked apprenticeships as a way to give young people a flavour of engineering, and shorter programmes such as this mean younger workers can try a job and see if they enjoy it, without signing up to a longer commitment. However, he said more clarity on the scheme would have enabled him to plan more. ""Getting information has been really difficult and understanding how we go about this has been tough."" A period of unemployment at an early stage in a person's working life can have ""multiple scarring effects"",according to academic research,external, with knock-on consequences for society over decades. This year thousands of young people have already been furloughed or lost their jobs as the pandemic tore into the hospitality and retail in particular, sectors that employ a lot of young people. On top of that, more than 700,000 more people are leaving education and entering the labour market at an extremely difficult time. As a result, there are already more than 800,000 under-24-year-olds receiving Universal Credit, many of whom are out of work. ""We are really reassured that the government has recognised that young people are particularly hit by this period,"" said Michele Farmer, director for central England for the Prince's Trust, which helps young people into work. She admitted the programme will have challenges, including ensuring genuine jobs are on offer. ""In an ideal world you would want to know that anybody entering into this kind of scheme has a real commitment to offering a genuine job at the end of it,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. But the scheme is ""a kickstart for business as well as for young people"". Employers' organisations have welcomed the chancellor's scheme. But in the past, from the Youth Opportunities Programme in the late 1970s to the Future Jobs Fund following the last recession, schemes to support young people into work have generally been met with a degree of scepticism. They don't always offer the level of training or experience participants hoped for, and firms are often accused of using them as a pool of cheap labour to replace older, more expensive employees. It can be hard to calculate whether roles created for such schemes are ""additional"" jobs or simply subsidised places that would have been created anyway. Moreover, the scheme will only get up and running if firms are happy to take on new recruits at a time when many are shedding workers and reducing their operations. Above all, it will only work as a stepping stone into permanent employment if those ""proper"" jobs are available. The Federation of Small Businesses said the scheme aims to get people into work, but did not seem to be designed with small businesses in mind. ""Small firms, who are the largest employers across the business landscape, have long expressed interest in this scheme and will be disappointed to find it harder than expected to take part. To put it bluntly, this scheme has not been designed with small businesses front of mind,"" said FSB national chair Mike Cherry. ""Crucially it is more difficult to access for those hiring fewer than 30 roles through the scheme, who as it stands will need to find intermediaries.""

"Greater Manchester rules 'illogical', mayor says","This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""swift and decisive action"" had been needed Parts of Greater Manchester will not have lockdown restrictions eased as planned following a government U-turn. Measures in Bolton and Trafford were due to be eased overnight after a fall in cases earlier in August. But they will ""now remain under existing restrictions"" following ""a significant change in the level of infection rates over the last few days"", the government announced. The region's mayor Andy Burnham said the U-turn had been ""complete chaos"". The boroughs had been due to allow people from different households to meet indoors and businesses to offer close contact services such as facials, but that has now been halted. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said the decision was made ""in collaboration with local leaders after reviewing the latest data"" which showed infection rates had more than trebled in Bolton in under a week and doubled in Trafford since the last review. ""We have always been clear we will take swift and decisive action where needed to contain outbreaks,"" he added. A spokesman for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the U-turn as ""utterly chaotic"" and it gave people ""no confidence in the government's approach"". What are the new local lockdown rules? Greater Manchester Mayor Mr Burnham compared the government's weekly announcements on local coronavirus restrictions as ""like waiting for the white smoke out of the Vatican"". ""It's not working, it's confusing people, it's causing anger and resentment,"" he added. ""In my view, it's local councils that need to be in the driving seat here, working then in consultation with the government."" Trafford's Labour council leader Andrew Western tweeted: ""We should never have been put in this mess in the first place; this has massively damaged public confidence in measures.""

Bolton Council leader David Greenhalgh said it would have been ""irresponsible not to recognise the unpredicted spike we have seen in Bolton"". He said he recognised ""many people will be extremely frustrated and annoyed by this decision"" but the borough had recorded the second highest increase in positive cases in the country. A Covid-19 spike in Bolton and Trafford promptedcouncil bosses to ask for restrictions to remain in placea day before they were due to be lifted. Bolton currently has one of the highest rates of new virus cases per 100,000 residents in England. Chris Green, Conservative MP for Bolton West, had argued that restrictions should be eased in his constituency. But, following the U-turn, he said the government had based its decision on recent data which he hadn't seen. He has since tweeted to say he was""disappointed at how this important decision has been communicated,externalbecause of the impact this will have on people's lives"". Lockdown restrictions were eased on Wednesday in Stockport,Burnley, Hyndburn,parts of Bradford, excluding Bradford city and Keighley town, parts of Calderdale, excluding Halifax, and parts of Kirklees, excluding Dewsbury and Batley. According to government rules,external, people living in these areas can now: Socialise in groups of up to two households indoors or in private gardens Stay overnight at somebody else's home but must try to social distance Book close contact services such as facials and brow or eyelash treatments Visit bowling alleys, roller rinks, soft play centres and casinos Measureswere imposedat the end of July amid a rise in cases. Stockport has joined Wigan in being allowed to have two households socialise indoors. But in Bolton, Trafford, Manchester, Salford, Rochdale, Bury and Tameside it is still banned. In Oldham people are advised not to meet up with other households outdoors as well. By Daniel Wainwright, BBC England Data Unit The rise in cases in Trafford and Bolton shows how quickly the situation with coronavirus can change. On Friday the government announced it was easing the localised lockdown restrictions in parts of Greater Manchester from Wednesday - a decision it has now reversed in those two areas. Pointing to data for the week to 20 August, it said ""cases in Bolton and Stockport fell from 25.6 (per 100,000 residents) to 18.9, and 23 to 15.1 respectively, and Trafford fell from 27.1 to 17.8."" Yet even then, there was concern that the rate was rising. The Labour leader of Trafford Council, Andrew Western, said the more recent data had shown a ""slight increase"". By Tuesday, the spike in Bolton had also become apparent and council leaders in both areas were calling for the easing of restrictions to not go ahead. According to data released on Tuesday evening, Trafford's rate for the week to 29 August was more than 35 cases per 100,000. In Bolton it was 59 cases per 100,000, driven in particular by high numbers of cases on 27, 28 and 29 August. Catalina Sastra, who runs the Party and Play, funhouse in Bolton was planning to re-open next week but said the changes were confusing. ""We're teetering on the edge... we are due to open with an online booking system, temperature reading, we've had all the screens put up... but it's just if it's on or if it's off"", she said. ""It's a bit like playing hokey-cokey. Are we in or are we out?""

Khmer Rouge prison chief Comrade Duch dies,"Comrade Duch claimed he was only following orders Comrade Duch, a former senior figure of the Khmer Rouge convicted of crimes against humanity in Cambodia, has died. He was serving a life term after being sentenced by a UN-backed court. Kaing Guek Eav, known as Comrade Duch, ran the notorious Tuol Sleng prison where thousands of people were tortured and murdered in the late 1970s. As many as two million people are believed to have died under the Khmer Rouge, a Maoist regime that controlled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. In 2010, Duch became the first senior Khmer Rouge leader to be convicted by the UN-backed tribunal after a journalist found him in hiding a decade earlier. He was sentenced in 2012. He died on Wednesday, aged 77, a spokesman for the tribunal in the capital Phnom Penh said, without giving details of the cause. He had been ill for many years. ""Duch died this morning at 00:52am, on 2 September at Khmer Soviet Friendship Hospital. Details of what he died of, I can't tell,"" the spokesman said. Comrade Duch: Symbol of Khmer Rouge horror How two men survived the Tuol Sleng prison Cambodian sisters, 98 and 101, reunited after 47 years Duch's testimony at the tribunal was a landmark moment for Cambodians who had suffered under the Khmer Rouge's brutal reign, and future generations. While prison chief at Tuol Sleng, Duch maintained a huge archive of photos and documents, including thousands of prisoner ""confessions"", that revealed many aspects of the Khmer Rouge's inner workings. They also helped prosecutors trace the final months of thousands of inmates' lives. In Phnom Penh, there were mixed feelings about his death. ""If he stayed alive then we may still hear more of the history from him for the younger generation and people,"" one man told Reuters news agency. Another resident said that she would never forget his crimes. ""He deserves to serve more prison terms. But now he has died, I can forgive him and his case is finished."" Comrade Duch ran Phnom Penh's S-21 prison, also known as Tuol Sleng, the most notorious Khmer Rouge torture site. It is thought that at least 15,000 men, women and children deemed enemies of the regime passed through the gates of the former school-turned-prison. Most of them were tortured, forced to confess to fictitious crimes against the Khmer Rouge and then put to death at the so-called ""killing fields"" just outside the capital. Tuol Sleng was turned from a school to a prison, torture site and death camp Prisoners were initially officials from the old government, people accused of being middle class and later mainly Khmer Rouge members suspected of disloyalty. The guards, who were often teenagers, forced the prisoners to write detailed confessions to whatever they were accused of and implicate friends and family who were then imprisoned in turn. Those who survived the torture where eventually taken to the ""killing fields"" at Choeung Ek where they were killed, sometimes after digging their own mass graves. Fewer than a dozen prisoners survived Tuol Sleng. This video can not be played A survivor of Cambodia's 'Killing Fields' ""Nothing in the former schoolhouse took place without Duch's approval. His control was total,"" wrote photojournalist Nic Dunlop, who found him in 1999 hiding near the Thai border. During his trial, Duch admitted he had been in charge of Tuol Sleng and apologised for his part in the horrors committed there. He later claimed he had only been following orders, but his appeal on those grounds was rejected by the tribunal. The brutal Khmer Rouge, in power from 1975-1979, claimed the lives of around two million people. The regime led by Pol Pot tried to take Cambodia back to the Middle Ages, or ""Year Zero"", forcing millions of people from the cities to work on communal farms in the countryside. At his trial, Duch apologised to relatives of his victims but asked to be freed They at first targeted ""intellectuals"" - often identified as those who wore glasses or spoke a foreign language - and those connected to the old, US-backed regime that they overthrew. But their paranoid leaders later began to see ""enemies"" everywhere. Ethnic Vietnamese and Cham Muslims in Cambodia were also targeted. Many of the Khmer Rouge's victims died from starvation, disease and overwork. The regime was ousted in 1979 by Vietnamese troops, but the Khmer Rouge leaders escaped and continued to resist the new, Vietnamese-backed government from areas along the Thai-Cambodia border. When the UN ran a country The UN helped establish a tribunal to try the surviving leaders, which began work in 2009. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid spent, only three former Khmer Rouge have ever been sentenced - Comrade Duch, the regime's head of state Khieu Samphan and Pol Pot's second-in-command,Nuon Chea, who died last year after being convicted of genocide. Pol Pot himself died in 1998. The BBC's Guy de Launey, who attended Duch's trial, saidhe sat impassively through proceedings,externalwhile judges described the techniques used at Tuol Sleng. Duch was born in the early 1940s. He was a teacher but joined the communist party and his leftist activism led to brushes with the authorities. When the Vietnam war threatened to spill into neighbouring Cambodia, Duch joined the Khmer Rouge communist rebels under leader Pol Pot. After the rebels took control in 1975, he became the director of Tuol Sleng. An image of Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch, at the Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh In 1979, he fled along with other senior Khmer Rouge members into countryside near the Thai border. Living under a false name, he was identified by Nic Dunlop in 1999. In subsequent interviews, he admitted to the atrocities at Tuol Sleng but said the orders came from the Khmer Rouge's central committee. ""Whoever was arrested must die. It was the rule of our party,"" he said. ""We had the responsibility to interrogate and give the confession to the central committee of the party."" Ten years later, facing the UN-backed tribunal, he described himself as ""deeply remorseful"" and apologised to relatives of his victims.

Parents get advice for first-day nerves at schoolAn educational psychologist says children might be worried going back after such a long time at home.,"It's more than 160 days since schools sent home pupils at the beginning of the lockdown. No-one at the time, in those bewildering March days, could have known when children would return. The leaves that were starting to appear on the trees when children hurried home are now about to turn brown. It's been a long and strange summer. Exams were cancelled and there were replacement results. And then those results were cancelled too. There was constant confusion over whether or not pupils were going back to school. Home-schooling didn't always really happen and rites of passage such as leaving events had to be called off. There were more u-turns than a handwriting text book. Many pupils will not have been to school since they were brought home in March But children are now going back full-time for the new school year. The ""new normal"" became a lockdown cliche, but going back to school in September is a rare case of the old normal. So what's it going to be like for these returning pupils? What should parents be saying to them? Are they going to be able to get back to learning after months of lie-ins and Netflix? ""I think there's a real need to recognise the physical, mental and emotional impact of going back,"" says leading educational psychologist, Daniel O'Hare. Sadness for pupils who may never go back to their schools 'Final year like no other' PM tells school leavers 'He's not getting up until one o'clock', say parents Children are likely to be ""drained"" by the sudden ""overload"" of being in school after being cocooned at home for so long, says Dr O'Hare, joint chair-elect of the British Psychological Society's education and child psychology division. ""It will be very new to go back into that full-on setting with 30 children in a class,"" he says. What makes it more complicated, says Dr O'Hare, is that the lockdown has been experienced by families in such different ways. School dinners will be back on the menu as the new term starts For some children, there will have been worries about their families catching the virus, or facing pressures over money, insecure jobs and lack of space. ""But on the other hand, there will be a population of children who have experienced lockdown as very positive,"" says Dr O'Hare. PPE at lunch and one-way systems â the new school term First primary pupils go back to school How did going back to school lose the plot? They will not have had the stresses of school and they might have enjoyed spending more time together with their parents. The lockdown saw a temporary reinvention of family life, with those parents working from home seeing more of their children than would ever usually be possible. When this finishes, children and perhaps also their parents could miss this closeness. Schools have been getting their safety plans ready for when pupils return Dr O'Hare says it would be a misunderstanding to think this follows socio-economic lines, with middle class families having had a better time during the lockdown. ""We have spoken to children from disadvantaged families and they said that they really enjoyed spending so much time with mum and they loved playing games and that it was better than before,"" he said. ""You know there's a real mix of stories coming from children about going back to school."" It means many different, contradictory responses which schools will have to address. Some researchers have warned ofincreased mental health worrieswhile at the same time others have said teenagers'anxiety levels have gone down during the pandemic. ""Children have missed school and all of the social benefits that it brings,"" says Dr O'Hare, who works with the local education authority in Gloucestershire and at the University of Bristol. For children who have ""challenging home circumstances"", he says there might be a relief at being back at school. But uncertainty also creates stress and the new school year could look very different. What will it be like getting up for school after months of lie-ins and without a routine? Dr O'Hare says parents can help to reduce anxiety by letting children know what changes to expect - how they will be in separate ""bubbles"", the one-way systems, the transport arrangements, the changes to timetables and the hand washing. Another educational psychologist, Will Shield, based at the University of Exeter, says children should be told that it's ""absolutely ok to be concerned"" about going back and to talk about any particular worries. ""It is important that teachers and parents let pupils know it is perfectly normal to be concerned about being away from home or worried about learning they may have missed, alongside feeling excited and happy about returning to school,"" said Dr Shield. Dr O'Hare says research shows children might be frightened of catching coronavirus and putting their family at risk. Hand washing is going to be an important part of the new school routine Friendship groups could have changed and there might be anxiety about falling behind with school work after so much missed time, he says, The children's charity Barnardos has published research suggesting that 4% of children might try to refuse to return to school at all. A survey for Netmums suggested a fifth of parents were still worried about the safety of going back to school, while a YouGov poll suggested about one in six parents was ""seriously considering"" keeping their children out of school. But Dr O'Hare says not to predict or expect problems, because the biggest reaction might be about seeing friends again. There was a first wave of school returns for primary pupils in June ""The conversation can also be positive. What are they looking forward to? Who are they looking forward to seeing? I think it's about trying to promote that sense of excitement,"" he says. He recommends ""watchful waiting - just being aware of the different reactions that children can have"" and keeping talking to them about how they feel about going back. ""Because some children might seem fine and it's not until three or four weeks later that they have a massive outburst."" After a year without precedent, it seems appropriate the advice is not to make any assumptions about what happens next.

Facebook and Twitter 'dismantle Russian network',"Facebook says it has dismantled a small network of accounts and pages that were part of a Russian influence operation. The company said the campaign was linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency (IRA), an organisation close to the Russian government and accused of interference in the 2016 US election. Twitter also suspended five accounts from the same network. The operation centred around PeaceData, which claimed to be a non-profit news website in English and Arabic. Both Facebook and Twitter said the campaign had achieved very limited success. The tactics of the IRA, a Russian troll farm Russia 'meddled in all big social media' News of the discovery comes just two months before the US presidential election between President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Tuesday's announcements by Facebook and Twitter came as the result of collaboration with the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force over the PeaceData website, which served a left-leaning audience. Facebook said it removed 13 accounts and two pages, which sought to ""target public debate in the US"" and other countries, including the UK and Egypt. But the operation had achieved ""very little reach"", with around 14,000 accounts following one or more of the pages it had removed, Facebook said. The English-language page had around 200 followers. The deleted accounts used fake names and profile pictures, Facebook said, but real and ""unwitting"" freelance writers appeared to have written for the PeaceData website. Twitter, meanwhile, said it had suspended five accounts ""for platform manipulation that we can reliably attribute to Russian state actors"". It added that the content created by the accounts was ""low quality and spammy, and most Tweets from these accounts received few, if any, Likes or Retweets"". The IRA was one of three Russian companies and 13 people indicted by the US Department of Justice as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election campaign. The former FBI director spent two years looking into alleged collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. He concluded that Russia had interfered in the election with the intention of benefitting Mr Trump's campaign, although he found no evidence of a conspiracy.

Firms urged to sign up to job scheme for under-24s,"Lois Johnson-Smith, from Lincolnshire, graduated from college this year after completing a course in musical theatre and was due to start work in July in a local entertainment venue. But the job was put on hold as the coronavirus crisis shuttered theatres and concert halls across the country. ""I must admit I was completely thrown off track,"" the 19-year-old told the BBC. Young people are one of the groups hardest hit by the pandemic as jobs have dried up in some sectors. The government is launching a scheme called Kickstart to create work placements for unemployed young people, and is urging firms to sign up from Wednesday. It will pay employers Â£1,500 for every 16-24 year old they train, the aim being to help those people build the skills they need to find a job. The young jobless of '09 - did a cash boost help them? But some business groups warn the scheme will not be enough in itself to create long-term jobs and want the government to go further. Lois likes the idea of Kickstart - which offers its first placements from November - having been unable to find work for months. ""It's really hard to get a job at the moment,"" she said. ""I'm trying my best."" Selected out-of-work young people will be offered six-month work placements, for at least 25 hours a week, to help them gain experience, skills and confidence. The scheme is designed to be a stepping stone to further employment. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was an ""opportunity to kickstart the careers of thousands of young people who could otherwise be left behind as a result of the pandemic"". Anyone between the age of 16 and 24 who is out-of-work and claiming Universal Credit may be eligible. Government figures suggest that there are already more than half a million people who fall into this category. Jobcentre staff will identify people at risk of long-term unemployment to refer to the scheme, and Jobcentre work coaches will support candidates before and after their placement. The government aims to have the first placements on offer from November. Speaking at the launch event, Mr Sunak said: ""It's a difficult time for everyone, but it's especially difficult for the youngest in our country. You are about to enter a jobs markets that is going to be really challenging."" This video can not be played 'I've applied for more than 2,000 jobs with no success' The government will fund each Kickstart job - paying 100% of the age-relevant National Minimum Wage, National Insurance and pension contributions for a 25-hour a week. Employers can top up pay out of their own pockets, or extend the hours if they wish. In addition, the government is offering employers Â£1,500 to set up support and training for those taking part, or other set-up costs such as buying uniforms. The government has put a Â£2bn price tag on the scheme, which it says could fund over 250,000 placements. But Mr Sunak hinted there could be more money. ""If [Kickstart] works and people think it is doing a good job, I'm very happy to do more,"" he said. Tesco has confirmed it plans to take part in Kickstart From 2 September larger employers can visit www.gov.uk/kickstart to register their interest. Employers interested in offering fewer than 30 Kickstart roles should apply through a representative organisation, the Treasury said. Tesco and Network Rail are among the companies who have said they will take part, with Tesco offering 1,000 placements. The scheme will run until at least December 2021 and covers the whole of the UK. How to recession-proof your job hunt A million under-25s face unemployment, study warns ""I think the scheme has got some merit,"" John Nollett, chief executive or Pressmark Pressings, an engineering firm, told the BBC's Wake Up to Money programme. ""We'd be keen to get people into work who haven't been in work before."" He said he liked apprenticeships as a way to give young people a flavour of engineering, and shorter programmes such as this mean younger workers can try a job and see if they enjoy it, without signing up to a longer commitment. However, he said more clarity on the scheme would have enabled him to plan more. ""Getting information has been really difficult and understanding how we go about this has been tough."" A period of unemployment at an early stage in a person's working life can have ""multiple scarring effects"",according to academic research,external, with knock-on consequences for society over decades. This year thousands of young people have already been furloughed or lost their jobs as the pandemic tore into the hospitality and retail in particular, sectors that employ a lot of young people. On top of that, more than 700,000 more people are leaving education and entering the labour market at an extremely difficult time. As a result, there are already more than 800,000 under-24-year-olds receiving Universal Credit, many of whom are out of work. ""We are really reassured that the government has recognised that young people are particularly hit by this period,"" said Michele Farmer, director for central England for the Prince's Trust, which helps young people into work. She admitted the programme will have challenges, including ensuring genuine jobs are on offer. ""In an ideal world you would want to know that anybody entering into this kind of scheme has a real commitment to offering a genuine job at the end of it,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. But the scheme is ""a kickstart for business as well as for young people"". Employers' organisations have welcomed the chancellor's scheme. But in the past, from the Youth Opportunities Programme in the late 1970s to the Future Jobs Fund following the last recession, schemes to support young people into work have generally been met with a degree of scepticism. They don't always offer the level of training or experience participants hoped for, and firms are often accused of using them as a pool of cheap labour to replace older, more expensive employees. It can be hard to calculate whether roles created for such schemes are ""additional"" jobs or simply subsidised places that would have been created anyway. Moreover, the scheme will only get up and running if firms are happy to take on new recruits at a time when many are shedding workers and reducing their operations. Above all, it will only work as a stepping stone into permanent employment if those ""proper"" jobs are available. The Federation of Small Businesses said the scheme aims to get people into work, but did not seem to be designed with small businesses in mind. ""Small firms, who are the largest employers across the business landscape, have long expressed interest in this scheme and will be disappointed to find it harder than expected to take part. To put it bluntly, this scheme has not been designed with small businesses front of mind,"" said FSB national chair Mike Cherry. ""Crucially it is more difficult to access for those hiring fewer than 30 roles through the scheme, who as it stands will need to find intermediaries.""

Khmer Rouge prison commander Comrade Duch dies,"Comrade Duch claimed he was only following orders Comrade Duch, a former senior figure of the Khmer Rouge convicted of crimes against humanity in Cambodia, has died. He was serving a life term after being sentenced by a UN-backed court. Kaing Guek Eav, known as Comrade Duch, ran the notorious Tuol Sleng prison where thousands of people were tortured and murdered in the late 1970s. As many as two million people are believed to have died under the Khmer Rouge, a Maoist regime that controlled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. In 2010, Duch became the first senior Khmer Rouge leader to be convicted by the UN-backed tribunal after a journalist found him in hiding a decade earlier. He was sentenced in 2012. He died on Wednesday, aged 77, a spokesman for the tribunal in the capital Phnom Penh said, without giving details of the cause. He had been ill for many years. ""Duch died this morning at 00:52am, on 2 September at Khmer Soviet Friendship Hospital. Details of what he died of, I can't tell,"" the spokesman said. Comrade Duch: Symbol of Khmer Rouge horror How two men survived the Tuol Sleng prison Cambodian sisters, 98 and 101, reunited after 47 years Duch's testimony at the tribunal was a landmark moment for Cambodians who had suffered under the Khmer Rouge's brutal reign, and future generations. While prison chief at Tuol Sleng, Duch maintained a huge archive of photos and documents, including thousands of prisoner ""confessions"", that revealed many aspects of the Khmer Rouge's inner workings. They also helped prosecutors trace the final months of thousands of inmates' lives. In Phnom Penh, there were mixed feelings about his death. ""If he stayed alive then we may still hear more of the history from him for the younger generation and people,"" one man told Reuters news agency. Another resident said that she would never forget his crimes. ""He deserves to serve more prison terms. But now he has died, I can forgive him and his case is finished."" Comrade Duch ran Phnom Penh's S-21 prison, also known as Tuol Sleng, the most notorious Khmer Rouge torture site. It is thought that at least 15,000 men, women and children deemed enemies of the regime passed through the gates of the former school-turned-prison. Most of them were tortured, forced to confess to fictitious crimes against the Khmer Rouge and then put to death at the so-called ""killing fields"" just outside the capital. Tuol Sleng was turned from a school to a prison, torture site and death camp Prisoners were initially officials from the old government, people accused of being middle class and later mainly Khmer Rouge members suspected of disloyalty. The guards, who were often teenagers, forced the prisoners to write detailed confessions to whatever they were accused of and implicate friends and family who were then imprisoned in turn. Those who survived the torture where eventually taken to the ""killing fields"" at Choeung Ek where they were killed, sometimes after digging their own mass graves. Fewer than a dozen prisoners survived Tuol Sleng. This video can not be played A survivor of Cambodia's 'Killing Fields' ""Nothing in the former schoolhouse took place without Duch's approval. His control was total,"" wrote photojournalist Nic Dunlop, who found him in 1999 hiding near the Thai border. During his trial, Duch admitted he had been in charge of Tuol Sleng and apologised for his part in the horrors committed there. He later claimed he had only been following orders, but his appeal on those grounds was rejected by the tribunal. The brutal Khmer Rouge, in power from 1975-1979, claimed the lives of around two million people. The regime led by Pol Pot tried to take Cambodia back to the Middle Ages, or ""Year Zero"", forcing millions of people from the cities to work on communal farms in the countryside. At his trial, Duch apologised to relatives of his victims but asked to be freed They at first targeted ""intellectuals"" - often identified as those who wore glasses or spoke a foreign language - and those connected to the old, US-backed regime that they overthrew. But their paranoid leaders later began to see ""enemies"" everywhere. Ethnic Vietnamese and Cham Muslims in Cambodia were also targeted. Many of the Khmer Rouge's victims died from starvation, disease and overwork. The regime was ousted in 1979 by Vietnamese troops, but the Khmer Rouge leaders escaped and continued to resist the new, Vietnamese-backed government from areas along the Thai-Cambodia border. When the UN ran a country The UN helped establish a tribunal to try the surviving leaders, which began work in 2009. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid spent, only three former Khmer Rouge have ever been sentenced - Comrade Duch, the regime's head of state Khieu Samphan and Pol Pot's second-in-command,Nuon Chea, who died last year after being convicted of genocide. Pol Pot himself died in 1998. The BBC's Guy de Launey, who attended Duch's trial, saidhe sat impassively through proceedings,externalwhile judges described the techniques used at Tuol Sleng. Duch was born in the early 1940s. He was a teacher but joined the communist party and his leftist activism led to brushes with the authorities. When the Vietnam war threatened to spill into neighbouring Cambodia, Duch joined the Khmer Rouge communist rebels under leader Pol Pot. After the rebels took control in 1975, he became the director of Tuol Sleng. An image of Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch, at the Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh In 1979, he fled along with other senior Khmer Rouge members into countryside near the Thai border. Living under a false name, he was identified by Nic Dunlop in 1999. In subsequent interviews, he admitted to the atrocities at Tuol Sleng but said the orders came from the Khmer Rouge's central committee. ""Whoever was arrested must die. It was the rule of our party,"" he said. ""We had the responsibility to interrogate and give the confession to the central committee of the party."" Ten years later, facing the UN-backed tribunal, he described himself as ""deeply remorseful"" and apologised to relatives of his victims. In the closing days of his trial, he asked to be freed, saying he had not been a senior member of the Khmer Rouge hierarchy. Relatives of his victims said this made a mockery of his claims of remorse.

Family strain made Jones 'nearly quit' as FM,"Carwyn Jones was first minister from 2009 to 2018 and is still a member of the Senedd for Bridgend Ex-first minister of Wales Carwyn Jones has revealed he came close to stepping down from the job earlier than he did due to the strain on his family. He said that he thought about walking away from the role when his daughter was going through a ""difficult time"". Mr Jones said that being away so much made him question if ""she needed a dad who is at home more"". Discussing his book, ""Not Just Politics"", he also warns Wales could become independent by accident. Carwyn Jones's legacy as first minister 'I was fair and honest' first minister Carwyn Jones to leave assembly in 2021 Mr Jones, first minister from 2009 to 2018, said that one occasion stood out ""when my daughter was going through a difficult time, as sometimes adopted children do"". ""She found things very difficult,"" he told BBC Wales. ""At that point I did start to think does she need a dad who is at home more? ""But she came through it, she's a great kid."" Carwyn Jones became first minister in December 2009, after Rhodri Morgan stepped down Mr Jones also talked about his wife Lisa's diagnosis with leukaemia in the 1990s and how they did not allow the illness to get in the way of their plans for the future. ""Very fortunately Lisa recovered. She had a bone marrow transplant from her brother, within a year she was pretty much back to normal and was strong, and she's a very brave person,"" he said. ""Life carried on and it was important that life carried on. When Lisa was ill a lot of people who were diagnosed didn't make it. ""Lisa was one of the fortunate ones, and 25 years on there has been no recurrence at all of the illness. ""I think it's important that when you get cancer you carry on. That you don't let it get in the way of your life and carry on with your plans."" Carl Sargeant was found dead days after Carwyn Jones sacked him amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour Mr Jones admitted that the death of the sacked Welsh Government minister Carl Sargeant would be one event that ""inevitably leaves a mark on you"". Mr Sargeant was found dead at his homedays after the then-first minister dismissed him in November 2017, after being accused of inappropriate conduct towards women. Five months later, Mr Jones announced he would be stepping down as first minister, saying he had been through the ""darkest of times"". In the book Mr Jones reveals that following Mr Sargeant's death he was clinically depressed, he received counselling and was prescribed with antidepressants. But Mr Jones doesn't believe this should have been made public at the time. ""I don't think it's appropriate when you have a grieving family to start talking about yourself and the challenges that you face. I think people would see that as a bit of a distraction to be fair,"" he said. ""I would never have felt comfortable with talking about what I was going through when there is a family that had gone through much worse. ""These things are not appropriate. There comes a time to discuss these things but it wasn't then."" Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn joined Carwyn Jones on the 2017 general election campaign trail in Cardiff Another theme that Mr Jones tackles in the book is the future of the United Kingdom. ""I've never accepted that it's a choice between the status quo and independence,"" he said. ""I think there is another way, a kind of federation, where you've got four equal nations who opt into that federation."" Mr Jones believes that there is a great appetite for constitutional change in the Labour Party. ""I think (Labour leader) Keir Starmer gets it. I'm not saying his view will be exactly the same as mine in terms of parliamentary sovereignty, it may be a different model,"" he added. Mr Jones also warns that Wales could become independent by accident. ""You have to bear in mind that if Scotland can leave the UK, Wales can leave the UK, so can England,"" he said. ""And you see Scotland leaving, that might well start to create a drive for English nationalism, independence for England. ""There are lots of forces that seem unlikely and ridiculous, and would have seemed so years ago, which now are not as ridiculous as they might be. These are the things we have to deal with.""

Erick Morillo: I Like to Move It DJ dead at 49,"Erick Morillo, the internationally-recognised DJ best known for the track I Like To Move It, has been found dead in Miami, local police have said. His death comes less than a month after his arrest for sexually assaulting a female DJ after working a gig together. Police said the 49-year old was found dead in his Miami Beach home, but have released few details as the investigation begins. He released his 1994 hit I Like To Move It using the name Reel 2 Real. It became a retro hit again after a remix was featured in the 2005 animated film Madagascar. Morillo had denied the sexual assault charge, but turned himself in after a rape kit identified him as the suspect, according to WPLG-TV in Florida. He had been scheduled for a court hearing on Friday, the station reported.

Apps for children must offer privacy by default,"The information commissioner said it was ""astonishing"" these protections were not already built in to websites Apps, social media platforms and online games that are specifically targeted at children will now have to put privacy at the heart of their design. A code of practice outlining how children's data should be protected has come into force and firms have 12 months to comply with the new rules. If they do not, they could face huge fines imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office. Some questioned whether the code would bring about real change. Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said it was an important step towards protecting children online. ""A generation from now we will all be astonished that there was ever a time when there wasn't specific regulation to protect kids online. It will be as normal as putting on a seatbelt. ""This code makes clear that kids are not like adults online, and their data needs greater protections."" She said the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) recognised that it could be difficult for smaller businesses to comply with the code and would offer ""help and support"" over the coming year. Among the tenets of the code are: the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration when designing and developing online services high levels of privacy must be set by default only a minimum amount of personal data should be collected and retained children's data should not be shared unless there is a compelling reason to do so children's personal data should not be used in ways that could be detrimental to their wellbeing geo-location should be switched off by default Others who must conform to the code include educational websites, streaming services that use, analyse and profile children's data and the makers of connected toys. The ICO has the power to fine firms up to 4% of their global turnover if they breach data protection guidelines. The organisation has previously said it will take more severe action when it sees harm to children. In September last year, YouTube was fined $170m (Â£139m) for collecting data on children under 13 without the consent of their parents, following a US investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The scope of protections needed for children online was huge and the ICO might not be up to the job, said one digital rights campaigner, Jen Persson. ""The code is well-intentioned, and if enforced, may bring about some more focused change in the approach of some apps and platforms to stop collecting excessive data from children for example, and start to meet the requirements of core data protection law in place for over 20 years. ""The key risks are that since the ICO has not enforced to date on behalf of children in its current remit of concrete data protection law, that it may be seen as not having the capability to enforce those new things in the code that go beyond that and are subjective, such as the best interests of the child, or that outstrip the ICO technical knowledge and capacity."" Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said he hoped the code would force a rethink on the content provided to children. ""Tech firms have a year to prepare for this transformative code that will force them to take online harms seriously, so there can be no more excuses for putting children at risk. ""For the first time, high-risk social networks will have a legal duty to assess their sites for sexual abuse risks and no longer serve up harmful self-harm and suicide content to children.""

"BTS send 'stay strong' message to fansSpeaking to the BBC, the K-pop group reflect on their US pop success and support from their fans.Asia","The seven member boyband has made history with their new track 'Dynamite' In a year where much of the world has been brought to standstill, BTS stands out. Unable to perform live and show off their electric choreography on some of the biggest stages across the world, they took a fresh approach: disco.

Back to school for millions of pupils in England,"The first day back for pupils at Riverside School in east London Millions of pupils in England and Wales are returning to school after the unprecedented shutdown during the coronavirus pandemic. Schools will look different, with one-way systems, screens keeping pupils apart and staggered start times. Many pupils will be given inductions so they understand the new rules, such as staying in their ""bubble"" groups and where to use social distancing. Teachers will assess how much pupils need to catch up after a long absence. Schools are beginning to return in England Wales this week - although there will be a mix of starting dates, with some schools having training days as staff prepare for new safety measures. In Scotland and Northern Ireland schools have already opened for the new academic year. Pupils wearing masks to school - but will not be expected to wear them in the classroom Godsway Dzoboku, principal of Outwood Academy Portland, in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, has re-organised classroom desks into rows, with each child being given a personalised pack of rulers, pens and other classroom equipment. ""The only way we can make bubbles work is to keep them [the pupils] in year groups - so we have a bubble of 300,"" Mr Dzoboku said.

Head teacher Andrew Roberts says the exam years will be a priority He says they have missed three months of learning since the lockdown began - and they need to be ready for crucial GCSEs and A-levels in less than a year's time. Delani, aged 11 says he is feeling ""pretty OK"" about his first day. ""I was quite scared but I've seen a lot of familiar faces,"" he says. Getting ready for the new term after months out of school He has a face mask in his pocket but the school has decided they're not needed. His mum, Heather, a university administrator says she's fairly confident that the benefits of being back at school outweigh the risks. From what she has read, she says the pandemic could go on for a very long time. So the children need to be back in school and the parents need to get back to work. Imole, aged 11, says coronavirus ""messed everything up"". He was sorry to miss most of his last year in primary school, even the end of year SATs tests. He's standing at the gates of his new secondary school - a bit apprehensive. ""A lot of stuff is going to change,"" he says. Aisha, also 11, is ""nervous and excited"". ""It's scary moving from a school where I knew everyone to a school where I don't,"" she says. Mum Rasheedat says she's ""confident"" her daughter will be safe from the virus at her new school: ""I'm not really worried"". PPE at lunch and one-way systems â the new school term What are the risks that schools will spread coronavirus? Portable loos and PPE: Teachers on the return to school It has been almost six months since schools were closed by the lockdown. They soon reopened to vulnerable pupils and key worker children, but only a fraction of the national school population returned to any form of face-to-face lessons over the summer term. Hand washing at the beginning of school in Doncaster The rest were required to carry on learning from home, but levels of support and interactive teaching have been very different from place to place. It is not clear how many parents will have sent their children back, with no official figures yet, although attendance is compulsory. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union said that, thanks to the preparations by school staff, ""the signs are at the moment that it's a very calm and managed and positive return"". ""There will be lots of nervous children and young people this morning,"" she said. ""I'm sure when they get into school they will be reassured by the routines and be really glad to be back with their teachers and their friends."" Children with a new classroom lay out at a school in Southwark, south London But teachers and head teachers have criticised the lack of funding for safety measures, such as hand-washing stations, sanitiser, and screens. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said it was ""hugely disappointing"" that these changes had to be paid for out of ""hard-pressed budgets"". England's schools minister Nick Gibb has said funding for safety measures is ""under review"", although Ms Bousted said the government was acting too slowly. Pupils lining up for a new year in Barking, east London Mr Gibb has also urged parents to send their children back to catch up on missed lesssons, saying: ""Schools are doing everything they can to make sure that their pupils and their staff are safe."" Some recent polls suggest families are keen to see children back in class, but others have not been so positive. In Scotland, where pupils returned several weeks ago,official statistics show one in 10 pupils is absent, although ministers and teachers have suggested cold and flu viruses are mostly to blame. But there are parents who are worried. Mother of two, Sally, has a chronic form of blood cancer and has been shielding since March. She told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme she was keen for her children to get back to school to continue their education and see their friends. ""But I do have concerns that it's exposing me to additional risks."" Back to school -but not as you know it When they return home school, she said: ""I won't be giving them a hug, unfortunately - I'll be keeping my distance as much as I can, otherwise it will be life as normal, hopefully."" Pupils returning to secondary schools will find whole sections of school buildings cordoned off to some groups, but open to others as head teachers strive to keep groups apart. Screens have been erected to keep pupils separate And there will be reduced movement of pupils around schools, with classes and year groups staying in a small number of rooms, while their individual subject teachers come to them to teach. Pupils can be required to wear face coverings in busy areas, such as corridors, and lessons like physical education will be very different, with all contact sports still banned. Many will already be wearing face coverings on public transport to school. And there are concerns about the impact on schools if there are further local outbreaks. If a school has a positive case it will work with local health officials to assess how many other pupils should go home and isolate. It could be just those who have been in close contact with the pupil, or an entire ""bubble"" group, which could be an entire year group in secondary schools.

Portable loos and PPE,"Many teachers are preparing to welcome pupils back to school this week for the first time in months. Schools in Scotland, Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK are already open. But for many pupils in England, it will be the first time they have been in a classroom since March. We spoke to teachers about what's changed, and how they are feeling about schools reopening. Teacher Kemi Oloyede has thought a lot about how safe she feels returning to work. She works in a pupil referral unit, with secondary students who have been excluded from school. When she welcomes her mixed ability class of eight pupils back this week, the 28-year-old says she will be working mainly from her desk. ""I won't lie to you, I probably will be wearing a mask in the building and wearing gloves as well. I'm trying to be as safe as safe as I can be."" The Londoner lives with her parents who are classed as being at risk, and this has impacted how she feels about her return to work. ""I am ready to go back to work because the students have missed out on a lot due to schools closing down back in March. But mentally, because of the anxiety, maybe not so much,"" she says. For Ms Oloyede, knowing that there is anincreased risk that black Britons could die from coronavirusis a worry. ""I am black, my parents are black and I don't want to put them at risk if they are already at risk. I don't want to bring anything home. My mum is working from home so she doesn't have to be in contact with people on a daily basis. But as a teacher, we have to be in contact with our students so that has added to my level of anxiety. I'm just hoping and praying everything will be fine. She says she feels supported by her school, which is supplying protective equipment. ""I have to work and the students have to learn."" Geography teacher Tom Clark say it's normal for teachers to feel butterflies before the start of a new term. But this one feels different. ""I don't know how the kids are going to be,"" he says.  ""I haven't seen them for six months. I've seen them on screen but I don't know how they are as people."" The 48-year-old works at Birkdale School in Sheffield, a private school for boys. It has set up bubbles - closed groups of pupils - and a one-way system. It is asking pupils to wear face coverings when in corridors and communal areas, and on school buses. Soon after lockdown started in March, he and his colleagues were given ""intensive training"" in remote classroom software and online teaching. ""It was a huge success,"" he explains. ""So much so that when the government announced in mid-June that certain year groups could go back to school, we decided that not to do that, because it was going to be more disruptive than the online learning that was happening from home. Mr Clark says the experience will help his school react to any new lockdown this winter. ""If we have to suddenly close down bubbles within the school, we can just revert back to Google Classroom. The idea of doing online learning would have filled me with terror eight months ago but it has become part and parcel of my daily life."" Laura Kline believes classroom learning creates a more level playing field for students than online lessons. ""I had one student who could only be on the laptop on certain days because they've got three other siblings in the house. ""One is a university student, another is an A-level student, and so they're bottom of the list because they're in Year 9, and it's really difficult to expect them to complete the work online with a potentially poor internet connection,"" she explains. Ms Kline, 27, qualified as a science teacher last year, and describes the past year as a ""huge shock to the system"". ""When I started in September it was already overwhelming because you have a full timetable just like any other teacher; I taught Year 11 for the first time, I had a form for the first time. ""I worked hard and got used to it, and then March came - and everything I had been building to got thrown out of the window because there was a whole new way of learning."" During lockdown, she sent work out to year groups once or twice a week, and there were also weekly live lessons online which she found a challenge. ""When the children are not directly in front of you, it's just not the same. You can't see who understands what you're saying and who needs a bit of assistance. Government guidance for schools,external Information for parents and carers,external Early years and childcare providers advice,external Government advice inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external ""There are some students I know will be far behind compared to where they should be and I can't see, with the pressures that teachers will now be under, how anyone can make up that lost time; especially for the GCSE students. They will be falling into those lower ability groups where they wouldn't necessarily need to be. ""Children have really sensitive morale so once you've moved them down it is really difficult to get them re-engaged to push them back up to where they really deserve to be."" Lee Batstone, head teacher of Madley Primary School in Herefordshire, says he's spent Â£10,000 on adapting to government guidelines on cleaning and social distancing. Since March the school has only been closed for two weeks - it ran a holiday club over the holidays - and Mr Batstone says his budget is increasingly stretched. ""The longer this goes on without any additional funding, the harder it is going to be"" says the 49-year-old. As well as standard measures such as regular cleaning and hand sanitising, the school is allowing staff and pupils to wear whatever PPE they want in order to feel safe. ""We're a school that's based on a pupils taking responsibility for themselves in their own actions, but now everything except going to the toilet is supervised and closely monitored,"" he says. That said, toilets have been an issue, according to Mr Batstone. The school's existing ones are small and the school is operating a one-in, one-out policy so new, temporary portable toilets have been brought in so that every year group has their own. ""Year 6 at the end of last term had the poshest toilets going - they had wedding toilets that piped music on to the playground,"" he says. Now that the practical measures are in place, Mr Batstone says the school's main focus will be about helping the children learn to look after themselves without becoming frightened of each other. ""I think one of the mental impacts [of the pandemic will be] making sure children are not scared of other human beings because that could be a long-term effect the longer this goes on.""

Parents get advice for first-day nerves at school,"It's more than 160 days since schools sent home pupils at the beginning of the lockdown. No-one at the time, in those bewildering March days, could have known when children would return. The leaves that were starting to appear on the trees when children hurried home are now about to turn brown. It's been a long and strange summer. Exams were cancelled and there were replacement results. And then those results were cancelled too. There was constant confusion over whether or not pupils were going back to school. Home-schooling didn't always really happen and rites of passage such as leaving events had to be called off. There were more u-turns than a handwriting text book. Many pupils will not have been to school since they were brought home in March But children are now going back full-time for the new school year. The ""new normal"" became a lockdown cliche, but going back to school in September is a rare case of the old normal. So what's it going to be like for these returning pupils? What should parents be saying to them? Are they going to be able to get back to learning after months of lie-ins and Netflix? ""I think there's a real need to recognise the physical, mental and emotional impact of going back,"" says leading educational psychologist, Daniel O'Hare. Sadness for pupils who may never go back to their schools 'Final year like no other' PM tells school leavers 'He's not getting up until one o'clock', say parents Children are likely to be ""drained"" by the sudden ""overload"" of being in school after being cocooned at home for so long, says Dr O'Hare, joint chair-elect of the British Psychological Society's education and child psychology division. ""It will be very new to go back into that full-on setting with 30 children in a class,"" he says. What makes it more complicated, says Dr O'Hare, is that the lockdown has been experienced by families in such different ways. School dinners will be back on the menu as the new term starts For some children, there will have been worries about their families catching the virus, or facing pressures over money, insecure jobs and lack of space. ""But on the other hand, there will be a population of children who have experienced lockdown as very positive,"" says Dr O'Hare. PPE at lunch and one-way systems â the new school term First primary pupils go back to school How did going back to school lose the plot? They will not have had the stresses of school and they might have enjoyed spending more time together with their parents. The lockdown saw a temporary reinvention of family life, with those parents working from home seeing more of their children than would ever usually be possible. When this finishes, children and perhaps also their parents could miss this closeness. Schools have been getting their safety plans ready for when pupils return Dr O'Hare says it would be a misunderstanding to think this follows socio-economic lines, with middle class families having had a better time during the lockdown. ""We have spoken to children from disadvantaged families and they said that they really enjoyed spending so much time with mum and they loved playing games and that it was better than before,"" he said. ""You know there's a real mix of stories coming from children about going back to school."" It means many different, contradictory responses which schools will have to address. Some researchers have warned ofincreased mental health worrieswhile at the same time others have said teenagers'anxiety levels have gone down during the pandemic. ""Children have missed school and all of the social benefits that it brings,"" says Dr O'Hare, who works with the local education authority in Gloucestershire and at the University of Bristol. For children who have ""challenging home circumstances"", he says there might be a relief at being back at school. But uncertainty also creates stress and the new school year could look very different. What will it be like getting up for school after months of lie-ins and without a routine? Dr O'Hare says parents can help to reduce anxiety by letting children know what changes to expect - how they will be in separate ""bubbles"", the one-way systems, the transport arrangements, the changes to timetables and the hand washing. Another educational psychologist, Will Shield, based at the University of Exeter, says children should be told that it's ""absolutely ok to be concerned"" about going back and to talk about any particular worries. ""It is important that teachers and parents let pupils know it is perfectly normal to be concerned about being away from home or worried about learning they may have missed, alongside feeling excited and happy about returning to school,"" said Dr Shield. Dr O'Hare says research shows children might be frightened of catching coronavirus and putting their family at risk. Hand washing is going to be an important part of the new school routine Friendship groups could have changed and there might be anxiety about falling behind with school work after so much missed time, he says, The children's charity Barnardos has published research suggesting that 4% of children might try to refuse to return to school at all. A survey for Netmums suggested a fifth of parents were still worried about the safety of going back to school, while a YouGov poll suggested about one in six parents was ""seriously considering"" keeping their children out of school. But Dr O'Hare says not to predict or expect problems, because the biggest reaction might be about seeing friends again. There was a first wave of school returns for primary pupils in June ""The conversation can also be positive. What are they looking forward to? Who are they looking forward to seeing? I think it's about trying to promote that sense of excitement,"" he says. He recommends ""watchful waiting - just being aware of the different reactions that children can have"" and keeping talking to them about how they feel about going back. ""Because some children might seem fine and it's not until three or four weeks later that they have a massive outburst."" After a year without precedent, it seems appropriate the advice is not to make any assumptions about what happens next.
