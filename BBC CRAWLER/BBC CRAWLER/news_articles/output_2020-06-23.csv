Rent day arrives for struggling retailersShops are due to pay their quarterly rent bill on Wednesday as landlords expect a shortfallBusiness,"""We're almost 90% open with most of our retailers trading. It's a return to almost normality,"" says James Roberts the boss of Grosvenor Shopping centre in Northampton. But there's one big question.  How many of the 50 or so retailers and food outlets will be paying any rent this week. He laughs nervously when asked. ""Hopefully some, but we've only collected 56% in the last quarter,"" he says. UK landlords should be collecting at least Â£2.5bn on Wednesday for shop rents. Retail landlords traditionally get paid four times a year. On the last rent day in March, no more than half the total rent was handed over and landlords will be lucky to get a quarter of what they're owed today. Most high street shops, along with pubs and restaurants, have seen sales evaporate and have either been unable or refusing to pay rent. Bill Hughes says unless there's an appeal for long term investors like pension funds to invest in UK real estate, infrastructure won't get funded. Businesses are hoarding cash to survive. But the crisis is starving landlords of much needed income, too. The Grosvenor Shopping Centre is the kind of everyday mall you'd find in many of our towns and city centres. It's owned by Legal & General which invests in property to fund thousands of pensions. ""It's not well known, or particularly transparent to people, but most retail properties are effectively owned by the normal person on the street in the UK,"" said Bill Hughes, Legal and General's head of real assets. Recent research by Estates Gazette, a commercial property weekly, showed that as much as 60% of all UK retail space is owned either directly or indirectly by the public, including pension funds, the public sector and individual shareholders. It's been a secure form of income until now. ""The risk of loss of income is really important. The pension fund owners of the built environment of the UK, they rely upon the income being produced by what hitherto have been seen as being very stable assets. And that is at risk in a way that's never been there to the extent before."" said Mr Hughes. Landlords have enjoyed the good times over the decades with long leases and upward-only rent reviews. And rapidly expanding retailers were happy to sign up. But in recent years with sales shifting online, it's become far harder for shops to make a profit. The pandemic has accelerated this trend.  The Government extended its ban on evictions for non-payment of rent until the autumn. Occupiers are now frantically trying to secure better deals or turning to insolvency proceedings to renegotiate their debts, including owed rent. Mark Burlton, the founder of Cross Border Retail, said landlords may have to get used to the fact their properties are worth less The traditional business model of how retail property is leased is now well and truly broken. ""It's a mess, but it's not a mess that we can't tidy up"" said Mark Burlton, the founder of Cross Border Retail, a real estate business which advises landlords and retailers. ""I do feel sorry for them (landlords) . Absolutely. They are entitled to receive income, but I don't believe they're entitled to receive the same income as they were. I think they have to understand the value of their asset. And the value of their asset is what someone is prepared to pay for it. There isn't a queue of retailers coming up behind them,"" he said. He believes upward only rent reviews should be abolished along with the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1954, the law which still underpins the leasehold system in the UK. ""It's inflexible. We need something which is much cheaper and quicker to negotiate. We should have a system of rents based on turnover, allowing retailers to pay a rent they can afford. But in order to do that, tenants have to play their part. They have to declare what they are turning over,"" said Mr Burlton. Bill Hughes thinks the Government's new code of practice on rental agreements should ease the tensions. ""We're having an active conversation with tenants about can they pay, and if they can't pay, we're working hard to restructure things. ""Because it's in our interest to find a way of helping cash flow to companies that would survive beyond this very difficult, unusual crisis that Covid presents."" Legal & General's Bill Hughes thinks the Government should take a careful look at providing some financial support to help bridge the likely shortfall in income otherwise the ""dynamic between landlords and tenants is likely to be challenging and deteriorate"". The future prosperity of our high streets and town centres could ultimately be at stake if this crisis doesn't end well. Regeneration requires private sector investment as well as Government funding. Mr Hughes says unless there's an appeal for long term investors like pension funds to invest in UK real estate, infrastructure won't get funded. ""They need a sensible and stable environment within which they can get some sort of return,"" he explains. Mr Burlton says he's receiving phone calls from US private equity and venture capitalists sniffing around for opportunities to snap up some retail assets on the cheap. ""Ultimately if landlords and tenants can't agree what the actual rent should be, then a number of landlords face the very real prospect of going bust. And then we have to be careful what we wish for because the purchasers of these assets in my opinion will likely have much shorter goals than the landlords they currently have. "" The fate of heavily indebted shopping centre owner, Intu, will be decided by Friday. It owns some of the UK's biggest and most popular malls, including the Trafford Centre and the Metrocentre in Gateshead. If it can't secure a last minute agreement with its lenders, it will go into administration which could mean the temporary closure of its sites.

Djokovic 'so sorry' after positive test,"On 18 June, Borna Coric (left), Grigor Dimitrov (second left), Novak Djokovic (second right) and Alexander Zverev played basketball in Zadar, Croatia. All apart from Zverev have since tested positive for coronavirus World number one Novak Djokovic said he is ""so sorry"" after becoming the latest tennis player to test positive for Covid-19. Grigor Dimitrov, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki all revealed they had coronavirus after playing at Djokovic's Adria Tour competition. Djokovic, 33, played fellow Serb Troicki in the first event in Belgrade. In a post on Twitter, Djokovic said it had been ""too soon"" to stage the tournament. ""I am so deeply sorry our tournament has caused harm,"" added Djokovic. He said the tournament had been organised with ""a pure heart"", ""good intentions"" and a belief that they had ""met all health protocols"". ""We were wrong and it was too soon,"" Djokovic said. The remaining Adria Tour events in Banja Luka and Sarajevo have now been cancelled Djokovic's brother Djordje, who is a director of the tournament, has confirmed. ""Unfortunately, due to all the events that happened in the last few days, we have decided that the most important thing right now is to stabilise the epidemiological situation, as well as for everyone to recover,"" he said. Britain's Andy Murray said the positive tests were a ""lesson for us"", while Australian Nick Kyrgios called playing a ""bone-headed decision"". A statement on Djokovic's website said: ""Immediately upon his arrival in Belgrade [after the second event] Novak was tested along with all members of the family and the team with whom he was in Belgrade and Zadar. He is not showing any symptoms."" Battle of the Brits - follow live coverage as Andy and Jamie Murray feature There have been no ATP Tour events since February because of the global pandemic and the Adria Tour, which is not an ATP Tour event, was one of the first competitions to be staged since then. The first leg in Serbia attracted 4,000 fans, and players were later pictured dancing close together in a Belgrade nightclub. Bulgaria's Dimitrov played Croatia's Coric on Saturday in the second leg in Zadar, Croatia. With Croatia easing lockdown measures, players were not obliged to observe social distancing rules and were seen embracing at the net at the end of their matches. Pictures on the tournament's social media site from Friday showed Dimitrov playing basketball with Djokovic, Alexander Zverev and Marin Cilic, while he also put his arm around Coric before their match. Djokovic and Dimitrov are among the tennis players to have tested positive for coronavirus. Zverev, Cilic and Andrey Rublev, who also played in the Adria Tour, have tested negative, but suggested they will all now self-isolate for up to 14 days. The ATP Tour season is set to restart on 14 August and the US Open will be held without fans from 31 August to 13 September, despite some players voicing concerns about travelling to New York. The moment we arrived in Belgrade we went to be tested. My result is positive, just as Jelena's, while the results of our children are negative. Everything we did in the past month, we did with a pure heart and sincere intentions. Our tournament was meant to unite and share a message of solidarity and compassion throughout the region. The Tour has been designed to help both established and up and coming tennis players from south-eastern Europe to gain access to some competitive tennis while the various tours are on hold due to Covid-19. It was born with a philanthropic idea, to direct all raised funds towards people in need and it warmed my heart to see how everybody strongly responded. We organised the tournament when the virus had weakened, believing the conditions for hosting the Tour had been met. Unfortunately, this virus is still present, and it is a new reality we are learning to cope and live with. I am hoping things will ease with time so we can all resume lives the way they were. I am extremely sorry for each individual case of infection. I hope it will not complicate anyone's health situation and everyone will be fine. I will remain in self-isolation for the next 14 days, and repeat the test in five days. Marianna Spring, Specialist disinformation and social media reporter Djokovic has been no stranger to coronavirus conspiracies throughout the pandemic. He revealed during a Facebook live in April that he opposes vaccinations. He said he ""wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine"", should that be necessary to travel and compete in tournaments. His comments fed into conspiracy theories about mandatory vaccinations that have been circulating on Facebook groups in recent weeks. That includes in one called ""Collective Action Against Bill Gates. We Wont Be Vaccinated!!"" - with over 160,000 members. The group, which promotes conspiracies about Bill Gates, praised Djokovic's comments and used them to justify false claims about vaccinations. A few days later, a video promoting conspiracy theories about 5G and coronavirus was shared by Djokovic's wife, Jelena. It was labelled by Instagram as false information.

Lockdown to be relaxed in England as 2m rule eased,"Pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers can open from 4 July in England, when social distancing rules will be eased. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should remain 2m apart where possible but a ""one metre plus"" rule would be introduced. Two households in England will also be able to meet indoors and stay overnight - with social distancing. The prime minister warned that all the steps were ""reversible"". The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said the relaxation represented a ""reasonable balance of risk"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford and Northern Ireland's Arlene Foster have said the 2m rule will remain in place in their nations for the time being. Theatres, cinemas, libraries, museums, theme parks and zoos are among other businesses that can also reopen. But indoor gyms, swimming pools, nail bars and indoor play areas will remain closed for the moment, as they have been since lockdown started on 23 March. During the government's final daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Johnson said ""task forces"" were being established to work out how they too could reopen. Lifting lockdown: All you need to know 'There will be a shortage of holiday cottages' Hairdresser: 'We've built a waiting list of over 2,000 people' The meeting of households will not be exclusive so, for example, one set of grandparents could see their relatives one weekend, and the other set of grandparents the next. But, unlikethe bubble system, people will have to maintain social distance - so family members who live apart will not be able to hug. In a statement in the Commons earlier, Mr Johnson said people would be encouraged to use ""mitigation"" - such as face coverings and not sitting face-to-face - when less than 2m from each other but ""where it is possible to keep 2m apart, people should"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson is cheered as he announces English pubs can reopen from 4 July Prof Whitty warned ""we will get an uptick"" if people did not take such measures seriously. And Mr Johnson urged people to be vigilant, saying the virus ""wants to take advantage of our carelessness"". He said there would be local outbreaks in the future - and that he would not hesitate to reverse the changes at local or national level if the virus were to begin to run out of control. The venues listed as being able to reopen include: Pubs, bars and restaurantsbut only with a table service indoors, and owners will be asked to keep contact details of customers to help with contact tracing Hotels, holiday apartments, campsites and caravan parksbut shared facilities must be cleaned properly Theatres and music hallsbut they will not be allowed to hold live performances In other changesweddingswill be allowed to have 30 attendees, andplaces of worshipwill be allowed to hold services but singing will be banned Hair salonsandbarberswill be able to reopen but must have protective measures, such as visors, in place Libraries, community centresandbingo halls Cinemas,museumsandgalleries Funfairs, theme parks, adventure parks, amusement arcades, skating rinksandmodel villages Indoor attractions where animals are exhibited, such as atzoos,aquariums,farms,safari parksandwildlife centres The following places will remain closed by law Nightclubs and casinos Bowling alleys and indoor skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft-play Spas Nail bars and beauty salons Massage, tattoo and piercing parlours Indoor fitness and dance studios, and indoor gyms and sports venues/facilities - although Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden tweeted that ministers hope to be able to reopen gyms and leisure facilities in mid-July Swimming pools and water parks Exhibition or conference centres - other than for those who work for that venue. Read more detail on how lockdown measures are easing in England here. Responding to Mr Johnson's statement on Tuesday afternoon, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""I believe the government is trying to do the right thing and in that I support them"". He added he thought it was ""safe for some children to return to school"" after the PM said schools in Englandshould return in full in September. In Scotland,schools are aiming to reopenfull-time in August, in Walessome schools will resumefor just three weeks later this month, while Northern Irelandhas a 24 August targetfor full reopening. Restrictions have to lift at some point. The big question is whether the UK is moving too soon. The number of infections has fallen dramatically. There are now just over 1,000 new cases a day on average. That compares with an estimated 100,000 at the peak at the end of March - we don't know the exact figure because there was limited testing in place. Huge progress has, therefore, been made. But the number of infections is still significantly higher than other countries. France and Germany are seeing fewer than half the number of infections that the UK is (and Germany has a larger population), while Italy has fewer than a quarter. It is why there are plenty of experts, including former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, voicing concern that restrictions are easing too quickly. But, of course, not lifting them comes at a cost too - to the economy, to people's health and wellbeing and to wider society. At the end of the day, it is a finely balanced judgement call. We will only know whether it was the right one or not in the weeks and months to come. Current evidence suggests being 1m apart carries between two and 10 times the risk of being 2m apart,scientists advising the government have said.,external Under new guidance, the government wants people to keep 2m apart where they can. If not, to remain at least 1m apart while taking steps to reduce the risk of transmission. They include measures such as not sitting face-to-face, cutting the number of people in an enclosed space, or having hand-sanitiser available to use. Mr Johnson stressed that the government was not ""forcing"" people to limit their social contact through legislation, but was ""asking them to follow guidance"". Police would still be able to ""break up large and irresponsible gatherings"", he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Earlier, he said it was each nation's own responsibility to make their own lockdown restrictions but said all parts of the UK were now ""travelling in the same direction"". Scotland not yet ready to relax 2m distance rule NI pupils to follow 1m social distancing at schools Wales will only changed 2m rule 'when safe' The prime minister added he did not believe there was ""a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS"". A further 171 deaths were reported in the UK on Tuesday, taking the total to 42,927, while latest testing figures showed there were 874 new positive cases. According to the latest official figures, the R value for the UK  - the average number of people that one infected person passes the virus on to - is between 0.7 and 0.9. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, who also spoke at the briefing, said the public should not ""be fooled"" into thinking that the virus had ""gone away"". ""The disease is growing across the world,"" he said. Prof Whitty said he would be ""surprised and delighted if we weren't in this current situation through the winter and into next spring"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: ""This is not a return back to normal business, but it is a very big moment, and a step to a new normal. ""One important point to note though, as I understand it, the advice from the government will still be that people should work at home if they can."" By Alice Evans, BBC News Shop owner Rezia isn't optimistic that business will improve for him when other places re-open Brixton looks almost normal this afternoon. Plenty of the market stalls are open, there's a steady stream of shoppers, and blaring music is coming from several shops. So far, so Brixton. But the many boarded-up businesses down the backstreets of this buzzing south-London neighbourhood are a tell-tale sign of the effect lockdown has had on trade. Some local firms have welcomed the prime minister's news. The Duke of Edinburgh pub, for example, is busy making its huge beer garden Covid-secure, with staff ""really excited"" for their customers to return. The customers are similarly keen - the pub's booking website crashed minutes after the prime minister's announcement. But others aren't so enthused. Fabric shop owner Rezia (pictured above) is happy with the 2m rule being relaxed to 1m, but is convinced business will remain ""slow"" for him. It doesn't matter that more people will be out and about spending money - they are not going to buy fabric, he says, on their way home from the pub. Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said he was ""extremely pleased"" that pubs were reopening after a long hiatus. ""We are going to discuss the precise government proposals with our pub managers and staff before we comment further on the details."" UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said reopening was the best way to secure business and jobs - but warned that social distancing constraints would mean some businesses were unviable, and government support remained ""crucial"". Glenn Earlam, chief executive of David Lloyd gyms, said he was disappointed by the announcement, since preparations had been under way for the sector to reopen from 4 July. ""For the last three weeks we've been working on an awful lot of detail,"" he said. ""Everything from temperature checks of our members when they arrive at reception, to screens at reception, to hand sanitisation, to an extreme cleaning regime."" An instant online poll carried out by YouGov shortly after Mr Johnson's announcement suggested 64% of people supported the reopening of the specified sectors and 73% backed the decision to allow two households to meet indoors.

Why are there outbreaks in meat processing plants?,"Hundreds of workers have tested positive for coronavirus at meat processing plants and abattoirs. They include a chicken processing site in Anglesey, where more than 150 workers have become infected with Covid-19, and plants in Wrexham and West Yorkshire. There have also been major outbreaks in Germany, France, Spain and the US. Bev Clarkson from the union Unite, says: ""Unite has warned time and again that coronavirus outbreaks at meat processing factories throughout the UK were likely"". People get infected with coronavirus from droplets, which may be coughed, sneezed or exhaled by an infected person. The infection may come through close contact with the person or by touching infected surfaces. ""Factories and, in particular, indoor areas which are cold and damp, are perfect environments for coronavirus to linger and spread,"" according to Lawrence Young, Professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick. ""Virus-containing droplets from infected individuals are more likely to spread, settle and stay viable."" Smithfield pork plant: The untold story of America's biggest outbreak 2 Sisters Anglesey: 158 factory staff have coronavirus Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry Hundreds of abattoir workers test positive in Germany Another possible factor in these refrigerated workplaces is noisy machinery, which requires people to talk more loudly or shout, which can increase the spread of infected droplets. It is difficult to keep workers two metres apart when they are working on fast-moving production lines, and the absence of daylight may also help the virus to survive. ""When you have people standing right next to each other working heavily - because of course this is a difficult job - and breathing heavily, you have a chance for spreading virus from just one infected individual to many that are in close proximity,"" said Tara Smith, professor of epidemiology at Kent State University in Ohio. ""And then of course you have a chain of dominoes after that."" There is no evidence that the meat products themselves could be a source of Covid-19 infection at the plants. The Food Standards Agency said,externalit was very unlikely that you could catch coronavirus from food because that is not how it is known to be transmitted. It's not just conditions inside the plant that may be increasing the risk of coronavirus. ""Some of these factories have on-site or nearby accommodation where there are several people in each dormitory. They may be transported on a bus to the site of work, and they will be indoors together all day,"" said Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton. The Unite union says that while it represents many workers in the meat processing sector, plants often employ migrant workers who may not be entitled to full sick pay, so could lose money if they self-isolate after getting sick. The union says they often do not speak English as a first language and are worried about losing their jobs, so may be reluctant to raise concerns. The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) told Reality Check that most workers in its members' plants are full employees rather than agency staff. The government hasissued guidelines,externalon working safely in food manufacturing - including keeping workers at least two metres apart when possible. The BMPA has also issued guidance, including cleaning factories more often than usual, isolating staff who develop symptoms and staggering start times and break times. It also suggests providing additional personal protective equipment (PPE) such as visors, if available - staff in meat processing facilities usually wear PPE, but that does not necessarily include masks. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said the organisation had been advising on a number of outbreaks in factories, some of which involved meat processing. ""Where outbreaks occur, we are working closely with NHS Test and Trace to ensure appropriate testing and tracing of contacts, both within and outside of the workplace. Where required, mobile testing units are being deployed to ensure large workforces are tested promptly."" In Germany, the government is banning the outsourcing of abattoir staff - workers will have to be employed directly by the company. A source close to Defra in the UK told the BBC that another of the factors being looked at in Germany is the poor training and poor language skills of the mainly Eastern European workforce in the meat processing industry, which was preventing the rules being followed. A report from the Center for Disease Control,externalin the US has recommended slowing production lines, putting physical barriers between staff, making everybody wear face coverings and ensuring that nobody would lose money because of self-isolating.

LiveLiveCoronavirus - Two metres remains & schools to open fullyCurrent social distancing will remain in Scotland but will be reduced in England and a plan is being worked on to see schools open fully in August.Scotland,"Education Secretary John Swinney says if the virus continues to be suppressed schools will re-open fully from 11 August Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she has sought advice on the two metre rule and that will be delivered to her on 2 July Once she has looked at that she will consider making changes Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the House of Commons that the two metre guidance will change to ""one plus"" on 4 July Four more people - who had a positive test - have died with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours Ms Sturgeon points out that 21 people are currently in ICU, but that contrasts with 221 on 12 April Scotland's Chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith says antibody tests should not be offered ""on-demand"" BBC Scotland News That's all for today's live coverage. We'll be back early tomorrow with more on how the coronavirus crisis is impacting on Scotland.    Drinks giant Diageo is giving Â£4m to Scottish pubs struggling with the impact of coronavirus. The company, which makes Guinness and whisky, has announced the two-year Raise the Bar programme to help premises bring back customers as lockdown continues to be relaxed. It designed the scheme following a global survey of bar owners to identify what they need to reopen after lockdown. Their top priorities include hygiene measures, digital support and practical equipment to transform how their outlets will work. The programme will provide support to help pay for the physical equipment such as sanitiser dispenser units, medical-grade hand sanitiser and PPE. Pubs and bars will also be helped with online reservations, cashless systems, mobile bars and outdoor equipment. Boris Johnson concluded his final daily briefing by saying the UK is improving all the time at fighting the virus. From now on the UK government's televised briefingswill be given on an ""ad hoc"" basis to ""coincide with significant announcements"". He praises the public for their efforts and looks to the possibility of drugs being developed, with the UK ""playing a lead role"". And the PM says the NHS test and trace scheme could be a ""real game changer"" in the fight against coronavirus. He concludes: ""Although the virus is the same and just as dangerous as it was, we are now better at dealing with it. ""This virus is still out there. The only way to beat it is to stay alert, follow the guidance and save lives"". Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland So, what do pupils make of plans for a full-time return to classrooms in August? Brodie,11,from Linlithgow, says: ""I've missed my friends. It's easier working in school, where you're with partners helping out. Harry, 8,from Glasgow: ""It would be a bit strange to go back for just two days a week, plus it would be hard to social distance in my school, the corridors are quite short. Holly, 11,from Glasgow: ""I'm really excited about going back. I like the school environment, where everyone supports each other. Pearse, 13,from Paisley: ""It's better than going back in groups. I've missed my pals, it's been tough, but we've still been talking on social media. Meave, 10,from Paisley: ""I miss all of my friends. It's been hard doing the school work at home and it's weird not going out to school in the morning."" Unison Scotland has criticised Education Secretary John Swinney's announcement on the reopening of schools, describing it as ""a significant about turn"" which seems to be driven ""more by politics than by safety"". The union's Mike Kirby said the wellbeing of staff
and pupils ""must be paramount"". He added: ""Any return to school must be led by the
scientific evidence at that time and be dependent on crucial risk assessments
to ensure everyoneâs safety."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The
chief of pub chain Brewdog earlier described the UKâs response to Covid-19 as a âcase
study on how not to support a sector through a challengeâ. David
McDowall told Drivetime that aside from a lack of pace on recovery, the
hospitality sector also suffered from a lack of certainty and limited
communication from both Scottish and UK governments. While todayâs news from England that pubs could open from 4 July was welcome, he warned than 10 daysâ notice was not enough time. He added there was a âcrushing lack of
guidanceâ from both governments and his firm was not sure if it would make
it through the crisis at first. Mr McDowall said the company was âwaiting with bated breathâ
for news on pubs in Scotland. What impact could seeing our neighbours in England have a bit more freedom have on our psychology? Professor Stephen Reicher explains it all depends on the level of understanding of the strategy. He says the strategy in England is more risk-taking than in Scotland, where the focus is on driving down the number of cases more now to make it easier to reopen later. If people understand the Scottish approach more people will buy into it, he explains. The payoff for a bit more pain now is more freedom in the future, he adds, suggesting Scotland is the tortoise to England's hare. ""Let's see if the tortoise overtakes the hare."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Sir David King, the former UK government chief scientific adviser, is not too happy aboutplans to reopen English pubs and restaurantsin early July. ""You can't wear a mask when you're eating and drinking or even chatting away,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""If you reduce the distance to 1m in an enclosed space, with no fresh air, the risk to others is very severe indeed. Just one person shedding the virus in that area would create problems for quite a few people."" Sir David explains that it is crucial to keep an eye on the daily rate of infection and argues the current number of new cases in England is far too high to consider changing the distancing guidance. He also describes the NHS England test and trace programme as ""not fit for purpose"" - and stresses that it needs to improve significantly in order to allow any relaxation of public health advice. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland John Swinney
says he understands the frustrations of the business community that we are not
moving at a faster pace. However, the deputy first minister says
it is important to avoid a second wave. Mr Swinney confirms the first ministerâs statement tomorrow will provide
more clarity for businesses and allow them to plan. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Mr Swinney
explains he was more optimistic that a full-time return to school will be
possible than he was five weeks ago, when asked about the change in position. He says the
sustained nature of reduction in cases, particularly given the easing of
lockdown in the end of May, led to todayâs announcement. âWe should
hopefully see Covid even further in retreatâ by August, he adds. The education secretary says the decision was not swayed by the possibility of legal action against blended learning. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney Mitigating measures
to be put in place in schools will be looked at over the summer, John Swinney
tells Drivetime. While the
ambition is for all pupils to return full time in August, steps may need to be
taken to create a âsafety first environment,â the education secretary says. Options to
be looked at will include face coverings, Perspex barriers and testing of teachers. Mr Swinney
also highlighted the example in the Netherlands where no physical distancing
was required by pupils in primary schools, but staff were still expected to maintain
it. Scottish schools are planning to reopen fully in August with no physical distancing if coronavirus is suppressed. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Sir Tom Hunter earlier said he liked aspects of the report drafted by Benny Higgins onrecommendations for Scotland's economic recovery. But the well-known businessman said there was not enough focus on entrepreneurship and said he had submitted his own ideas to the Scottish government, along with the offer of financial backing. Sir Tom told BBC Radio Scotland that the Higgins report was ""beginning to get realistic about what is ahead"" and he praised the proposal of a jobs guarantee for 16 to 25-year-olds. However, he added that Mr Higgins ""doesn't seem to have listened to the job creators"". Sir Tom's own suggestions are a list of ""things we can do
tomorrow"", with an emphasis on start-up businesses, which will need money and mentorship, which he said he was prepared to help fund. He said he was willing to put ""millions behind this"" but adds he is still waiting for a government reply six weeks on from delivering his document. Mr Flannagan says nobody should have to risk their lives when mitigating measures can be put in place. The use of face coverings by pupils must be looked at, he adds. Proactive testing of teachers must be looked at and perspex screens must be considered so schools remain safe places, says the general secretary of the EIS. ""We would need to be strongly persuaded that social distancing could be set aside in schools,"" Mr Flannagan tells Drivetime. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The general secretary of the EIS Larry Flannagan says it's a well caveated statement from Mr Swinney on the reopening of Schools. If Scotland's schools are able to reopen, Scotland's teachers will be as delighted as parents and pupils, he says. However it's seven weeks away and ""who knows exactly where we'll be"", adds the representative of Scotland's largest teachers' union. it's a mistake I  think to believe that the Covid virus has disappeared. I think its still very prevelant in our society. So we do need to be cautious. If schools are to reopen we do need to make sure that they do so in a way that continues to be safe for staff and pupils."" Larry Flannagan, The general secretary of the EIS Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The plan toreopen Scottish schools full-timewith no physical distancing in August is a huge boost for the economy, says Sir Tom Hunter. ""It's the best news I've heard in a long time,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. ""I kept saying the 2m rule is not going to last and (proposals for 'blended learning') were a waste of time. ""It will have a huge effect on our children's education and a huge effect on our economy since parents will be able to get back to work."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Eileen
Prior from parents group Connect says safety of staff and children will be most
important in getting pupils back to school in August. She
also said there needed to be some thought given to children who will not be
able to return, where schools and local authorities must work with families. Overall,
she said todayâs announcement was âgood news because parents have been listened
to."" As an organisation, we felt parents' voices have been pretty well ignored throughout the last three months as the recovery group has been working away, coming up with plans which would have meant many families simply could not have returned to work, couldnât have returned to any kind of normal life, and would have ended up with many parents having to make a choice between working and staying home to look after their children.""

Scottish schools aim to reopen full-time in AugustScottish schools are planning to reopen fully in August with no physical distancing if coronavirus is suppressed.Scotland politicsComments,"Scottish schools are aiming to reopen full-time with no physical distancing in August if coronavirus continues to be suppressed, John Swinney has said. Schools had been preparing to return with a ""blended"" model of face-to-face teaching and at-home learning. But the education secretary said ""significant progress"" had been made in controlling the spread of the virus. Mr Swinney said ministers were now preparing for all schools to open full-time in August. He had previously targeted having pupils spend at least half their time physically in the classroom, leading to concerns from parents. Opposition parties said the move was a ""u-turn"" and a ""climbdown"" which had been forced by public pressure. And union bosses said other measures would need to be put in place to keep staff and pupils safe, such as the use of face coverings and routine testing of teachers. Live: Watch Mr Swinney's statement to MSPs 'We will accept the risks for full-time school' Teachers urge caution over reopening of schools Schools have faced difficulty in working out how to bring pupils back in August while maintaining the current 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule, leading to the blended learning plans. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has ordered officials to review whether the distancing rule could be relaxed in some circumstances. Northern Ireland is set to usea 1m rule for school pupils, while England will move toa ""one metre plus"" rule from 4 July. Mr Swinney said the blended learning plan was a ""necessary"" contingency plan, drawn up a time when the outlook was ""bleak"" - but that ""the picture looks more positive"" now. He said: ""When we prepared our plans back in May I frankly would not have imagined we would have made as much progress in virus suppression as we have. ""It is this more positive outlook that allows the Scottish government to make this change in planning for schools."" Penni Brown is relieved at the announcement the aim is for full-time schooling in August Penni Brown from Edinburgh is ""so unbelievably relieved"" that the Scottish government is now planning to have all schools back full-time from August. She has five children, two of them dyslexic, and she had to give them a lot of support as online learning was too much for them. She told BBC Scotland: ""I was having to consider resigning from work under blended learning, as with five kids they would all be at school at different times. I felt passionately enough about it to fight for all of Scotland's children, not just my own. ""I don't believe the science justifies ""blended learning"" or social distancing amongst children. I think it may be suitable for teachers to remain socially distanced while allowing children to interact normally. ""My heart was breaking for only children and parents of special needs kids as well as many vulnerable families for whom this is pushing them over the edge."" John Swinney had previously said he wanted to see at least 50% of pupils' time spent physically in school Mr Swinney said full time schooling for all pupils was ""the aim the government is now working towards"", with no physical distancing rules to be enforced in classrooms. However, he stressed that this was strictly conditional on Covid-19 continuing to be suppressed and ""stringent"" safety measures being put in place for staff and pupils. And he said that blended learning may still have to be implemented if infection rates rise again, warning that ""there are no certainties with this virus"". The education secretary also announced an extra Â£100m of funding over two years to help children return to school and ""recover any lost ground"". And he said Â£30m would be spent on laptops for the 70,000 most disadvantaged pupils, amid concerns about the impact of home learning on the attainment gap. Just last Sunday, John Swinney said it was ""unlikely"" schools would return to normal within the coming school year. Today, he has told MSPs that they could return to normal - or something far more akin to it, with no physical distancing at all - within seven weeks. So in a little over a week there has been a remarkable change of tack from the government. It has certainly been enabled by the progress made in suppressing coronavirus, but a key factor will also have been the increasingly vocal concerns of parents - who during that same week were receiving letters from schools underscoring the reality of the ""blended"" learning model. But for all the opposition talk of u-turns and climbdowns, what those parents will ultimately care about is what is actually delivered in classrooms come August. If Mr Swinney's vision of a return to normality can be delivered, the politics around it may largely be forgotten. Council umbrella body Cosla said the statement from Mr Swinney was ""a significant change in direction"". Spokesman Stephen McCabe said local authorities would ""work with the Scottish government, trade unions, parent organisations and children and young people representatives to consider the implications and practicalities of a full time return for pupils in August"". The EIS union said ""a great deal of work at school level has already gone into planning for a blended learning model"" and that there would need to be ""time to adjust plans and conduct revised risk assessments"". General secretary Larry Flanagan said there needed to be ""appropriate mitigations"" to protect staff and pupils, such as the use of face coverings, ""proactive"" testing of teachers and physical distancing between pupils and staff. While opposition parties broadly welcomed the move, they were critical of the government's handling of the issue. As recently as 14 June, Mr Swinney had said it was ""unlikely"" that schools could return to normal within the current school year, suggesting that the2021 exam diet may need to be pushed back. The Scottish Conservatives said the ""screeching u-turn"" had been forced on the government by ""relentless campaigning from all quarters"" and an ""outburst of anger from parents"". Education spokesman Jamie Greene said: ""The sad truth is that until now, recent events have exposed nothing but a complete vacuum of leadership in the handling of this issue."" Scottish Labour accused Mr Swinney of ""the mother and father of all ministerial climb-downs"", with education spokesman Iain Gray saying the government had produced ""a completely new plan at the last possible moment"".

Here is a quick roundup of the key updates: We've spent quite a bit of today updating you on the easing of coronavirus restrictions which will come into force in England on 4 July. But it's worth remembering that there are currently different lockdown rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and devolved governments are easing restrictions at a different rate to Westminster. For example, in England, where it is not possible to maintain the 2m social distancing rule, people should keep a distance of""one metre plus"" from 4 July.But in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the 2m ruleremains in placefor now.

Intu owns Lakeside in Essex and the Trafford Centre in Manchester among others. It has appointed administrators KPMG as a ""contingency"" in case financial restructuring talks with lenders fail - but only has until Friday to sort out a new financial footing. If that happens, its says, ""there is a risk that centres may have to close for a period"". Margaret completing her fundraising effort In Scotland, a 90-year-old woman has completed a two-month-long fundraising challenge that saw her climb a mountain -from the comfort of her own home. Margaret Payne has climbed the equivalent of Highland mountain Suilven - 731m (2,398ft) - with trips upstairs at her Sutherland home. Mrs Payne, from Ardvar, first climbed Suilven, in the west of Sutherland at the age of 15 in 1944. Her challenge started on 12 April and took almost 300 trips to complete. Inspired by the fundraising efforts of war veteran Captain Tom Moore, she has achieved more than Â£347,000 for the NHS, Highland Hospice and Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). From 4 July, friends and families can be reunited, people can enjoy a pint at the pub or a meal in a restaurant - or even a stay-cation - as part of an easing to England's coronavirus lockdown. The 2m social distancing rule has been changed so that if it's not possible to maintain this a ""one metre plus"" space will be acceptable if certain precautions are taken such as the use of face coverings. Under the changes, two households of any size will be permitted to meet in any setting - inside or out - and can stay overnight. People will also be able to enjoy a taste of life's bigger moments, withweddings of up to 30 people permitted in Englandfrom early July. They had been banned under almost all circumstances since lockdown began on 23 March. After three months of binge-watching boxsets from the sofa, people craving something different will alsobe able to go to the cinema,with top UK cinema chain Showcase opening on 4 July and Vue, Cineworld and Picturehouse reopening on 10 July. But the cinema experience will be different, with new safety measures such as limited numbers in each screen, socially distanced seating for those from different households and staggered start and finished times to avoid congestion in foyers. The mega-church in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Donald Trump is due to speak later today has been criticised for claiming that its air filtration system takes ""particulants"" out of the air so that ""Covid cannot live in that environment"". ""So when you come into our auditorium, 99% of Covid is gone, killed, if it was there in the first place,"" Dream City Church pastor Luke Barnett said in a video posted on Twitter on Monday. ""You can know when you come here, you'll be safe and protected. Thank God for great technology and thank God for being proactive."" Numerous health experts say that although a filter will help clean the air, it does not prevent the spread of the virus on surfaces or the ongoing emission of potentially virus-contaminated respiratory droplets from attendees via coughs and sneezes. The mayor of Phoenix has criticised the event for going ahead at all, saying the city has neither ""sanctioned nor permitted"" it to happen. The 3,000 young people whom Trump will be addressing will comply with the Phoenix city ordinance passed on Friday requiring masks in crowded places, a Students for Trump spokesman told the Arizona Republic newspaper. EU officials are considering who to allow into the union from 1 July, and Americans may not be accepted,according to draft lists seen by the New York Times newspaper,external. Their assessment is to be based on how travellers' countries of origin are tackling the pandemic, the newspaper reports. The lists - supplied by EU officials anonymously - are also said to include China, Russia and Brazil. The US currently has the world's largest number of cases with more than 2.3 million reported and more than 120,000 deaths, according to figures collated byJohns Hopkins University,external. Earlier, a top US health official, Dr Anthony Fauci, told Congress that the US response was a ""mixed bag"" due to the nation's diversity, and that some states were now ""seeing a disturbing surge of infection"". US travellers have been banned from entering the union since mid-March when lockdowns were imposed on most of the continent. Two more members of the Trump campaign have tested positive for coronavirus days after his rally on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It comes after six members of his team tested positive hours before the event. ""After another round of testing for campaign staff in Tulsa, two additional members of the advance team tested positive for the coronavirus,"" campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. ""These staff members attended the rally but were wearing masks during the entire event. Upon the positive tests, the campaign immediately activated established quarantine and contact tracing protocols."" Trump was criticised for holding the rally amidst the pandemic, and attendees had to sign waivers saying they accepted the risk of contracting Covid-19 at the event. Today, Trump will be speaking at a mega-church in Arizona. Mark EastonHome editor An instant online poll in the hours immediately after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement on easing the lockdown in England suggests people are generally supportive of the changes. Pollsters YouGov asked 2,200 people adults for their reaction. On reopening pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, cinemas and other venues â 64% say they think it is a good idea, with 29% reckoning it is too soon. There was a similar broad agreement with the plan to allow two households to meet indoors - 73% support the change with just 20% opposing the idea. The snap survey suggests the governmentâs lockdown escape plans have the backing of voters, but there is still a significant minority of people who are concerned that ministers are easing the restrictions too quickly. Just over a third of people in the poll (37%) think the changes go too far. Just under half (47%) believe ministers have got the balance about right and just 7% say the changes donât go far enough. Reality Check Cleaners disinfect the area around the Kaaba in Mecca's Grand Mosque in this 24 April file photo Saudi Arabia won't be allowing foreign visitors to make the annual Islamic pilgrimage, or Hajj, this year because of the risk of coronavirus. So who's likely to be most affected? People normally come from around the world to visit Mecca. But this year, the Saudi authorities say the only non-Saudi pilgrims who can take part are those normally resident in the Kingdom. In 2019, there were a total of 2.49 million pilgrims at the Hajj out of whom 1.8 million were international visitors, according to official Saudi statistics. And the data shows that the number of pilgrims coming from non-Arab countries in Africa and Asia has been growing in the last few years. Each country is normally allocated a specific quota for the Hajj, based on the size of its Muslim population, with Indonesia having the largest number, followed by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Egypt. These countries have all seen increases in coronavirus cases during May and early June, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in particular are reporting large numbers of new cases daily. You can read more on how coronavirus is spreading across the worldhere.   President Vladimir Putin says he will increase taxes for wealthy Russian citizens as the country tackles the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In a televised address to the nation today, Putin proposed an increase in the annual rate of income tax from
13% to 15% on earnings above five million roubles (Â£58,228; $72,833). It will be the first time that Russia will have increased the rate since a flat tax rate was introduced in 2001. The president, whose approval rating has fallen to an all-time low, said the changes would add an extra 60 billion roubles to the budget and could come into effect on 1 January 2021. There are currently almost 600,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Russia, and 8,349 reported deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

It says the  guidelines offer a blueprint to specific groups, from parents to teachers to industry to children themselves to help protect children from cyber-crime and from sexual exploitation. Children are online at an ever younger age, and parents find it increasingly challenging to supervise their access: where families once shared a household computer, now everyone has their own smartphones, tablets and laptops. The new ITU guidelines offer information to teachers and parents on firewalls and filtering, to children on what to do if they view things online that make them uncomfortable, and to industry on incorporating childrenâs rights and child protection into all their company operations.  Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson gave the first of the daily updates on 16 March. It feels like a different era. The prime minister had already warned that some people would
lose loved ones before their time. Itâs unlikely he was anticipating being in ICU himself
the following month. But now just as the nation ""emerges from
hibernation"", government ministers are withdrawing from daily public view, although ""significant announcements"" will still be subject to
media scrutiny. Today, the scientists seemed absolutely determined not to go out on a
high. Sir Patrick Vallance stressed infections were not down to
zero. The virus has not gone away â and most of the nation is
still susceptible to it. Chris Whitty still advised people to stay 2m apart in
England, where possible, and reminded us we could be living with the virus until
this time next year, so some restrictions may have to return. And this is the political risk for the prime minister. Boris Johnson said today he takes responsibility for his
decisions. While he will get plaudits for restarting the economy, if, subsequently, he does ""have to apply the handbrake
and reverse"" (and just imagine the screeching noise your car would make
if you did that) his handling of the pandemic will come under even greater
scrutiny. Even without daily
press conferences. Reality Check The prime minister was asked by Christine in Lincoln about coronavirus outbreaks in meat processing factories. She wanted to know why this was happening and what was being done to protect the public from âcontaminated meatâ. The governmentâs chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the environment in meat processing factories âis a difficult oneâ because it is cold, it is difficult to keep workers apart, it is noisy so people may have to shout and there are communal areas where people gather. On the question of whether the meat itself could be a âvectorâ â or way of transmitting Covid-19 â he passed on the judgement of the Food Standards Agency that this risk is âvery lowâ. You can read more about the factors helping spread coronavirus in meat processing plants in the UK and in other countrieshere. Continuing his testimony to congress, top US disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci says that he is âcautiously optimisticâ a vaccine may be ready by the end of 2020. He said it is a matter of âwhen and not ifâ the vaccine is ready, but added that it ""might take some time"". Drug company Moderna has plans âto launch a Phase 3 clinical trial as early as July 2020, pending positive results from this Phase 2 trial,â Fauci added. He added that it is crucially important that Americans get a flu jab this year. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield also called on Americans to ""embrace flu vaccinations with confidence"". ""This single act will save lives,"" he said. Today marked the end of the daily government press conferences. From now on, the government says it will only hold a briefing when it has something to announce. Today's conference was held by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Here's what they told us: Reality Check It has now been a month since the government last announced how many individuals are being tested every day. Instead, they are only releasing numbers for the number of tests delivered. This matters, because the number of tests data includes people who may have been swabbed twice as well as tests sent in the post but not necessarily returned. The result is that the number of tests is far higher than the number of people tested. For example, as of 22 May â the last date we had the statistics â the numbers showed that 3.2m tests had been done or sent out, but only 2.1m people individuals had actually been tested. The UK Statistics Authority has previously criticised the government for their use of testing statistics. The Department of Health and Social Care has previously said that the release of the number was âtemporarily paused"" because of problems with double counting in the data. Boris Johnson concludes this final daily briefing by saying the UK is improving all the time at fighting the virus. He praises the public for their efforts and looks to the possibility of drugs being developed, with the UK ""playing a lead role"". And the PM says the NHS test and trace scheme could be a ""real game changer"" in the fight against coronavirus. He concludes: ""Although the virus is the same and just as dangerous as it was, we are now better at dealing with it. ""This virus is still out there. The only way to beat it is to stay alert, follow the guidance and save lives"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Pubs fear new rules won't save them,"It's the moment we've all been waiting for. The government is expected to announce measures that will allow pubs, restaurants, cinemas, galleries and theatres to re-open under relaxed but still constraining rules on the 4th of July. It's not quite social Independence Day, but the expected announcement that social distancing measures that require two metres distance in most settings will be relaxed to one metre has been welcomed by the hospitality industry as ""an important staging post"". It's ""a helpful moment for the national psyche"", according to Kate Nicholls, head of the trade group UK Hospitality. But the champagne is still on ice. And could yet be put back in the economic refrigerator. Pubs in the UK are among hospitality businesses that have been closed for months ""We are only able to move forward this week because the vast majority of people have taken steps to control the virus,"" a number 10 spokesman told the BBC. ""But the more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. We will not hesitate to reverse these steps if it is necessary to stop the virus running out of control."" Many establishments are straining at the leash to re-open. Peter Borg-Neal, who runs 28 pubs has already provocatively said he intends to re-open on 4 July whether or not the government gives him the green light. Others are less gung ho. Several pubs and restaurants have told me they do not see the point of re-opening even under one metre distancing rules as it will be impossible to police and the business would still lose money. That's the supply side of the equation - the other side is demand. Most of us want to go out for a drink or a meal or a film but how many would actually step through the door? Recent polling by Ipsos Mori found that six out of 10 people would feel uncomfortable returning to a pub or restaurant. Some operators feel that the government's re-opening guidelines - that are expected to accompany tomorrow's announcement - may be counter-productive.  3rdlargest UK employer in 2018 3.2 millionworkers in the sector 99%of hospitality businesses are SMEs Â£130bnannual turnover in 2018 67%expect it will be ""months"" before going to a restaurant ""Single use menus, banning condiments, insisting on mask wearing - you are making people afraid of using a pepper pot. We have to persuade people there is nothing to fear,"" said Jonathan Downey, head of street food venue operator London Union and head of lobbying group Hospitality Union. There are other major concerns. Once people have had a few drinks, who will police the social distancing measures that are expected in the guidelines,  even at one metre. ""To think that a young bar tender could do that is nuts"" said one pub owner. And what about the legal position? Could a hospitality venue owner be sued if someone contracted the virus and blamed the management for a potentially life-threatening condition? On this point there is good and bad news for the industry, according to Kate Nicholls, head of Hospitality UK. The bad news for venues is that no insurer will touch that risk with a barge pole. The good news is that it will be almost impossible to establish whether the virus was in fact contracted on the premises. Going to the pub will be entirely at the pub-goers risk. But not opening hospitality venues will represent a grave risk to the economy and up to 3 million jobs. Everyone wants the semblance of normality that a further easing of social lockdown measures will bring. But as the government has made clear, if things don't go to plan and the virus sees another surge it may be too soon to pull up all those two metre distancing tapes on the floor and call time on this health, social and economic menace.

'There will be a shortage of holiday cottages',"As English hotels and other forms of accommodation prepare to reopen on 4 July, there is a ""frenzy"" of appetite for holidays, says one listings site. Sarah and Steve Jarvis, who run theIndependent Cottages,externalwebsite, say traffic in the past week has been 150% up on the same time last year. ""We're very excited and very busy,"" said Steve, adding that the lifting of restrictions on Tuesday was ""very welcome news"". But he added that not all holidaymakers will get the accommodation they want. ""There will be a shortage of holiday cottages,"" he told the BBC. ""There are forward bookings to be honoured and there will be fewer properties available."" Independent Cottages has more than 1,800 properties on its books, with more than 1,500 of them in England. Unlike online travel agents, it does not take a percentage on bookings, but charges an annual listing fee and allows property owners to deal directly with holidaymakers. Sarah and Steve Jarvis say demand for cottages is high Sarah said travel industry guidelines on coronavirus allowed holiday lets to cope with back-to-back bookings. However, some holiday cottage owners were opting to leave two to three days between bookings to allow for thorough cleaning, further constraining the supply of accommodation. ""There's a lot to clean,"" she said. ""It's all very achievable, but some owners will feel that they want to leave a gap."" One issue that is still unclear is the question of accommodation for stag and hen parties and other mass gatherings. Such occasions can bring together as many as 18 to 20 people from different households, all using shared areas. ""We're being asked about this a lot,"" said Sarah. ""The 2m rule isn't much of an issue in a self-catering cottage. but we don't know how many households are allowed."" Self-catering accommodation is ideal for helping people ""ease back to a new normal"" as lockdown restrictions are lifted, says another holiday provider,holidaycottages.co.uk,external. The firm's chief marketing officer, James Starkey, welcomed the government's announcement, saying it gave would-be holidaymakers ""something to look forward to"". ""Self-catering accommodation by its very nature allows for natural social distancing, with people visiting holiday properties staying in self-contained units without having to use shared facilities,"" he said. ""Our owners already adhere to high standards of cleaning, but all have now been provided with additional information on cleaning best practice for before and after a stay."" Hotels, too, are busy preparing to open their doors to guests on 4 July. Accor, which operates 270 hotels in the UK, says it will be reopening them gradually. It hopes to have 90% of them back in business by the end of August. Those booking in will see plenty of changes. Restaurants and bars will be serving food and drink on a ""grab-and-go"" basis, while fridges in the rooms will not contain any mini-bar items. Every other room will be unoccupied and rooms will be left empty for 24 hours after a guest checks out. Thomas Dubaere, Accor's chief operating officer for Northern Europe, told the BBC Accor had been able to test its safety measures in other countries which had already eased lockdown. He said guests were comfortable with the measures ""as long as we keep good service and a friendly smile"". ""They still get the service. It's just in a different way for the time being,"" he added. Mr Dubaere welcomed the government's moves to allow hotels to reopen. ""We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said. Domestic tourism will now most likely be operational in some form in all parts of the UK by 15 July - starting with self-catering in Northern Ireland from Friday. Holidaymakers will still have some concerns, not least the possibility of a local or national spike in coronavirus cases over the summer. Any new lockdown would mean a return to the refund or rebooking rights currently in place. That gets more complicated if you are told, under the test and trace system, to self-isolate. Any refund rights would be subject to the terms and conditions when you book. The traditional backstop of insurance (albeit less common among domestic travellers) may not help, unless you bought your policy months ago. Coronavirus is no longer an unknown event, so anyone buying travel insurance now is unlikely to be covered for any coronavirus-related delays or cancellations. Self-catering holiday accommodation will open again on Friday in Northern Ireland, and hotels will follow on 3 July. A decision will be taken in Wales on 9 July on whether to open up the country to tourists again. If this is given the go-ahead, it's likely to take effect from 13 July. The Scottish government has said that hotels and tourist accommodation may be able to reopen from 15 July at the earliest, if its next review of lockdown restrictions on 9 July decides that conditions are favourable. UK Hospitality, which represents hotels and accommodation as well as other areas of the hospitality sector, said it greeted the government's relaxation of the lockdown restrictions in England ""with relief and praise"". ""The government has given due recognition to how hard hospitality has been hit by this crisis,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""Our sector was one of the first to be seriously affected and we are going to be one of the last to reopen."" However, she added that government support would remain crucial. ""Many businesses have been closed for months with no revenue and are now facing substantial rent and PAYE bills,"" she said. ""We need financial help from the government, otherwise some of these businesses are going to go under right at the point at which they are allowed to open once again."" Abta, the travel association, described the latest measures in England as ""a step in the right direction on the road to restarting travel in earnest"". ""However, the travel sector remains in a perilous state, with redundancies announced each week, and more needs to be done to help the whole sector recover,"" it added. ""We need a more comprehensive roadmap as soon as possible that includes timeframes for relaxing international travel restrictions too, so businesses and customers can plan ahead.""

"Lockdown to be relaxed in England as 2m rule easedTwo households will be able to meet, and pubs, restaurants and hairdressers can reopen from 4 July.","Pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers can open from 4 July in England, when social distancing rules will be eased. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should remain 2m apart where possible but a ""one metre plus"" rule would be introduced. Two households in England will also be able to meet indoors and stay overnight - with social distancing. The prime minister warned that all the steps were ""reversible"". The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said the relaxation represented a ""reasonable balance of risk"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford and Northern Ireland's Arlene Foster have said the 2m rule will remain in place in their nations for the time being. Theatres, cinemas, libraries, museums, theme parks and zoos are among other businesses that can also reopen. But indoor gyms, swimming pools, nail bars and indoor play areas will remain closed for the moment, as they have been since lockdown started on 23 March. During the government's final daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Johnson said ""task forces"" were being established to work out how they too could reopen. Lifting lockdown: All you need to know 'There will be a shortage of holiday cottages' Hairdresser: 'We've built a waiting list of over 2,000 people' The meeting of households will not be exclusive so, for example, one set of grandparents could see their relatives one weekend, and the other set of grandparents the next. But, unlikethe bubble system, people will have to maintain social distance - so family members who live apart will not be able to hug. In a statement in the Commons earlier, Mr Johnson said people would be encouraged to use ""mitigation"" - such as face coverings and not sitting face-to-face - when less than 2m from each other but ""where it is possible to keep 2m apart, people should"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson is cheered as he announces English pubs can reopen from 4 July Prof Whitty warned ""we will get an uptick"" if people did not take such measures seriously. And Mr Johnson urged people to be vigilant, saying the virus ""wants to take advantage of our carelessness"". He said there would be local outbreaks in the future - and that he would not hesitate to reverse the changes at local or national level if the virus were to begin to run out of control. The venues listed as being able to reopen include: Pubs, bars and restaurantsbut only with a table service indoors, and owners will be asked to keep contact details of customers to help with contact tracing Hotels, holiday apartments, campsites and caravan parksbut shared facilities must be cleaned properly Theatres and music hallsbut they will not be allowed to hold live performances In other changesweddingswill be allowed to have 30 attendees, andplaces of worshipwill be allowed to hold services but singing will be banned Hair salonsandbarberswill be able to reopen but must have protective measures, such as visors, in place Libraries, community centresandbingo halls Cinemas,museumsandgalleries Funfairs, theme parks, adventure parks, amusement arcades, skating rinksandmodel villages Indoor attractions where animals are exhibited, such as atzoos,aquariums,farms,safari parksandwildlife centres The following places will remain closed by law Nightclubs and casinos Bowling alleys and indoor skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft-play Spas Nail bars and beauty salons Massage, tattoo and piercing parlours Indoor fitness and dance studios, and indoor gyms and sports venues/facilities - although Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden tweeted that ministers hope to be able to reopen gyms and leisure facilities in mid-July Swimming pools and water parks Exhibition or conference centres - other than for those who work for that venue. Read more detail on how lockdown measures are easing in England here. Responding to Mr Johnson's statement on Tuesday afternoon, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""I believe the government is trying to do the right thing and in that I support them"". He added he thought it was ""safe for some children to return to school"" after the PM said schools in Englandshould return in full in September. In Scotland,schools are aiming to reopenfull-time in August, in Walessome schools will resumefor just three weeks later this month, while Northern Irelandhas a 24 August targetfor full reopening. Restrictions have to lift at some point. The big question is whether the UK is moving too soon. The number of infections has fallen dramatically. There are now just over 1,000 new cases a day on average. That compares with an estimated 100,000 at the peak at the end of March - we don't know the exact figure because there was limited testing in place. Huge progress has, therefore, been made. But the number of infections is still significantly higher than other countries. France and Germany are seeing fewer than half the number of infections that the UK is (and Germany has a larger population), while Italy has fewer than a quarter. It is why there are plenty of experts, including former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, voicing concern that restrictions are easing too quickly. But, of course, not lifting them comes at a cost too - to the economy, to people's health and wellbeing and to wider society. At the end of the day, it is a finely balanced judgement call. We will only know whether it was the right one or not in the weeks and months to come. Current evidence suggests being 1m apart carries between two and 10 times the risk of being 2m apart,scientists advising the government have said.,external Under new guidance, the government wants people to keep 2m apart where they can. If not, to remain at least 1m apart while taking steps to reduce the risk of transmission. They include measures such as not sitting face-to-face, cutting the number of people in an enclosed space, or having hand-sanitiser available to use. Mr Johnson stressed that the government was not ""forcing"" people to limit their social contact through legislation, but was ""asking them to follow guidance"". Police would still be able to ""break up large and irresponsible gatherings"", he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Earlier, he said it was each nation's own responsibility to make their own lockdown restrictions but said all parts of the UK were now ""travelling in the same direction"". Scotland not yet ready to relax 2m distance rule NI pupils to follow 1m social distancing at schools Wales will only changed 2m rule 'when safe' The prime minister added he did not believe there was ""a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS"". A further 171 deaths were reported in the UK on Tuesday, taking the total to 42,927, while latest testing figures showed there were 874 new positive cases. According to the latest official figures, the R value for the UK  - the average number of people that one infected person passes the virus on to - is between 0.7 and 0.9. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, who also spoke at the briefing, said the public should not ""be fooled"" into thinking that the virus had ""gone away"". ""The disease is growing across the world,"" he said. Prof Whitty said he would be ""surprised and delighted if we weren't in this current situation through the winter and into next spring"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: ""This is not a return back to normal business, but it is a very big moment, and a step to a new normal. ""One important point to note though, as I understand it, the advice from the government will still be that people should work at home if they can."" By Alice Evans, BBC News Shop owner Rezia isn't optimistic that business will improve for him when other places re-open Brixton looks almost normal this afternoon. Plenty of the market stalls are open, there's a steady stream of shoppers, and blaring music is coming from several shops. So far, so Brixton. But the many boarded-up businesses down the backstreets of this buzzing south-London neighbourhood are a tell-tale sign of the effect lockdown has had on trade. Some local firms have welcomed the prime minister's news. The Duke of Edinburgh pub, for example, is busy making its huge beer garden Covid-secure, with staff ""really excited"" for their customers to return. The customers are similarly keen - the pub's booking website crashed minutes after the prime minister's announcement. But others aren't so enthused. Fabric shop owner Rezia (pictured above) is happy with the 2m rule being relaxed to 1m, but is convinced business will remain ""slow"" for him. It doesn't matter that more people will be out and about spending money - they are not going to buy fabric, he says, on their way home from the pub. Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said he was ""extremely pleased"" that pubs were reopening after a long hiatus. ""We are going to discuss the precise government proposals with our pub managers and staff before we comment further on the details."" UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said reopening was the best way to secure business and jobs - but warned that social distancing constraints would mean some businesses were unviable, and government support remained ""crucial"". Glenn Earlam, chief executive of David Lloyd gyms, said he was disappointed by the announcement, since preparations had been under way for the sector to reopen from 4 July. ""For the last three weeks we've been working on an awful lot of detail,"" he said. ""Everything from temperature checks of our members when they arrive at reception, to screens at reception, to hand sanitisation, to an extreme cleaning regime."" An instant online poll carried out by YouGov shortly after Mr Johnson's announcement suggested 64% of people supported the reopening of the specified sectors and 73% backed the decision to allow two households to meet indoors.

Facebook bans 'loot-to-order' antiquities trade,"Facebook has banned users trading in historical artefacts on the site. It follows a campaign by academic researchers andan investigation by BBC News, exposing how items looted from Iraq and Syria were sold on Facebook. One expert welcomed the move but said for anything to change, Facebook should invest in ""teams of experts to identify and remove networks rather than playing whack-a-mole with individual posts"". Facebook says all trade in ancient artefacts is banned on its platforms. The changes are included in a new set of Facebook Community Standards published on Tuesday. They ban content that ""encourages or attempts to buy, sell or trade historical artefacts"" or ""attempts to solicit historical artefacts"". Items sold in this way can include ancient scrolls, manuscripts, mummified body parts and ancient coins. The BBC was shown private Facebook groups offering antiquities for sale in Syria and Iraq Facebook public policy manager Greg Mandel explained: ""Historical artefacts hold significant personal and cultural value for communities across the globe, but their sale often results in harmful behaviour. ""That's why we've long had rules preventing the sale of stolen artefacts. ""To keep these artefacts and our users safe, we've been working to expand our rules, and starting today we now prohibit the exchange, sale or purchase of all historical artefacts on Facebook and Instagram."" Prof Amr al-Azm, from Shawnee State University in Ohio, hailed the move as an important shift in Facebook's position but said he feared the new standards would prove worthless without adequate efforts to enforce them. The social media giant is developing automated systems based on images and key words to identify content which violates the new policy but Prof Al-Azm told the BBC: ""Relying on user reports and Artificial Intelligence is simply not enough."" Prof Amr al-Azm says it is not enough for Facebook just to ban trading networks - they need to be identified and removed A BBC News investigation in 2019 found evidence that Roman mosaics still in the ground in Syria were being offered for sale on Facebook. 'Loot-to-order' antiquities sold on Facebook Saving Syria's heritage with an invisible solution We saw groups exchange ideas on how to dig up sites and evidence of ""loot-to-order"" requests. In one case, administrators asked for Islamic-era manuscripts to be made available for purchase in Turkey. Following our investigation, Facebook said it had removed 49 groups - but researchers continue to unearth evidence that trade is still ongoing. ""Illicit antiquities trade on Facebook appears to have the greatest reach in the Middle East and North Africa where we are currently monitoring over 120 Facebook groups developed solely for looting and trafficking activity,"" said Prof Amr Al-Azm ""The largest group we identified had roughly 150,000 members this time last year - now it has more than 437,000. "" Part of the recent increase may be attributable to the effects of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But this was not just a case of the impoverished selling antiquities to make a few dollars, said Prof al-Azm. ""This is also a black market that funds criminal organisations, warlords, and radical extremists, and it's happening on the same site in the same digital space that you welcome into your home and [use to] share photos of your children."" Prof al-Azm is critical of Facebook's policy of deleting posts that violate its community standards. Instead, he said, it should keep a digital archive of images, which might not exist anywhere else. ""This evidence is vital for ensuring the repatriation of these objects if they appear on the market,"" he argued. Usually, content that violates Facebook standards is permanently deleted within 90 days but data can be retained if requested by law enforcement, the BBC understands. .

Djokovic tests positive for Covid-19,"On 18 June, Borna Coric (left), Grigor Dimitrov (second left), Novak Djokovic (second right) and Alexander Zverev played basketball in Zadar, Croatia. All apart from Zverev have since tested positive for coronavirus World number one Novak Djokovic said he is ""so sorry"" after becoming the latest tennis player to test positive for Covid-19. Grigor Dimitrov, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki all revealed they had coronavirus after playing at Djokovic's Adria Tour competition. Djokovic, 33, played fellow Serb Troicki in the first event in Belgrade. In a post on Twitter, Djokovic said it had been ""too soon"" to stage the tournament. ""I am so deeply sorry our tournament has caused harm,"" added Djokovic. He said the tournament had been organised with ""a pure heart"", ""good intentions"" and a belief that they had ""met all health protocols"". ""We were wrong and it was too soon,"" Djokovic said. The remaining Adria Tour events in Banja Luka and Sarajevo have now been cancelled Djokovic's brother Djordje, who is a director of the tournament, has confirmed. ""Unfortunately, due to all the events that happened in the last few days, we have decided that the most important thing right now is to stabilise the epidemiological situation, as well as for everyone to recover,"" he said. Britain's Andy Murray said the positive tests were a ""lesson for us"", while Australian Nick Kyrgios called playing a ""bone-headed decision"". A statement on Djokovic's website said: ""Immediately upon his arrival in Belgrade [after the second event] Novak was tested along with all members of the family and the team with whom he was in Belgrade and Zadar. He is not showing any symptoms."" Battle of the Brits - follow live coverage as Andy and Jamie Murray feature There have been no ATP Tour events since February because of the global pandemic and the Adria Tour, which is not an ATP Tour event, was one of the first competitions to be staged since then. The first leg in Serbia attracted 4,000 fans, and players were later pictured dancing close together in a Belgrade nightclub. Bulgaria's Dimitrov played Croatia's Coric on Saturday in the second leg in Zadar, Croatia. With Croatia easing lockdown measures, players were not obliged to observe social distancing rules and were seen embracing at the net at the end of their matches. Pictures on the tournament's social media site from Friday showed Dimitrov playing basketball with Djokovic, Alexander Zverev and Marin Cilic, while he also put his arm around Coric before their match. Djokovic and Dimitrov are among the tennis players to have tested positive for coronavirus. Zverev, Cilic and Andrey Rublev, who also played in the Adria Tour, have tested negative, but suggested they will all now self-isolate for up to 14 days. The ATP Tour season is set to restart on 14 August and the US Open will be held without fans from 31 August to 13 September, despite some players voicing concerns about travelling to New York. The moment we arrived in Belgrade we went to be tested. My result is positive, just as Jelena's, while the results of our children are negative. Everything we did in the past month, we did with a pure heart and sincere intentions. Our tournament was meant to unite and share a message of solidarity and compassion throughout the region. The Tour has been designed to help both established and up and coming tennis players from south-eastern Europe to gain access to some competitive tennis while the various tours are on hold due to Covid-19. It was born with a philanthropic idea, to direct all raised funds towards people in need and it warmed my heart to see how everybody strongly responded. We organised the tournament when the virus had weakened, believing the conditions for hosting the Tour had been met. Unfortunately, this virus is still present, and it is a new reality we are learning to cope and live with. I am hoping things will ease with time so we can all resume lives the way they were. I am extremely sorry for each individual case of infection. I hope it will not complicate anyone's health situation and everyone will be fine. I will remain in self-isolation for the next 14 days, and repeat the test in five days. Marianna Spring, Specialist disinformation and social media reporter Djokovic has been no stranger to coronavirus conspiracies throughout the pandemic. He revealed during a Facebook live in April that he opposes vaccinations. He said he ""wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine"", should that be necessary to travel and compete in tournaments. His comments fed into conspiracy theories about mandatory vaccinations that have been circulating on Facebook groups in recent weeks. That includes in one called ""Collective Action Against Bill Gates. We Wont Be Vaccinated!!"" - with over 160,000 members. The group, which promotes conspiracies about Bill Gates, praised Djokovic's comments and used them to justify false claims about vaccinations. A few days later, a video promoting conspiracy theories about 5G and coronavirus was shared by Djokovic's wife, Jelena. It was labelled by Instagram as false information.

'Iâm anxious about reopening',"Lindsey Holland does all the cooking for guests at her B&B This year, 4 July will hold a different kind of celebration as a range of hospitality and similar firms in England are finally allowed to reopen for business. But with government guidance still not clear, how prepared are they? The BBC spoke to a pub, a salon and a B&B to find out how ready they are for the next phase of lockdown easing. ""I'm feeling really anxious about reopening as I just don't know what's coming."" Lindsey Holland runs the Cleeve Hill Hotel, a 12-bedroom B&B in Gloucestershire. She runs the business on her own and worries that reopening rules may make that impossible. ""I'm going to be really interested to see how much I'm going to be allowed to achieve by myself, when I have to switch from cooking to cleaning, for instance."" Many B&B staples will disappear, not least the buffet breakfast. ""I've heard that breakfasts may have to be delivered to rooms, which isn't practical for me as a one-person business. ""I also can't afford to buy room service trays."" Tourism sector 'will require long-term help' When will pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants reopen? Free magazines and the help-yourself minibar will also have to go. Lindsey reckons she will be able to open up three quarters of the hotel now the social distancing rule has been lowered from 2m to 1m. At 2m, she would only have been able to run at 50% capacity. However, she says if bookings don't pick up then it may not be worth her while opening the doors at all in July. ""4 July is just two weeks away and we're only now getting bits of pieces of details of what the rules may be. ""Even if I do reopen and we have enough bookings, a second wave could mean the end for us."" ""We've spent a lot of time during lockdown getting ready for the new normal."" Simon Daws has run the Gloucester Old Spot pub in Cheltenham for a decade, but recent times have been his biggest challenge, he says. Simon Daws runs the Gloucester Old Spot pub ""We've been waiting for news of when we can reopen with different dates being bandied around, which hasn't been helpful."" He says he would have preferred more than a couple of weeks of notice to get the right beer in and get staff back from furlough, but he is still eager to get people back into the pub. The pub industry is desperate to reopen and cutting the social distancing rules to 1m will have a major impact, he says. ""If the distance is 1m then pubs with generous garden areas can make a go of it,"" he says. His pub has room for 160 people outside but they've had to change things to prepare for reopening. ""We don't need plastic screens as people won't come into the pub. Instead we're switching to a continental style of service with our staff taking orders on a handheld device and using disposable menus to reduce the risk to customers,"" he says. Even then, he's not confident that reopening will be a success. ""We will be walking a tightrope. We are relying on sunny weather to make the new system work."" He is also worried about rumours that customers will have to book a table and supply the names of everyone on the table. ""It's just putting more hurdles in our way, which is not good news for an industry that's on its knees."" Jo Dyer runs Plymouth hairdressing salon Yoke with husband Steve, and will be able to reopen on 4 July. But the last few weeks have been nerve wracking. ""The guidelines keep changing so we don't know yet what we need to do to open safely - or what kind of protective equipment will be necessary."" Jo Dyer runs the Yoke hairdressing salon with husband Steve The salon plans to reopen with half of its eight stations to ensure clients remain a safe distance from each other. Opening hours will be extended to cover 08:00-20:00 every day except for Sunday to accommodate as many customers as possible, even with half as many stations and stylists available. Meanwhile clients will only have contact with one person, with stylists washing hair instead of apprentices. Now the reopening date has been confirmed, Jo hopes to start booking in appointments - although those wanting hair colouring will have to book in for a skin test first. They are waiting to find out what protective equipment they will need. ""We don't know what grade facemasks we've got to have or what kind of gloves we need, given we're washing our hands constantly in normal times. ""We have some cloth facemasks but they may not fit in with the guidelines."" Staff and customer safety will be paramount, she says, which means throwaway gowns instead of their normal eco-wear. ""It goes against our ethical principles, but we're going to have to compromise to stay within the rules, it seems,"" Jo says. Will your business be reopening on 4 July?

How Asia's biggest slum contained the coronavirus,"Night falls on Dharavi, home to more than 650,000 people In one of the world's most congested shanty towns, social distancing is not a luxury people can afford. And density is a friend of the coronavirus. Imagine more than 650,000 people spread over 2.5 grubby sq km, less than a square mile. That's a population larger than Manchester living in an area smaller than Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Eight to 10 people live together in poky 100 sq ft dwellings. About 80% of the residents use community toilets. Homes and factories coexist in single buildings lining the slum's narrow lanes. Most people are informal daily-wage workers who don't cook at home and go out to get their food. The race to stop the virus spread in Asia's biggest slum And yet Dharavi, a sprawling slum in the heart of Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital, appears to have brought an outbreak under control - for now. Since the first case was reported on 1 April, more than 2,000 infections and 80-odd deaths have been reported here. Half of the cases have recovered. Daily reported infections dropped from a high of 43 a day in May to 19 in third week of June. The average doubling rate had gone up from 18 days in April to 78 in June. The scale of the measures put in place - a mix of draconian containment, extensive screening and providing free food to an out-of-work population - has been extraordinary. Municipal officials say they have traced, tracked, tested and isolated aggressively to halt the spread of infection. At the heart of this has been the screening effort, involving fever camps, doorstep initiatives and mobile vans. The early door-to-door screening by workers in sweltering personal protective gear was not sustainable when the weather turned hot and muggy. People who are testing positive are being taken away for quarantine So the effort pivoted to the fever camps, where more than 360,000 people have been screened for symptoms so far. At each camp, a team of half-a-dozen doctors and health workers in protective clothing screen up to 80 residents every day for temperature and blood oxygen levels using infrared thermometers and pulse oximeters. People showing flu-like symptoms are tested for the disease on spot. Those who test positive are moved to local institutional quarantine facilities, a bunch of schools, marriage halls, sports complexes. More than 10,000 people have been put into quarantine so far. If their condition deteriorates, patients are moved to public and three private hospitals in the area. ""The fever camps have really helped in checking the spread of the infection,"" Dr Amruta Bawaskar, a medical officer working in the slum, told me. ""People turn up voluntarily now, and want to get tested on any pretext. Sometimes they will inflate their age to qualify for testing for high-risk elderly people. Sometimes they will want to get tested because they sat next to someone who coughed or sneezed. There's a lot of fear and awareness."" Five key questions about India's rising Covid-19 infections With some 11,000 tests done since April, there's a possibility that the slum still has a large population of people who are infected but show no symptoms. But officials believe they have been able to contain the infection at a time when it is picking up speed elsewhere in Mumbai and other hotspot cities. The relatively low death toll is possibly explained by the overwhelmingly young population of the slum - most infected people have been in the age group of 21 to 50 years. And to make sure the harsh containment worked, free meals and food rations have been provided to residents trapped at home without work and income. ""I think we have managed to break the chain of transmission without social distancing because there was no scope for that,"" Kiran Dighavkar, an assistant municipal commissioner in charge of the area, told me. Dharavi is one of the world's most congested slums It also helps that Dharavi gets a lot of media attention. The slum drew international attention as the inspiration for the Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire. Business school researchers and city planners from around the world have studied its $1bn informal economy and urban dynamics. Private doctors have joined the fever camps. The cash-rich municipality, politicians, and non-profits have provided tens of thousands of free meals and rations. Bollywood actors and businessmen have donated gear, oxygen cylinders, gloves, masks, medicines and ventilators. ""Mumbai has a history of community action. They have a done a good job in helping officials containing the infection in Dharavi,"" says Dr Armida Fernandez, who's involved with a non-profit working in the slum. However, the economic costs of the draconian containment have been enormous. The slum is home to thriving leather, pottery and textile stitching businesses. It has 5,000 small factories which pay taxes and some 15,000 single-room workshops. It is also Mumbai's main hub of plastic recycling. How Covid-19 has ravaged India's richest city Not surprisingly Dharavi is a place where migrant low-cost skilled labour has thrived for decades. After the lockdown, an estimated 150,000 of them left the place for their native villages after their workplaces shut and earnings dried up. Residents have pawned their gold, depleted their savings and been pushed into debt. ""It was a very harsh containment. It killed the economy of Dharavi,"" says Vinod Shetty, a lawyer who runs a non-profit called Acorn India, which works in the slum. ""People are living hand to mouth. They are not getting work inside our outside the slum."" In other words, the trade-off between lives and livelihood has been harsh. The next challenge, agrees Mr Dighavkar, is to slowly open up the factories so that people can go back to work, and ensure that people continue to wear masks and follow all procedures. More than 360,000 residents have been screened But questions remain. Will there be enough water in a slum where many buy supplies to to make sure that people can wash their hands? Will there be enough jobs left to woo workers back to the factories? How long can the slum remain in a lockdown mode to contain future waves of infection? How long can non-profits continue to help as they start to run out of resources in what promises to be a long and weary battle? ""The war is not yet over. Not until the virus has left for good, anyway,"" Mr Dighavkar says. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Cinemas and museums set to reopen in England,"Galleries, cinemas and museums will be able to reopen from 4 July, the prime minister is expected to announce on Tuesday Cinemas, museums and galleries will be able to reopen in England from 4 July, Boris Johnson is expected to announce on Tuesday as he outlines a further easing of coronavirus restrictions. Venues closed since the middle of March will be able to welcome visitors as long as safety measures are in place. The PM is also due to set out how pubs can safely reopen following a review of the 2m distancing rule. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday the virus was ""in retreat"". Mr Hancock said England was ""clearly on track"" to further ease lockdown restrictions but No 10 warned the moves would be reversed if they led to a surge in new infections. There werefewer than 1,000 confirmed new casesannounced on Monday, the lowest daily figure since the lockdown started on 23 March, while the number of people in hospital with the virus has fallen below 5,000. The number of daily virus deaths also fell to 15, the lowest since 15 March. However, the figures often dip on Mondays due to reporting delays. Office for National Statistics figures show the number of overall deaths in England and Wales for the week ending 12 June was back below 10,000 for the first time this year, although still not back to normal levels. There were 9,976 deaths registered in England and Wales, down from 10,709 the previous week - 6% above the five year average. 'I'm really anxious about reopening' Tory MPs urge change in 2m social distancing rule Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? How lockdown is being lifted across Europe On Monday, the prime minister discussed the changes with the Covid-19 strategy committee, attended by the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty. He is expected to announce the plans in Parliament at about 12:30 BST. Mr Johnson is expected to say the 2m (6ft 6in) social distancing rule will be reduced to 1m (3ft 3in) from 4 July, with some mitigating measures. This will enable many pubs, restaurants, hotels and B&Bs to reopen for the first time in more than three months. Current evidence suggests being 1m apart carries between two and 10 times the risk of being 2m apart,scientists advising the government say,external. Boris Johnson's words today will represent more than a different notch on a measuring tape, more than another kind of business being able to open its own doors in England, and more than the government moving into the final official phase of its so called roadmap set out weeks ago. Coronavirus has bestowed grief on tens of thousands of families and is bringing recession to the whole UK. And it has also pushed the capabilities of the Westminster government, arguably, beyond its limits - buffeting ministers' reputations and raising questions about their grip. Now with the threat to health receding, and the economic danger very real, the political calculus has moved enough to allow the next phase to begin. Ministers used to boast they were following the science. But that complicated advice was a guide, never a medical diktat. The decisions on how and when to react to the pandemic were always for the politicians to take. The government's ambition now is to move steadily towards a more recognisable way of life that gives a chance, ministers hope, to give them, not the virus itself, control. Read more from Laurahere. The government has come under pressure from the hospitality sector, and some Conservative MPs, to relax the 2m rule, with many saying it would be impossible to trade under the current measures. Labour said its support would depend on employees having adequate protective equipment, such as face shields, and there being an effective testing and tracing system in place. This video can not be played One and two metre social distancing - what does it look like? Ministers have not ruled out customers having to register when entering pubs and bars so they can easily be tracked down if they come into contact with a person infected with coronavirus. Peter Borg Neal, chief executive of pub chain Oakman Inns, told Radio 4's Today programme that 1m social distancing was ""still very problematic"" but would allow most pubs to open. ""We hope to prove very quickly to government that pubs will be a safe environment and they can ease restrictions further in due course,"" he said. As part of the government's recovery plan, some arts and entertainment venues are also likely to be able to open their doors from 4 July but only if they follow guidance to ensure they are ""Covid secure"". They will be expected to minimise face-to-face contact by requiring customers to pre-book tickets, to stand in spaced queues and to enter and leave through different areas. Screens could be put up to minimise the risk to staff while ventilation systems will be improved. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Gallery directors have said they are ""incredibly excited"" to reopen and hope the public will be hungry for culture after three months. Simon Martin, director of Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, West Sussex, told Today: ""I think many are going to feel quite emotional when they come. But for us we really want our visitors to feel welcome, feel safe and have an enjoyable time. We are working very hard to ensure that although we sanitise the building we don't sanitise the experience."" Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said the public health community was ""very anxious"" about the pace of changes, adding that the UK still has a far higher number of cases than other European countries. ""I don't think we're in the position where we have a fully functioning track and trace [system] to give us the confidence that if we start to see cases rise again we can contain it,"" she told the BBC's Newsnight programme. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told the Today programme that the government will be issuing guidelines to businesses on how to manage safety. ""The reality is we're all going to have to get used to this new kind of normal as we go forward...where we have to take some self-responsibility to ensure the safety of ourselves, our friends, our family, and the people in our community,"" he said. The other nations of the UK are yet to announce any plans to change the 2m distance rule for the hospitality industry. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has asked scientific advisers toreview the circumstancesin which it might be reduced alongside ""additional mitigations"". In Northern Ireland, where hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes are set to reopen from 3 July, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said she isopen to changing it. Schools will be able tofollow 1m social distancing measures when they reopen in August. A change has alsonot been ruled outin Wales - where First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would support a reduction if Welsh advisers said it was safe.

Scottish schools aim to reopen full-time in August,"Scottish schools are aiming to reopen full-time with no physical distancing in August if coronavirus continues to be suppressed, John Swinney has said. Schools had been preparing to return with a ""blended"" model of face-to-face teaching and at-home learning. But the education secretary said ""significant progress"" had been made in controlling the spread of the virus. Mr Swinney said ministers were now preparing for all schools to open full-time in August. He had previously targeted having pupils spend at least half their time physically in the classroom, leading to concerns from parents. Opposition parties said the move was a ""u-turn"" and a ""climbdown"" which had been forced by public pressure. And union bosses said other measures would need to be put in place to keep staff and pupils safe, such as the use of face coverings and routine testing of teachers. Live: Watch Mr Swinney's statement to MSPs 'We will accept the risks for full-time school' Teachers urge caution over reopening of schools Schools have faced difficulty in working out how to bring pupils back in August while maintaining the current 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule, leading to the blended learning plans. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has ordered officials to review whether the distancing rule could be relaxed in some circumstances. Northern Ireland is set to usea 1m rule for school pupils, while England will move toa ""one metre plus"" rule from 4 July. Mr Swinney said the blended learning plan was a ""necessary"" contingency plan, drawn up a time when the outlook was ""bleak"" - but that ""the picture looks more positive"" now. He said: ""When we prepared our plans back in May I frankly would not have imagined we would have made as much progress in virus suppression as we have. ""It is this more positive outlook that allows the Scottish government to make this change in planning for schools."" Penni Brown is relieved at the announcement the aim is for full-time schooling in August Penni Brown from Edinburgh is ""so unbelievably relieved"" that the Scottish government is now planning to have all schools back full-time from August. She has five children, two of them dyslexic, and she had to give them a lot of support as online learning was too much for them. She told BBC Scotland: ""I was having to consider resigning from work under blended learning, as with five kids they would all be at school at different times. I felt passionately enough about it to fight for all of Scotland's children, not just my own. ""I don't believe the science justifies ""blended learning"" or social distancing amongst children. I think it may be suitable for teachers to remain socially distanced while allowing children to interact normally. ""My heart was breaking for only children and parents of special needs kids as well as many vulnerable families for whom this is pushing them over the edge."" John Swinney had previously said he wanted to see at least 50% of pupils' time spent physically in school Mr Swinney said full time schooling for all pupils was ""the aim the government is now working towards"", with no physical distancing rules to be enforced in classrooms. However, he stressed that this was strictly conditional on Covid-19 continuing to be suppressed and ""stringent"" safety measures being put in place for staff and pupils. And he said that blended learning may still have to be implemented if infection rates rise again, warning that ""there are no certainties with this virus"". The education secretary also announced an extra Â£100m of funding over two years to help children return to school and ""recover any lost ground"". And he said Â£30m would be spent on laptops for the 70,000 most disadvantaged pupils, amid concerns about the impact of home learning on the attainment gap. Just last Sunday, John Swinney said it was ""unlikely"" schools would return to normal within the coming school year. Today, he has told MSPs that they could return to normal - or something far more akin to it, with no physical distancing at all - within seven weeks. So in a little over a week there has been a remarkable change of tack from the government. It has certainly been enabled by the progress made in suppressing coronavirus, but a key factor will also have been the increasingly vocal concerns of parents - who during that same week were receiving letters from schools underscoring the reality of the ""blended"" learning model. But for all the opposition talk of u-turns and climbdowns, what those parents will ultimately care about is what is actually delivered in classrooms come August. If Mr Swinney's vision of a return to normality can be delivered, the politics around it may largely be forgotten. Council umbrella body Cosla said the statement from Mr Swinney was ""a significant change in direction"". Spokesman Stephen McCabe said local authorities would ""work with the Scottish government, trade unions, parent organisations and children and young people representatives to consider the implications and practicalities of a full time return for pupils in August"". The EIS union said ""a great deal of work at school level has already gone into planning for a blended learning model"" and that there would need to be ""time to adjust plans and conduct revised risk assessments"". General secretary Larry Flanagan said there needed to be ""appropriate mitigations"" to protect staff and pupils, such as the use of face coverings, ""proactive"" testing of teachers and physical distancing between pupils and staff. While opposition parties broadly welcomed the move, they were critical of the government's handling of the issue. As recently as 14 June, Mr Swinney had said it was ""unlikely"" that schools could return to normal within the current school year, suggesting that the2021 exam diet may need to be pushed back. The Scottish Conservatives said the ""screeching u-turn"" had been forced on the government by ""relentless campaigning from all quarters"" and an ""outburst of anger from parents"". Education spokesman Jamie Greene said: ""The sad truth is that until now, recent events have exposed nothing but a complete vacuum of leadership in the handling of this issue."" Scottish Labour accused Mr Swinney of ""the mother and father of all ministerial climb-downs"", with education spokesman Iain Gray saying the government had produced ""a completely new plan at the last possible moment"".

Can I be in a coronavirus 'social bubble'?,"Some people across the UK have been able to form household support bubbles or extended households. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is a group of people with whom you have close physical contact. Bubbles must be ""exclusive"". Once in one, you can't start another with a different household. If you decide to change your bubble, you should treat your previous bubble as a separate household for 10 days before forming a new one. People in a bubble can stay overnight in each other's homes, visit outdoors places together and do not have to socially distance. In England, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household. The second household can be of any size and can include ""at risk"" peoplewho may be shielding. Wherever possible, the government recommends that a support bubble should be with another local household to avoid unnecessary travel. Anyone in the bubble contacted as part of England'stest and trace programmemust stay at home. If they develop coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. The governmentexpanded the eligibility,externalof support bubbles in England on 2 December to help families with very young children or people with continuous care needs. This means households can form a support bubble with another household, if at least one of them has: a child under 1 (regardless of how many other adults are in the household) a child under 5 with a disability that requires continuous care (regardless of how many other adults are in the household) a single adult carer (living with any additional adults in the household that have a disability and need continuous care) As well as the support bubble rules, the government in England also has a set of rules that apply to families with children under 14 (as well as to vulnerable adults). They can form a childcare bubble with one other household to provide informal (unpaid and unregistered) childcare. This must always be between the same two households. Childcare can be provided in either or both of the two homes. During lockdown,registered childcare and childcare bubbles can continue.,external Two single people each living alone can bubble Someone in a houseshare could bubble - but their housemates wouldn't be allowed to form their own bubbles with other people Full government guidelinesfor England are here.,external In Wales, during lockdown, you must not visit other households, or meet other people you do not live with, unless they are in yoursupport bubble,external. Support bubbles can be formed by: households where one adult lives alone households where one adult lives with any number of children under 18, or households where more than one adult lives, but one adult has caring responsibilities for all of the other adults in the home People in the same bubble can stay in each other's homes overnight. And they can meet up in groups in some other outdoor places. If you were part of a temporary extended household during the firebreak period, or were in one before that, you can make a new bubble, instead. However, once you have agreed and joined that new extended household, neither household can leave to form a new one. Under the five tier system in Scotland,external, people who live on their own or only with children under 18 can form an extended household with people from one other household. People in extended households are counted as one household, and so can continue to meet and socialise with each other despite general restrictions on households mixing, and can stay overnight in each other's homes. Couples who do not live together can also form an extended household, which can include any children they each live with. A household must not form an extended household with more than one other. However, one of them can end the arrangement at any time, and - as long as they wait at least 14 days - then form a new extended household with someone else. If any member of an extended household develops symptoms or tests positive for Covid, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. Two households of any size can form a support bubble. The members can spend time indoors and stay overnight with each other. Under the latest restrictions, these bubbles are limited to a maximum of 10 people, including children, at any one time. Read more fromthe Northern Ireland Executive here.,external Before the latest lockdown, schools across the UK have been usingyear group and/or class bubblesto support social distancing and reduce close contact between pupils as much as possible. Maintaining distinct groups which do not mix makes it quicker and easier when a positive case occurs to identify those who may need to self-isolate and minimise their number.

Coronavirus: Who should be shielding?,"Guidance for people in England identified as being ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing? Formal advice telling them to take extra care, or ""shield"", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. Most coronavirus restrictionsare being lifted in Englandon 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else. However, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to ""think particularly carefully"" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including: limiting moments of close contact considering whether you and others have been fully vaccinated (you might want to wait until 14 days after your second dose before meeting) considering the risk if Covid levels are high in the general community meeting outside if possible ensuring inside spaces are well-ventilated washing hands regularly and avoiding face-touching continuing social distancing if that feels right for you asking friends/family to take lateral flow tests before meeting There is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Although Scotland moves toCovid protection level zero,externalon 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidkeeping the mandatory use of face coveringspast then would give ""added protection and assurance"" to people who were particularly vulnerable. From 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace. However, companies still havelegally binding health and safety responsibilities,external- and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. Some firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people. TheCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough),externalis available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. You may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons. Read theupdated government advice,external. Although the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it ""expects and recommends"" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport. You should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. TheNHS Volunteer Responders,externalprogramme is still available to offer support. Data showsCovid vaccines are highly effectivein most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection. Being double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. You should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not,book through the NHS website,externalor call 119. The most vulnerable peopleare likely to be offered booster jabs from September,external, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. You are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions. The pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The governmentrecommends several support websites,external. If you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on theNHS Shielded Patient List,external. A combination of factors can contribute toa person's risk,external, including: age (older being higher risk) ethnicity deprivation (according to postcode) weight (body mass index) underlying health issues prescribed medications Cancer patients need to take extra care High risk categories,externalinclude people: with transplanted solid organs undergoing some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy on immunosuppression drugs with heart disease who are also pregnant with severe respiratory conditions (for example: cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD) with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency with Down's syndrome (adults) on dialysis or with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (adults) EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Shopping centres' funding woes may prompt closures,"Intu, owner of the Trafford, Braehead and Lakeside shopping centres, is warning its financial troubles could see entire sites shut. It has lined up administrators KPMG as a ""contingency"" in case financial restructuring talks with lenders fail. Intu warns that if that happens it will have to give KPMG funds for certain services, or see the centres shut. The company is the biggest shopping centre chain in the UK with 17 UK outlets and three in Spain. Intu has until Friday to sort out a new financial footing. The company said: ""In the event that Intu properties plc is unable to reach a standstill, it is likely it and certain other central entities will fall into administration. Intu owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester ""If that happened, the various group companies would have to put money into the administrator. If the administrator is not pre-funded then there is a risk that centres may have to close for a period."" Intu's group companies provide key services to the sites, from lighting and cleaning to health and safety systems, security and essential maintenance. Intu had been struggling before coronavirus to fill outlets within some centres sites and had heavy debts. It said in March it was in talks with lenders about new funding. On Tuesday, Intu said ""notwithstanding the progress made"" it had appointed KPMG to plan for administration. Since the coronavirus lockdown Intu's centres have been partially shut, with only essential stores remaining open. The company had about 60% of shopping centre staff and about 20% of head office employees on furlough. Shopping centre giant Intu warns it could go bust The firm's financial woes include making a loss of Â£2bn in 2019, failing earlier this year to raise Â£1bn in new funding, and having debts of Â£5bn. The collapse and contraction of High Street retailers in the face of rising costs and the seemingly ever-increasing online shopping trend had already seen retailers closing outlets, leaving a number of landlords, such as Intu, struggling to fill empty space. Many among the remainder are finding it harder to meet rent payments. Retail consultant Kate Hardcastle said the writing had been on the wall for such centres for some time. ""Intu's model is heavily dependent on big box retailers paying rent for big retail spaces, and with the rise and rise of online and consumer spending shifting to travel and experience rather than pure retail it was probably on precarious ground."" She added that its shopping centres had become places for ""show-rooming"", where consumers see the products they want, then go home and buy them more cheaply online. The company is well down on normal income levels. Intu's latest update on rent collection said it had received only 40% of rental and service charge income for the first quarter of the year. It had moved from quarterly rent collection to more flexible arrangements with shop owners. Intu has been attempting to sell shopping centres to raise cash and has sold off its outlet in Zaragoza, in Spain. Braehead, Glasgow Broadmarsh, Nottingham Chapelfield, Norwich Derby Eldon Square, Newcastle Lakeside, Essex Merry Hill, West Midlands Metrocentre, Gateshead Milton Keynes Potteries, Stoke-on-Trent Trafford Centre, Manchester Uxbridge Victoria Centre, Nottingham Watford Centres run as joint ventures: Manchester Arndale St David's, Cardiff The Mall, Cribbs Causeway Plus three centres in Spain Intu's possible demise has been a long time foretold. The retail landlord, still better known to some by its former name, Capital Shopping Centres, has always carried a high level of debt relative to its peers, and the gradual drift away from bricks and mortar shops to the internet left it with less margin for error if a downturn came. But the company still had an impressive list of blue-chip assets - some of the best malls in the UK, a decent defence, most thought, against the predations of online competitors. Just two and a half years ago it was still riding high. Its FTSE 100 rival Hammerson made a takeover approach at 253p a share, valuing Intu as a whole at Â£3.4bn. Intu shares are now at 4.5p, giving the whole company a stock market value of Â£60m. That staggering fall has been caused by that steady erosion of sales away to the internet, and then the shattering blow of the coronavirus. Intu is now collecting one-third less rent at some of its flagship malls than it was a year ago. It is in breach of the conditions of agreements it made with the lenders who financed those individual properties. If it cannot reach a peace deal with those lenders, administration beckons. What happens next is difficult to predict. The management may be able to stitch together an agreement with lenders, in which case it will limp along until it is able to refinance. If administration comes, it could be a messy restructuring, with different lenders holding the whip hand on individual properties. As the company itself points out today, the uncertainties that come with administration could even mean that some of Britain's best-known shopping centres have to close, if only temporarily.

Dating site Shaadi.com removes skin tone filter,"Asian marriage website, Shaadi.com, has removed a skin tone filter following pressure from users. Hetal Lakhani from Dallas, USA, started an online petition against the option, which led to the company removing it. She started it after speaking to another user, who questioned the filter in light of anti-racism protests. Shaadi.com says the filter ""was not serving any purpose"" and was a ""product debris we missed removing"". When users joined the site they were asked to select how dark or light their skin is under the 'skin tone' option. Users could search for potential partners by the skin tone they'd selected, but Shaadi.com claims this filter didn't work and searches would show all matches of all skin tones. The website is unique to other dating sites because it replaces south Asian tradition of a matchmaker and helps people intending to get married find a spouse. Meghan Nagpal was using the website to find a potential life partner who would also be of Indian origin. ""I emailed them (shaadi.com) and one representative said this is a filter required by most parents,"" she tells BBC Asian Network. She discussed the complexion filter on a Facebook group, where Hetal is also a member. ""When Meghan shared this on our group I was really shocked because a company usually has a social responsibility,"" says Hetal. ""I wanted to tackle this in a way that could make a difference so I started a petition. ""And it just took off like wildfire. Within 14 hours we had over 1,500 signatures. People were so glad we were raising the issue."" The petition was shared with Shaadi.com by a blogger knows as Miss Roshni who runs an entertainment website, Urban Asian. She challenged the company for their response to Meghan and described the skin tone filter as ""disrespectful"" and ""disgusting"". Shaadi.com claimed it was ""blindspot"" they had missed on their site and the filter was removed overnight. ""It's just one small step in an ultimate goal of promoting equality within the south Asian community on a global level,"" said Meghan. Hetal added: ""I have my bachelors, I have my masters. But if a skin tone can take that away from me - that would be the worst."" Colourism in South Asia has come under the spotlight following global anti-racism protests after the death of George Floyd. Indian film actors have also been criticised ""Bollywood stars were on one hand endorsing fairness creams but on the other hand were supporting the Black Lives Matter movement,"" said Meghan. ""So a part of me was thinking there is obviously a mindset within the south Asian culture about fair skin being better, and that's spilling over into matrimonial websites. ""You hear it more when older people in our community are commenting about women rather than men; saying 'she is so fair, she is so beautiful' and I think it's more of an unconscious bias."" Hetals says dating apps and websites shouldn't support individual bias Hetal says a company with international reach should be more responsible. ""People have their biases. But a company should not inculcate that culture."" The Director of Marketing at Shaadi.com told BBC Asian Network: ""We truly believe that love comes in all shapes and shades. ""And we are proud to represent a cross-section of India - that's something very few companies in India can boast about."" Priya (name has been changed) found her husband on the site after being rejected by others for her skin colour. ""I am dark-skinned and saw the skin colour question on there (shaadi.com) and answered it the best I could,"" she tells BBC Asian Network. ""I remember selecting 'wheat-ish' - whatever that means."" ""My mother-in-law was dead against our marriage because I was a lot darker than her fair skinned, handsome son. Her generation view beauty in shades, which I have hated my entire life.

US soldier accused of planning attack on own unit,"Ethan Melzer has been described as an ""enemy within"" A US soldier has been charged with terrorism offences for planning a deadly ambush on his unit by sending information to a neo-Nazi group. Ethan Melzer, 22, stands accused of sending sensitive details about his unit to the Order of Nine Angles. The US Department of Justice calls it an ""occult-based neo-Nazi and racially motivated violent extremist group"". He was allegedly planning for information to be passed to jihadists, who would then carry out an attack. His plan was thwarted late last month by the FBI and the US army. He was arrested on 10 June. Private Melzer, from Louisville, Kentucky, has been charged with conspiring and attempting to murder US nationals; conspiring and attempting to murder military service members; providing and attempting to provide material support to terrorists; and conspiring to murder and maim in a foreign country. Private Melzer enlisted in the US Army in December 2018 and began his active service in June 2019. In the fall of 2019, he was assigned to a US military facility in Europe, the indictment says. In April 2020, the army informed Private Melzer that he and his unit would be deployed to another foreign country, not named in the filing. After Private Melzer was notified of this assignment, he used an encrypted messaging system to send notice to members of the Order of Nine Angles, including his unit's locations, movements and security plans. The information was shared ""for the purpose of facilitating an attack on the unit"", the indictment says. Also known as the ONA, or O9A, the Order is an occult group founded in the UK, with roots dating back to the 1960s It describes itself as Satanic and its writings are widely shared in Neo-Nazi communities The Order calls for the overthrow of the West's Judeo-Christian order, and it encourages members to isolate themselves from society, commit crimes and embrace political extremism New followers must spend at least six months in ""insight roles,"" a practice of infiltrating and subverting other religious groups or organisations like the police and army The group maintains a decentralised structure, so it is hard to estimate the true size and influence. But its ideology is having a resurgence in Europe and the US, partly due to the online proliferation of its literature. ""As alleged, Ethan Melzer, a private in the US Army, was the enemy within,"" said Audrey Strauss, acting US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a statement. ""Melzer allegedly attempted to orchestrate a murderous ambush on his own unit by unlawfully revealing its location, strength, and armaments to a neo-Nazi, anarchist, white supremacist group."" He is accused of planning to provide information intended to be conveyed to jihadist terrorists, she added. He allegedly exchanged communications regarding passing information about an anticipated deployment of his unit to a purported member of al-Qaeda. Order of Nine Angles should be outlawed, campaigners urge What is the Order of Nine Angles? Private Melzer wrote to O9A members that he was ""risking [my] literal free life"" by disclosing this information, court documents say. I am ""expecting results"", he added. Members of the Order of Nine Angles, also known as O9A, have expressed admiration for both Nazis, such as Adolf Hitler, and Islamic jihadists, such as Osama Bin Laden. Court documents say that Private Melzer consumed propaganda distributed by the Islamic State (IS), including an IS-issued document that mentioned the ""HARVEST OF THE SOLDIERS"" and described attacks on US army personnel. This video can not be played Why do some people join white supremacy gangs and what does it take to get in one? ""Melzer declared himself to be a traitor against the United States, and described his own conduct as tantamount to treason.  We agree,"" said FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. ""He turned his back on his county and his unit while aligning himself with members of the neo-Nazi group ONA. Today, he is in custody and facing a lifetime of service - behind bars - which is appropriate given the severity of the conduct we allege today."" UK anti-racism campaigners Hope Not Hate used its annual State of Hate report to call for the Order of Nine Angles to be banned. In April, the UN Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate released a report on extreme right-wing terrorism. The report suggested that there has been a 320% surge in terror attacks associated with such ideology in the past five years worldwide. Last week, a US Air Force sergeant with ties to the right-wing Boogaloo Bois movement was charged with the murder of a federal security officer in California. The Boogaloo Bois are among a number of fringe groups accused of exploiting the recent anti-racism protests to incite violence.

Community oxygen tests 'key to virus second wave',"These Â£50 devices are being developed in south Wales to test oxygen levels Oxygen levels in suspected coronavirus cases should be monitored in the community to help hospitals cope with a second wave of cases, according to Wales' leading respiratory doctor. Dr Simon Barry said early on in the pandemic it became clear reduced oxygen levels in the blood suggested a patient had Covid-19. But flu and pneumonia will be more common in a future winter peak. This means more community monitoring would be needed, he said. Dr Barry is leading the implementation of Welsh guidelines to treat the virus, and said work was under way to conduct specific tests before coronavirus patients were admitted to hospital in future. Most people with coronavirus only have mild symptoms, and sometimes none at all. But doctors report low blood oxygen saturation levels among those who are admitted to hospital with coronavirus. Healthy adults usually have saturation levels of between 94% and 99%, whereas those with Covid-19 can fall below 90% and require oxygen therapy and, in some cases, ventilation in intensive care. Dr Barry, who has treated Covid-19 patients, has also developed a website that delivers the latest treatment guidelines to doctors in all Welsh hospitals. He said: ""Early on there was a clear recognition that this disease caused oxygenation failure in people who presented. ""The ones who got sick (the 20% of patients who get sick) had low oxygen levels and they came into hospital with low oxygen levels."" Dr Barry has been producing online training videos for doctors Dr Barry said far more patients had been treated with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device than he had anticipated. The treatment, which involves a tight-fitting mask that delivers a continuous flow of oxygen, is given while the patient is awake and does not require them to be sedated and placed on a mechanical ventilator. ""We've learned that actually you can manage patients with quite bad oxygenation failure on the wards, using CPAP, and getting them to lie on their front,"" he said. ""And we also know that, if you go to ITU [an intensive therapy unit] and you're ventilated, you have very high mortality. It's about 70% if you're actually invasively ventilated."" Early intervention is key in providing the best treatment, and monitoring blood oxygen levels could prove crucial in determining whether someone has coronavirus or another respiratory illness. Dr Barry, who is based at Cardiff and Vale health board, said a winter surge would mean Covid-19 mixing with flu and pneumonia cases. That, he said, would mean it would be ""extremely difficult"" to manage patients into ""safe streams"" within hospitals, making community testing necessary. ""We are looking at a mechanism to be able to do all of these specific tests, point-of-care, in the community. Both in primary care but also using the Welsh ambulance crew, so they will be able to make a specific diagnosis within minutes."" The oximeter is being developed at labs at the University of South Wales Engineers at the University of South Wales have received Welsh Government funding to create a new oximeter, a Â£50 portable device which can accurately measure a patient's blood oxygen levels. Prof Nigel Copner, who has led the programme to rapidly develop the oximeter at the laboratory in Treforest, said the devices would be ready ""in weeks"" and Welsh patients would be the first to benefit. ""Wales obviously has first call, the Welsh Government has funded the project in total. And we have contract manufacturers down in Sony that can manufacture the device and turn it around very quickly."" F1 team helps to create coronavirus breathing aid What are ventilators and how do they work? 'Our hospitals weren't made to use so much oxygen' Prof Copner said the device had ""no issues"" with pre-existing supply chains, which have been stretched by global demand. ""We can actually manufacture and build this device very easily in south Wales, and we can turn around high volumes in a matter of weeks,"" he added. Clinicians have also responded in innovative ways during the pandemic. Dr Barry said a pioneering online training platform had helped Welsh doctors to provide the best treatment, as lessons were learned and best practice shared quickly with colleagues. ""Traditionally in Wales we have seven health boards that do things in seven different ways,"" he said. ""But if you stood above it and you look down, it's an enormously inefficient and ineffective way to manage cases. ""We're trying to rise above that by saying 'look, this is the national guideline'. We are getting experts within Wales who are talking about updates and talking about what should be the best practice. And that seems a logical way to proceed.""

Lockdown relaxed in England as 2m rule eased,"Pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers can open from 4 July in England, when social distancing rules will be eased. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should remain 2m apart where possible but a ""one metre plus"" rule would be introduced. Two households in England will also be able to meet indoors and stay overnight - with social distancing. The prime minister warned that all the steps were ""reversible"". The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said the relaxation represented a ""reasonable balance of risk"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford and Northern Ireland's Arlene Foster have said the 2m rule will remain in place in their nations for the time being. Theatres, cinemas, libraries, museums, theme parks and zoos are among other businesses that can also reopen. But indoor gyms, swimming pools, nail bars and indoor play areas will remain closed for the moment, as they have been since lockdown started on 23 March. During the government's final daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Johnson said ""task forces"" were being established to work out how they too could reopen. Lifting lockdown: All you need to know 'There will be a shortage of holiday cottages' Hairdresser: 'We've built a waiting list of over 2,000 people' The meeting of households will not be exclusive so, for example, one set of grandparents could see their relatives one weekend, and the other set of grandparents the next. But, unlikethe bubble system, people will have to maintain social distance - so family members who live apart will not be able to hug. In a statement in the Commons earlier, Mr Johnson said people would be encouraged to use ""mitigation"" - such as face coverings and not sitting face-to-face - when less than 2m from each other but ""where it is possible to keep 2m apart, people should"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson is cheered as he announces English pubs can reopen from 4 July Prof Whitty warned ""we will get an uptick"" if people did not take such measures seriously. And Mr Johnson urged people to be vigilant, saying the virus ""wants to take advantage of our carelessness"". He said there would be local outbreaks in the future - and that he would not hesitate to reverse the changes at local or national level if the virus were to begin to run out of control. The venues listed as being able to reopen include: Pubs, bars and restaurantsbut only with a table service indoors, and owners will be asked to keep contact details of customers to help with contact tracing Hotels, holiday apartments, campsites and caravan parksbut shared facilities must be cleaned properly Theatres and music hallsbut they will not be allowed to hold live performances In other changesweddingswill be allowed to have 30 attendees, andplaces of worshipwill be allowed to hold services but singing will be banned Hair salonsandbarberswill be able to reopen but must have protective measures, such as visors, in place Libraries, community centresandbingo halls Cinemas,museumsandgalleries Funfairs, theme parks, adventure parks, amusement arcades, skating rinksandmodel villages Indoor attractions where animals are exhibited, such as atzoos,aquariums,farms,safari parksandwildlife centres The following places will remain closed by law Nightclubs and casinos Bowling alleys and indoor skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft-play Spas Nail bars and beauty salons Massage, tattoo and piercing parlours Indoor fitness and dance studios, and indoor gyms and sports venues/facilities - although Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden tweeted that ministers hope to be able to reopen gyms and leisure facilities in mid-July Swimming pools and water parks Exhibition or conference centres - other than for those who work for that venue. Read more detail on how lockdown measures are easing in England here. Responding to Mr Johnson's statement on Tuesday afternoon, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""I believe the government is trying to do the right thing and in that I support them"". He added he thought it was ""safe for some children to return to school"" after the PM said schools in Englandshould return in full in September. In Scotland,schools are aiming to reopenfull-time in August, in Walessome schools will resumefor just three weeks later this month, while Northern Irelandhas a 24 August targetfor full reopening. Restrictions have to lift at some point. The big question is whether the UK is moving too soon. The number of infections has fallen dramatically. There are now just over 1,000 new cases a day on average. That compares with an estimated 100,000 at the peak at the end of March - we don't know the exact figure because there was limited testing in place. Huge progress has, therefore, been made. But the number of infections is still significantly higher than other countries. France and Germany are seeing fewer than half the number of infections that the UK is (and Germany has a larger population), while Italy has fewer than a quarter. It is why there are plenty of experts, including former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, voicing concern that restrictions are easing too quickly. But, of course, not lifting them comes at a cost too - to the economy, to people's health and wellbeing and to wider society. At the end of the day, it is a finely balanced judgement call. We will only know whether it was the right one or not in the weeks and months to come. Current evidence suggests being 1m apart carries between two and 10 times the risk of being 2m apart,scientists advising the government have said.,external Under new guidance, the government wants people to keep 2m apart where they can. If not, to remain at least 1m apart while taking steps to reduce the risk of transmission. They include measures such as not sitting face-to-face, cutting the number of people in an enclosed space, or having hand-sanitiser available to use. Mr Johnson stressed that the government was not ""forcing"" people to limit their social contact through legislation, but was ""asking them to follow guidance"". Police would still be able to ""break up large and irresponsible gatherings"", he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Earlier, he said it was each nation's own responsibility to make their own lockdown restrictions but said all parts of the UK were now ""travelling in the same direction"". Scotland not yet ready to relax 2m distance rule NI pupils to follow 1m social distancing at schools Wales will only changed 2m rule 'when safe' The prime minister added he did not believe there was ""a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS"". A further 171 deaths were reported in the UK on Tuesday, taking the total to 42,927, while latest testing figures showed there were 874 new positive cases. According to the latest official figures, the R value for the UK  - the average number of people that one infected person passes the virus on to - is between 0.7 and 0.9. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, who also spoke at the briefing, said the public should not ""be fooled"" into thinking that the virus had ""gone away"". ""The disease is growing across the world,"" he said. Prof Whitty said he would be ""surprised and delighted if we weren't in this current situation through the winter and into next spring"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: ""This is not a return back to normal business, but it is a very big moment, and a step to a new normal. ""One important point to note though, as I understand it, the advice from the government will still be that people should work at home if they can."" By Alice Evans, BBC News Shop owner Rezia isn't optimistic that business will improve for him when other places re-open Brixton looks almost normal this afternoon. Plenty of the market stalls are open, there's a steady stream of shoppers, and blaring music is coming from several shops. So far, so Brixton. But the many boarded-up businesses down the backstreets of this buzzing south-London neighbourhood are a tell-tale sign of the effect lockdown has had on trade. Some local firms have welcomed the prime minister's news. The Duke of Edinburgh pub, for example, is busy making its huge beer garden Covid-secure, with staff ""really excited"" for their customers to return. The customers are similarly keen - the pub's booking website crashed minutes after the prime minister's announcement. But others aren't so enthused. Fabric shop owner Rezia (pictured above) is happy with the 2m rule being relaxed to 1m, but is convinced business will remain ""slow"" for him. It doesn't matter that more people will be out and about spending money - they are not going to buy fabric, he says, on their way home from the pub. Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said he was ""extremely pleased"" that pubs were reopening after a long hiatus. ""We are going to discuss the precise government proposals with our pub managers and staff before we comment further on the details."" UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said reopening was the best way to secure business and jobs - but warned that social distancing constraints would mean some businesses were unviable, and government support remained ""crucial"". Glenn Earlam, chief executive of David Lloyd gyms, said he was disappointed by the announcement, since preparations had been under way for the sector to reopen from 4 July. ""For the last three weeks we've been working on an awful lot of detail,"" he said. ""Everything from temperature checks of our members when they arrive at reception, to screens at reception, to hand sanitisation, to an extreme cleaning regime."" An instant online poll carried out by YouGov shortly after Mr Johnson's announcement suggested 64% of people supported the reopening of the specified sectors and 73% backed the decision to allow two households to meet indoors.

"Scientists examine the great 'human pause'Tracking wildlife before, during and after lockdown will aim to analyse the slowdown in human activity.Science & Environment","Bio-logging devices are trackers fitted to animals, like this Alpine ibex, that record their movements Researchers have launched an initiative to track wildlife before, during and after the coronavirus lockdown. The UK-led team's aim is to study what they have called the ""anthropause"" - the global-scale, temporary slowdown in human activity, which is likely to have a profound impact on other species. Measuring that impact, they say, will reveal ways in which we can ""share our increasingly crowded planet"". They outline the missionin the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution,external. All over the world, some animals have been tracked throughout lockdown They outline ""urgent steps"" to allow scientists to learn as much as possible from the sudden absence of humans in many landscapes - including ensuring that researchers have access and permission to carry out their work, and can gain access to information about human movement, as well as animal-tracking data. Coronavirus: This is not the last pandemic Covid recovery could 'tip the balance' for nature Coronavirus: A hunt for the 'missing link' species Prof Christian Rutz from the University of St Andrews is president of the International Bio-logging Society. He pointed out that bio-loggers - small tracking devices fitted to animals in order to record their movements and other behaviour - have been collecting information in habitats all over the world throughout the pandemic. Tracking whales could also reveal the impact that the ""anthropause"" has had on ocean wildlife ""There is a really valuable research opportunity here, one that's been brought about by the most tragic circumstances, but it's one we think we can't afford to miss,"" he told BBC News. Usually, studies which try to examine the impact of human presence and activity on wild animals are limited to comparing protected habitats to unprotected areas, or studying landscapes in the wake of a natural disaster. Disasters like the one in Chernobyl can become tragic ""natural experiments"" ""But during lockdown we have this replicated around the globe -  in different localities and for habitats where some species have been fitted with tracking devices the whole time,"" said Prof Rutz. There have been many accounts on social media of wildlife apparently making the most of our absence  - moving freely through surprisingly urban settings. In some places though, the lack of human activity appears to have been detrimental -increases in poaching driven by poverty, and the absence of ecotourism. This video can not be played Chernobyl's post-human landscape ""No one's saying that humans should stay in lockdown permanently,"" added Prof Rutz. ""But what if we see major impacts of our changes in road use, for example? We could use that to make small changes to our transport network that could have major benefits."" Prof Jim Smith from the University of Portsmouth has been part of what might be considered the first anthropause study - a long-term investigation into the changes in the abandoned landscape around the damaged Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Chernobyl's wolves returned in the wake of the abandonment of the Exclusion Zone ""Just a few years after the evacuation of the Exclusion Zone, Belarussian and Ukrainian researchers found species associated with humans - like pigeons and rats - were disappearing, but wild animals - wild boar, deer and wolf - were multiplying,"" he said. ""Still abandoned more than 30 years later, the zone has become an iconic example of accidental rewilding."" ""At great economic and human cost, Covid and Chernobyl forcedÂ us to push the pause button on our environmental damage,"" Prof Smith continued. ""Stopping some of those impacts altogether will be hard, but will be helpedÂ by what we can learn from these extreme events."" Prof Rutz and his team pointed out in their paper: ""Scientific knowledge gained during this devastating crisis will allow us to develop innovative strategies for sharing space on this increasingly crowded planet, with benefits for both wildlife and humans.""

"Dating site Shaadi.com removes skin tone filterThe Asian matrimonial website, Shaadi.com, said the filter was ""not serving any purpose"".Newsbeat","Asian marriage website, Shaadi.com, has removed a skin tone filter following pressure from users. Hetal Lakhani from Dallas, USA, started an online petition against the option, which led to the company removing it. She started it after speaking to another user, who questioned the filter in light of anti-racism protests. Shaadi.com says the filter ""was not serving any purpose"" and was a ""product debris we missed removing"". When users joined the site they were asked to select how dark or light their skin is under the 'skin tone' option. Users could search for potential partners by the skin tone they'd selected, but Shaadi.com claims this filter didn't work and searches would show all matches of all skin tones. The website is unique to other dating sites because it replaces south Asian tradition of a matchmaker and helps people intending to get married find a spouse. Meghan Nagpal was using the website to find a potential life partner who would also be of Indian origin. ""I emailed them (shaadi.com) and one representative said this is a filter required by most parents,"" she tells BBC Asian Network. She discussed the complexion filter on a Facebook group, where Hetal is also a member. ""When Meghan shared this on our group I was really shocked because a company usually has a social responsibility,"" says Hetal. ""I wanted to tackle this in a way that could make a difference so I started a petition. ""And it just took off like wildfire. Within 14 hours we had over 1,500 signatures. People were so glad we were raising the issue."" The petition was shared with Shaadi.com by a blogger knows as Miss Roshni who runs an entertainment website, Urban Asian. She challenged the company for their response to Meghan and described the skin tone filter as ""disrespectful"" and ""disgusting"". Shaadi.com claimed it was ""blindspot"" they had missed on their site and the filter was removed overnight. ""It's just one small step in an ultimate goal of promoting equality within the south Asian community on a global level,"" said Meghan. Hetal added: ""I have my bachelors, I have my masters. But if a skin tone can take that away from me - that would be the worst."" Colourism in South Asia has come under the spotlight following global anti-racism protests after the death of George Floyd. Indian film actors have also been criticised ""Bollywood stars were on one hand endorsing fairness creams but on the other hand were supporting the Black Lives Matter movement,"" said Meghan. ""So a part of me was thinking there is obviously a mindset within the south Asian culture about fair skin being better, and that's spilling over into matrimonial websites. ""You hear it more when older people in our community are commenting about women rather than men; saying 'she is so fair, she is so beautiful' and I think it's more of an unconscious bias."" Hetals says dating apps and websites shouldn't support individual bias Hetal says a company with international reach should be more responsible. ""People have their biases. But a company should not inculcate that culture."" The Director of Marketing at Shaadi.com told BBC Asian Network: ""We truly believe that love comes in all shapes and shades. ""And we are proud to represent a cross-section of India - that's something very few companies in India can boast about."" Priya (name has been changed) found her husband on the site after being rejected by others for her skin colour. ""I am dark-skinned and saw the skin colour question on there (shaadi.com) and answered it the best I could,"" she tells BBC Asian Network. ""I remember selecting 'wheat-ish' - whatever that means."" ""My mother-in-law was dead against our marriage because I was a lot darker than her fair skinned, handsome son. Her generation view beauty in shades, which I have hated my entire life.

We'll be back early tomorrow with more on how the coronavirus crisis is impacting on Scotland.    Drinks giant Diageo is giving Â£4m to Scottish pubs struggling with the impact of coronavirus. The company, which makes Guinness and whisky, has announced the two-year Raise the Bar programme to help premises bring back customers as lockdown continues to be relaxed. It designed the scheme following a global survey of bar owners to identify what they need to reopen after lockdown. Their top priorities include hygiene measures, digital support and practical equipment to transform how their outlets will work. The programme will provide support to help pay for the physical equipment such as sanitiser dispenser units, medical-grade hand sanitiser and PPE. Pubs and bars will also be helped with online reservations, cashless systems, mobile bars and outdoor equipment. Boris Johnson concluded his final daily briefing by saying the UK is improving all the time at fighting the virus. From now on the UK government's televised briefingswill be given on an ""ad hoc"" basis to ""coincide with significant announcements"". He praises the public for their efforts and looks to the possibility of drugs being developed, with the UK ""playing a lead role"". And the PM says the NHS test and trace scheme could be a ""real game changer"" in the fight against coronavirus. He concludes: ""Although the virus is the same and just as dangerous as it was, we are now better at dealing with it. ""This virus is still out there. The only way to beat it is to stay alert, follow the guidance and save lives"". Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland So, what do pupils make of plans for a full-time return to classrooms in August? Brodie,11,from Linlithgow, says: ""I've missed my friends. It's easier working in school, where you're with partners helping out. Harry, 8,from Glasgow: ""It would be a bit strange to go back for just two days a week, plus it would be hard to social distance in my school, the corridors are quite short. Holly, 11,from Glasgow: ""I'm really excited about going back. I like the school environment, where everyone supports each other. Pearse, 13,from Paisley: ""It's better than going back in groups. I've missed my pals, it's been tough, but we've still been talking on social media. Meave, 10,from Paisley: ""I miss all of my friends. It's been hard doing the school work at home and it's weird not going out to school in the morning."" Unison Scotland has criticised Education Secretary John Swinney's announcement on the reopening of schools, describing it as ""a significant about turn"" which seems to be driven ""more by politics than by safety"". The union's Mike Kirby said the wellbeing of staff
and pupils ""must be paramount"". He added: ""Any return to school must be led by the
scientific evidence at that time and be dependent on crucial risk assessments
to ensure everyoneâs safety."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The
chief of pub chain Brewdog earlier described the UKâs response to Covid-19 as a âcase
study on how not to support a sector through a challengeâ. David
McDowall told Drivetime that aside from a lack of pace on recovery, the
hospitality sector also suffered from a lack of certainty and limited
communication from both Scottish and UK governments. While todayâs news from England that pubs could open from 4 July was welcome, he warned than 10 daysâ notice was not enough time. He added there was a âcrushing lack of
guidanceâ from both governments and his firm was not sure if it would make
it through the crisis at first. Mr McDowall said the company was âwaiting with bated breathâ
for news on pubs in Scotland. What impact could seeing our neighbours in England have a bit more freedom have on our psychology? Professor Stephen Reicher explains it all depends on the level of understanding of the strategy. He says the strategy in England is more risk-taking than in Scotland, where the focus is on driving down the number of cases more now to make it easier to reopen later. If people understand the Scottish approach more people will buy into it, he explains. The payoff for a bit more pain now is more freedom in the future, he adds, suggesting Scotland is the tortoise to England's hare. ""Let's see if the tortoise overtakes the hare."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Sir David King, the former UK government chief scientific adviser, is not too happy aboutplans to reopen English pubs and restaurantsin early July. ""You can't wear a mask when you're eating and drinking or even chatting away,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""If you reduce the distance to 1m in an enclosed space, with no fresh air, the risk to others is very severe indeed. Just one person shedding the virus in that area would create problems for quite a few people."" Sir David explains that it is crucial to keep an eye on the daily rate of infection and argues the current number of new cases in England is far too high to consider changing the distancing guidance. He also describes the NHS England test and trace programme as ""not fit for purpose"" - and stresses that it needs to improve significantly in order to allow any relaxation of public health advice.

explains he was more optimistic that a full-time return to school will be
possible than he was five weeks ago, when asked about the change in position. He says the
sustained nature of reduction in cases, particularly given the easing of
lockdown in the end of May, led to todayâs announcement. âWe should

be looked at will include face coverings, Perspex barriers and testing of teachers. Mr Swinney
also highlighted the example in the Netherlands where no physical distancing
was required by pupils in primary schools, but staff were still expected to maintain
it. Scottish schools are planning to reopen fully in August with no physical distancing if coronavirus is suppressed. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Sir Tom Hunter earlier said he liked aspects of the report drafted by Benny Higgins onrecommendations for Scotland's economic recovery. But the well-known businessman said there was not enough focus on entrepreneurship and said he had submitted his own ideas to the Scottish government, along with the offer of financial backing. Sir Tom told BBC Radio Scotland that the Higgins report was ""beginning to get realistic about what is ahead"" and he praised the proposal of a jobs guarantee for 16 to 25-year-olds. However, he added that Mr Higgins ""doesn't seem to have listened to the job creators"". Sir Tom's own suggestions are a list of ""things we can do
tomorrow"", with an emphasis on start-up businesses, which will need money and mentorship, which he said he was prepared to help fund. He said he was willing to put ""millions behind this"" but adds he is still waiting for a government reply six weeks on from delivering his document. Mr Flannagan says nobody should have to risk their lives when mitigating measures can be put in place. The use of face coverings by pupils must be looked at, he adds. Proactive testing of teachers must be looked at and perspex screens must be considered so schools remain safe places, says the general secretary of the EIS. ""We would need to be strongly persuaded that social distancing could be set aside in schools,"" Mr Flannagan tells Drivetime. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The general secretary of the EIS Larry Flannagan says it's a well caveated statement from Mr Swinney on the reopening of Schools.

However it's seven weeks away and ""who knows exactly where we'll be"", adds the representative of Scotland's largest teachers' union. it's a mistake I  think to believe that the Covid virus has disappeared. I think its still very prevelant in our society. So we do need to be cautious.

Prior from parents group Connect says safety of staff and children will be most
important in getting pupils back to school in August. She
also said there needed to be some thought given to children who will not be
able to return, where schools and local authorities must work with families. Overall,
she said todayâs announcement was âgood news because parents have been listened
to."" As an organisation, we felt parents' voices have been pretty well ignored throughout the last three months as the recovery group has been working away, coming up with plans which would have meant many families simply could not have returned to work, couldnât have returned to any kind of normal life, and would have ended up with many parents having to make a choice between working and staying home to look after their children.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsLockdown relaxed in England as 2m rule easedPubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers can open from 4 July in England, as social distancing rules easedUK","Pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers can open from 4 July in England, when social distancing rules will be eased. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should remain 2m apart where possible but a ""one metre plus"" rule would be introduced. Two households in England will also be able to meet indoors and stay overnight - with social distancing. The prime minister warned that all the steps were ""reversible"". The government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said the relaxation represented a ""reasonable balance of risk"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford and Northern Ireland's Arlene Foster have said the 2m rule will remain in place in their nations for the time being. Theatres, cinemas, libraries, museums, theme parks and zoos are among other businesses that can also reopen. But indoor gyms, swimming pools, nail bars and indoor play areas will remain closed for the moment, as they have been since lockdown started on 23 March. During the government's final daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Johnson said ""task forces"" were being established to work out how they too could reopen. Lifting lockdown: All you need to know 'There will be a shortage of holiday cottages' Hairdresser: 'We've built a waiting list of over 2,000 people' The meeting of households will not be exclusive so, for example, one set of grandparents could see their relatives one weekend, and the other set of grandparents the next. But, unlikethe bubble system, people will have to maintain social distance - so family members who live apart will not be able to hug. In a statement in the Commons earlier, Mr Johnson said people would be encouraged to use ""mitigation"" - such as face coverings and not sitting face-to-face - when less than 2m from each other but ""where it is possible to keep 2m apart, people should"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson is cheered as he announces English pubs can reopen from 4 July Prof Whitty warned ""we will get an uptick"" if people did not take such measures seriously. And Mr Johnson urged people to be vigilant, saying the virus ""wants to take advantage of our carelessness"". He said there would be local outbreaks in the future - and that he would not hesitate to reverse the changes at local or national level if the virus were to begin to run out of control. The venues listed as being able to reopen include: Pubs, bars and restaurantsbut only with a table service indoors, and owners will be asked to keep contact details of customers to help with contact tracing Hotels, holiday apartments, campsites and caravan parksbut shared facilities must be cleaned properly Theatres and music hallsbut they will not be allowed to hold live performances In other changesweddingswill be allowed to have 30 attendees, andplaces of worshipwill be allowed to hold services but singing will be banned Hair salonsandbarberswill be able to reopen but must have protective measures, such as visors, in place Libraries, community centresandbingo halls Cinemas,museumsandgalleries Funfairs, theme parks, adventure parks, amusement arcades, skating rinksandmodel villages Indoor attractions where animals are exhibited, such as atzoos,aquariums,farms,safari parksandwildlife centres The following places will remain closed by law Nightclubs and casinos Bowling alleys and indoor skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft-play Spas Nail bars and beauty salons Massage, tattoo and piercing parlours Indoor fitness and dance studios, and indoor gyms and sports venues/facilities - although Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden tweeted that ministers hope to be able to reopen gyms and leisure facilities in mid-July Swimming pools and water parks Exhibition or conference centres - other than for those who work for that venue. Read more detail on how lockdown measures are easing in England here. Responding to Mr Johnson's statement on Tuesday afternoon, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""I believe the government is trying to do the right thing and in that I support them"". He added he thought it was ""safe for some children to return to school"" after the PM said schools in Englandshould return in full in September. In Scotland,schools are aiming to reopenfull-time in August, in Walessome schools will resumefor just three weeks later this month, while Northern Irelandhas a 24 August targetfor full reopening. Restrictions have to lift at some point. The big question is whether the UK is moving too soon. The number of infections has fallen dramatically. There are now just over 1,000 new cases a day on average. That compares with an estimated 100,000 at the peak at the end of March - we don't know the exact figure because there was limited testing in place. Huge progress has, therefore, been made. But the number of infections is still significantly higher than other countries. France and Germany are seeing fewer than half the number of infections that the UK is (and Germany has a larger population), while Italy has fewer than a quarter. It is why there are plenty of experts, including former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, voicing concern that restrictions are easing too quickly. But, of course, not lifting them comes at a cost too - to the economy, to people's health and wellbeing and to wider society. At the end of the day, it is a finely balanced judgement call. We will only know whether it was the right one or not in the weeks and months to come. Current evidence suggests being 1m apart carries between two and 10 times the risk of being 2m apart,scientists advising the government have said.,external Under new guidance, the government wants people to keep 2m apart where they can. If not, to remain at least 1m apart while taking steps to reduce the risk of transmission. They include measures such as not sitting face-to-face, cutting the number of people in an enclosed space, or having hand-sanitiser available to use. Mr Johnson stressed that the government was not ""forcing"" people to limit their social contact through legislation, but was ""asking them to follow guidance"". Police would still be able to ""break up large and irresponsible gatherings"", he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Earlier, he said it was each nation's own responsibility to make their own lockdown restrictions but said all parts of the UK were now ""travelling in the same direction"". Scotland not yet ready to relax 2m distance rule NI pupils to follow 1m social distancing at schools Wales will only changed 2m rule 'when safe' The prime minister added he did not believe there was ""a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS"". A further 171 deaths were reported in the UK on Tuesday, taking the total to 42,927, while latest testing figures showed there were 874 new positive cases. According to the latest official figures, the R value for the UK  - the average number of people that one infected person passes the virus on to - is between 0.7 and 0.9. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, who also spoke at the briefing, said the public should not ""be fooled"" into thinking that the virus had ""gone away"". ""The disease is growing across the world,"" he said. Prof Whitty said he would be ""surprised and delighted if we weren't in this current situation through the winter and into next spring"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: ""This is not a return back to normal business, but it is a very big moment, and a step to a new normal. ""One important point to note though, as I understand it, the advice from the government will still be that people should work at home if they can."" By Alice Evans, BBC News Shop owner Rezia isn't optimistic that business will improve for him when other places re-open Brixton looks almost normal this afternoon. Plenty of the market stalls are open, there's a steady stream of shoppers, and blaring music is coming from several shops. So far, so Brixton. But the many boarded-up businesses down the backstreets of this buzzing south-London neighbourhood are a tell-tale sign of the effect lockdown has had on trade. Some local firms have welcomed the prime minister's news. The Duke of Edinburgh pub, for example, is busy making its huge beer garden Covid-secure, with staff ""really excited"" for their customers to return. The customers are similarly keen - the pub's booking website crashed minutes after the prime minister's announcement. But others aren't so enthused. Fabric shop owner Rezia (pictured above) is happy with the 2m rule being relaxed to 1m, but is convinced business will remain ""slow"" for him. It doesn't matter that more people will be out and about spending money - they are not going to buy fabric, he says, on their way home from the pub. Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said he was ""extremely pleased"" that pubs were reopening after a long hiatus. ""We are going to discuss the precise government proposals with our pub managers and staff before we comment further on the details."" UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said reopening was the best way to secure business and jobs - but warned that social distancing constraints would mean some businesses were unviable, and government support remained ""crucial"". Glenn Earlam, chief executive of David Lloyd gyms, said he was disappointed by the announcement, since preparations had been under way for the sector to reopen from 4 July. ""For the last three weeks we've been working on an awful lot of detail,"" he said. ""Everything from temperature checks of our members when they arrive at reception, to screens at reception, to hand sanitisation, to an extreme cleaning regime."" An instant online poll carried out by YouGov shortly after Mr Johnson's announcement suggested 64% of people supported the reopening of the specified sectors and 73% backed the decision to allow two households to meet indoors.

"Cinemas and museums set to reopen in EnglandPubs can also open up following a review of the 2m distancing rule, Boris Johnson is expected to say.","Galleries, cinemas and museums will be able to reopen from 4 July, the prime minister is expected to announce on Tuesday Cinemas, museums and galleries will be able to reopen in England from 4 July, Boris Johnson is expected to announce on Tuesday as he outlines a further easing of coronavirus restrictions. Venues closed since the middle of March will be able to welcome visitors as long as safety measures are in place. The PM is also due to set out how pubs can safely reopen following a review of the 2m distancing rule. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday the virus was ""in retreat"". Mr Hancock said England was ""clearly on track"" to further ease lockdown restrictions but No 10 warned the moves would be reversed if they led to a surge in new infections. There werefewer than 1,000 confirmed new casesannounced on Monday, the lowest daily figure since the lockdown started on 23 March, while the number of people in hospital with the virus has fallen below 5,000. The number of daily virus deaths also fell to 15, the lowest since 15 March. However, the figures often dip on Mondays due to reporting delays. Office for National Statistics figures show the number of overall deaths in England and Wales for the week ending 12 June was back below 10,000 for the first time this year, although still not back to normal levels. There were 9,976 deaths registered in England and Wales, down from 10,709 the previous week - 6% above the five year average. 'I'm really anxious about reopening' Tory MPs urge change in 2m social distancing rule Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? How lockdown is being lifted across Europe On Monday, the prime minister discussed the changes with the Covid-19 strategy committee, attended by the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty. He is expected to announce the plans in Parliament at about 12:30 BST. Mr Johnson is expected to say the 2m (6ft 6in) social distancing rule will be reduced to 1m (3ft 3in) from 4 July, with some mitigating measures. This will enable many pubs, restaurants, hotels and B&Bs to reopen for the first time in more than three months. Current evidence suggests being 1m apart carries between two and 10 times the risk of being 2m apart,scientists advising the government say,external. Boris Johnson's words today will represent more than a different notch on a measuring tape, more than another kind of business being able to open its own doors in England, and more than the government moving into the final official phase of its so called roadmap set out weeks ago. Coronavirus has bestowed grief on tens of thousands of families and is bringing recession to the whole UK. And it has also pushed the capabilities of the Westminster government, arguably, beyond its limits - buffeting ministers' reputations and raising questions about their grip. Now with the threat to health receding, and the economic danger very real, the political calculus has moved enough to allow the next phase to begin. Ministers used to boast they were following the science. But that complicated advice was a guide, never a medical diktat. The decisions on how and when to react to the pandemic were always for the politicians to take. The government's ambition now is to move steadily towards a more recognisable way of life that gives a chance, ministers hope, to give them, not the virus itself, control. Read more from Laurahere. The government has come under pressure from the hospitality sector, and some Conservative MPs, to relax the 2m rule, with many saying it would be impossible to trade under the current measures. Labour said its support would depend on employees having adequate protective equipment, such as face shields, and there being an effective testing and tracing system in place. This video can not be played One and two metre social distancing - what does it look like? Ministers have not ruled out customers having to register when entering pubs and bars so they can easily be tracked down if they come into contact with a person infected with coronavirus. Peter Borg Neal, chief executive of pub chain Oakman Inns, told Radio 4's Today programme that 1m social distancing was ""still very problematic"" but would allow most pubs to open. ""We hope to prove very quickly to government that pubs will be a safe environment and they can ease restrictions further in due course,"" he said. As part of the government's recovery plan, some arts and entertainment venues are also likely to be able to open their doors from 4 July but only if they follow guidance to ensure they are ""Covid secure"". They will be expected to minimise face-to-face contact by requiring customers to pre-book tickets, to stand in spaced queues and to enter and leave through different areas. Screens could be put up to minimise the risk to staff while ventilation systems will be improved. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Gallery directors have said they are ""incredibly excited"" to reopen and hope the public will be hungry for culture after three months. Simon Martin, director of Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, West Sussex, told Today: ""I think many are going to feel quite emotional when they come. But for us we really want our visitors to feel welcome, feel safe and have an enjoyable time. We are working very hard to ensure that although we sanitise the building we don't sanitise the experience."" Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said the public health community was ""very anxious"" about the pace of changes, adding that the UK still has a far higher number of cases than other European countries. ""I don't think we're in the position where we have a fully functioning track and trace [system] to give us the confidence that if we start to see cases rise again we can contain it,"" she told the BBC's Newsnight programme. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told the Today programme that the government will be issuing guidelines to businesses on how to manage safety. ""The reality is we're all going to have to get used to this new kind of normal as we go forward...where we have to take some self-responsibility to ensure the safety of ourselves, our friends, our family, and the people in our community,"" he said. The other nations of the UK are yet to announce any plans to change the 2m distance rule for the hospitality industry. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has asked scientific advisers toreview the circumstancesin which it might be reduced alongside ""additional mitigations"". In Northern Ireland, where hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes are set to reopen from 3 July, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said she isopen to changing it. Schools will be able tofollow 1m social distancing measures when they reopen in August. A change has alsonot been ruled outin Wales - where First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would support a reduction if Welsh advisers said it was safe. The World Health Organization recommends a distance of at least 1m.

Here is a quick roundup of the key updates: We've spent quite a bit of today updating you on the easing of coronavirus restrictions which will come into force in England on 4 July. But it's worth remembering that there are currently different lockdown rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and devolved governments are easing restrictions at a different rate to Westminster. For example, in England, where it is not possible to maintain the 2m social distancing rule, people should keep a distance of""one metre plus"" from 4 July.But in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the 2m ruleremains in placefor now.

Margaret completing her fundraising effort In Scotland, a 90-year-old woman has completed a two-month-long fundraising challenge that saw her climb a mountain -from the comfort of her own home. Margaret Payne has climbed the equivalent of Highland mountain Suilven - 731m (2,398ft) - with trips upstairs at her Sutherland home. Mrs Payne, from Ardvar, first climbed Suilven, in the west of Sutherland at the age of 15 in 1944. Her challenge started on 12 April and took almost 300 trips to complete. Inspired by the fundraising efforts of war veteran Captain Tom Moore, she has achieved more than Â£347,000 for the NHS, Highland Hospice and Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). From 4 July, friends and families can be reunited, people can enjoy a pint at the pub or a meal in a restaurant - or even a stay-cation - as part of an easing to England's coronavirus lockdown. The 2m social distancing rule has been changed so that if it's not possible to maintain this a ""one metre plus"" space will be acceptable if certain precautions are taken such as the use of face coverings. Under the changes, two households of any size will be permitted to meet in any setting - inside or out - and can stay overnight. People will also be able to enjoy a taste of life's bigger moments, withweddings of up to 30 people permitted in Englandfrom early July. They had been banned under almost all circumstances since lockdown began on 23 March. After three months of binge-watching boxsets from the sofa, people craving something different will alsobe able to go to the cinema,with top UK cinema chain Showcase opening on 4 July and Vue, Cineworld and Picturehouse reopening on 10 July. But the cinema experience will be different, with new safety measures such as limited numbers in each screen, socially distanced seating for those from different households and staggered start and finished times to avoid congestion in foyers. The mega-church in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Donald Trump is due to speak later today has been criticised for claiming that its air filtration system takes ""particulants"" out of the air so that ""Covid cannot live in that environment"". ""So when you come into our auditorium, 99% of Covid is gone, killed, if it was there in the first place,"" Dream City Church pastor Luke Barnett said in a video posted on Twitter on Monday. ""You can know when you come here, you'll be safe and protected. Thank God for great technology and thank God for being proactive."" Numerous health experts say that although a filter will help clean the air, it does not prevent the spread of the virus on surfaces or the ongoing emission of potentially virus-contaminated respiratory droplets from attendees via coughs and sneezes. The mayor of Phoenix has criticised the event for going ahead at all, saying the city has neither ""sanctioned nor permitted"" it to happen. The 3,000 young people whom Trump will be addressing will comply with the Phoenix city ordinance passed on Friday requiring masks in crowded places, a Students for Trump spokesman told the Arizona Republic newspaper. EU officials are considering who to allow into the union from 1 July, and Americans may not be accepted,according to draft lists seen by the New York Times newspaper,external. Their assessment is to be based on how travellers' countries of origin are tackling the pandemic, the newspaper reports. The lists - supplied by EU officials anonymously - are also said to include China, Russia and Brazil. The US currently has the world's largest number of cases with more than 2.3 million reported and more than 120,000 deaths, according to figures collated byJohns Hopkins University,external. Earlier, a top US health official, Dr Anthony Fauci, told Congress that the US response was a ""mixed bag"" due to the nation's diversity, and that some states were now ""seeing a disturbing surge of infection"". US travellers have been banned from entering the union since mid-March when lockdowns were imposed on most of the continent. Two more members of the Trump campaign have tested positive for coronavirus days after his rally on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It comes after six members of his team tested positive hours before the event. ""After another round of testing for campaign staff in Tulsa, two additional members of the advance team tested positive for the coronavirus,"" campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. ""These staff members attended the rally but were wearing masks during the entire event. Upon the positive tests, the campaign immediately activated established quarantine and contact tracing protocols."" Trump was criticised for holding the rally amidst the pandemic, and attendees had to sign waivers saying they accepted the risk of contracting Covid-19 at the event. Today, Trump will be speaking at a mega-church in Arizona. Mark EastonHome editor An instant online poll in the hours immediately after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement on easing the lockdown in England suggests people are generally supportive of the changes. Pollsters YouGov asked 2,200 people adults for their reaction. On reopening pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, cinemas and other venues â 64% say they think it is a good idea, with 29% reckoning it is too soon. There was a similar broad agreement with the plan to allow two households to meet indoors - 73% support the change with just 20% opposing the idea. The snap survey suggests the governmentâs lockdown escape plans have the backing of voters, but there is still a significant minority of people who are concerned that ministers are easing the restrictions too quickly. Just over a third of people in the poll (37%) think the changes go too far. Just under half (47%) believe ministers have got the balance about right and just 7% say the changes donât go far enough. Reality Check Cleaners disinfect the area around the Kaaba in Mecca's Grand Mosque in this 24 April file photo Saudi Arabia won't be allowing foreign visitors to make the annual Islamic pilgrimage, or Hajj, this year because of the risk of coronavirus. So who's likely to be most affected? People normally come from around the world to visit Mecca. But this year, the Saudi authorities say the only non-Saudi pilgrims who can take part are those normally resident in the Kingdom. In 2019, there were a total of 2.49 million pilgrims at the Hajj out of whom 1.8 million were international visitors, according to official Saudi statistics. And the data shows that the number of pilgrims coming from non-Arab countries in Africa and Asia has been growing in the last few years. Each country is normally allocated a specific quota for the Hajj, based on the size of its Muslim population, with Indonesia having the largest number, followed by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Egypt. These countries have all seen increases in coronavirus cases during May and early June, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in particular are reporting large numbers of new cases daily. You can read more on how coronavirus is spreading across the worldhere.   President Vladimir Putin says he will increase taxes for wealthy Russian citizens as the country tackles the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In a televised address to the nation today, Putin proposed an increase in the annual rate of income tax from
13% to 15% on earnings above five million roubles (Â£58,228; $72,833). It will be the first time that Russia will have increased the rate since a flat tax rate was introduced in 2001. The president, whose approval rating has fallen to an all-time low, said the changes would add an extra 60 billion roubles to the budget and could come into effect on 1 January 2021. There are currently almost 600,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Russia, and 8,349 reported deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Because of the pandemic, millions of children have spent much more time online in recent months The Covid-19 pandemic and school closures mean that in the last three months, millions of children have spent much more time online. Now the UN's International Telecommunications Union (ITU) hasissued new guidelines,externalthat it says should help to ensure that childrenâs internet experience is educational, fun and above all safe. It says the  guidelines offer a blueprint to specific groups, from parents to teachers to industry to children themselves to help protect children from cyber-crime and from sexual exploitation. Children are online at an ever younger age, and parents find it increasingly challenging to supervise their access: where families once shared a household computer, now everyone has their own smartphones, tablets and laptops. The new ITU guidelines offer information to teachers and parents on firewalls and filtering, to children on what to do if they view things online that make them uncomfortable, and to industry on incorporating childrenâs rights and child protection into all their company operations.  Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson gave the first of the daily updates on 16 March. It feels like a different era. The prime minister had already warned that some people would
lose loved ones before their time. Itâs unlikely he was anticipating being in ICU himself
the following month. But now just as the nation ""emerges from
hibernation"", government ministers are withdrawing from daily public view, although ""significant announcements"" will still be subject to
media scrutiny. Today, the scientists seemed absolutely determined not to go out on a
high. Sir Patrick Vallance stressed infections were not down to
zero. The virus has not gone away â and most of the nation is
still susceptible to it. Chris Whitty still advised people to stay 2m apart in
England, where possible, and reminded us we could be living with the virus until
this time next year, so some restrictions may have to return. And this is the political risk for the prime minister. Boris Johnson said today he takes responsibility for his
decisions. While he will get plaudits for restarting the economy, if, subsequently, he does ""have to apply the handbrake
and reverse"" (and just imagine the screeching noise your car would make
if you did that) his handling of the pandemic will come under even greater
scrutiny. Even without daily
press conferences. Reality Check The prime minister was asked by Christine in Lincoln about coronavirus outbreaks in meat processing factories. She wanted to know why this was happening and what was being done to protect the public from âcontaminated meatâ. The governmentâs chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the environment in meat processing factories âis a difficult oneâ because it is cold, it is difficult to keep workers apart, it is noisy so people may have to shout and there are communal areas where people gather. On the question of whether the meat itself could be a âvectorâ â or way of transmitting Covid-19 â he passed on the judgement of the Food Standards Agency that this risk is âvery lowâ. You can read more about the factors helping spread coronavirus in meat processing plants in the UK and in other countrieshere. Continuing his testimony to congress, top US disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci says that he is âcautiously optimisticâ a vaccine may be ready by the end of 2020. He said it is a matter of âwhen and not ifâ the vaccine is ready, but added that it ""might take some time"". Drug company Moderna has plans âto launch a Phase 3 clinical trial as early as July 2020, pending positive results from this Phase 2 trial,â Fauci added. He added that it is crucially important that Americans get a flu jab this year. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield also called on Americans to ""embrace flu vaccinations with confidence"". ""This single act will save lives,"" he said. Today marked the end of the daily government press conferences. From now on, the government says it will only hold a briefing when it has something to announce. Today's conference was held by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Here's what they told us: Reality Check It has now been a month since the government last announced how many individuals are being tested every day. Instead, they are only releasing numbers for the number of tests delivered. This matters, because the number of tests data includes people who may have been swabbed twice as well as tests sent in the post but not necessarily returned. The result is that the number of tests is far higher than the number of people tested. For example, as of 22 May â the last date we had the statistics â the numbers showed that 3.2m tests had been done or sent out, but only 2.1m people individuals had actually been tested. The UK Statistics Authority has previously criticised the government for their use of testing statistics. The Department of Health and Social Care has previously said that the release of the number was âtemporarily paused"" because of problems with double counting in the data. Boris Johnson concludes this final daily briefing by saying the UK is improving all the time at fighting the virus. He praises the public for their efforts and looks to the possibility of drugs being developed, with the UK ""playing a lead role"". And the PM says the NHS test and trace scheme could be a ""real game changer"" in the fight against coronavirus. He concludes: ""Although the virus is the same and just as dangerous as it was, we are now better at dealing with it. ""This virus is still out there. The only way to beat it is to stay alert, follow the guidance and save lives"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Their assessment is to be based on how travellers' countries of origin are tackling the pandemic, the newspaper reports. The lists - supplied by EU officials anonymously - are also said to include China, Russia and Brazil. The US currently has the world's largest number of cases with more than 2.3 million reported and more than 120,000 deaths, according to figures collated byJohns Hopkins University,external. Earlier, a top US health official, Dr Anthony Fauci, told Congress that the US response was a ""mixed bag"" due to the nation's diversity, and that some states were now ""seeing a disturbing surge of infection"". US travellers have been banned from entering the union since mid-March when lockdowns were imposed on most of the continent. Two more members of the Trump campaign have tested positive for coronavirus days after his rally on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It comes after six members of his team tested positive hours before the event. ""After another round of testing for campaign staff in Tulsa, two additional members of the advance team tested positive for the coronavirus,"" campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. ""These staff members attended the rally but were wearing masks during the entire event. Upon the positive tests, the campaign immediately activated established quarantine and contact tracing protocols."" Trump was criticised for holding the rally amidst the pandemic, and attendees had to sign waivers saying they accepted the risk of contracting Covid-19 at the event. Today, Trump will be speaking at a mega-church in Arizona. Mark EastonHome editor An instant online poll in the hours immediately after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement on easing the lockdown in England suggests people are generally supportive of the changes. Pollsters YouGov asked 2,200 people adults for their reaction. On reopening pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, cinemas and other venues â 64% say they think it is a good idea, with 29% reckoning it is too soon. There was a similar broad agreement with the plan to allow two households to meet indoors - 73% support the change with just 20% opposing the idea. The snap survey suggests the governmentâs lockdown escape plans have the backing of voters, but there is still a significant minority of people who are concerned that ministers are easing the restrictions too quickly. Just over a third of people in the poll (37%) think the changes go too far. Just under half (47%) believe ministers have got the balance about right and just 7% say the changes donât go far enough. Reality Check Cleaners disinfect the area around the Kaaba in Mecca's Grand Mosque in this 24 April file photo Saudi Arabia won't be allowing foreign visitors to make the annual Islamic pilgrimage, or Hajj, this year because of the risk of coronavirus. So who's likely to be most affected? People normally come from around the world to visit Mecca. But this year, the Saudi authorities say the only non-Saudi pilgrims who can take part are those normally resident in the Kingdom. In 2019, there were a total of 2.49 million pilgrims at the Hajj out of whom 1.8 million were international visitors, according to official Saudi statistics. And the data shows that the number of pilgrims coming from non-Arab countries in Africa and Asia has been growing in the last few years. Each country is normally allocated a specific quota for the Hajj, based on the size of its Muslim population, with Indonesia having the largest number, followed by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Egypt. These countries have all seen increases in coronavirus cases during May and early June, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in particular are reporting large numbers of new cases daily. You can read more on how coronavirus is spreading across the worldhere.   President Vladimir Putin says he will increase taxes for wealthy Russian citizens as the country tackles the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In a televised address to the nation today, Putin proposed an increase in the annual rate of income tax from
13% to 15% on earnings above five million roubles (Â£58,228; $72,833). It will be the first time that Russia will have increased the rate since a flat tax rate was introduced in 2001. The president, whose approval rating has fallen to an all-time low, said the changes would add an extra 60 billion roubles to the budget and could come into effect on 1 January 2021. There are currently almost 600,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Russia, and 8,349 reported deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Because of the pandemic, millions of children have spent much more time online in recent months The Covid-19 pandemic and school closures mean that in the last three months, millions of children have spent much more time online. Now the UN's International Telecommunications Union (ITU) hasissued new guidelines,externalthat it says should help to ensure that childrenâs internet experience is educational, fun and above all safe. It says the  guidelines offer a blueprint to specific groups, from parents to teachers to industry to children themselves to help protect children from cyber-crime and from sexual exploitation. Children are online at an ever younger age, and parents find it increasingly challenging to supervise their access: where families once shared a household computer, now everyone has their own smartphones, tablets and laptops. The new ITU guidelines offer information to teachers and parents on firewalls and filtering, to children on what to do if they view things online that make them uncomfortable, and to industry on incorporating childrenâs rights and child protection into all their company operations.  Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson gave the first of the daily updates on 16 March. It feels like a different era. The prime minister had already warned that some people would
lose loved ones before their time. Itâs unlikely he was anticipating being in ICU himself
the following month. But now just as the nation ""emerges from
hibernation"", government ministers are withdrawing from daily public view, although ""significant announcements"" will still be subject to
media scrutiny. Today, the scientists seemed absolutely determined not to go out on a
high. Sir Patrick Vallance stressed infections were not down to
zero. The virus has not gone away â and most of the nation is
still susceptible to it. Chris Whitty still advised people to stay 2m apart in
England, where possible, and reminded us we could be living with the virus until
this time next year, so some restrictions may have to return. And this is the political risk for the prime minister. Boris Johnson said today he takes responsibility for his
decisions. While he will get plaudits for restarting the economy, if, subsequently, he does ""have to apply the handbrake
and reverse"" (and just imagine the screeching noise your car would make
if you did that) his handling of the pandemic will come under even greater
scrutiny. Even without daily
press conferences. Reality Check The prime minister was asked by Christine in Lincoln about coronavirus outbreaks in meat processing factories. She wanted to know why this was happening and what was being done to protect the public from âcontaminated meatâ. The governmentâs chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the environment in meat processing factories âis a difficult oneâ because it is cold, it is difficult to keep workers apart, it is noisy so people may have to shout and there are communal areas where people gather. On the question of whether the meat itself could be a âvectorâ â or way of transmitting Covid-19 â he passed on the judgement of the Food Standards Agency that this risk is âvery lowâ. You can read more about the factors helping spread coronavirus in meat processing plants in the UK and in other countrieshere. Continuing his testimony to congress, top US disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci says that he is âcautiously optimisticâ a vaccine may be ready by the end of 2020. He said it is a matter of âwhen and not ifâ the vaccine is ready, but added that it ""might take some time"". Drug company Moderna has plans âto launch a Phase 3 clinical trial as early as July 2020, pending positive results from this Phase 2 trial,â Fauci added. He added that it is crucially important that Americans get a flu jab this year. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield also called on Americans to ""embrace flu vaccinations with confidence"". ""This single act will save lives,"" he said. Today marked the end of the daily government press conferences. From now on, the government says it will only hold a briefing when it has something to announce. Today's conference was held by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. Here's what they told us: Reality Check It has now been a month since the government last announced how many individuals are being tested every day. Instead, they are only releasing numbers for the number of tests delivered. This matters, because the number of tests data includes people who may have been swabbed twice as well as tests sent in the post but not necessarily returned. The result is that the number of tests is far higher than the number of people tested. For example, as of 22 May â the last date we had the statistics â the numbers showed that 3.2m tests had been done or sent out, but only 2.1m people individuals had actually been tested. The UK Statistics Authority has previously criticised the government for their use of testing statistics. The Department of Health and Social Care has previously said that the release of the number was âtemporarily paused"" because of problems with double counting in the data. Boris Johnson concludes this final daily briefing by saying the UK is improving all the time at fighting the virus. He praises the public for their efforts and looks to the possibility of drugs being developed, with the UK ""playing a lead role"". And the PM says the NHS test and trace scheme could be a ""real game changer"" in the fight against coronavirus. He concludes: ""Although the virus is the same and just as dangerous as it was, we are now better at dealing with it. ""This virus is still out there. The only way to beat it is to stay alert, follow the guidance and save lives"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Ex-chancellor warns against return to austerity,"Former chancellor Sajid Javid has warned against a return to austerity as the UK economy struggles with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. In a report by the Centre for Policy Studies, he also called for low taxes on business to aid the UK's recovery. The conservative think tank, which was co-founded by Margaret Thatcher, said this should be based on ""a dynamic private sector and low taxes"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said there will be no return to ""austerity"". However, Labour has said the government should have offered more generous support during the crisis. The report by the Centre for Policy Studies said that a quick economic bounce back from the coronavirus crisis is is unlikely. But it said coronavirus emergency spending measures should be stopped, if possible, by April 2021. It said that polls suggest the UK is ""not ready"" to return to austerity measures introduced by former chancellor George Osborne, ""necessary though they were"". How much will coronavirus cost the UK? Where do governments borrow money? Dozens of people 'chasing every job' in poor areas Instead, the report calls for tax to shift away from profits and incomes and towards reformed property tax and tightening tax reliefs ""which unduly favour the wealthy"". National insurance should be given a ""significant temporary"" reduction to make it cheaper for employers to take on staff. Mr Javid, who resigned from the Treasury in February, said ""early hopes of a V-shaped recovery"" had ""proved optimistic"". He predicted that ""some long-term damage to the economy"" had become ""unavoidable"", with as many as 2.5 million people out of work due to the Covid-19 lockdown. But to speed up the rate of people re-entering employment, Mr Javid argued in the After The Virus report, published on Tuesday, that ministers must make it easier for businesses to hire workers. ""If we want to support and stimulate employment, then axiomatically the best option is to cut the payroll tax - employer's National Insurance,"" Mr Javid said. ""Tax employment less, and all other things being equal you will end up with more of it."" Other recommendations made in the report include temporarily cutting VAT and bringing forward ""shovel ready"" infrastructure projects, with Mr Javid arguing that the ""only way out of this crisis is growth"". He joins fellow former chancellor Alistair Darling in calling for an emergency VAT cut to boost consumer spending, a move undertaken by the Labour peer after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr Javid said: ""If we want to secure the strongest possible recovery, it's essential that no stone is left unturned."" The Labour Party, in areport in March,externalon the economic effects of coronavirus, criticised the government for acting too slowly and said it should underwrite a bigger proportion of wages for those who lose their jobs. 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented?

Pubs fear that new opening rules won't save them,"It's the moment we've all been waiting for. The government is expected to announce measures that will allow pubs, restaurants, cinemas, galleries and theatres to re-open under relaxed but still constraining rules on the 4th of July. It's not quite social Independence Day, but the expected announcement that social distancing measures that require two metres distance in most settings will be relaxed to one metre has been welcomed by the hospitality industry as ""an important staging post"". It's ""a helpful moment for the national psyche"", according to Kate Nicholls, head of the trade group UK Hospitality. But the champagne is still on ice. And could yet be put back in the economic refrigerator. Pubs in the UK are among hospitality businesses that have been closed for months ""We are only able to move forward this week because the vast majority of people have taken steps to control the virus,"" a number 10 spokesman told the BBC. ""But the more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. We will not hesitate to reverse these steps if it is necessary to stop the virus running out of control."" Many establishments are straining at the leash to re-open. Peter Borg-Neal, who runs 28 pubs has already provocatively said he intends to re-open on 4 July whether or not the government gives him the green light. Others are less gung ho. Several pubs and restaurants have told me they do not see the point of re-opening even under one metre distancing rules as it will be impossible to police and the business would still lose money. That's the supply side of the equation - the other side is demand. Most of us want to go out for a drink or a meal or a film but how many would actually step through the door? Recent polling by Ipsos Mori found that six out of 10 people would feel uncomfortable returning to a pub or restaurant. Some operators feel that the government's re-opening guidelines - that are expected to accompany tomorrow's announcement - may be counter-productive.  3rdlargest UK employer in 2018 3.2 millionworkers in the sector 99%of hospitality businesses are SMEs Â£130bnannual turnover in 2018 67%expect it will be ""months"" before going to a restaurant ""Single use menus, banning condiments, insisting on mask wearing - you are making people afraid of using a pepper pot. We have to persuade people there is nothing to fear,"" said Jonathan Downey, head of street food venue operator London Union and head of lobbying group Hospitality Union. There are other major concerns. Once people have had a few drinks, who will police the social distancing measures that are expected in the guidelines,  even at one metre. ""To think that a young bar tender could do that is nuts"" said one pub owner. And what about the legal position? Could a hospitality venue owner be sued if someone contracted the virus and blamed the management for a potentially life-threatening condition? On this point there is good and bad news for the industry, according to Kate Nicholls, head of Hospitality UK. The bad news for venues is that no insurer will touch that risk with a barge pole. The good news is that it will be almost impossible to establish whether the virus was in fact contracted on the premises. Going to the pub will be entirely at the pub-goers risk. But not opening hospitality venues will represent a grave risk to the economy and up to 3 million jobs. Everyone wants the semblance of normality that a further easing of social lockdown measures will bring. But as the government has made clear, if things don't go to plan and the virus sees another surge it may be too soon to pull up all those two metre distancing tapes on the floor and call time on this health, social and economic menace. Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? What are the social distancing rules? What will pubs, cafes and gigs be like from 19 July?

"Shopping centre owner braces for administrationOwner of Trafford Centre and Lakeside shopping centres appoints administrators KPMG as ""contingency"".Business","Intu, owner of the Trafford, Braehead and Lakeside shopping centres, is warning its financial troubles could see entire sites shut. It has lined up administrators KPMG as a ""contingency"" in case financial restructuring talks with lenders fail. Intu warns that if that happens it will have to give KPMG funds for certain services, or see the centres shut. The company is the biggest shopping centre chain in the UK with 17 UK outlets and three in Spain. Intu has until Friday to sort out a new financial footing. The company said: ""In the event that Intu properties plc is unable to reach a standstill, it is likely it and certain other central entities will fall into administration. Intu owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester ""If that happened, the various group companies would have to put money into the administrator. If the administrator is not pre-funded then there is a risk that centres may have to close for a period."" Intu's group companies provide key services to the sites, from lighting and cleaning to health and safety systems, security and essential maintenance. Intu had been struggling before coronavirus to fill outlets within some centres sites and had heavy debts. It said in March it was in talks with lenders about new funding. On Tuesday, Intu said ""notwithstanding the progress made"" it had appointed KPMG to plan for administration. Since the coronavirus lockdown Intu's centres have been partially shut, with only essential stores remaining open. The company had about 60% of shopping centre staff and about 20% of head office employees on furlough. Shopping centre giant Intu warns it could go bust The firm's financial woes include making a loss of Â£2bn in 2019, failing earlier this year to raise Â£1bn in new funding, and having debts of Â£5bn. The collapse and contraction of High Street retailers in the face of rising costs and the seemingly ever-increasing online shopping trend had already seen retailers closing outlets, leaving a number of landlords, such as Intu, struggling to fill empty space. Many among the remainder are finding it harder to meet rent payments. Retail consultant Kate Hardcastle said the writing had been on the wall for such centres for some time. ""Intu's model is heavily dependent on big box retailers paying rent for big retail spaces, and with the rise and rise of online and consumer spending shifting to travel and experience rather than pure retail it was probably on precarious ground."" She added that its shopping centres had become places for ""show-rooming"", where consumers see the products they want, then go home and buy them more cheaply online. The company is well down on normal income levels. Intu's latest update on rent collection said it had received only 40% of rental and service charge income for the first quarter of the year. It had moved from quarterly rent collection to more flexible arrangements with shop owners. Intu has been attempting to sell shopping centres to raise cash and has sold off its outlet in Zaragoza, in Spain.

The retail landlord, still better known to some by its former name, Capital Shopping Centres, has always carried a high level of debt relative to its peers, and the gradual drift away from bricks and mortar shops to the internet left it with less margin for error if a downturn came. But the company still had an impressive list of blue-chip assets - some of the best malls in the UK, a decent defence, most thought, against the predations of online competitors. Just two and a half years ago it was still riding high. Its FTSE 100 rival Hammerson made a takeover approach at 253p a share, valuing Intu as a whole at Â£3.4bn. Intu shares are now at 4.5p, giving the whole company a stock market value of Â£60m. That staggering fall has been caused by that steady erosion of sales away to the internet, and then the shattering blow of the coronavirus. Intu is now collecting one-third less rent at some of its flagship malls than it was a year ago. It is in breach of the conditions of agreements it made with the lenders who financed those individual properties. If it cannot reach a peace deal with those lenders, administration beckons. What happens next is difficult to predict. The management may be able to stitch together an agreement with lenders, in which case it will limp along until it is able to refinance. If administration comes, it could be a messy restructuring, with different lenders holding the whip hand on individual properties. As the company itself points out today, the uncertainties that come with administration could even mean that some of Britain's best-known shopping centres have to close, if only temporarily.

Apple Mac computers make jump to its own chipsThe firm will now custom-design the chips that power its future desktop and laptop computers.,"Tim Cook said it was a ""historic day for the Mac"" Apple has confirmed it will transition its Mac laptop and desktop computers to its own ARM-based processors. The move means that Macs will run on the same type of chips as the firm's iPhones and iPads, rather than Intel's. Intel had faced problems manufacturing its own designs,leading it to issue a public apology to computer-makers,external. Apple's challenge will be to carry off the transition smoothly and convince third-party developers to update their apps accordingly. ""We expect to ship our first Mac with Apple silicon by the end of the year,"" said chief executive Tim Cook, adding that it would likely be two years before its full product line had made the jump. The firm said the move would allow it to offer new features and improved performance as well as making it easier for developers to ""write and optimise software for the entire Apple ecosystem"". The announcement was made at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). ""Apple's motivations for doing this include reducing its dependence on Intel, maximizing its silicon investment, boosting performance and giving itself more flexibility and agility when it comes to future products,"" commented Geoff Blaber from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""Embracing ARM and making its hardware more consistent across the iPhone, iPad and Mac ranges is a strategic necessity, but there will be inevitable bumps along the road."" MacOS was shown running on the current iPad Pro chip, but the new computers will have processors of their own Apple said it had already developed native versions of several of its own apps, including Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro.  iPhone and iPad apps will also be able to be run on the computers. Apple said that Microsoft was working on an optimised version of Office, and Adobe was developing a version of Photoshop. Other developers should be able to recompile their apps to get a version running ""in just a matter of days,"" said the company's software chief Craig Federighi. He added that old apps would automatically be translated at point of installation to run, although they would not work as well. To mark the significance of the move, MacOS will move to version 11. Since 2001, it had only moved from 10.0 to 10.15. Apple successfully made the switch from IBM-Motorola's PowerPC processors to Intel's x86 family in 2006. However, some software was never updated and cannot easily be run on today's Mac computers. Apple dropped support for running older software under emulation in the 2011 release of its Mac operating system. Microsoft already allows Windows 10 to be run on both Intel and ARM-based processors and looks set to continue supporting both chip architectures. Apple has not stated how long it will do the same.

As a result, some people considering buying one of its laptop or desktop computers may decide to postpone a purchase until its first ARM-based computers go on sale. This could hit sales both at Apple and the development studios that make software for the platform. ARM-based chips are based on the designs of the UK-based company, which is headquartered in Cambridge. Other companies then adapt these to add capabilities of their own. Samsung, Qualcomm and Huawei are among the many other companies to do so. Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor, according to market research firm Gartner, coming behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell. The company has said that it has more than 100 million active Mac users. Back in June 2005, when it first announced the move to Intel chips, the figure was about 12.5 million. ""Apple is approximately 4.5% of the laptop market and 2.6% of the desktop market, so the financial impact to Intel will not be significant,"" commented Gartner's Jon Erensen. ""However, this transition... could give momentum to Microsoft's current efforts to run Windows on Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors."" The new version of MacOS, ""Big Sur"", was shown off with design tweaks Existing Mac owners will see changes to the next MacOS operating system - called Big Sur - which Apple said marked its biggest redesign to date. Analysis by James Clayton, North America technology reporter The best way to describe a processor is the brain of the computer. Hardly surprising then that the processor in your computer is kind of important. Changing it is no small thing - and Apple hasn't decided this lightly. The big question though - and the one that if you're reading this you're probably more interested in - is what will this do for Macs in general? The prevailing view in Silicon Valley is moving to Apple silicon will make for more powerful Macs. Bringing it in-house could create cheaper processors - so in theory you could have cheaper Macs (that's if Apple wanted to pass on savings to the consumer). But there are risks too. The first is that Apple still has Intel-based Macs yet to come out. Will people simply wait for Apple's new processor to go live before choosing to buy a new computer? And - considering how well Mac products sell there will be a nervousness about changing a formula that has worked very well for Apple for the last 15 years. Other announcements at WWDC included the ability to use an iPhone as a substitute for a car key by transmitting an NFC (near-field communication) signal to unlock doors and start the engine. This will initially be limited to some new BMWs, but the firm said it intended to expand to other models in time. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One of the biggest changes to the iPhone's iOS14 operating system will be a shake-up of the home screen. Apps can now be automatically organised into folders containing: suggested apps, which are based on past habits recently downloaded items themed downloads, for example games In addition, the firm is updating its ""widgets"" - blocks that display a stripped-down, small app window - so that they can be placed among the icons for other programs. Examples included weather forecasts, news briefings, and calendar meetings. Android already has something similar. Another Android-like new feature is the introduction of App Clips, which allow part of a program to be downloaded quickly. These must be less than 10 megabytes in size and will be able to be triggered via an NFC-transmission or by scanning a QR code. Suggested uses included the ability to order a drink in a cafe or to pay for a car-parking space. ""App Clips"" are lightweight apps that can be launched easily, without installing, for immediate functionality Apple is also releasing a new app called Translate that carries out language translations offline, offering an alternative to Google Translate. It will support 11 languages to begin with including English, Mandarin, French, German, and Arabic. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'One in six UK car industry jobs could be lost',"The UK car industry's trade body says one in six jobs are at risk of redundancy without help from the government in restarting production. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said emergency funding, permanent short-time working, business rate holidays, and VAT cuts are needed to stem the flow of job losses. Showrooms are reopening and production lines are restarting, it said. But more than 6,000 jobs have been lost in the automotive sector this month. In common with many manufacturers, carmakers have high fixed costs to pay, such as rent, during a period where sales are sharply down. And many workers remain furloughed as companies work out how to operate while allowing for social distancing. ""A third of our workforce remains furloughed, and we want those staff coming back to work, not into redundancy,"" said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive. ""Government's intervention has been unprecedented,"" he added. ""But the job isn't done yet. Just as we have seen in other countries, we need a package of support to restart; to build demand, volumes and growth, and keep the UK at the forefront of the global automotive industry."" The lobby group estimates the impact of lockdown will cut annual car and light commercial vehicle production by one-third to 920,000 vehicles this year. As well as assistance to restart production, the industry is anxious about securing a trade deal with the EU. Mr Hawes told the BBC's Today programme that UK car manufacturers could not afford to pay import tariffs on components arriving in the UK from abroad, as the cost would be more than their profit margin. He added: ""It is vitally important that the government achieves its ambition, which is a trade agreement before the end of the year."" The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains in the single market and customs union until 31 December, while the two sides try to hammer out a trade agreement. ""Certainty that a full, zero-tariff deal will be in place by the end of the transition period will give businesses on both sides chance to prepare, and help drive investment into the new skills, facilities and technologies that will be integral to delivering a zero-carbon future for the UK,"" the lobby group said. British car manufacturing came to a screeching halt in April, down 99.7% against the same month last year. It was the lowest output since World War Two. Just 197 premium and luxury sports vehicles rolled off factory lines, with 45 of those sent to UK customers. Some plants refocused to make 711,495 items of personal protective equipment for health workers. The loss of 400,000 cars that would normally have been made is expected to cost the British car industry up to Â£12.5bn in revenues. In April, there were 830 new car engines made at UK plants, 781 of which were exported. This level was down 99.5% on the year before.

Swinney to set out school reopening plans,"Scottish schools are aiming to reopen full-time with no physical distancing in August if coronavirus continues to be suppressed, John Swinney has said. Schools had been preparing to return with a ""blended"" model of face-to-face teaching and at-home learning. But the education secretary said ""significant progress"" had been made in controlling the spread of the virus. Mr Swinney said ministers were now preparing for all schools to open full-time in August. He had previously targeted having pupils spend at least half their time physically in the classroom, leading to concerns from parents. Opposition parties said the move was a ""u-turn"" and a ""climbdown"" which had been forced by public pressure. And union bosses said other measures would need to be put in place to keep staff and pupils safe, such as the use of face coverings and routine testing of teachers. Live: Watch Mr Swinney's statement to MSPs 'We will accept the risks for full-time school' Teachers urge caution over reopening of schools Schools have faced difficulty in working out how to bring pupils back in August while maintaining the current 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule, leading to the blended learning plans. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has ordered officials to review whether the distancing rule could be relaxed in some circumstances. Northern Ireland is set to usea 1m rule for school pupils, while England will move toa ""one metre plus"" rule from 4 July. Mr Swinney said the blended learning plan was a ""necessary"" contingency plan, drawn up a time when the outlook was ""bleak"" - but that ""the picture looks more positive"" now. He said: ""When we prepared our plans back in May I frankly would not have imagined we would have made as much progress in virus suppression as we have. ""It is this more positive outlook that allows the Scottish government to make this change in planning for schools."" Penni Brown is relieved at the announcement the aim is for full-time schooling in August Penni Brown from Edinburgh is ""so unbelievably relieved"" that the Scottish government is now planning to have all schools back full-time from August. She has five children, two of them dyslexic, and she had to give them a lot of support as online learning was too much for them. She told BBC Scotland: ""I was having to consider resigning from work under blended learning, as with five kids they would all be at school at different times. I felt passionately enough about it to fight for all of Scotland's children, not just my own. ""I don't believe the science justifies ""blended learning"" or social distancing amongst children. I think it may be suitable for teachers to remain socially distanced while allowing children to interact normally. ""My heart was breaking for only children and parents of special needs kids as well as many vulnerable families for whom this is pushing them over the edge."" John Swinney had previously said he wanted to see at least 50% of pupils' time spent physically in school Mr Swinney said full time schooling for all pupils was ""the aim the government is now working towards"", with no physical distancing rules to be enforced in classrooms. However, he stressed that this was strictly conditional on Covid-19 continuing to be suppressed and ""stringent"" safety measures being put in place for staff and pupils. And he said that blended learning may still have to be implemented if infection rates rise again, warning that ""there are no certainties with this virus"". The education secretary also announced an extra Â£100m of funding over two years to help children return to school and ""recover any lost ground"". And he said Â£30m would be spent on laptops for the 70,000 most disadvantaged pupils, amid concerns about the impact of home learning on the attainment gap. Just last Sunday, John Swinney said it was ""unlikely"" schools would return to normal within the coming school year. Today, he has told MSPs that they could return to normal - or something far more akin to it, with no physical distancing at all - within seven weeks. So in a little over a week there has been a remarkable change of tack from the government. It has certainly been enabled by the progress made in suppressing coronavirus, but a key factor will also have been the increasingly vocal concerns of parents - who during that same week were receiving letters from schools underscoring the reality of the ""blended"" learning model. But for all the opposition talk of u-turns and climbdowns, what those parents will ultimately care about is what is actually delivered in classrooms come August. If Mr Swinney's vision of a return to normality can be delivered, the politics around it may largely be forgotten. Council umbrella body Cosla said the statement from Mr Swinney was ""a significant change in direction"". Spokesman Stephen McCabe said local authorities would ""work with the Scottish government, trade unions, parent organisations and children and young people representatives to consider the implications and practicalities of a full time return for pupils in August"". The EIS union said ""a great deal of work at school level has already gone into planning for a blended learning model"" and that there would need to be ""time to adjust plans and conduct revised risk assessments"". General secretary Larry Flanagan said there needed to be ""appropriate mitigations"" to protect staff and pupils, such as the use of face coverings, ""proactive"" testing of teachers and physical distancing between pupils and staff. While opposition parties broadly welcomed the move, they were critical of the government's handling of the issue. As recently as 14 June, Mr Swinney had said it was ""unlikely"" that schools could return to normal within the current school year, suggesting that the2021 exam diet may need to be pushed back. The Scottish Conservatives said the ""screeching u-turn"" had been forced on the government by ""relentless campaigning from all quarters"" and an ""outburst of anger from parents"". Education spokesman Jamie Greene said: ""The sad truth is that until now, recent events have exposed nothing but a complete vacuum of leadership in the handling of this issue."" Scottish Labour accused Mr Swinney of ""the mother and father of all ministerial climb-downs"", with education spokesman Iain Gray saying the government had produced ""a completely new plan at the last possible moment"".

"Cinemas and museums set to reopen in EnglandPubs can also open up following a review of the 2m distancing rule, Boris Johnson is expected to say.UK PoliticsRelated contentIs it safe to relax the 2m rule?Shielding to stop in England on 1 August","Galleries, cinemas and museums will be able to reopen from 4 July, the prime minister is expected to announce on Tuesday Cinemas, museums and galleries will be able to reopen in England from 4 July, Boris Johnson is expected to announce on Tuesday as he outlines a further easing of coronavirus restrictions. Venues closed since the middle of March will be able to welcome visitors as long as safety measures are in place. The PM is also due to set out how pubs can safely reopen following a review of the 2m distancing rule. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday the virus was ""in retreat"". Mr Hancock said England was ""clearly on track"" to further ease lockdown restrictions but No 10 warned the moves would be reversed if they led to a surge in new infections. There werefewer than 1,000 confirmed new casesannounced on Monday, the lowest daily figure since the lockdown started on 23 March, while the number of people in hospital with the virus has fallen below 5,000. The number of daily virus deaths also fell to 15, the lowest since 15 March. However, the figures often dip on Mondays due to reporting delays. Office for National Statistics figures show the number of overall deaths in England and Wales for the week ending 12 June was back below 10,000 for the first time this year, although still not back to normal levels. There were 9,976 deaths registered in England and Wales, down from 10,709 the previous week - 6% above the five year average. 'I'm really anxious about reopening' Tory MPs urge change in 2m social distancing rule Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? How lockdown is being lifted across Europe On Monday, the prime minister discussed the changes with the Covid-19 strategy committee, attended by the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty. He is expected to announce the plans in Parliament at about 12:30 BST. Mr Johnson is expected to say the 2m (6ft 6in) social distancing rule will be reduced to 1m (3ft 3in) from 4 July, with some mitigating measures. This will enable many pubs, restaurants, hotels and B&Bs to reopen for the first time in more than three months. Current evidence suggests being 1m apart carries between two and 10 times the risk of being 2m apart,scientists advising the government say,external. Boris Johnson's words today will represent more than a different notch on a measuring tape, more than another kind of business being able to open its own doors in England, and more than the government moving into the final official phase of its so called roadmap set out weeks ago. Coronavirus has bestowed grief on tens of thousands of families and is bringing recession to the whole UK. And it has also pushed the capabilities of the Westminster government, arguably, beyond its limits - buffeting ministers' reputations and raising questions about their grip. Now with the threat to health receding, and the economic danger very real, the political calculus has moved enough to allow the next phase to begin. Ministers used to boast they were following the science. But that complicated advice was a guide, never a medical diktat. The decisions on how and when to react to the pandemic were always for the politicians to take. The government's ambition now is to move steadily towards a more recognisable way of life that gives a chance, ministers hope, to give them, not the virus itself, control. Read more from Laurahere. The government has come under pressure from the hospitality sector, and some Conservative MPs, to relax the 2m rule, with many saying it would be impossible to trade under the current measures. Labour said its support would depend on employees having adequate protective equipment, such as face shields, and there being an effective testing and tracing system in place. This video can not be played One and two metre social distancing - what does it look like? Ministers have not ruled out customers having to register when entering pubs and bars so they can easily be tracked down if they come into contact with a person infected with coronavirus. Peter Borg Neal, chief executive of pub chain Oakman Inns, told Radio 4's Today programme that 1m social distancing was ""still very problematic"" but would allow most pubs to open. ""We hope to prove very quickly to government that pubs will be a safe environment and they can ease restrictions further in due course,"" he said. As part of the government's recovery plan, some arts and entertainment venues are also likely to be able to open their doors from 4 July but only if they follow guidance to ensure they are ""Covid secure"". They will be expected to minimise face-to-face contact by requiring customers to pre-book tickets, to stand in spaced queues and to enter and leave through different areas. Screens could be put up to minimise the risk to staff while ventilation systems will be improved. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Gallery directors have said they are ""incredibly excited"" to reopen and hope the public will be hungry for culture after three months. Simon Martin, director of Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, West Sussex, told Today: ""I think many are going to feel quite emotional when they come. But for us we really want our visitors to feel welcome, feel safe and have an enjoyable time. We are working very hard to ensure that although we sanitise the building we don't sanitise the experience."" Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said the public health community was ""very anxious"" about the pace of changes, adding that the UK still has a far higher number of cases than other European countries. ""I don't think we're in the position where we have a fully functioning track and trace [system] to give us the confidence that if we start to see cases rise again we can contain it,"" she told the BBC's Newsnight programme. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told the Today programme that the government will be issuing guidelines to businesses on how to manage safety. ""The reality is we're all going to have to get used to this new kind of normal as we go forward...where we have to take some self-responsibility to ensure the safety of ourselves, our friends, our family, and the people in our community,"" he said. The other nations of the UK are yet to announce any plans to change the 2m distance rule for the hospitality industry. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has asked scientific advisers toreview the circumstancesin which it might be reduced alongside ""additional mitigations"". In Northern Ireland, where hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes are set to reopen from 3 July, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said she isopen to changing it. Schools will be able tofollow 1m social distancing measures when they reopen in August. A change has alsonot been ruled outin Wales - where First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would support a reduction if Welsh advisers said it was safe.

"Community oxygen tests 'key to virus second wave'Measuring people's oxygen levels is key to tackling a second wave, a top doctor says.","These Â£50 devices are being developed in south Wales to test oxygen levels Oxygen levels in suspected coronavirus cases should be monitored in the community to help hospitals cope with a second wave of cases, according to Wales' leading respiratory doctor. Dr Simon Barry said early on in the pandemic it became clear reduced oxygen levels in the blood suggested a patient had Covid-19. But flu and pneumonia will be more common in a future winter peak. This means more community monitoring would be needed, he said. Dr Barry is leading the implementation of Welsh guidelines to treat the virus, and said work was under way to conduct specific tests before coronavirus patients were admitted to hospital in future. Most people with coronavirus only have mild symptoms, and sometimes none at all. But doctors report low blood oxygen saturation levels among those who are admitted to hospital with coronavirus. Healthy adults usually have saturation levels of between 94% and 99%, whereas those with Covid-19 can fall below 90% and require oxygen therapy and, in some cases, ventilation in intensive care. Dr Barry, who has treated Covid-19 patients, has also developed a website that delivers the latest treatment guidelines to doctors in all Welsh hospitals. He said: ""Early on there was a clear recognition that this disease caused oxygenation failure in people who presented. ""The ones who got sick (the 20% of patients who get sick) had low oxygen levels and they came into hospital with low oxygen levels."" Dr Barry has been producing online training videos for doctors Dr Barry said far more patients had been treated with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device than he had anticipated. The treatment, which involves a tight-fitting mask that delivers a continuous flow of oxygen, is given while the patient is awake and does not require them to be sedated and placed on a mechanical ventilator. ""We've learned that actually you can manage patients with quite bad oxygenation failure on the wards, using CPAP, and getting them to lie on their front,"" he said. ""And we also know that, if you go to ITU [an intensive therapy unit] and you're ventilated, you have very high mortality. It's about 70% if you're actually invasively ventilated."" Early intervention is key in providing the best treatment, and monitoring blood oxygen levels could prove crucial in determining whether someone has coronavirus or another respiratory illness. Dr Barry, who is based at Cardiff and Vale health board, said a winter surge would mean Covid-19 mixing with flu and pneumonia cases. That, he said, would mean it would be ""extremely difficult"" to manage patients into ""safe streams"" within hospitals, making community testing necessary. ""We are looking at a mechanism to be able to do all of these specific tests, point-of-care, in the community. Both in primary care but also using the Welsh ambulance crew, so they will be able to make a specific diagnosis within minutes."" The oximeter is being developed at labs at the University of South Wales Engineers at the University of South Wales have received Welsh Government funding to create a new oximeter, a Â£50 portable device which can accurately measure a patient's blood oxygen levels. Prof Nigel Copner, who has led the programme to rapidly develop the oximeter at the laboratory in Treforest, said the devices would be ready ""in weeks"" and Welsh patients would be the first to benefit. ""Wales obviously has first call, the Welsh Government has funded the project in total. And we have contract manufacturers down in Sony that can manufacture the device and turn it around very quickly."" F1 team helps to create coronavirus breathing aid What are ventilators and how do they work? 'Our hospitals weren't made to use so much oxygen' Prof Copner said the device had ""no issues"" with pre-existing supply chains, which have been stretched by global demand. ""We can actually manufacture and build this device very easily in south Wales, and we can turn around high volumes in a matter of weeks,"" he added. Clinicians have also responded in innovative ways during the pandemic. Dr Barry said a pioneering online training platform had helped Welsh doctors to provide the best treatment, as lessons were learned and best practice shared quickly with colleagues. ""Traditionally in Wales we have seven health boards that do things in seven different ways,"" he said. ""But if you stood above it and you look down, it's an enormously inefficient and ineffective way to manage cases. ""We're trying to rise above that by saying 'look, this is the national guideline'. We are getting experts within Wales who are talking about updates and talking about what should be the best practice. And that seems a logical way to proceed.""

"Microsoft abandons Mixer app in Facebook dealMixer will close in a month's time, with partners being offered similar deals on Facebook Gaming.","Mixer signed exclusive deals with some popular streamers, including Ninja Microsoft has decided to close its Mixer livestreaming service and is partnering with Facebook Gaming instead. Mixer made headlines last year when it signed a reportedly multi-million dollar exclusivity deal with Ninja, a big star on rival platform Twitch. But despite the investment, Microsoft says the platform will close in one month's time. Ninja and other major gamers will no longer be tied to exclusivity deals. Ninja had been signed to Mixer for less than a year. From 22 July, Mixer's website and app will redirect users to Facebook Gaming. As part of the deal, Microsoft will work to bring its xCloud games-streaming service to Facebook. ""This seems quite ruthless, but Microsoft's strategy to reach more gamers is underpinned by its cloud business, not Mixer,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls from the consultancy Ampere Analysis. ""Clearly Facebook has significant reach globally, to expose users to xCloud."" All games-streamers in Mixer's partner programme will be granted partner status on Facebook Gaming if they wish to move to the platform. Facebook reveals Gaming app to rival Twitch YouTube signs three top gamers away from Twitch Streaming star Ninja moves to Microsoft's Mixer ""Ultimately, the success of partners and streamers on Mixer is dependent on our ability to scale the platform for them as quickly and broadly as possible,""Mixer said in a statement,external. ""It became clear that the time needed to grow our own livestreaming community to scale was out of measure with the vision and experiences that Microsoft and Xbox want to deliver for gamers now, so we've decided to close the operations side of Mixer and help the community transition to a new platform."" In a separate blog post,external, Xbox chief Phil Spencer said the transition deal was part of a wider agreement between Xbox and Facebook, with Xbox aiming to introduce gaming features that work on Facebook and Instagram in the future.
