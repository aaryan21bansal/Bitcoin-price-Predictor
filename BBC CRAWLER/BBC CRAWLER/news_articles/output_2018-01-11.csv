May defends 'long-term' green plan,"Theresa May has defended her 25-year plan to protect the environment as campaigners called for ""emergency"" action now. The prime minister said her long-term strategy, including eradicating all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042, would allow future generations to ""enjoy a beautiful environment"". Green groups said the proposals should have legal force. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said 25 years was ""far too long"" to take action. Unveiling the proposals at London Wetlands Centre, Mrs May vowed that Brexit would not lead to environmental standards being lowered, and promised her government would ""leave the natural environment in a better state than we found it"". Have Tories blown hot and cold on environment? Where does the plastic bag charge go? Seven charts that explain plastic pollution Key to this is a crackdown on throwaway plastics. Under the government's plan, supermarkets will be urged to introduce ""plastic-free"" aisles while taxes and charges on single-use items such as takeaway containers will be considered. Mrs May's announcements also include: Confirmation of the extension of the 5p charge for plastic carrier bags to all retailers in England Government funding for plastics innovation A commitment to help developing nations tackle pollution and reduce plastic waste, including through UK aid She said: ""We look back in horror at some of the damage done to our environment in the past and wonder how anyone could have thought that, for example, dumping toxic chemicals into rivers was ever the right thing to do."" She called plastic waste ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"", adding: ""In the UK alone, the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year would fill 1,000 Royal Albert Halls."" Six simple ways to cut back on plastic What impact will microbead ban have? Asked after her speech about calls for more urgent action, the PM said the government had already reduced plastic bag usage by nine billion and legislated to ban plastic microbeads used in cosmetics and cleaning products. And asked about her own environmental credentials, she revealed she had put owl and bat boxes in her garden. This video can not be played Theresa May: A plan to 'nurture' environment Some campaigners have warned about the loss of European environmental standards once the UK leaves the EU, but Mrs May promised a new ""world leading"" body to hold the government to account on environmental issues. However the chairwoman of the Commons Environmental Audit Committee, Labour's Mary Creagh, said a new Act of Parliament was needed after Brexit. ""We don't want to go back to being the 'dirty man of Europe',"" she added. Many wildflower meadows have been destroyed Thursday's announcements are the culmination of an environmental week for the government.  On Sunday, Mrs May promised a clampdown on plastic waste. On Wednesday, plans emerged to extend the 5p plastic bag charge to include corner shops in England. Ministers have been under political pressure to do more for the environment after it was identified by the Tory think-tank Bright Blue as the key issue for young voters, who failed to back the party in large numbers at the 2017 general election. Environmentalists agree that the government's plan to restore nature - not just safeguard nature - is genuinely radical. Many of the UK's landscapes have been ravaged by development, intensive farming and sheep grazing. Only 2% of wildflower meadows have survived. I understand that the document will cover many policy areas, including: managing land sustainably; enhancing nature and recovering wildlife; increasing people's health and well-being through nature; resource efficiency, reduction of pollution and waste and protecting and improving the global environment. But there is scepticism about how far the environment department Defra will be able to carry out its plans. There are huge pressures on the natural world from urgently needed house-building; HS2 threatens scores of ancient woodlands; and the Department for Transport has a major road-building programme. Scotland to ban plastic cotton buds Plastic bag charge: 5p levy could be extended Green campaigners said Mrs May's plans could simply be shelved if they become inconvenient and the promise to stop ""avoidable"" plastic waste is too vague. ""Britain's natural environment needs a 25-month emergency plan more than it needs a 25-year vision,"" said Greenpeace UK's executive director John Sauven. ""If the government's aim is to get through to young voters, they need to offer change that happens before these youths turn middle-aged."" Greenpeace questioned why there was no mention of deposit return schemes for bottles - which the government has said it will consider - while Friends of the Earth said a ""clear timetable"" not ""woolly promises"" was needed. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: 25 year plan is too long - do it now Sue Hayman, Labour's environment spokeswoman, said the Conservatives had a record of ""failure and broken promises"" on the environment. She said the ""weak"" proposals would mean the problem with plastic waste was ""kicked into the long grass"". The Liberal Democrats said it ""beggared belief"" that a target of 2042 had been set for removing plastic waste and that action was needed now. 5p plastic bag charge set to be extended Microbead ban: What impact will it have?

Ex-BHS boss Dominic Chappell guilty,"Dominic Chappell, who was in charge of BHS when it went bust in 2016, has been found guilty on three charges of failing to provide information demanded by The Pensions Regulator. The watchdog accused him of neglecting or refusing to hand over information about BHS's pension schemes. The schemes had 19,000 members and a shortfall of Â£571m when BHS collapsed. Mr Chappell, a former bankrupt, bought the department store chain from Sir Philip Green for Â£1. The Pensions Regulator (TPR) alleged that Mr Chappell failed to provide information three times about the company's pension schemes. Appearing at Brighton Magistrates Court, Mr Chappell argued that he didn't have the information available because he had been shut out of his office at BHS after administrators took over. He also said tax officers had raided his home, removing computers and files. However the judge, Mr William Ashworth, said that he was not a credible witness, that parts of his explanation made no sense and that other evidence he offered was simply not credible. Nicola Parish, TPR's executive director of frontline regulation, said: ""Dominic Chappell failed to provide us with information we had requested in connection with our investigation into the sale and ultimate collapse of BHS, despite numerous requests. ""The power to demand specific information is a key investigative tool in our work to protect people's pensions. This conviction shows that the courts recognise its importance and that anyone who fails to co-operate with our information notices risks getting a criminal record."" Speaking outside court, Mr Chappell said he would appeal against the verdict. He said: ""As you can imagine, I'm extremely disappointed and annoyed about the outcome. It's not the one we were looking for. ""I've instructed my legal team to put in an immediate application for an appeal on this case, which we will be doing tomorrow."" He added: ""We feel that this case has not been treated fairly and we will look deeply into this."" The offences he has been found guilty of carry unlimited fines for each count. The judge has adjourned to a later date, 19 January in Winchester, to consider the financial aspects. The highest previous fine in a case such as this was Â£5,000. Administrators were called in to BHS after only a year under Mr Chappell's ownership, leaving 11,000 people out of work and endangering the pensions of 19,000. The Pensions Regulator is said to be seeking Â£10m from Mr Chappell to shore up BHS's stricken pension fund, to add to the Â£363m already obtained from Sir Philip. A spokesman for the regulator said: ""Our separate anti-avoidance action against Dominic Chappell continues. ""TPR's determinations panel is considering evidence submitted by various parties and is expected to be in a position to issue its written determination notice to affected parties in the coming weeks.""

Banks consider paying for EU access,"Banks and financial firms are prepared to consider helping the government pay for access to the single market. They will lose the ability to sell financial services across the EU from the UK after Brexit. Several sources told the BBC that if the government decided to pay into the EU budget in return for barrier-free access, they would reluctantly consider making a contribution. The so-called ""pay to play option"" has been ruled out by ministers. It would be politically unpalatable to continue making payments to the EU and would add extra expense for business. The finance sector has also downplayed the option. But industry sources said that while any extra cost would make the UK less competitive, losing frictionless market access to the world's largest trading block - or having to fragment their operations throughout Europe - could be worse. ""We'd have to look at the detail, but it's possible,"" said one insider. ""We would look to support the UK government in negotiations and if part of that meant some sort of financial contribution we'd consider it,"" said another. Publicly, finance industry groups have been loathe to raise this option for three reasons. First, they think it effectively penalises successful exporters - the opposite of what the government purports to want. UK plans to soften impact on European banks Brexit 'affecting London's talent pool' Second, they believe agreeing to pay for admission sets a dangerous precedent for trade deals with new partners. Third, they think other industries such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals should be asked to do the same and suspect the complexity of divvying up any bill would be mind-bogglingly complex. The government is clear the UK should not have to pay to get what we already have for free - and for something the EU also values. A Downing Street spokesman told the BBC: ""The position hasn't changed - we are not going to pay for market access. There is a lot of mutual self-interest at stake here. If you listened to EU briefings last summer then the breakthrough we achieved in December was impossible. This is a negotiation."" Nevertheless, financial services chiefs have made clear there is a big potential cost to losing access to the EU. If the price for keeping it is right, some think it might be worth paying.

China's #IceBoy reignites poverty debate,"Pictures of eight-year-old Little Wang were shared tens of thousands of times An eight-year-old Chinese pupil, dubbed ""Ice Boy"" by social media users after images emerged of him arriving at school with swollen hands and frost on his hair and eyebrows, has sparked renewed discussion online about child poverty. Many users sayÂ the pictures of ""Little Wang"", who went viral on Monday, highlight that not enough is being done to help children from poor, rural families in China. They sympathise with the harsh journeys that Little Wang endures in order to get to his school in Ludian County in the south-western province of Yunnan. State-run China News Service agency says the boy walks 4.5 km (2.8 miles) to get to school, a journey that takes him an hour. On the day the picture was taken, the temperature was -9C, the agency says. One picture that circulated thousands of times shows Wang received 99 out of 100 on a test, despite his swollen hands One photo of the boy, which has been shared by tens of thousands of people, shows him with swollen red cheeks and dressed in a thin jacket, being laughed at by classmates. Another image shows the boy's dirty and swollen hands, which are next to the near-perfect work in his school exercise book. Wang's teacher took the pictures on 8 JanuaryÂ and sent themÂ to the headmaster and a few other individuals, according to reportsÂ in state media. But theyÂ soon came to the attention of localÂ and then national media, and the images went viral online. Thousands of users of the popular Sina Weibo microblog shared the pictures, using the hashtag #IceBoy. One post byÂ People's Daily received more than 277,000 likes. Many Weibo users posted messages praising Wang's fortitude and perseverance. ""This child knows that knowledge can change his fate,"" says one. But others voiced their concern, saying that their hearts achedÂ for him, especially seeing his swollen hands and threadbare clothes. ""His frozen little red face and he's wearing so little, he really looks pitiful,"" another user commented. Some responded by posting angry comments targeted at the government. ""What is the local Yunnan government doing about this?"" one asked. Others urged fellow users forÂ their help in contacting the boyÂ so they could donate money and clothes. Journalists from the popular Pear Video website visited Little Wang to see how he lives. ""His homeÂ is made of mud and brickÂ and is very dilapidated,"" Pear VideoÂ said. Â Counting the cost of China's left-behind children China's uphill struggle fighting extreme poverty The boys who travelled 80km in bus undercarriage The site found that the boy is a ""left-behind child"" - one of tens of millions of Chinese children who rarely see their parents, who have moved to the cities to find work to support them. Little Wang lives with his grandmother and sister. He rarely sees his father, a migrant worker who is able to return home only every four or five months. The boy tells Pear Video that his mother left him when he was very young. The Communist Youth League has donated clothing and an improved heating system to Little Wang's school Wang's story has prompted an outcry in Chinese media for more to be done to help left-behind children. Some local companies have already responded. State-runCCTV,externalÂ says the provincial Communist Youth League has donated 100,000 yuan (about $15,350: Â£11,350) so that each child at the school can have better clothing, and for the school to improve its heating system. Influential news websiteThe Paper,externalshares the contact details of the Zhaotong City Youth Development Foundation, a charity that supports children in north-east Yunnan. Â Many social media users say they hope Wang's story helps raise social awareness of the poverty facing other children in poorer, rural regions. But some note poignantly that Little Wang's case is synonymous with many other children's. 'SurblueDu', receivedÂ 2,000 likes for their comment: ""No-one knows how many poor children there are, helping one is only helping one.""

Trapped butcher saved by black pudding,"This video can not be played Chris McCabe says he owes his life to the cylinder of blood and suet A butcher who became trapped in a walk-in freezer escaped thanks to a frozen black pudding. Chris McCabe, 70, said he got trapped after the freezer door in his shop in Totnes, Devon, blew shut behind him. Stranded in temperatures of -20C (-4F), with the door-release button frozen shut, he said he used the 1.5kg (3.3lbs) sausage as a battering ram on the release mechanism. Mr McCabe said: ""No-one could hear me banging. Black pudding saved my life."" More news from Devon and Cornwall Upon realising his predicament, Mr McCabe initially thought he ""was OK because I could kick the safety button from inside"", but ""this time it was frozen solid"". Stuck in temperatures capable of killing a human in about an hour, the father-of-four searched frantically for an improvised tool to batter the button. With the beef too slippery and the lamb too big, he happened on the ""best thing"" - the black pudding, made by the Queen's butcher HM Sheridan of Ballater, Aberdeenshire, who Mr McCabe has been buying the pudding from for more than 20 years. He said: ""It was the right shape. I used it like the police use battering rams to break door locks in. It was solid, pointed and I could get plenty of weight behind it. ""I'm lucky really. We sell about two or three each week and that was the last one in there."" Trapped: Your stories Trapped-tower ordeal 'horrendous' Upside down trapped horse rescued.

Council tax hike Labour MP quits role,"Labour MP Chris Williamson has stood down as shadow fire minister. It comes the day after he suggested council tax bills for the highest value homes in England should be doubled. He said that as a backbencher ""I will be campaigning on a broader range of issues"" and will ""continue to loyally support"" leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Corbyn said: ""I am grateful for Chris' work on the frontbench, particularly on fire safety following the appalling Grenfell Tower Fire."" He added: ""I know that on the backbenches, Chris will be a strong campaigner on a range of crucial issues as well as serving his constituents with dedication."" Labour MP: Hike council tax to offset cuts Labour's announcement did not confirm the reasons for Mr Williamson's departure. He had stressed that his council tax proposal was not party policy. But Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis claimed he had been ""forced out"" because he had ""exposed Labour's plans for soaring increases in council tax, and his plans have been endorsed by Labour activists across the country"". Some Labour colleagues backed Mr Williamson's resignation - which was reportedly a ""mutual decision"" reached with Mr Corbyn. Allow Twitter content?

Actress Falkholt's 'life support turned off',"Home and Away actress Jessica Falkholt has had her life support switched off two weeks after being in a car crash, a hospital in Australia has confirmed. The crash, which happened in New South Wales on 26 December, killed her parents, sister and the other driver. The actress, 29, who played Hope Morrison in the soap, remained in a critical condition on Friday. The decision to end her life support came after a funeral service for her family on Wednesday. ""On behalf of the family of Jessica Falkholt, St George Hospital has been asked to advise the media and the community that Jessica's life support has been switched off,"" a hospital statement said. Lars, Vivian, Annabelle and Jessica seen together in a photo supplied to the media At the time of the accident, Network Seven, Home and Away's broadcaster, released a statement saying: ""Although her time on set was brief, once a part of the Home and Away family, always part of the family."" Falkholt's character first appeared when Hope and Raffy Morrison arrived in the fictional seaside town of Summer Bay. Hope briefly worked at the garage, but ran away after stealing money from there and from Salt restaurant. It emerged that her young sister Raffy - actually her cousin - was a sibling of the Morgan brothers in the soap, so Raffy stayed in the Bay with them when Hope was jailed for her crimes. Falkholt (centre) played Hope Morrison on Home and Away Falkholt's stint on the long-running series only lasted for 16 episodes and ended in November 2016. She then filmed a role in the US film Harmony, which is set for release this year. Jessica's parents Lars and Vivian were killed instantly in the crash and her sister Annabelle died in hospital three days later. Vivian Falkholt's brother Paul Ponticello spoke at their funeral, saying he thought he and his sister ""would grow old together"". Australian police are still investigating the crash, which also killed 50-year-old Craig Whittall, who was driving the other car involved.

Ban on menstruating girls crossing river,"Girls living near Kyekyewerein (not pictured) are affected by the ban Ghanaian schoolgirls have been banned from crossing a river while they are menstruating - and on Tuesdays. The ban, apparently given by a local river god, has outraged children's activists, especially as girls must cross the river to reach school. It means girls in the Upper Denkyira East district, in the Central Region, could miss out on their education. Sub-Saharan Africa is already struggling to keep girls in school during their periods. Africa Live: More on this and other stories School students breaking the stigma around periods Rape and no periods in North Korea's army The UN's scientific and education organisation, Unesco, estimates one in 10 girls in the region does not attend school because they are menstruating, whilea World Bank report notes that 11.5m Ghanaian women lack the appropriate hygiene and sanitation management facilities,externalneeded. Unicef's menstrual hygiene ambassador Shamima Muslim Alhassan told BBC Pidgin that the directive, which applies to part of the River Ofin, violated girls' right to education. ""It seems the gods are really powerful aren't they?"" she said. ""Sometimes I think that we need to ask for some form of accountability from these gods who continue to bar a lot of things from happening, to account for how they have used the tremendous power that we have given them."" Central Regional Minister Kwamena Duncan has given indications he will coordinate with the Ashanti regional minister to find a solution, BBC Pidgin reports. The River Ofin serves as a boundary between the Ashanti and Central Region. Many cultures have myths and taboos around menstruation.

Farage warming to second EU referendum,"This video can not be played UKIP MEP Nigel Farage talking on The Wright Stuff chat show Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage says he is close to backing a second EU referendum to end the ""whinging and whining"" of anti-Brexit campaigners. Mr Farage told Channel 5's The Wright Stuff a fresh vote could ""kill off"" the Remain campaign for a generation. He later clarified his remarks saying it was the ""last thing"" he wanted but Leave voters had to be prepared and he was confident they would win again. Pro-EU campaigners said ""support is growing"" for another referendum. Farage judgement 'shot to pieces' And co-founder of the Leave.EU referendum campaign group, Arron Banks, said that to avoid sleepwalking ""into a faux Brexit"" people should ""go back the polls and let the people shout from the rooftops their support of a true Brexit"". But Mr Farage's former UKIP colleagues dismissed his suggestion. And Downing Street said: ""We will not be having a second referendum."" Seven thoughts on a second referendum Brexit: All you need to know New Brexit referendum would be 'divisive and hate-filled' warns Hague Mr Farage was one of the leading figures in the Leave campaign, which won the referendum with 51.9% of votes. The result in June 2016 means that the UK is leaving the European Union, with the date for departure set as 29 March 2019. Negotiations are currently taking place between the UK and the EU about a post_Brexit relationship. During a debate about Brexit on the Channel 5 programme, Mr Farage said: ""What is for certain is that the [Nick] Cleggs, the [Tony] Blairs, the [Lord] Adonises will never ever, ever, give up. ""They will go on whinging and whining and moaning all the way through this process. ""So maybe, just maybe, I'm reaching the point of thinking that we should have a second referendum on EU membership... and we may just finish the whole thing off. ""And Blair can disappear off into total obscurity."" He said ""the percentage that would vote to leave next time would be very much bigger than it was last time round"". His UKIP colleagues did not agree: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Even putting aside the astronomical and completely unjustified public cost of a second referendum, Farage's comments are an open goal for the Remain camp,"" she wrote on theBrexit Central website,external. But the other side of the Brexit debate were more enthusiastic. Labour MP Chuka Umunna, of the Open Britain campaign for close ties with the EU, said: ""For perhaps the first time in his life, Nigel Farage is making a valid point. ""In a democracy like ours, the British people have every right to keep an open mind about Brexit.""

Speaking on his LBC radio show later on Thursday, Mr Farage said that his meeting with Michel Barnier in Brussels on Monday had convinced him that the EU's chief Brexit negotiator was ""not going to give us a good deal."" He believed it would be rejected by Parliament, where he counted more Tory rebels than Labour Brexiteers ready to defy their own side. ""I am saying this to Leavers: Don't be complacent,"" he said.

M&S food sales slide over Christmas,"M&S food sales fell in the key Christmas trading period Marks and Spencer sales fell over the key Christmas period, while Tesco reported record festive trade. M&S said like-for-like revenues fell 1.4% in the 13 weeks to 30 December. Clothing and homeware fell 2.8%, while food, seen as its most successful sector, was down 0.4%. By contrast, Tesco's UK sales rose 2.3% in the 19 weeks to 6 January. The supermarket said it enjoyed ""record sales and volumes"" in the four weeks leading up to Christmas Day. Shares in M&S fell 5.6%, while Tesco shed 4.8%. Christmas shopping: the winners and losers The two trading updates came as other retailers released figures for the Christmas period. John Lewis said like-for-like sales rose 3.1% for the six weeks to 30 December, while its Waitrose supermarket chain posted a 1.5% rise compared with the same period in 2016. In other retail news: Department storeHouse of Frasersaid sales in stores for the six weeks to 23 December declined by 2.9%, while online sales were down 7.5% in the period Online fashion retailerBoohoosaid its UK revenues increased 107% in the last four months of 2017 All three major retailers alluded to difficulties in the market and tough trading conditions, with Tesco speaking of ""inflationary pressures"" and M&S referring to ""ongoing trading pressures"". Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said he expected trading to remain volatile ""due to the economic environment and anticipate that competitive intensity will continue"". M&S chief executive Steve Rowe said it had been a ""mixed quarter"", with ""a weak clothing market in October and ongoing underperformance in our food like-for-like sales"". He added: ""Our revenue grew both in-store and online over the weeks leading up to Christmas, and we held our full-price stance in a very promotional market and did not participate in Black Friday. ""However, the impact of an unseasonal October resulted in an overall revenue decline."" As ever, the all-important Christmas trading has brought a mixed bag of fortunes for retailers. Tesco is in the winning camp today with a decent set of figures. On the whole, food sales have done far better than non-food, helped by inflation. Morrisons and Co-op were notable performers. Marks and Spencer, still the UK's biggest clothing retailer, saw sales in fashion and homewares go into reverse again, after positive results the previous year. And it has underperformed in food. Meanwhile, John Lewis reported very good clothing sales, with strong numbers overall for the department store chain. It's firmly in the winners camp, although its profit margins will take a knock thanks to price matching. And Boohoo, the small but fast-growing online fashion retailer, saw its revenues double over the last four months, with growth the mainstream retailers can only dream of. What does it all tell us? It's been a tough Christmas quarter overall, far from golden. It's been hard going all year. There are always winners and losers, but the gap between the strongest and weakest players seems to be getting bigger. And the relentless rise of online continues. Bryan Roberts of TCC Global said a last-minute rush for M&S proved ""too little, too late to rescue the overall period"". He added: ""It is within food that many rivals have closed the gap on M&S in terms of innovation and premium ranges, while also putting M&S's prices in sharp relief. We would like to see a simpler pricing architecture with less reliance on multi-buys."" Meanwhile, Tesco said it was ""confident"" in its full-year outlook following its performance over Christmas. Chief executive Dave Lewis said: ""We have continued to outperform the market throughout this period, particularly in fresh food, thanks to our most competitive offer for many years."" Natalie Berg, global research director of Planet Retail, told BBC Breakfast that Tesco would never return to its former glory, but had responded well to its difficulties: ""The ship has been steadied and they're doing all the right things.""

Calls to scrap benefits 'rape clause',"This video can not be played Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale says Esther McVey should review the child tax credit 'rape clause' The new work and pensions secretary is facing calls to urgently review the ""rape clause"" in child tax credits. A cap came into force in April where a parent could only claim the credit for two children, but if they had another by ""non-consensual conception"" they would be exempt - if they filled out the correct paperwork. Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale says the policy is ""degrading"". But the department said its methods were as ""sensitive as possible"". What is the 'rape clause'? MSPs condemn tax credit 'rape clause' Davidson: Rape clause 'misinformation is deeply damaging' The policy to cap child tax credit was announced in 2015 by then-Chancellor George Osborne. The UK government said it had introduced the limit, for a claimant's first two children, because it wanted ""people on benefits to make the same choices as those supporting themselves solely through work"". Exemptions were announced for those adopting children, those involved in kinship care and for multiple births, as well as those who had a child conceived ""as a result of a sexual act which you didn't or couldn't consent to"" or ""at a time when you were in an abusive relationship, under ongoing control or coercion by the other parent of the child"". The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said it would operate a ""third-party model"" so that women could talk to healthcare professionals, a social worker or an approved rape charity, rather than describe the details to a member of its staff. But critics say the policy forces victims of rape to endure further trauma, making women ""prove"" they have been raped to receive child benefits. Esther McVey was given the job of work and pension secretary in the reshuffle earlier this week In a letter to the minister,external, Ms Dugdale - who has campaigned against reducing the welfare state - quoted Ms McVey's previous statementssupporting feminism,externaland said she should ""take this sentiment into office"". ""I consider [the rape clause] to be one of the most abhorrent policies of a government in my adult lifetime,"" she wrote. ""It essentially punishes a woman for being the victim of a violent act at the hands of a man - a punishment which will be felt by the product of that violence, which in the context of the rape clause is a child."" Ms Dugdale, who has campaigned against the policy with members from across different parties in the Scottish government, told BBC Radio 5 Live that while she accepted she held different political views to Ms McVey, perhaps they could agree ""as women"" that this clause was wrong. ""This isn't rhetoric from a Labour politician throwing it at a Conservative politician and the back and forth you would normally expect from that,"" she said. ""I am appealing to Esther McVey as a woman to repeal the rape clause as the first thing she does as secretary of state."" Ms McVey is the first female work and pensions secretary since the Conservatives took office in 2010. She has yet to respond personally to the letter. However, a spokeswoman from the Department for Work and Pensions said they had consulted widely on the policy and had ensured that women who face these ""very difficult circumstances"" are exempt. She added: ""Using third-party professionals, who already support women in circumstances such as these, means the exception can be applied as sensitively as possible."" What is the 'rape clause'?

YouTube punishes star over suicide video,"This video can not be played How Logan and Jake Paul became social media superstars YouTube has cut some business ties with Logan Paul, the hugely popular vlogger who posted a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. Paul's channels were removed from YouTube's Google Preferred programme, where brands sell ads on the platform's top 5% of content creators. YouTube also said it had put on hold original projects with the US vlogger. Paul posted the video with a man's body on 31 December, triggering widespread criticism. The video showed Paul and his friends at the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, known to be a frequent site of suicides. Going in to film the ""haunted"" forest, they come across a man's body and are shocked but also make jokes. The identity of the deceased man is not known. Online comments have called the Japan video, which garnered millions of views on YouTube before it was taken down, ""disrespectful"" and ""disgusting"". Paul later posted an apology,externalon Twitter, saying he had been ""misguided by shock and awe"". A still from Logan Paul's video shows him looking shocked - but in outtakes, he joked about suicide He also uploaded a video apology, and said: ""I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through."" ""I'm ashamed of myself,"" he added. ""I'm disappointed in myself."" It's hard to calculate exactly. YouTube's move will cost him financially as his videos will no longer earn top-tier cash per click - but as he hasn't been completely kicked off the platform, he will still earn money from views. Google Preferred,externalallows brands to publish ads on the accounts that are most popular among 18-34 year-olds in the US. YouTube's own wording calls it a way for companies to ""share their messages alongside some of the most engaging and brand safe content on YouTube"". Aside from his videos, Paul makes money from sponsored social media posts and merchandise - and it's worth noting that his apology video has racked up nearly 40 million views. With more than 15 million subscribers and counting, he's huge. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated he made $12.5m (Â£9.3m), making him the fourth highest-paid YouTube star in 2016. Some people are frustrated that it took YouTube 10 days to respond to the controversy. The company acknowledged this, saying: ""You're right to be [frustrated]. You deserve to know what's going on."" The Japan video itself was not taken down by YouTube; Paul himself took it down, leading some to complain that the platform should have acted more decisively. Allow Twitter content?

Worboys victims demand new attack probe,"John Worboys, 60, is thought to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in the capital Almost 100 cases against sex attacker John Worboys should be reconsidered by the Crown Prosecution Service, lawyers for his victims have said. Black cab driver Worboys is thought to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London. Lawyers have asked the CPS to review the 93 cases that Worboys, 60, was not prosecuted over. One of his victims said it would be a ""total scandal"" if the additional cases were not reviewed. Worboys, who was jailed in 2009, faced prosecution for allegations made by 12 women. He gave his victims drug-laced champagne before attacking them in the back of his cab. Last week theParole Board decided Worboys would be released with ""stringent"" licence conditionsafter he completed his minimum term of eight years in jail. Slater and Gordon, a law firm that represented 11 of Worboys' victims, has now sent a letter to the CPS asking it to ""undertake a thorough review of all available evidence"" against him to see if he could be convicted of more crimes. One victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said unless the cases were reopened, ""we can have no faith in the justice system"". ""These cases were not dropped at the time for lack of evidence, but rather because the CPS thought he would never be released from prison - and yet he's due to be released in just a couple of weeks,"" they said. ""The evidence is there. It would be a total scandal if it is now not properly looked at. ""There are few things more difficult and upsetting than coming forward after being sexually assaulted or raped. But when you do, then not to have your evidence taken into account, is much, much worse. What signal does that send?"" The black cab used by Worboys in his attacks The latest demand comes after the law firm also sent a letter earlier this week to theprobation service calling for Worboys to be excluded from the Greater London area upon his release. In the latest letter Slater and Gordon lawyer Richard Scorer explained how Worboys was only prosecuted for 12 complainants out of ""some 105 in total whom, we understand made complaints to the police"". He said since Worboys' conviction, an additional 45 incidents had been reported, of which 18 were linked to the taxi driver. Mr Scorer also wrote Worboys' victims were told their attacker would ""not be coming out for a long time"" and therefore another trial was ""not necessary"". ""To the extent that this was the CPS's expectation at the time, this has clearly not happened and this justification for not bringing further prosecutions has fallen away,"" the letter reads. ""We therefore formally request that the CPS make a public commitment to reconsidering the evidence in all Worboys cases with a view to further prosecution."" BBC London has contacted the CPS for comment.

Vow to 'eradicate needless plastic waste',"This video can not be played Theresa May: A plan to 'nurture' environment Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. The commitment is part of the government's 25-year plan to improve the natural environment. ""I think people will be shocked at how today we allow so much plastic to be produced needlessly,"" the PM said. But green groups are angry the proposals will have no legal force - and Jeremy Corbyn said 25 years was ""far too long"" to take action. The Labour leader said the ""throw-away"" culture had to be tackled ""now,"" after his party described Mrs May's plans as a ""cynical attempt at rebranding the Tories' image"". Where does the plastic bag charge go? Seven charts that explain plastic pollution Under the government's plan, supermarkets will be urged to introduce ""plastic-free"" aisles while taxes and charges on single-use items such as takeaway containers will be considered. Mrs May's announcements, which have been agreed by cabinet, also include: Confirmation of the extension of the 5p charge for plastic carrier bags to all retailers in England Government funding for plastics innovation A commitment to help developing nations tackle pollution and reduce plastic waste, including through UK aid In her speech, Mrs May said: ""We look back in horror at some of the damage done to our environment in the past and wonder how anyone could have thought that, for example, dumping toxic chemicals into rivers was ever the right thing to do."" She called plastic waste ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"", adding: ""In the UK alone, the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year would fill 1,000 Royal Albert Halls."" Six simple ways to cut back on plastic What impact will microbead ban have? Asked after her speech about her own environmental credentials, she revealed she had put owl and bat boxes in her garden. Constantine beach in Cornwall is among those awaiting a clean-up Meanwhile, plans to help more children engage with the environment will include Â£10m for school visits and a programme to create school grounds that allow youngsters to learn more about the natural world. Mrs May said she would put the oceans firmly on the agenda of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April. Many wildflower meadows have been destroyed Thursday's announcements are the culmination of an environmental week for the government.  On Sunday, Mrs May promised a clampdown on plastic waste. On Wednesday, plans emerged to extend the 5p plastic bag charge to include corner shops in England. Ministers have been under political pressure to do more for the environment after it was identified by the Tory think-tank Bright Blue as the key issue for young voters, who failed to back the party in large numbers at the 2017 general election. Environmentalists agree that the government's plan to restore nature - not just safeguard nature - is genuinely radical. Many of the UK's landscapes have been ravaged by development, intensive farming and sheep grazing. Only 2% of wildflower meadows have survived. I understand that the document will cover many policy areas, including: managing land sustainably; enhancing nature and recovering wildlife; increasing people's health and well-being through nature; resource efficiency, reduction of pollution and waste and protecting and improving the global environment. But there is scepticism about how far the environment department Defra will be able to carry out its plans. There are huge pressures on the natural world from urgently needed house-building; HS2 threatens scores of ancient woodlands; and the Department for Transport has a major road-building programme. Earlier Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC he wanted the government to ""set the global gold standard"" on the environment. He also said ministers were ""reflecting"" on aproposal from a Commons committee,externalfor a 25p charge on disposable cups. Scotland to ban plastic cotton buds Plastic bag charge: 5p levy could be extended Green campaigners said Mrs May's plans could simply be shelved if they become inconvenient and the promise to stop ""avoidable"" plastic waste is too vague. Greenpeace said Mrs May's announcement was a ""missed opportunity"", questioning why there was no mention of deposit return schemes for bottles, while Friends of the Earth said a ""clear timetable"" not ""woolly promises"" were needed. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: 25 year plan is too long - do it now Sue Hayman, Labour's environment spokeswoman, said the Conservatives had a record of ""failure and broken promises"" on the environment. She said the ""weak"" proposals would mean the problem with plastic waste was ""kicked into the long grass"". The Liberal Democrats said it ""beggared belief"" that a target of 2042 had been set for removing plastic waste and that action was needed now. 5p plastic bag charge set to be extended Microbead ban: What impact will it have?

'Very high flu levels' in hospitals,"Hospitals in England are now seeing very high rates of patients with flu, according to Public Health England figures. A sharp rise in cases seen by GPs in the past week - up 78% on the week before - suggests it could be the worst flu season for seven years. But PHE said the current levels of flu were ""not unprecedented"". Deaths from flu remained static with 27 in the past seven days. Around 5,000 people were admitted to hospital with flu in the first week of January, based on PHE figures for 22 out of 137 trusts. Prof Paul Cosford, medical director from Public Health England, said: ""The levels of flu being seen are high and of course that is contributing to the pressures in the NHS, but they are not unprecedented levels."" He also suggested the coverage of the so-called Aussie flu outbreak was a little misleading, saying that while it was circulating at ""significant"" levels there were two other strains that were also causing problems. Should we be worried about 'Aussie' flu? These strains are an unknown type of influenza A and influenza B - which is normally a milder strain - but appears to be affecting older people in care homes. The H3N2 strain - an influenza A virus - has been dubbed 'Aussie flu' because it is the same strain that recently caused big problems for Australia during their winter. 18-year-old Bethany Walker died after contracting the flu and developing pneumonia This year's flu vaccine is designed to protect against this strain and some other ones. Figures in Scotland show a doubling of flu casesin the past week but mortality rates related to the virus were still said to be low. However,an 18-year-old student from Wester Ross died after her flu developed into pneumonia. In Wales,a large rise in flu caseshas prompted advice to stay away from some hospitals. The rate of hospital admissions in England rose by over 50% in the first week of January to 7.38 per 100,000. In the same week, the GP consultation rate was 37.3 per 100,000 compared to 21 per 100,000 the week before. Nearly 22,000 patients went to see their GP with flu in the first week of 2018, the Royal College of GPs said, and there was also a rise in people seen with the common cold, acute bronchitis, respiratory system diseases and asthma.

Kuenssberg: Time for answers?,"There are some things that are more or less unsayable in politics, at least for people who want to win elections. For many years, any serious conversations about big changes to the NHS or its principles have been on that list. But with the service creaking, individual horror stories emerging during this winter's period of pressure, the chorus of ""something must be done"" is growing louder. This morning's latest figures that will give the statistical verdict on the frustration of patients and problems for hospitals in England will give more ammunition to those, including Tory MPs and the prime minister's influential former chief of staff who are arguing for a Royal Commission, or cross-party conversation to thrash out the issues. Hospital's cancer care 'unsustainable' We must do better on NHS waits - Hunt Behind closed doors pretty much every politician will acknowledge the service is going to need more money, but it's a question of how, when, and with what strings attached. But while there have been lots of demands for a proper debate on what's next, ideas and proposals are thinner on the ground. With even theHealth Secretary Jeremy Huntwishing he had more answers for 'long term funding', however, maybe they will start to emerge. Today the former minister Nick Boles, considered one of the Tories' big brains, is venturing an idea that he believes could provide a solution, give long-term stability to the NHS finances and take some of the political grand standing out of the issue. Inthe latest chapter of his book,external, he argues it is ""foolish to delude ourselves that we can meet legitimate demands for high quality care without spending more money"". Without reform he writes, the NHS is a ""cuckoo in the Treasury nest, hungrily demanding ever more money and pushing other public services ever closer to the edge"". His answer is a ""hypothecated tax"", rebranding national insurance as 'National Health Insurance', where voters' payments of NI overtly go specifically to the NHS, the money held and distributed from a stand-alone fund, outside the Treasury's grasp, spent according to plans set every five years. Traditionally such an idea would be likely to send a chancellor to hospital with a panic attack themselves. But while it's not perfect, interestingly the idea of a specific tax for health has the backing of a former boss of the Treasury, Nick McPherson, among others. Number 11 hates to lose control of money, but politically, as the NHS struggles, demands for new thinking are building. It's of course quite possible, with the demands of Brexit and the difficulty of touching the NHS at all, that Number 10 will simply hope to get through the annual winter stresses, carry on with its reform and get on quietly with its longer term planning to reform social care. Labour will continue to make the case that more money is urgently required and that private providers are gobbling up too much of the NHS Budget. Certainly, it would be surprising if Theresa May was to hunt for any radical change soon. And government sources say most people's experience of the health service is still very positive, so perhaps there's no real demand for change and once the winter passes all will be well. That feels optimistic though. Some NHS insiders argue that the service and its current model is reaching the end of its very long tether. In fact, today the boss of NHS providers, the organisation that represents hospital managers, has written to the health sec saying the service can't go on like this and is at a 'watershed moment' The targets that have been recently missed will be extremely hard to reach again. Voices like Boles' joining the demands for change matter. And most importantly, each day of difficulty for the NHS that's witnessed or experienced by members of the public first hand brings us closer to a day when ""something must be done"" becomes a political demand that is impossible to ignore.

Bennell 'abused boy on the way to games',"Chris Unsworth told the court he had been abused by Barry Bennell as a child Former football coach Barry Bennell abused a boy while giving him lifts to and from training and youth matches at Manchester City, a court has heard. Chris Unsworth told Liverpool Crown Court Mr Bennell - who acted as a youth scout for the club - abused him from the age of nine or 10 until 14 or 15. He said Mr Bennell raped him ""about half a dozen times"" during that time. Mr Bennell, 64, now known as Richard Jones, denies 48 sex offence charges involving 11 boys. The alleged offences took place between 1979 and 1991. Giving evidence in court, Mr Unsworth said he was a junior footballer playing for his local club when he first met Mr Bennell, who at the time worked as a scout for Manchester City. He told the court his parents were very busy and ""trusted Mr Bennell to pick me up"", adding that the ex-coach would give him a lift ""on all occasions"", taking him to matches and training. He said the abuse would begin with a game called ""follow me"", which the Mr Bennell would initiate. ""He would move his hands around your body on the outside of your clothes, tickle you, and you would have to do the same to him,"" Mr Unsworth said. The game would keep going until his hands were ""inside your shirt or inside your underpants"", he told told the jury. ""I just thought it was normal, this is what you have to do,"" he added. Mr Unsworth said the abuse would take place regularly, if not every time Mr Bennell gave him a lift. ""That game was pretty much ongoing until, basically, I walked away from football,"" he told the court. He told the jury he was also abused at Mr Bennell's then home in the Peak District, where boys would watch horror movies in the dark, often sharing Mr Bennell's bed. Mr Unsworth said he was also abused on trips to Wales, where he described staying in a ""haunted house"" with other boys. ""That was his scene, he would try and scare the lads,"" he told the court. Barry Bennell, now known as Richard Jones, is appearing in court via a video link The alleged abuse escalated and eventually led to Mr Bennell raping him, Mr Unsworth told the jury. ""The first time I will never forget it, "" he said. ""I was just crying, the pain. It felt like it went on for hours but it was probably two or three minutes."" Mr Unsworth told the court that none of the boys spoke to each other about the alleged abuse, adding: ""We knew where we wanted to go and we just thought this was what we had to go through."" He said he had contacted police in 2016 after seeing former footballers speak about allegations of abuse. Defending Mr Bennell, Eleanor Laws QC, questioned whether Mr Unsworth had discussed seeking financial compensation with a solicitor or other alleged victims. ""This is not about compensation, this is about justice,"" he replied. She said: ""I suggest to you that you were not sexually abused at all by Barry Bennell. Do you agree or disagree?"" ""Disagree"", Mr Unsworth replied. A transcript of a police interview with Mr Bennell in February last year was read to the court, which included a denial that he had abused Mr Unsworth. He did admit that the youth footballer had stayed at his house and slept in his bed, but said he would have been too young for him to be attracted to. In the interview, Mr Bennell said: ""I always tended to aim for the 13-year-olds because that was puberty age and they were becoming a bit more strong-willed and not tied to the apron strings."" Mr Bennell is on trial for 35 counts of indecent assault, 11 serious sexual assaults and two counts of attempted sexual assault, on boys aged between eight and 14. He is appearing in court via video link due to illness. Before the trial, Mr Bennell, an ex-Crewe Alexandra coach, admitted seven charges of indecent assault committed between 1981 and 1991, relating to three boys aged between 11 and 14.

Actress 'has life support turned off',"Home and Away actress Jessica Falkholt has had her life support switched off two weeks after being in a car crash, a hospital in Australia has confirmed. The crash, which happened in New South Wales on 26 December, killed her parents, sister and the other driver. The actress, 29, who played Hope Morrison in the soap, remained in a critical condition on Friday. The decision to end her life support came after a funeral service for her family on Wednesday. ""On behalf of the family of Jessica Falkholt, St George Hospital has been asked to advise the media and the community that Jessica's life support has been switched off,"" a hospital statement said. Lars, Vivian, Annabelle and Jessica seen together in a photo supplied to the media At the time of the accident, Network Seven, Home and Away's broadcaster, released a statement saying: ""Although her time on set was brief, once a part of the Home and Away family, always part of the family."" Falkholt's character first appeared when Hope and Raffy Morrison arrived in the fictional seaside town of Summer Bay. Hope briefly worked at the garage, but ran away after stealing money from there and from Salt restaurant. It emerged that her young sister Raffy - actually her cousin - was a sibling of the Morgan brothers in the soap, so Raffy stayed in the Bay with them when Hope was jailed for her crimes. Falkholt (centre) played Hope Morrison on Home and Away Falkholt's stint on the long-running series only lasted for 16 episodes and ended in November 2016. She then filmed a role in the US film Harmony, which is set for release this year.

Vivian Falkholt's brother Paul Ponticello spoke at their funeral, saying he thought he and his sister ""would grow old together"".

UK challenges US over Iran nuclear deal,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Iran nuclear deal: 'I don't think anybody has come up with a better idea' European powers have urged the US not to abandon the 2015 agreement with Iran that limits its nuclear programme, saying it is making the world safer. After meeting his Iranian, French, German and EU counterparts in Brussels, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisted the deal was preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. He also challenged Washington to come up with a better alternative. US President Donald Trump wants to amend the deal or withdraw from it. In October, he refused to recertify for Congress that Iran was complying, accusing it of ""not living up to the spirit"" of the agreement. At a news conference after meeting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Thursday,representatives of the EU, the UK, France and Germany reiterated their support for the nuclear deal they helped negotiate,external. ""The deal is working; it is delivering on its main goal, which means keeping the Iranian nuclear programme in check and under close surveillance,"" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said. ""The unity of the international community is essential to preserve a deal that is working, that is making the world safer and that is preventing a potential nuclear arms race in the region. And we expect all parties to continue to fully implement this agreement."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Mr Johnson described the deal, which is known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as a ""considerable diplomatic accomplishment"". ""I don't think that anybody has produced a better alternative to the JCPOA as a way of preventing the Iranians from going ahead with the acquisition of a military nuclear capability,"" he said. ""It is incumbent on those who oppose the JCPOA to come up with that better solution, because we have not seen it so far."" Iran nuclear deal: Key details How sanctions have hit ordinary Iranians Johnson raises Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case at summit Iran's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that if the US withdrew from the agreement, it was ready to give an ""appropriate and heavy response"". The US president declared in October that the agreement was ""one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into"",external, and warned that within a few years Iran would be able to ""sprint towards a rapid nuclear weapons breakout"". He accused Iran of committing ""multiple violations"" and promised to work with Congress to ""address the deal's many serious flaws"". Mr Trump said they included the deal's ""sunset clauses"", one of which allows for the lifting of restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment programme after 2025. He also wants to give the International Atomic Energy Agency access to Iranian military sites, and for the deal to cover Iran's ballistic missile programme. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump has said about the Iran deal Critics of the deal in Congress have also proposed amending legislation to ensure that US sanctions would ""snap back"" automatically if Iran carried out certain actions. On Friday, Mr Trump is set to decide whether to extend relief for Iran from some US economic sanctions. The sanctions, which were suspended in 2016, had cut Iran's central bank out of the international financial system and imposed penalties for buying Iranian oil. US officials told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Mr Trump was expected to extend the sanctions relief for another 120 days,external. But they said he might also impose new, targeted sanctions on Iranian businesses and people allegedly involved in missile tests, supporting terrorism, and human rights abuses. On Thursday,  US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he thought President Trump would impose new sanctions on Iran. ""I am expecting new sanctions on Iran,"" he told reporters. ""We continue to look at them. We've rolled them out and I think you can expect there will be more sanctions coming."" The US and EU say Iranian ballistic missile tests conducted in the past year have violated UN Security Council resolution 2231, which endorsed the nuclear deal. The resolution calls upon Iran not to ""undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology"". Iran rejects US assertions that its ballistic missiles are designed to carry nuclear warheads Iran says the missiles it has tested are not designed to carry nuclear warheads and insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. The European ministers expressed serious concern about Iran's ballistic missile programme,external, as well as its alleged transfer of missiles and assistance to non-state entities in the Middle East. But they said the issue should be kept separate from the nuclear deal.

"Ex-chorister is second on Sound Of 2018Rex Orange County is runner-up in the BBC Music Sound of 2018, thanks to his heart-on-sleeve pop songs.3h3 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Rex Orange County: 'I chose it 'cos I like the name Rex' The emotional intricacies of Rex Orange County's exquisite pop songs have earned him second place on BBC Music's Sound of 2018 list, which aims to find music's Next Big Things. Born Alex O'Connor, he grew up in sleepy Haslemere in Surrey, singing in the school choir and disturbing the peace with his drum practice. He briefly attended the Brit School, whose alumni include Adele, Amy Winehouse and Katy B, but released his first, self-produced album before he graduated. Recorded in his bedroom, bcos u will never be free showcased his sweet voice and unselfconscious lyrics, while hinting at his prowess as a songwriter. That came to fruition on last year's Apricot Princess, a breezy, laid-back album of love songs that glides smoothly between pop, rock, hip-hop, jazz and R&B. ""It's so effortless,"" says Annie Mac, who has championed the 19-year-old on her BBC Radio 1 show. ""Every song sounds like a classic."" She's not his only fan: US rapper Tyler, The Creator put O'Connor on his latest album, Flower Boy; Frank Oceanhired him for his touring band,external; and he backed Skepta at last year's Mercury Prize. ""I've been able to do a lot of cool things,"" he tells the BBC. ""That's always the dream, for any artist."" How does it feel to be on the Sound of 2018? It's cool. I'm really honoured to have been chosen. The BBC has shown me a lot of love in the past - so it's great. I'm excited. Do you remember the first time you got played on the radio? For sure! The first person on the BBC that played me was Huw Stephens. I was sat around my laptop with my girlfriend and my family and it was super-exciting. It felt weird and it sounded weirder but it was great. This video can not be played Rex Orange County plays Happiness at The Church Studios for the BBC Sound of 2018 TBC Rex Orange County IAMDDB Khalid Pale Waves Find out more about the Sound of 2018 What was it like growing up in Haslemere? I always played music, I was in a choir when I was super young. I took piano lessons and I wanted to play drums when I was six. Luckily enough, my parents let me have a drum kit in my room - which is kind of crazy. Presumably the countryside's a good place to practice drums because the neighbours aren't too close. It was exceedingly loud now I look back on it - but the neighbours were fine. My mum always said, ""I'm so glad you got better because the first couple of years with you bashing away up there was difficult!"" School was good, too. I had a teacher that really got me into music. And I went to study music for sixth form in London. This is at the Brits School? That's right. I don't really mind people know I went there but I don't feel it defined me or anything. What prompted you to leave the drums behind and become a frontman? Midway through college, I was discovering a lot of artists who played the guitar. Prior to that, I was still studying Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder songs [and] I didn't think guitar was an instrument I was interested in in any way. But when I started actually listening to those songs - the chords and the melodies and the lyrics - I realised I'd rather be doing that because, at that school, the people who played drums were amazing. I mean, I'm totally competent and I've played drums on all my music, but there were people there who were born to play, and I was just not that. I knew I had talents in other fields so I just utilised them. The singer has turned down deals from record labels to release his music independently On Paradise, you sing: ""Who needs an academic career when you're the one with all the ideas?"" Did you grow disillusioned with school? Sort of â¦ I'm a typical artist: I didn't do particularly well with science and maths. School did stress me out, like it does for a lot of young people. I didn't like having to do work that I didn't care about. Your second album, Apricot Princess, is very upbeat compared to the first. What changed? Just before the album was written, I found myself in a relationship and I'm super-positive about it and I wanted to flip what I had previously done. I made the first album when I was angry and upset - and now I'm nowhere near that. Is that your girlfriend singing on Sycamore? Yeah, her name is Thea. So she gets a starring role in her own story. Of course! But it can be anyone's story - I think that's why people like it. People are always messaging me talking about their own experiences with a girl or a boy. The singer says he plans to tour Apricot Princess extensively in 2018 Apricot Princess makes a big leap in terms of arrangements and instrumentation. Was it all recorded live? It was predominantly produced by myself and a recording engineer called Ben Baptie. He helped me get the sounds I wanted from the [computer] files I had, which all sounded like fake instruments. But the real expense was having an eight-piece string section. That was massively overwhelming. You've already followed up that album with a standalone single, Loving Is Easy. Are you quite a prolific writer? I try and write as much as I can. But I don't have a song a day or anything like that. I just do it as best I can. I mean, I'm not very good at anything else. How did you end up on Tyler, The Creator's album? His friend found me on YouTube and showed him the video - and then he emailed me personally. It was pretty out of the blue. Did you believe it was him? Not really. It wasn't like I had people hitting me up all the time, so I was just kind of confused. In the studio with Tyler, The Creator - August 2016 So what did you do? I said, ""I know this probably isn't really you, but if you want to prove it you can just call me right now!"" Instead of doing that, he messaged me on Twitter so I could tell it was his verified account. We started talking about songs we both liked - Stevie Wonder and Amy Winehouse - and it ended up with him having a song he wanted me to do, and I did it! Was it one of those situations where he emailed over an instrumental for you to add vocals in your bedroom? That did happen, but only so he knew it was worth having me come all the way out to LA to do it in the studio with him. When he first sent it, he was like, ""Don't get your hopes up too much, because I still don't know who I want to get on it."" Then you ended up on two songs! It worked out pretty well. I love the album, regardless of my songs. It's his best album, for sure. What does next year hold? Album number three? I'm going to tour this album as much as I can, and the next one is going to be worked on for the whole of the year. It's weird to have an amount of pressure to deliver, now that I've delivered once or twice. So it'll come when it does. That's pretty much all I can say.

Queen's bra fitter loses royal warrant,"This video can not be played June Kenton: ""We never come out of the fitting room talking about a customer, ever"" A company which supplied lingerie to the Queen has lost its royal warrant over a book which revealed details of royal bra fittings. Rigby & Peller, a luxury underwear firm founded in London, had held the royal warrant since 1960. It was withdrawn after June Kenton, who fitted bras for the Queen, released a book called 'Storm in a D-Cup'. Mrs Kenton said there was ""nothing"" in the book to ""be upset about"", adding that it was an ""unbelievable"" decision. Buckingham Palace said it did not ""comment on individual companies"". A statement from Rigby & Peller said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the decision, adding it was ""not able to elaborate further on the cancellation out of respect for her Majesty the Queen and the Royal Warrant Holders Association"". The Royal Warrants Association says 20 to 40 Royal Warrants are cancelled every year - and a similar number granted. Mrs Kenton, from Bushey in Hertfordshire, had bought Rigby & Peller with her husband in 1982 for Â£20,000 before selling a majority stake in 2011 for Â£8m - although she remains on the board. As official ""corsetiere"" to the Queen, Mrs Kenton regularly visited Buckingham Palace and served members of the Royal Family, including the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. The 82-year-old's autobiography was published in March 2017 and gave details of her royal visits. She said she was told by the Palace six months ago that they ""didn't like the book"" and she shouldn't have the royal warrant any more. ""I'm very sad Buckingham Palace took exception to the story - it's a kind and gentle story about what went on in my life,"" she said. ""I only ever said I went there, not what happened.

The royal warrant for chemist Boots is displayed in the window of their Oxford Street branch For centuries, royal warrants have been issued to trades people and companies who regularly supply goods or services to the monarchy. The royal warrant is granted to a named individual and gives them permission and responsibility for the display of the relevant Royal Arms in connection with the business. They are not granted for professional services, such as to bankers or solicitors, or to publications such as newspapers and magazines. The Monarch decides who is able to grant a royal warrant. Currently there are three people, known as the grantors, who may award them - the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales. Companies can apply to the Royal Warrant Holders Association after they have supplied the royal household with goods or services for at least five years out of seven. G.D. Golding tailors, who hold a royal warrant for services to the royal household There are currently about 800 holders representing a cross-section of trade and industry. The warrants come up for review every five years and their renewal generally depends on how much the shop is being used by the Royal Family. Department store Harrods had its royal warrant withdrawn from the Duke of Edinburgh in 2000. The reason given by a Palace spokesman was a ""significant decline in the trading relationship"" between the Duke and the store. But the BBC understood that Prince Philip was angered by allegations made by owner Mohamed al Fayed accusing the Duke of masterminding the 1997 car crash in Paris that killed Diana, Princess of Wales and his son Dodi. The royal endorsement can also be removed if a brand stops being used by the Palace, such as Carr's Table Water biscuits, which lost its warrant in 2012 because of ""lower demand"". It can also be lost over a company's reputation - Hoover's was revoked in 2004 following an unflattering BBC documentary about the vacuum company. How important is a Royal Warrant?

Woman accused of garden body murder,"The woman is also charged with preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body and fraud A woman has appeared in court accused of murdering a man 12 years ago after police found a body buried in a garden in Greater Manchester. Barbara Coombes, 63, is also charged with preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body and fraud. Remains, believed to be those of her father Kenneth Coombes, were found in Reddish, Stockport on Tuesday. Ms Coombes, of Reddish, was remanded in custody by magistrates and is due at Manchester Crown Court on Friday. At Manchester Magistrates' Court Ms Coombes, of Matlock Road, spoke only to confirm her details and did not enter a plea. She is accused of killing Mr Coombes in January 2006 and preventing the lawful and decent burial of his body between his death and 10 January 2018. She is also accused of fraud in the same period through dishonestly making a false representation by sending official letters in the name of Mr Coombes, intending to make a gain by claiming monies not belonging to herself. The final charge is obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception between 7 January 7 2006 and 15 January 2007, by making a false representation that she was a carer for Mr Coombes. Inquiries began on Sunday, after police said a woman walked into a police station in South Manchester and told officers she killed a man several years ago and had buried him in the garden. After a forensic search at the property in Matlock Road, police handed questionnaires to neighbours to ask them if they remember Mr Coombes, who was born on 9 January 1919. Police said the remains have not yet been formally identified and results of a post-mortem examination have not been released.

Grenfell paramedic caught doing 116mph,"David Hickling has received The Queen's Award for his work A paramedic who was one of the first at the scene of the Grenfell Tower disaster has avoided a driving ban after being caught speeding at 116mph. David Hickling, 46, of South Benfleet, Essex, was caught while off duty on the A55 near Caerwys, Flintshire, in July. The London Ambulance Service suspended him and Hickling said a driving ban would cost him his job. Flintshire magistrates gave him six points on his driving licence and he must pay Â£635 in fines and costs. Hickling was driving to a terrorism-related training course when he was clocked in July,three weeks after the tower fire that killed 71 people. He admitted breaking the 70mph (110km/h) speed limit but told Flintshire Magistrates' Court at Mold that a driving ban would mean the end of his career of 22 years. A psychotherapist's report showed the exceptional stress Hickling was under. He served for five years in the Army and had been in his present role for the past eight years. Magistrates heard Hickling, the clinical leader for the hazardous area emergency team, was involved in the search and recovery of bodies at the London tower block. He already had six points on his licence, but magistrates accepted a ban would cause exceptional hardship. Seventy-one people were killed in the west London tower block fire in June His barrister Phil Williams told the court his client was the bronze commander for the ambulance service and first on the scene at the Grenfell Tower disaster and responded following the Westminster Bridge attack. Chairman Terry Eastham said: ""Society is grateful to such people and the personal cost involved will never be truly known."" Hickling told the court he had been informed by his employers that if he received a ban then ""I will no longer be able to carry out my work."" The court heard his work had affected his mental health but he had been determined to remain on duty because of his great sense of responsibility towards his team. Mr Williams said his client did not seek sympathy or make excuses, but was in a highly pressurised job he carried out with honour. He said Hickling was ""extremely sorry"" and embarrassed for the offence and the difficulty he had placed himself and the ambulance service in. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?

Ex-chorister is second on Sound Of 2018,"This video can not be played Rex Orange County: 'I chose it 'cos I like the name Rex' The emotional intricacies of Rex Orange County's exquisite pop songs have earned him second place on BBC Music's Sound of 2018 list, which aims to find music's Next Big Things. Born Alex O'Connor, he grew up in sleepy Haslemere in Surrey, singing in the school choir and disturbing the peace with his drum practice. He briefly attended the Brit School, whose alumni include Adele, Amy Winehouse and Katy B, but released his first, self-produced album before he graduated. Recorded in his bedroom, bcos u will never be free showcased his sweet voice and unselfconscious lyrics, while hinting at his prowess as a songwriter. That came to fruition on last year's Apricot Princess, a breezy, laid-back album of love songs that glides smoothly between pop, rock, hip-hop, jazz and R&B. ""It's so effortless,"" says Annie Mac, who has championed the 19-year-old on her BBC Radio 1 show. ""Every song sounds like a classic."" She's not his only fan: US rapper Tyler, The Creator put O'Connor on his latest album, Flower Boy; Frank Oceanhired him for his touring band,external; and he backed Skepta at last year's Mercury Prize. ""I've been able to do a lot of cool things,"" he tells the BBC. ""That's always the dream, for any artist."" How does it feel to be on the Sound of 2018? It's cool. I'm really honoured to have been chosen. The BBC has shown me a lot of love in the past - so it's great. I'm excited. Do you remember the first time you got played on the radio? For sure! The first person on the BBC that played me was Huw Stephens. I was sat around my laptop with my girlfriend and my family and it was super-exciting. It felt weird and it sounded weirder but it was great. This video can not be played Rex Orange County plays Happiness at The Church Studios for the BBC Sound of 2018 TBC Rex Orange County IAMDDB Khalid Pale Waves Find out more about the Sound of 2018 What was it like growing up in Haslemere? I always played music, I was in a choir when I was super young. I took piano lessons and I wanted to play drums when I was six. Luckily enough, my parents let me have a drum kit in my room - which is kind of crazy. Presumably the countryside's a good place to practice drums because the neighbours aren't too close. It was exceedingly loud now I look back on it - but the neighbours were fine. My mum always said, ""I'm so glad you got better because the first couple of years with you bashing away up there was difficult!"" School was good, too. I had a teacher that really got me into music. And I went to study music for sixth form in London. This is at the Brits School? That's right. I don't really mind people know I went there but I don't feel it defined me or anything. What prompted you to leave the drums behind and become a frontman? Midway through college, I was discovering a lot of artists who played the guitar. Prior to that, I was still studying Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder songs [and] I didn't think guitar was an instrument I was interested in in any way. But when I started actually listening to those songs - the chords and the melodies and the lyrics - I realised I'd rather be doing that because, at that school, the people who played drums were amazing. I mean, I'm totally competent and I've played drums on all my music, but there were people there who were born to play, and I was just not that. I knew I had talents in other fields so I just utilised them. The singer has turned down deals from record labels to release his music independently On Paradise, you sing: ""Who needs an academic career when you're the one with all the ideas?"" Did you grow disillusioned with school? Sort of â¦ I'm a typical artist: I didn't do particularly well with science and maths. School did stress me out, like it does for a lot of young people. I didn't like having to do work that I didn't care about. Your second album, Apricot Princess, is very upbeat compared to the first. What changed? Just before the album was written, I found myself in a relationship and I'm super-positive about it and I wanted to flip what I had previously done. I made the first album when I was angry and upset - and now I'm nowhere near that. Is that your girlfriend singing on Sycamore? Yeah, her name is Thea. So she gets a starring role in her own story. Of course! But it can be anyone's story - I think that's why people like it. People are always messaging me talking about their own experiences with a girl or a boy. The singer says he plans to tour Apricot Princess extensively in 2018 Apricot Princess makes a big leap in terms of arrangements and instrumentation. Was it all recorded live? It was predominantly produced by myself and a recording engineer called Ben Baptie. He helped me get the sounds I wanted from the [computer] files I had, which all sounded like fake instruments. But the real expense was having an eight-piece string section. That was massively overwhelming. You've already followed up that album with a standalone single, Loving Is Easy. Are you quite a prolific writer? I try and write as much as I can. But I don't have a song a day or anything like that. I just do it as best I can. I mean, I'm not very good at anything else. How did you end up on Tyler, The Creator's album? His friend found me on YouTube and showed him the video - and then he emailed me personally. It was pretty out of the blue. Did you believe it was him? Not really. It wasn't like I had people hitting me up all the time, so I was just kind of confused. In the studio with Tyler, The Creator - August 2016 So what did you do? I said, ""I know this probably isn't really you, but if you want to prove it you can just call me right now!"" Instead of doing that, he messaged me on Twitter so I could tell it was his verified account. We started talking about songs we both liked - Stevie Wonder and Amy Winehouse - and it ended up with him having a song he wanted me to do, and I did it! Was it one of those situations where he emailed over an instrumental for you to add vocals in your bedroom? That did happen, but only so he knew it was worth having me come all the way out to LA to do it in the studio with him. When he first sent it, he was like, ""Don't get your hopes up too much, because I still don't know who I want to get on it."" Then you ended up on two songs! It worked out pretty well. I love the album, regardless of my songs. It's his best album, for sure. What does next year hold? Album number three? I'm going to tour this album as much as I can, and the next one is going to be worked on for the whole of the year. It's weird to have an amount of pressure to deliver, now that I've delivered once or twice. So it'll come when it does. That's pretty much all I can say.

Koala screwed to post sparks Australia anger,"The incident has drawn widespread condemnation Australian animal welfare authorities are investigating the discovery of a dead koala that was screwed to a wooden post, in an act criticised as ""sick"". The incident has caused widespread anger after a photo of the marsupial was posted on social media. Council workers found the koala fixed by its paws to a wooden shelter in a park in Queensland on Wednesday. The perpetrator could face animal cruelty charges if found, animal protection charity RSPCA said. It is not yet known how the koala died. Its fur was matted with blood, and gum leaves had been hung in front of it. ""It's just sick, it makes me want to throw up,"" Murray Chambers, from Koala Rescue Queensland, told the BBC. ""I've been doing this job for 10 years and I've never seen anything like it."" The not-for-profit group put the image on Facebook in a bid to find the perpetrator, in a post that has drawn thousands of shares. Commenter Sandy Fiorentini wrote: ""How sad to think we as humans could inflict such cruelty on a defenceless living creature... there are sick humans out there.""

The picnic area was close to a road in Imbil, about 120km (75 miles) north of Brisbane. ""My gut feeling is that it was hit but why would you screw a koala to a wooden structure?"" he said. ""And was it alive when they did it?"" The koala was fixed to the pole with building screws, local media reported.

Armed heist at Ritz Paris nets millionsFive men reportedly smashed a window at the luxurious hotel and grabbed jewellery.13h13 hours agoEurope,"Police guard the hotel's rear entrance on Cambon street Armed robbers have seized millions of euros worth of merchandise from a jewellery shop at the famous Ritz Hotel in Paris. Five men armed with axes smashed a window at the shop inside the hotel at about 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT), French media report.

The Ritz is among the most luxurious hotels in Paris Local newspaper Le Parisien, citing a police source, reports that the robbery was interrupted by an officer on patrol, but two people escaped on a motorised scooter. The city's police commissioner issued a statement on Twitter thanking officers for their quick reactions, which led to the arrest of three men. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb also offered praise, saying they were ""a credit to our police"". Eyewitnesses reported a heavy police presence in the area. One hotel employee told the AFP news agency: ""We heard a loud noise and lots of racket in the street"". ""Passers-by took refuge in the hotel.

Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from London, has been held in a Tehran prison for 21 months on spying charges she denies.

Quadruple amputee girl 'to return home',"Kia Gott had all four limbs amputated after she got meningitis in September A one-year-old girl who had all of her limbs amputated after contracting meningitis C will be allowed home by April, doctors have said. Kia Gott, from Bradford, has been in hospital since September and has endured multiple skin grafts. Her father Paul said he ""felt like we won the lottery"" when he was told the news by a hospital consultant earlier. Medics have described Kia's condition as ""one of the worst cases of meningitis"" ever seen. Kia Gott celebrated her first birthday last month while in Leeds General Infirmary Kia's mother, Vikki Mitchell, said: ""It was something we thought we'd never hear. I nearly burst out crying it was that emotional. ""[The last few months] have been absolute torture. We weren't sure if she was ever going to make it. ""Four weeks ago the consultant actually gave us a letter saying she was pretty confident that Kia wasn't going to make it. Then today we've met her again and she's now convinced that Kia will be home by April. ""I feel like she's just been born again. The feeling you get when you've just had a baby. Words can't describe it,"" added Mr Gott. Kia's mum Vikki Mitchell says the last few months have been ""absolute torture"" He said the family, from Woodside, Bradford, were starting to prepare for Kia's return by learning all aspects of her care. ""It's very nerve-wracking because I have never even been around a disabled child before. It's life changing for us all,"" said Ms Mitchell. ""It's like entering into the unknown everyday"", added Mr Gott. The pair said they would be organising a ""massive homecoming party"". But the ""urgent priority"" was to move to the Wyke area before Kia's arrival and they said they had asked their local MP Judith Cummins for help. ""We have a lot of support in Wyke - all my family live there - and we really need them for when Kia comes home,"" said Ms Mitchell. Kia before the ""living nightmare"" Meningitis is an infection of the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Kia contracted the condition last year before she could receive the Men C vaccine, which is administered to infants at about 12 months old. The government stopped the vaccination for three-month-old babies last year.

"M&S sees Christmas food sales fallMarks and Spencer reported a ""mixed quarter"", while supermarket Tesco boasted record festive trade.","M&S food sales fell in the key Christmas trading period Marks and Spencer sales fell over the key Christmas period, while Tesco reported record festive trade. M&S said like-for-like revenues fell 1.4% in the 13 weeks to 30 December. Clothing and homeware fell 2.8%, while food, seen as its most successful sector, was down 0.4%. By contrast, Tesco's UK sales rose 2.3% in the 19 weeks to 6 January. The supermarket said it enjoyed ""record sales and volumes"" in the four weeks leading up to Christmas Day. Shares in M&S fell 5.6%, while Tesco shed 4.8%. Christmas shopping: the winners and losers The two trading updates came as other retailers released figures for the Christmas period. John Lewis said like-for-like sales rose 3.1% for the six weeks to 30 December, while its Waitrose supermarket chain posted a 1.5% rise compared with the same period in 2016. In other retail news: Department storeHouse of Frasersaid sales in stores for the six weeks to 23 December declined by 2.9%, while online sales were down 7.5% in the period Online fashion retailerBoohoosaid its UK revenues increased 107% in the last four months of 2017 All three major retailers alluded to difficulties in the market and tough trading conditions, with Tesco speaking of ""inflationary pressures"" and M&S referring to ""ongoing trading pressures"". Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said he expected trading to remain volatile ""due to the economic environment and anticipate that competitive intensity will continue"". M&S chief executive Steve Rowe said it had been a ""mixed quarter"", with ""a weak clothing market in October and ongoing underperformance in our food like-for-like sales"". He added: ""Our revenue grew both in-store and online over the weeks leading up to Christmas, and we held our full-price stance in a very promotional market and did not participate in Black Friday. ""However, the impact of an unseasonal October resulted in an overall revenue decline."" As ever, the all-important Christmas trading has brought a mixed bag of fortunes for retailers. Tesco is in the winning camp today with a decent set of figures. On the whole, food sales have done far better than non-food, helped by inflation. Morrisons and Co-op were notable performers. Marks and Spencer, still the UK's biggest clothing retailer, saw sales in fashion and homewares go into reverse again, after positive results the previous year. And it has underperformed in food. Meanwhile, John Lewis reported very good clothing sales, with strong numbers overall for the department store chain. It's firmly in the winners camp, although its profit margins will take a knock thanks to price matching. And Boohoo, the small but fast-growing online fashion retailer, saw its revenues double over the last four months, with growth the mainstream retailers can only dream of. What does it all tell us? It's been a tough Christmas quarter overall, far from golden. It's been hard going all year. There are always winners and losers, but the gap between the strongest and weakest players seems to be getting bigger. And the relentless rise of online continues. Bryan Roberts of TCC Global said a last-minute rush for M&S proved ""too little, too late to rescue the overall period"". He added: ""It is within food that many rivals have closed the gap on M&S in terms of innovation and premium ranges, while also putting M&S's prices in sharp relief. We would like to see a simpler pricing architecture with less reliance on multi-buys."" Meanwhile, Tesco said it was ""confident"" in its full-year outlook following its performance over Christmas. Chief executive Dave Lewis said: ""We have continued to outperform the market throughout this period, particularly in fresh food, thanks to our most competitive offer for many years."" Natalie Berg, global research director of Planet Retail, told BBC Breakfast that Tesco would never return to its former glory, but had responded well to its difficulties: ""The ship has been steadied and they're doing all the right things.""

Kuenssberg: Time for an answer on the NHS?,"There are some things that are more or less unsayable in politics, at least for people who want to win elections. For many years, any serious conversations about big changes to the NHS or its principles have been on that list. But with the service creaking, individual horror stories emerging during this winter's period of pressure, the chorus of ""something must be done"" is growing louder. This morning's latest figures that will give the statistical verdict on the frustration of patients and problems for hospitals in England will give more ammunition to those, including Tory MPs and the prime minister's influential former chief of staff who are arguing for a Royal Commission, or cross-party conversation to thrash out the issues. Hospital's cancer care 'unsustainable' We must do better on NHS waits - Hunt Behind closed doors pretty much every politician will acknowledge the service is going to need more money, but it's a question of how, when, and with what strings attached. But while there have been lots of demands for a proper debate on what's next, ideas and proposals are thinner on the ground. With even theHealth Secretary Jeremy Huntwishing he had more answers for 'long term funding', however, maybe they will start to emerge. Today the former minister Nick Boles, considered one of the Tories' big brains, is venturing an idea that he believes could provide a solution, give long-term stability to the NHS finances and take some of the political grand standing out of the issue. Inthe latest chapter of his book,external, he argues it is ""foolish to delude ourselves that we can meet legitimate demands for high quality care without spending more money"". Without reform he writes, the NHS is a ""cuckoo in the Treasury nest, hungrily demanding ever more money and pushing other public services ever closer to the edge"". His answer is a ""hypothecated tax"", rebranding national insurance as 'National Health Insurance', where voters' payments of NI overtly go specifically to the NHS, the money held and distributed from a stand-alone fund, outside the Treasury's grasp, spent according to plans set every five years. Traditionally such an idea would be likely to send a chancellor to hospital with a panic attack themselves. But while it's not perfect, interestingly the idea of a specific tax for health has the backing of a former boss of the Treasury, Nick McPherson, among others. Number 11 hates to lose control of money, but politically, as the NHS struggles, demands for new thinking are building. It's of course quite possible, with the demands of Brexit and the difficulty of touching the NHS at all, that Number 10 will simply hope to get through the annual winter stresses, carry on with its reform and get on quietly with its longer term planning to reform social care. Labour will continue to make the case that more money is urgently required and that private providers are gobbling up too much of the NHS Budget. Certainly, it would be surprising if Theresa May was to hunt for any radical change soon. And government sources say most people's experience of the health service is still very positive, so perhaps there's no real demand for change and once the winter passes all will be well. That feels optimistic though. Some NHS insiders argue that the service and its current model is reaching the end of its very long tether. In fact, today the boss of NHS providers, the organisation that represents hospital managers, has written to the health sec saying the service can't go on like this and is at a 'watershed moment' The targets that have been recently missed will be extremely hard to reach again. Voices like Boles' joining the demands for change matter. And most importantly, each day of difficulty for the NHS that's witnessed or experienced by members of the public first hand brings us closer to a day when ""something must be done"" becomes a political demand that is impossible to ignore.

"Breaking|Breaking newsWoman charged over garden body findWoman, 63, charged with murder after police find a body buried in a Stockport garden5m6 minutes agoManchester","The woman is also charged with preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body and fraud A woman has appeared in court accused of murdering a man 12 years ago after police found a body buried in a garden in Greater Manchester. Barbara Coombes, 63, is also charged with preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body and fraud. Remains, believed to be those of her father Kenneth Coombes, were found in Reddish, Stockport on Tuesday. Ms Coombes, of Reddish, was remanded in custody by magistrates and is due at Manchester Crown Court on Friday. At Manchester Magistrates' Court Ms Coombes, of Matlock Road, spoke only to confirm her details and did not enter a plea. She is accused of killing Mr Coombes in January 2006 and preventing the lawful and decent burial of his body between his death and 10 January 2018. She is also accused of fraud in the same period through dishonestly making a false representation by sending official letters in the name of Mr Coombes, intending to make a gain by claiming monies not belonging to herself. The final charge is obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception between 7 January 7 2006 and 15 January 2007, by making a false representation that she was a carer for Mr Coombes. Inquiries began on Sunday, after police said a woman walked into a police station in South Manchester and told officers she killed a man several years ago and had buried him in the garden. After a forensic search at the property in Matlock Road, police handed questionnaires to neighbours to ask them if they remember Mr Coombes, who was born on 9 January 1919. Police said the remains have not yet been formally identified and results of a post-mortem examination have not been released.

"Russian ex-cop on trial for 59 murdersMikhail Popkov, 53, could be Russia's most prolific serial killer in recent history.","A former Russian policeman who was convicted of killing 22 women has gone on trial in the Siberian city of Irkutsk for dozens of other murders. Mikhail Popkov, 53, has confessed to 59 additional murders between 1992 and 2010, Interfax news agency reports. If convicted, that would make him Russia's most prolific serial killer in recent history. He has been dubbed ""the werewolf"" and the ""Angarsk maniac"" by Russian media. Popkov is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2015 of raping and killing 22 women, and attempting to murder two more. The murders are said to have taken place in and around his home city of Angarsk, near Irkutsk, both while he was a police officer and after he left the service in 1998. His victims and alleged victims were all women between the ages of 16 and 40 apart from one male, a policeman. Prosecutors say Popkov killed them after offering them lifts late at night, sometimes in a police car, while he was off-duty. He was arrested in 2012 during a re-examination of the evidence, which involved the DNA testing of people who drove a make of car whose tracks were found at the scenes of murders. If convicted of all 81 murders, the number of victims would exceed those of ""chessboard killer"" Alexander Pichushkin, who killed 48 people, and Andrei Chikatilo, convicted of 52 murders during the Soviet era.

We'll be back at 6am sharp tomorrow to bring you the latest business and markets news. We'll have a trading update from one of the UK's biggest housebuilders, Bovis Homes. The US corporate earnings season will also get underway in earnest with results from banking giant JP Morgan. Wall Street has got back to winning ways. The three main indexes all finished at record highs as rising oil prices boosted energy stocks and
investors bet on a strong US corporate results season.  US stocks dropped yesterday after a report that China could cut its holdings in US government debt caused turbulence on financial markets. Beijing dismissed the report today, suggesting it was ""fake news"", which helped to settle trading in dollars and US bonds. We now know the posse that President Trump is taking with him to Davos later this month. Treasury chief Steve Mnuchin, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner are on a list of 12 delegates who will be attending the economic gathering. Trump's attendance is something of a surprise. For decades, the US was the biggest driving force behind moves to stimulate more international trade. Now it's the most important sceptic. So the big question - for Davos and for the rest of 2018 - has to be: what can we expect from him, and other forces around the world that share his doubts about trade? Read Andrew Walker's answers here. The job losses at Vauxhall's flagship car factory, which will now exceed 650 workers, has led to calls from Labour MPs for more government support for manufacturing. Speaking in parliament, Conservative minister Paul Maynard said he was ""disappointed"" by the further job losses at Ellesmere Port. Mr Maynard, who was a transport minister until this week's reshuffle, said: ""The government are trying to engage with Vauxhall further throughout the process to do all we can both to protect UK jobs and to help those who are affected."" Business secretary Greg Clark was reportedly in Paris yesterday meeting with the boss of Peugeot-Citroen, which bought Vauxhall last year, about the future of the business. Former pensions minister Baroness Ros Altmann has welcomed BHS owner Dominic Chappell being found guilty of failing to provide information to the pension regulator. Mr Chappell, who was in charge when the department store chain collapsed, has said he will appeal the decision. BHS went under in 2016, leaving a Â£571m black hole and 17,000 pension scheme members.

On the same day that Walmart announced it was raising its staff's minimum pay, it has also revealed plans to shut dozens of its wholesale shops. The move to close 63 Sam's Club stores - which are like cash-and-carries in the UK - will result in hundreds of job losses. The closures clouded a decision by the world's biggest retailer to start paying its US staff at least $11 an hour and hand some of them a one-off cash bonus. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed that the pay deal was further proof that the newly-passed tax bill is returning money to workers. However, at a press conference Mr Mnuchin dismissed questions about the layoffs. ""Lots of things are going on in the economy,"" he said. ""We appreciate what Walmart's doing."" Dominic Chappell, the owner of BHS when it collapsed, says he will appeal a court decision that he failed to provide information to the pension regulator. Speaking to reporters outside court, Mr Chappell said: ""As you can imagine I'm extremely disappointed and annoyed about the
outcome. ""I've instructed my legal team to put in an immediate application for an
appeal on this case, which we will be doing tomorrow. ""We feel that this case has not been treated fairly and we will look deeply
into this."" Mr Chappell was found guilty on three charges of failing to provide information demanded by the Pensions Regulator, which could lead to a heavy fine. Donald Trump's decision to speak at Davos later this month has raised some eyebrows. The annual economic gathering has a reputation for bringing together the global elite and fans of globalisation - both of which Trump campaigned against on his way to the White House. But his Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, has defended Trump's decision to attend. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vauxhall's newly appointed boss, Stephen Norman, says Brexit is making it harder for the carmaker to plan ahead. ""So long as there are two, three or possibly more sets of
viable hypotheses [due to Brexit] with different forecasts and
different financial parameters, it's very difficult to make a
clear decision,"" he told reporters. New owners Peugeot-Citroen are due to decide as early as this year whether to build new models at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant. Earlier this week, Vauxhall announced it was cutting another 250 jobs at Ellesmere Port - taking total job losses to near 700 - to become more competitive. French
luxury goods group Kering is evaluating options for German sports goods
brand Puma. Sources told Reuters that Kering has been considering spinning off Puma for a while. Kering currently owns an 85% stake in Puma. The Pinault family controls Kering, and spinning off Puma would see the stake distributed amongst Kering's shareholders. This would give the Pinault family a direct stake in the sporting goods firm. Former BHS owner Dominic Chappell has been
convicted at Brighton Magistrates' Court of failing to provide information about
the firm's pension schemes to investigators. The Pensions Regulator had accused him of
neglecting or refusing requests made through legally enforceable Section 72
notices under the Pension Act 2004. Mr
Chappell argued that he didnât have the information available because heâd been
shut out of his office at BHS after administrators took over, and because tax
officers had raided his home removing computers and files. The judge, Mr William Ashworth,
said that he was not a credible witness, that parts of his explanation made no
sense, and that others he simply did not believe. Mr Chappell, a former racing
driver and self-proclaimed business turnaround specialist, bought BHS for Â£1 from the retail tycoon, Sir Philip Green. Oil has hit a three-year high of $70 a barrel. So what does it mean for drivers? The chart above shows you how petrol and diesel prices have been rising over the past six months. In that time, oil has risen by more than 60% from a low of $42.50 a barrel. That's despite oil accounting for only a fraction of the price of a litre at the pumps. There are also currency fluctuations, petrol garages' margins, and - the biggest chunk - tax. BBC business correspondent tweets Allow Twitter content?

Earlier we brought you the news that a new boss has been put in charge of British car maker Vauxhall. Stephen Norman, who's been installed by Vauxhall's new owners Peugeot-Citroen, said he hopes to bring about a ""radical improvement"" in its fortunes. It comes as the Labour MP Justin Madders raised the issue in parliament of Vauxhall cutting another 250 jobs in his constituency of Ellesmere Port, and called for government support. Former Transport Minister Paul Maynard said the government was planning to talk to the company. Dominic Chappell, the former boss of BHS, has been on trial this week for failing to provide information about the collapsed department store's pension schemes. The judge has been
deliberating for nearly six hours, according to BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz. A decision could come at the Brighton court this evening, he adds. We'll bring you the news if it does. Bad news for Wilkinson Sword and people who buy their blades to fit on
rival Gillette's popular Mach 3 razor. A German court has ruled that the blades - which
can sell for 30% less than Gillette's - infringe the US company's patent rights. But Wilkinson's owner
Edgewell Personal Care said it was confident the ruling would be nullified in
Germany's patent court, as the patent expires early next month. A spokeswoman for Gillette
said: ""This patent and other patents are still valid in many markets
around the world, including Germany, which is why we brought this
lawsuit."" Simon JackBBC Business Editor Banks and financial firms are prepared to consider helping the government pay for access to the single market. Such firms can sell financial products and services throughout the EU from the UK using a financial ""passport"" - but that freedom will end after Brexit. Downing Street says the ""position hasn't changed"" (see post at 17:02) and the UK should not have to pay to get what we already have for free - and for something the EU also values. Nevertheless, financial services chiefs have made clear there is a big potential cost to losing access to the EU. If the price for keeping it is right, some think it might be worth paying. The UK's 100 share index kept its new year rally going as it finished at an all-time high for the third day in a row. The FTSE 100 finished 0.2% higher at 7762.94 points. It was given a boost by oil giants BP and Shell, as well as miners like Anglo American, on the back of rising oil and metal prices. Retailers Tesco and Marks & Spencer were
among the biggest fallers after their
Christmas trading updates disappointed. Theresa May met with UK finance leaders in Downing Street this afternoon to update them on the Brexit negotiations. Among those at the talks were Barclays chief Jes Staley (pictured), Lloyds of London chief executive Inga Beale and HSBC
chairman Mark Tucker. But some of the attendees will have gone away disappointed after Downing Street ruled out UK payments for the City to continue to access the EU's single market.

Tunisia hit by new anti-austerity protests,"This video can not be played Violence at anti-austerity protests in Tunisia More than 300 people have been arrested in Tunisia overnight, as anger over the government's austerity measures spilled into the streets once more. Police used tear gas against large crowds demonstrating against price rises affecting basic goods. The army was deployed into towns across the country to protect government buildings, which have become targets. PM Youssef Chahed condemned acts of ""vandalism"" by the protesters, saying they were trying to weaken the state. Protests have taken place in at least 10 different areas, including the capital, Tunis, in the last few days. The protests began peacefully last week, but escalated on Monday evening. Wednesday was the third successive night of violence, with almost 600 people arrested in total since the start of the week. There have been protests in all of these towns Interior ministry spokesman Khelifa Chiban told news outlets that more than 300 were arrested on Wednesday night alone. The government has accused demonstrators of torching police cars and attacking officials. Some people attempted to take over shopping malls and stores, while others blocked roads. The army was also forced to enter the town of Thala, near the Algerian border, overnight on Wednesday after police were forced to retreat after protesters burnt down the national security offices, news agency Reuters reports. The defence ministry said the army was now protecting banks, post offices and other government buildings in Tunisia's main cities. Not all protests are violent, however. Local news agency Tass reported the Tunisian students' union organised a sit-in at the theatre in Tunis, the country's capital,  before marching towards the offices of the interior ministry. Demonstrators have also accused police of a violent crackdown. ""The protests are over the cost of living,"" one protester in Tunis told the BBC. ""Prices of medicine have increased. Everything has, and salaries have not. I don't think this is the right time for price hikes."" Big rallies are planned for Friday. The demonstrators are demanding the government drop the 2018 budget, which opposition groups describe as unfair. They also want to see more welfare payments for struggling families. People are demanding an end to austerity The protests come after the government announced an increase in value-added tax and social contributions in the budget. The new financial year has also brought with it price hikes on some goods and increased taxes on imports. Tunisia's economy has been struggling since the 2011 revolution, when Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was forced to flee after more than 20 years in power. The revolution was sparked by the country's high unemployment rates and worries about corruption. Seven years on, and nine governments later, some of those same problems remain - not helped by a number of terrorist attacks which have damaged Tunisia's tourism industry and foreign investment opportunities. In December 2017, the International Monetary Fund told Tunisia it needed to take ""urgent action"" and ""decisive measures"" to reduce its deficit. The IMF gave the country a $2.9bn (Â£2.2bn) loan in 2015. Mr Chahed has said Tunisians can look forward to better times ahead. ""People have to understand that the situation is extraordinary and their country is having difficulties, but we believe that 2018 will be the last difficult year for the Tunisians,"" he said on Tuesday.

Butterfly origins pushed back in time,"One of the scales under the microscope Newly discovered fossils show that moths and butterflies have been on the planet for at least 200 million years. Scientists found fossilised butterfly scales the size of a speck of dust inside ancient rock from Germany. The find pushes back the date for the origins of the Lepidoptera, one of the most prized and studied insect groups. Researchers say they can learn more about the conservation of butterflies and moths by studying their early evolution. They used acid to dissolve ancient rocks, leaving behind small fragments, including ""perfectly preserved"" scales that covered the wings of early moths and butterflies. ""We found the microscopic remains of these organisms in the form of these scales,"" said Dr Bas van de Schootbrugge from Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Intriguingly, they show that some of the moths and butterflies belonged to a group still alive today that have long straw-like tongues for sucking up nectar. A living moth from the group ""These finds push back the evolution of this group with proboscises - with a tongue - by about 70 million years,"" said Dr van de Schootbrugge. ""Our finds show that the group that was supposed to co-evolve with flowers is actually much older."" The Jurassic was a world dominated by gymnosperm plants, such as conifers, which produced sugary nectar to capture pollen from the air. The primitive insects may have fed on this nectar, before flowering plants came along around 130 million years ago. Dr Russell Garwood of the University of Manchester, who is not connected with the study, said it had always been assumed that coiled mouthparts had evolved alongside the flowers that these animals pollinate. ""This new evidence suggests that perhaps the coiled mouthparts had another role, before flowering plants evolved,"" he said. The rock was drilled from the ground east of Hannover The study, published in the journalScience Advances,external, gives clues to how butterflies and moths became so widespread, thriving on every continent except Antarctica. The early Lepidopterans survived the mass extinction at the end of the Triassic, which wiped out many other living things. This knowledge will help inform modern conservation efforts, said Dr Timo van Eldijk, also of Utrecht University, the lead researcher on the study. The information is ""paramount to help us piece together how current manmade climate change might affect insects and their evolution in the future"", he said. The scales are similar to those seen on this moth Butterflies and moths are fragile creatures, meaning fossil evidence is rare. Scientists have relied largely on DNA evidence from modern butterflies and moths, which can be used to make an evolutionary tree of life. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

Koala fixed to post sparks Australia anger,"The incident has drawn widespread condemnation Australian animal welfare authorities are investigating the discovery of a dead koala that was screwed to a wooden post, in an act criticised as ""sick"". The incident has caused widespread anger after a photo of the marsupial was posted on social media. Council workers found the koala fixed by its paws to a wooden shelter in a park in Queensland on Wednesday. The perpetrator could face animal cruelty charges if found, animal protection charity RSPCA said. It is not yet known how the koala died. Its fur was matted with blood, and gum leaves had been hung in front of it. ""It's just sick, it makes me want to throw up,"" Murray Chambers, from Koala Rescue Queensland, told the BBC. ""I've been doing this job for 10 years and I've never seen anything like it."" The not-for-profit group put the image on Facebook in a bid to find the perpetrator, in a post that has drawn thousands of shares. Commenter Sandy Fiorentini wrote: ""How sad to think we as humans could inflict such cruelty on a defenceless living creature... there are sick humans out there."" You might also be interested in: Giant bat remains discovered in New Zealand Yakuza boss caught after tattoos go viral Woman behind Media Men list comes forward Mr Chambers said the koala may have been struck by a car. The picnic area was close to a road in Imbil, about 120km (75 miles) north of Brisbane. ""My gut feeling is that it was hit but why would you screw a koala to a wooden structure?"" he said. ""And was it alive when they did it?"" The koala was fixed to the pole with building screws, local media reported.

"US 'could conceivably' rejoin Paris dealThe US president says he has no problem with the climate agreement, just the US part of the deal.5h5 hours agoUS & Canada","Donald Trump gave no indication of how likely it would be for the US to return to the accord President Donald Trump has said the US could ""conceivably"" return to the 2015 Paris climate accord if an agreement treated America more fairly. He said it ""was a bad deal for the US"", repeating comments made when he announced the US withdrawal last June. But he said he had no problem with the accord itself. A US pull-out will make the US in effect the only country not to be part of the accord. The announcement sparked global anger. Some critics have called it an abdication of US leadership on a key global challenge. The Paris agreement commits countries to keeping the rise in global temperatures ""well below""  2C more than pre-industrial levels and aiming for a tighter limit of 1.5C. In a separate development on Wednesday, New York City announced plans to sell off $5bn (Â£3.7bn) in fossil fuel investments from its $189bn public pension funds over the next five years. The city authorities also filed a multibillion dollar lawsuit against five major oil companies, seeking damages for ""contributions to global warming"". New York City said the lawsuit against BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell would help fund protection against climate change. The lawsuit follows similar recent moves by a number of cities in California. The reasons Trump wanted to leave deal Analysis: The world's crying, not laughing Five effects of US pullout ""It's an agreement that I have no problem with but I had a problem with the agreement that they (the Obama administration) signed because, as usual, they made a bad deal,"" he told reporters. ""So we could conceivably go back in. Mr Trump stressed his administration's commitment to environmental issues, ""clean water, clean air"", but added ""we also want businesses that can compete"". ""The Paris accord really would have taken away our competitive edge, and we're not going to let that happen,"" he said. Mr Trump has claimed in the past that the agreement would cost the US $3tn in lost GDP and 6.5 million jobs - while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably. When he announced last June he was pulling the US out of the accord,Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. He also said during the presidential election campaign that he wanted to help US oil and coal industries. Mr Trump has faced a storm of protest both at home and abroad over his decision to pull out of the deal It was not clear from his comments on Wednesday whether he has embarked on any attempt to renegotiate America's terms. Last September, the US was present as an observer when environment ministers from about 30 countries discussed key issues relating to the Paris agreement in Montreal, Canada. French President Emmanuel Macron in December said he would not agree to a renegotiationbut was hopeful the US would return to the accord. Analysts have said the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement makes it more difficult for the world to reach the goals that it set for itself in the Paris agreement. What is in the Paris climate deal? The US contributes about 15% of global emissions of carbon, but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures. No timescale for a US withdrawal from the accord has been given, although White House sources have previously suggested it could take up to four years.

South Korea announces Bitcoin ban planGovernment cryptocurrency concerns include tax evasion and people developing gambling addictions24m24 minutes agoBusiness,"South Korea is considering a law to ban cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin being traded on local exchanges. Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said virtual currencies were ""great concerns"" and that the ministry was preparing a bill to ban trading. However, South Korea's presidential office said later that a ban had not yet been finalised and was one measure being considered. The local Bitcoin price fell by a fifth after the justice minister's comments. In South Korea it trades at about a 30% premium compared with other countries. There is no one fixed price for Bitcoin as it is not regulated and is traded on dozens of exchanges worldwide. According to Coindesk.com,the price of Bitcoin was about 8% lower,externalat just under $13,800 on Thursday afternoon. Is Asia driving the Bitcoin craze? What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin - risky bubble or the future? Forget Bitcoin - now Dogecoin goes wild South Korea has become a hotbed for cryptocurrency trading, accounting for about 20% of global Bitcoin transactions. It has more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges, according to the Korea Blockchain Industry Association. Several were raided this week in a probe into alleged tax evasion, including the country's second-largest virtual currency operator, Bithumb. The government had already said in December that it would apply more scrutiny to the exchanges, including moves to curb anonymous trading. Given the low levels of trading and relatively small number of people holding virtual currencies, wild price swings have become the norm,leading to an argument that paying too much attention to price rises and falls is futile. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin have surged in value over the past year - driving a huge demand. That has led to concerns about gambling addiction as inexperienced investors try to ride the wave.

Montecito is home to celebrities such as actor Rob Lowe, chat show host Ellen DeGeneres and media mogul Oprah Winfrey. On Instagram, Ms Winfrey said her property had escaped the worst as she toured the scene, but described the house next door as ""devastated"". The first rain in months caused mudslides when it hit ground that had been burned by December's huge wildfires. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption. Together with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. The Federal Emergency Management Agency saysthe risk of flooding stays ""significantly higher"" for up to five years after a wildfire,external. Thousands had to leave their homes, many for the second time in two months.The emergency services declared an exclusion zone,external, saying anyone moving around the area would be in the way of rescuers and would be subject to arrest. The US Coast Guard has sent ""multiple airships to support rescue operations"" and warned the public not to fly drones, saying it would cause the flights to be grounded. The destruction comes after arecord-setting year of $306bn (Â£226bn) of weather and climate-related disaster costsin the United States, with 2017 the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. California has suffered severe drought in five out of six of the past years.

US 'could conceivably' rejoin Paris deal,"Donald Trump gave no indication of how likely it would be for the US to return to the accord President Donald Trump has said the US could ""conceivably"" return to the 2015 Paris climate accord if an agreement treated America more fairly. He said it ""was a bad deal for the US"", repeating comments made when he announced the US withdrawal last June. But he said he had no problem with the accord itself. A US pull-out will make the US in effect the only country not to be part of the accord. The announcement sparked global anger. Some critics have called it an abdication of US leadership on a key global challenge. The Paris agreement commits countries to keeping the rise in global temperatures ""well below""  2C more than pre-industrial levels and aiming for a tighter limit of 1.5C. In a separate development on Wednesday, New York City announced plans to sell off $5bn (Â£3.7bn) in fossil fuel investments from its $189bn public pension funds over the next five years. The city authorities also filed a multibillion dollar lawsuit against five major oil companies, seeking damages for ""contributions to global warming"". New York City said the lawsuit against BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell would help fund protection against climate change. The lawsuit follows similar recent moves by a number of cities in California. The reasons Trump wanted to leave deal Analysis: The world's crying, not laughing Five effects of US pullout ""It's an agreement that I have no problem with but I had a problem with the agreement that they (the Obama administration) signed because, as usual, they made a bad deal,"" he told reporters. ""So we could conceivably go back in. Mr Trump stressed his administration's commitment to environmental issues, ""clean water, clean air"", but added ""we also want businesses that can compete"". ""The Paris accord really would have taken away our competitive edge, and we're not going to let that happen,"" he said. Mr Trump has claimed in the past that the agreement would cost the US $3tn in lost GDP and 6.5 million jobs - while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably. When he announced last June he was pulling the US out of the accord,Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. He also said during the presidential election campaign that he wanted to help US oil and coal industries. Mr Trump has faced a storm of protest both at home and abroad over his decision to pull out of the deal It was not clear from his comments on Wednesday whether he has embarked on any attempt to renegotiate America's terms. Last September, the US was present as an observer when environment ministers from about 30 countries discussed key issues relating to the Paris agreement in Montreal, Canada. French President Emmanuel Macron in December said he would not agree to a renegotiationbut was hopeful the US would return to the accord. Analysts have said the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement makes it more difficult for the world to reach the goals that it set for itself in the Paris agreement. What is in the Paris climate deal? The US contributes about 15% of global emissions of carbon, but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures. No timescale for a US withdrawal from the accord has been given, although White House sources have previously suggested it could take up to four years.

"We've run out of beds, say hospital bosses","Patients are dying in hospital corridors as safety is compromised by ""intolerable"" conditions, doctors say. The warning has been issued in a letter to the prime minister signed by 68 senior A&E doctors, spelling out the danger patients are facing this winter. It comes as reports have emerged of people being left for hours on trolleys in corridors and stuck in ambulances. Hospital bosses said they had run out of beds as they battle with""very high"" rates of flu. Official figures show the number of hospital admissions from flu has risen by more than 50% in the past week in England, although Public Health England officials said the levels were certainly not ""unprecedented"". Instead, hospital bosses have blamed the bed shortages on a lack of money and staff. Last week, there was a point when 133 out of 137 hospital trusts in England had an unsafe number of patients on their wards, NHS records show. Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search Figures are assessed against targets before rounding             If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The letter from doctors in England and Wales sets out some of the impact of this pressure. It says: Patients are having to sleep in makeshift wards set up in side rooms Trolley waits of up to 12 hours are being routinely seen as staff struggle to find free beds Thousands of patients are left stuck in the back of ambulances waiting for A&E staff to take them in More than 120 patients a day are being managed in corridors in some places, some dying prematurely The letter has been sent on the day it has been revealed that England's A&Es missed their four-hour waiting time target by a record margin in December - more than 300,000 patients waited longer than they should. Just over 85% of patients were seen in four hours - well below the 95% target - and marginally worse than the previous low in January 2017. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, said hospitals were unsafe and overcrowded, and the NHS was at a ""watershed moment"", requiring long-term funding. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Kuenssberg: Time for an answer on the NHS? The rest of the UK is also struggling. Waits in Scotland's major A&E unitshit their worst levels at the end of December. The Welsh government has said the health service was facing ""significant pressure"" and in Northern Ireland the Antrim Area Hospital has had to bring in St John Ambulance volunteers to help with a surge in demand. This video can not be played Rosie Dawson had to be examined in a hospital corridor in A&E last week Rosie Dawson, 37, is only one of the patients who has been caught up in the problems. She was taken to Torbay General A&E on 3 January with a gynaecological problem which had left her with severe pain and bleeding. She said it was chaos, with trolleys everywhere, staff running up and down corridors and queues of ambulances outside. Staff could not find a private area for her in which to assess her, so she ended up being examined in front of other patients. ""There was no dignity. It was degrading,"" she said. ""I couldn't fault the staff, there was nothing they could do. It was chaos."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hopson said last year was ""the first time ever"" in NHS history that all of its key targets for A&E, cancer and planned operations across the UK had been missed. He said hospitals were short of 10,000 to 15,000 beds and it was time for the government to decide how to fund the NHS in the long term. Since 2010 the budget has been rising at about 1% a year on average whereas traditionally the NHS received more than 4%. ""We have reached a watershed moment where either we fund the NHS to the extent that is needed to meet those standards or, and this is absolutely not what we want, we abandon those standards. ""But it is a watershed moment. We are now at the point where we cannot deliver the NHS constitutional standards without a long-term funding settlement."" Mr Hopson said mild weather and low flu rates had helped hospitals ""scrape by"" during previous winters. ""Maybe if we had been lucky again this year we could, just about, have coped,"" he added. ""But it has not turned out that way. Flu is rising, there is more respiratory illness and the cold weather is taking its toll."" This video can not be played Chief executive of NHS providers tells Today the NHS can no longer cope Figures from Public Health England show ""medium"" levels of flu are circulating across the community, but they are causing ""very high"" rates of admission to hospital. On both measures, flu rates are the highest since 2011, the year after the pandemic when there was a lot of swine flu circulating. Prime Minister Theresa May insisted the government was still doing enough to support the health service, but blamed flu for the pressures on hospitals. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care in England added: ""We know there is a great deal of pressure in A&E departments. We are grateful to all NHS staff for their incredible work in challenging circumstances."" But he added that plans were in place to help, including extra money for council-run care services so people could be moved out of hospital more quickly and the single biggest expansion in doctoring training places in the history of the NHS - 25% in the coming years.

PM aims to eradicate plastic litter by 2042,"This video can not be played Theresa May: A plan to 'nurture' environment Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. The commitment is part of the government's 25-year plan to improve the natural environment. ""I think people will be shocked at how today we allow so much plastic to be produced needlessly,"" the PM said. But green groups are angry the proposals will have no legal force - and Jeremy Corbyn said 25 years was ""far too long"" to take action. The Labour leader said the ""throw-away"" culture had to be tackled ""now,"" after his party described Mrs May's plans as a ""cynical attempt at rebranding the Tories' image"". Where does the plastic bag charge go? Seven charts that explain plastic pollution Under the government's plan, supermarkets will be urged to introduce ""plastic-free"" aisles while taxes and charges on single-use items such as takeaway containers will be considered. Mrs May's announcements, which have been agreed by cabinet, also include: Confirmation of the extension of the 5p charge for plastic carrier bags to all retailers in England Government funding for plastics innovation A commitment to help developing nations tackle pollution and reduce plastic waste, including through UK aid In her speech, Mrs May said: ""We look back in horror at some of the damage done to our environment in the past and wonder how anyone could have thought that, for example, dumping toxic chemicals into rivers was ever the right thing to do."" She called plastic waste ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"", adding: ""In the UK alone, the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year would fill 1,000 Royal Albert Halls."" Six simple ways to cut back on plastic What impact will microbead ban have? Asked after her speech about her own environmental credentials, she revealed she had put owl and bat boxes in her garden. Constantine beach in Cornwall is among those awaiting a clean-up Meanwhile, plans to help more children engage with the environment will include Â£10m for school visits and a programme to create school grounds that allow youngsters to learn more about the natural world. Mrs May said she would put the oceans firmly on the agenda of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April. Many wildflower meadows have been destroyed Thursday's announcements are the culmination of an environmental week for the government.  On Sunday, Mrs May promised a clampdown on plastic waste. On Wednesday, plans emerged to extend the 5p plastic bag charge to include corner shops in England. Ministers have been under political pressure to do more for the environment after it was identified by the Tory think-tank Bright Blue as the key issue for young voters, who failed to back the party in large numbers at the 2017 general election. Environmentalists agree that the government's plan to restore nature - not just safeguard nature - is genuinely radical. Many of the UK's landscapes have been ravaged by development, intensive farming and sheep grazing. Only 2% of wildflower meadows have survived. I understand that the document will cover many policy areas, including: managing land sustainably; enhancing nature and recovering wildlife; increasing people's health and well-being through nature; resource efficiency, reduction of pollution and waste and protecting and improving the global environment. But there is scepticism about how far the environment department Defra will be able to carry out its plans. There are huge pressures on the natural world from urgently needed house-building; HS2 threatens scores of ancient woodlands; and the Department for Transport has a major road-building programme. Earlier Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC he wanted the government to ""set the global gold standard"" on the environment. He also said ministers were ""reflecting"" on aproposal from a Commons committee,externalfor a 25p charge on disposable cups. Scotland to ban plastic cotton buds Plastic bag charge: 5p levy could be extended Green campaigners said Mrs May's plans could simply be shelved if they become inconvenient and the promise to stop ""avoidable"" plastic waste is too vague. Greenpeace said Mrs May's announcement was a ""missed opportunity"", questioning why there was no mention of deposit return schemes for bottles, while Friends of the Earth said a ""clear timetable"" not ""woolly promises"" were needed. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: 25 year plan is too long - do it now Sue Hayman, Labour's environment spokeswoman, said the Conservatives had a record of ""failure and broken promises"" on the environment. She said the ""weak"" proposals would mean the problem with plastic waste was ""kicked into the long grass"". The Liberal Democrats said it ""beggared belief"" that a target of 2042 had been set for removing plastic waste and that action was needed now. 5p plastic bag charge set to be extended Microbead ban: What impact will it have?

YouTube punishes star over Japan video,"This video can not be played How Logan and Jake Paul became social media superstars YouTube has cut some business ties with Logan Paul, the hugely popular vlogger who posted a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. Paul's channels were removed from YouTube's Google Preferred programme, where brands sell ads on the platform's top 5% of content creators. YouTube also said it had put on hold original projects with the US vlogger. Paul posted the video with a man's body on 31 December, triggering widespread criticism. The video showed Paul and his friends at the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, known to be a frequent site of suicides. Going in to film the ""haunted"" forest, they come across a man's body and are shocked but also make jokes. The identity of the deceased man is not known. Online comments have called the Japan video, which garnered millions of views on YouTube before it was taken down, ""disrespectful"" and ""disgusting"". Paul later posted an apology,externalon Twitter, saying he had been ""misguided by shock and awe"". A still from Logan Paul's video shows him looking shocked - but in outtakes, he joked about suicide He also uploaded a video apology, and said: ""I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through."" ""I'm ashamed of myself,"" he added. ""I'm disappointed in myself."" It's hard to calculate exactly. YouTube's move will cost him financially as his videos will no longer earn top-tier cash per click - but as he hasn't been completely kicked off the platform, he will still earn money from views. Google Preferred,externalallows brands to publish ads on the accounts that are most popular among 18-34 year-olds in the US. YouTube's own wording calls it a way for companies to ""share their messages alongside some of the most engaging and brand safe content on YouTube"". Aside from his videos, Paul makes money from sponsored social media posts and merchandise - and it's worth noting that his apology video has racked up nearly 40 million views. With more than 15 million subscribers and counting, he's huge. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated he made $12.5m (Â£9.3m), making him the fourth highest-paid YouTube star in 2016. Some people are frustrated that it took YouTube 10 days to respond to the controversy. The company acknowledged this, saying: ""You're right to be [frustrated]. You deserve to know what's going on."" The Japan video itself was not taken down by YouTube; Paul himself took it down, leading some to complain that the platform should have acted more decisively. Allow Twitter content?

Overseas students 'add Â£20bn' to economy,"London has the biggest share of overseas students, but the biggest economic impact is in Sheffield International students are worth Â£20bn to the UK economy, says a report from the Higher Education Policy Institute. The analysis says on top of tuition fees, their spending has become a major factor in supporting local economies. London alone gains Â£4.6bn - with Sheffield the biggest beneficiary in proportion to its economy. The think tank's director, Nick Hillman, says the figures support calls to remove students from immigration targets. There are about 230,000 students arriving each year for university courses in the UK - most of them postgraduates, with China the most common country of origin. The analysis, carried out by London Economics,external, calculated the financial contribution of overseas students, such as spending on tuition and living expenses, and balanced that against costs, including the extra pressure on local services and non-repayment of loans. Mr Hillman says the report provides comprehensive evidence that overseas students are a significant benefit and that students from outside the European Union, who pay higher fees, are worth Â£102,000 each to the UK economy. There has been a debate about whether overseas students should be included in targets to reduce migration ""International students bring economic benefits to the UK that are worth 10 times the costs of hosting them,"" says Mr Hillman. ""Fewer international students would mean a lot fewer jobs in all areas of the UK, because international students spend money in their universities, in their local economies,"" he says. ""It is literally the sandwich shops, the bike shops, the taxi firms; it is the night clubs, it's the bookshops. ""Without international students, some of the local companies might go bust. Some of the local resident population would lose their jobs,"" says Mr Hillman. The Higher Education Policy Institute, which carried out the study with education company Kaplan, argues that the UK should have a more positive approach to students from overseas - and separate them from the wider debate about immigration. The institute quotes a recent report from India's Hindustan Times that told its readers that the UK had many top universities, ""but they also offer the most student-hostile government in the world"". While the institute argues the students should be removed from the wider debate about reducing net migration, the Home Office said there were ""no plans"" for such a change to how migration targets were measured. ""There is no limit to the number of genuine international students that can come to the UK to study and we very much value the contribution that they make,"" said a Home Office spokeswoman. The Home Office says the Migration Advisory Committee is also carrying out an assessment of the economic impact which will provide evidence for shaping the ""future migration system"". The Higher Education Policy Institute analysis also carried out a regional breakdown of the economic impact of international students, calculating that each constituency on average gained Â£31.3m. London has the biggest share of overseas students - but the study shows that in relative terms, smaller cities, with more than one university, can have a greater impact from their spending. The study breaks down the financial impact of international students by parliamentary constituency.

Worboys victims call for London-wide ban,"Rapist John Worboys' victims said they have been treated ""with the utmost contempt"" by the criminal justice system Victims of sex attacker John Worboys have asked for him to be excluded from Greater London when he leaves prison. Worboys, 60, is thought to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in the capital. The Parole Board decided Worboys would be released with ""stringent"" licence conditionsafter he completed his minimum term of eight years in jail. Lawyers asked the National Probation Service to stop the taxi driver accessing alleged or proven victims. Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his black cab. Victims have already said they feel ""betrayed"" and ""terrified"" by the decision to release him. Slater and Gordon, a law firm that represented 11 of Worboys' victims, sent a letter to the probation service calling for him to be excluded from the Greater London area. The majority of Worboys' victims lived in Greater London, the letter said, and they had ""a real and justified fear that he will know their home addresses"". Richard Scorer, a lawyer at Slater and Gordon, said his clients felt they had been treated ""with the utmost contempt"" by the criminal justice system.

May aims to eradicate plastic litter,"This video can not be played Theresa May: A plan to 'nurture' environment Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. The commitment is part of the government's 25-year plan to improve the natural environment. ""I think people will be shocked at how today we allow so much plastic to be produced needlessly,"" the PM said. But green groups are angry the proposals will have no legal force - and Jeremy Corbyn said 25 years was ""far too long"" to take action. The Labour leader said the ""throw-away"" culture had to be tackled ""now,"" after his party described Mrs May's plans as a ""cynical attempt at rebranding the Tories' image"". Where does the plastic bag charge go? Seven charts that explain plastic pollution Under the government's plan, supermarkets will be urged to introduce ""plastic-free"" aisles while taxes and charges on single-use items such as takeaway containers will be considered. Mrs May's announcements, which have been agreed by cabinet, also include: Confirmation of the extension of the 5p charge for plastic carrier bags to all retailers in England Government funding for plastics innovation A commitment to help developing nations tackle pollution and reduce plastic waste, including through UK aid In her speech, Mrs May said: ""We look back in horror at some of the damage done to our environment in the past and wonder how anyone could have thought that, for example, dumping toxic chemicals into rivers was ever the right thing to do.""

Environmentalists agree that the government's plan to restore nature - not just safeguard nature - is genuinely radical. Many of the UK's landscapes have been ravaged by development, intensive farming and sheep grazing. Only 2% of wildflower meadows have survived. I understand that the document will cover many policy areas, including: managing land sustainably; enhancing nature and recovering wildlife; increasing people's health and well-being through nature; resource efficiency, reduction of pollution and waste and protecting and improving the global environment. But there is scepticism about how far the environment department Defra will be able to carry out its plans. There are huge pressures on the natural world from urgently needed house-building; HS2 threatens scores of ancient woodlands; and the Department for Transport has a major road-building programme.

Grenfell paramedic caught doing 116mphDavid Hickling was off duty when he was caught speeding on a 70mph road in north Wales.12m12 minutes agoNorth East Wales,"David Hickling has received The Queen's Award for his work A paramedic who was one of the first at the scene of the Grenfell Tower disaster has avoided a driving ban after being caught speeding at 116mph. David Hickling, 46, of South Benfleet, Essex, was caught while off duty on the A55 near Caerwys, Flintshire, in July. The London Ambulance Service suspended him and Hickling said a driving ban would cost him his job. Flintshire magistrates gave him six points on his driving licence and he must pay Â£635 in fines and costs. Hickling was driving to a terrorism-related training course when he was clocked in July,three weeks after the tower fire that killed 71 people. He admitted breaking the 70mph (110km/h) speed limit but told Flintshire Magistrates' Court at Mold that a driving ban would mean the end of his career of 22 years. A psychotherapist's report showed the exceptional stress Hickling was under. He served for five years in the Army and had been in his present role for the past eight years. Magistrates heard Hickling, the clinical leader for the hazardous area emergency team, was involved in the search and recovery of bodies at the London tower block. He already had six points on his licence, but magistrates accepted a ban would cause exceptional hardship. Seventy-one people were killed in the west London tower block fire in June His barrister Phil Williams told the court his client was the bronze commander for the ambulance service and first on the scene at the Grenfell Tower disaster and responded following the Westminster Bridge attack. Chairman Terry Eastham said: ""Society is grateful to such people and the personal cost involved will never be truly known."" Hickling told the court he had been informed by his employers that if he received a ban then ""I will no longer be able to carry out my work."" The court heard his work had affected his mental health but he had been determined to remain on duty because of his great sense of responsibility towards his team. Mr Williams said his client did not seek sympathy or make excuses, but was in a highly pressurised job he carried out with honour. He said Hickling was ""extremely sorry"" and embarrassed for the offence and the difficulty he had placed himself and the ambulance service in. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?

Armed heist at Ritz Paris nets millionsFive men reportedly smashed a window at the luxurious hotel and grabbed jewellery.24m24 minutes agoEurope,"Police guard the hotel's rear entrance on Cambon street Armed robbers have seized millions of euros worth of merchandise from a jewellery shop at the famous Ritz Hotel in Paris. Five men armed with axes smashed a window at the shop inside the hotel at about 18:00 local time (17:00 GMT), French media report. Three men have been arrested, police said, while others remain on the run. It is not clear whether any of the loot, estimated to be worth more than â¬4m (Â£3.5m), was recovered. The luxurious five-star Ritz is located in Place VendÃ´me, in Paris' historical first district on the right bank of the river Seine. The ministry of justice lies next door. The hotel includes a gallery shopping area near its rear entrance, which it says hosts five shops and 95 ""showcases"", selling jewellery, watches and luxury clothing. The Ritz is among the most luxurious hotels in Paris Local newspaper Le Parisien, citing a police source, reports that the robbery was interrupted by an officer on patrol, but two people escaped on a motorised scooter. The city's police commissioner issued a statement on Twitter thanking officers for their quick reactions, which led to the arrest of three men. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb also offered praise, saying they were ""a credit to our police"". Eyewitnesses reported a heavy police presence in the area. One hotel employee told the AFP news agency: ""We heard a loud noise and lots of racket in the street"". ""Passers-by took refuge in the hotel. We didn't know what was going on until someone told us there had been a robbery."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russian ex-cop on trial for 59 murders,"A former Russian policeman who was convicted of killing 22 women has gone on trial in the Siberian city of Irkutsk for dozens of other murders. Mikhail Popkov, 53, has confessed to 59 additional murders between 1992 and 2010, Interfax news agency reports. If convicted, that would make him Russia's most prolific serial killer in recent history. He has been dubbed ""the werewolf"" and the ""Angarsk maniac"" by Russian media. Popkov is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2015 of raping and killing 22 women, and attempting to murder two more. The murders are said to have taken place in and around his home city of Angarsk, near Irkutsk, both while he was a police officer and after he left the service in 1998. His victims and alleged victims were all women between the ages of 16 and 40 apart from one male, a policeman. Prosecutors say Popkov killed them after offering them lifts late at night, sometimes in a police car, while he was off-duty. He was arrested in 2012 during a re-examination of the evidence, which involved the DNA testing of people who drove a make of car whose tracks were found at the scenes of murders. If convicted of all 81 murders, the number of victims would exceed those of ""chessboard killer"" Alexander Pichushkin, who killed 48 people, and Andrei Chikatilo, convicted of 52 murders during the Soviet era. Another serial killer, Andrei Chikatilo, was convicted of 52 murders during the Soviet era (file photo) Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?
