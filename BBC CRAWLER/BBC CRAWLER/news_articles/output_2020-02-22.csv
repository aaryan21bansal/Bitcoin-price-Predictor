Fullback Rabbitoh Latrell Mitchell made the invitation in a video. ""We've got your back and just want to make sure that you are doing alright... we want you around, we want you to lead us out on the weekend,"" he said. Holding the hand of team captain Joel Thompson, Quaden led them out on to the pitch accompanied by roars from the crowd. Quaden wore noise-cancelling headphones for the event He then posed with the teams holding the match ball, before handing it to the referee. The Maori All Stars won the game 30-16.

Ms Bayles said she hoped her son's experience was raising awareness over the effects of bullying. ""We are losing way too many people because of bullying, because of discrimination, because of racism. There's so many factors of bullying,"" she said. ""On top of that, being an Aboriginal boy with a disability, people don't understand that's a double-edged sword. There's racism and then there's discrimination because of the disability."" In the six-minute video, posted on Tuesday, Quaden's mother describes the relentless bullying experienced by her son every day. The family, who are Aboriginal Australian, live in Queensland. ""I've just picked my son up from school, witnessed a bullying episode, rang the principal, and I want people to know - parents, educators, teachers - this is the effect that bullying has,"" Ms Bayle says as her son sobs. The video of Quaden crying has been viewed millions of times online ""Every single... day, something happens. Another episode, another bullying, another taunt, another name-calling. ""Can you please educate your children, your families, your friends?""

Hole in wall earns rave reviews on TripAdvisor,"One japester described the hole, in Bath Street, as ""an adventure not to be missed"" Internet jokers have turned a circular hole in a wall outside a bank into a tourist attraction. Since December 2018, wags have been posting glowing reviews on TripAdvisor for the hole at NatWest in Ilkeston. ""NatWest hole"" is now ranked fourth out of 16 attractions in the Derbyshire town based on user reviews. One reviewer on TripAdvisor offered the spoof advice: ""Can get very busy and you can queue for hours, but it's worth the wait."" The attention has seen the modest hole rise up the rankings Another wag wrote: ""The city of Agra has the Taj Mahal, Paris has the Eiffel Tower and Sydney has its Opera House. ""But they all pale in comparison to the impact on the soul of first laying eyes on Ilkeston's Hole in the Wall."" Paul Miller, chairman of the Ilkeston and District History Society, said he was ""gobsmacked"" at the hole's high ranking. Bennerly Viaduct has a lower ranking on TripAdvisor than the NatWest hole ""It doesn't really say a lot about the area if it's number four,"" he said. ""It's beatBennerley Viaduct. ""I think it looks like a 1970s idea of something to look different. It doesn't really beat the pyramids though does it?"" A NatWest spokeswoman clarified the hole was introduced during a mid-1990s refurbishment as a safety feature so people using the cash machine could see if anyone was lurking behind the wall. It is not the first time tongue-in-cheek reviews have propelled an unlikely attraction up the TripAdvisor rankings. In 2018,a plastic tunnel outside a Bude supermarketbecame the highest ranked place to visit in the Cornish resort - although TripAdvisorbosses later suspended reviewsfor the see-through walkway.

Cases double in one day in South Korea,"Virus-hit Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo has transferred some patients to other facilities South Korea says the number of new coronavirus cases in the country has more than doubled in one day. Officials said on Saturday that 229 new cases had been confirmed since Friday, raising the total to 433. In a televised address, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun described the situation as ""grave"". Many of the new cases are linked to a hospital and to a religious group near the south-eastern city of Daegu, authorities have said. Two patients in South Korea have died so far and there are fears the number will rise. Daegu and nearby Cheongdo - where the hospital is situated - have been declared ""special care zones"" and the streets of Daegu are reported to be largely abandoned. South Korea has now reported the largest number of confirmed infections after China - 76,288 cases including 2,345 deaths - and the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan which has seen more than 600 cases. South Korean sect identified as coronavirus hotbed What you need to know about the virus A visual guide to the outbreak Pregnant nurse 'propaganda' sparks backlash The latest developments came as Chinese health authorities reported a decrease in the rate of deaths and new cases of the coronavirus on Saturday. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has expressed concern at the number of new cases with no clear link to China or other confirmed cases. He said the greatest concern now was countries with weaker health systems, particularly in Africa. Outside China, more than 1,200 cases of the virus have been confirmed in 26 countries and there have been at least eight deaths, the WHO says. In other developments: Thirty-two British and other European cruise ship passengers are in quarantine in north-west Englandafter arriving back from Japan Israel refused to allow some 200 non-Israelis to disembark from a plane which had arrived from South Korea, sending them back to Seoul; the 12 Israelis on board were quarantined. Israel suspended all flights from Japan and South Korea on Saturday after confirming its first case of the virus on Friday Italy reported its second death from the virus - a woman living in the northern region of Lombardy - a day after a 78-year-old man became the first person in Italy to die from the new coronavirus. The country now has nearly 60 cases Iran reported its fifth death from the disease, and ordered the closure of schools, universities and cultural centres in 14 provinces. The outbreak is centred on the holy city of Qom but officials warned that the virus may already have spread to ""all cities in Iran"" The new virus, which originated last year in Hubei province in China, causes a respiratory disease called Covid-19. Medical officials first announced 142 new cases on Saturday and then hours later increased the number by 87. In a statement, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said that of the 229 new cases, 95 were related to Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo, which treats the elderly and people with mental health issues. There are now 114 confirmed cases at the hospital - nine staff and 102 patients - it added. Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said the outbreak had entered ""a serious new phase"". He said most of those diagnosed at the hospital had been inpatients for mental illnesses. Some cases showed ""no confirmed epidemiological connections"", meaning it was not clear how they had contracted the virus, he added. This video can not be played People in Daegu have voiced concern over the spread of the virus A 63-year-old man died at the hospital on Wednesday and another patient died on Friday in Busan after being transferred from Daenam Hospital, Yonhap news agency reports. In his national address, Prime Minister Chung asked South Koreans to avoid large gatherings, including religious events. ""The government believes the situation of the Covid-19 infections is turning into a grave phase, and is making every effort to prevent the spread,"" he said. Mr Chung said the government would take action against anyone hoarding face masks or taking part in now-banned mass rallies. KCDC said 62 new cases - 231 in total - were connected toa Christian sect in Daegu called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Authorities have highlighted that a large number of sect followers attended the funeral of the founder's brother from 31 January to 2 February. The agency said it had placed 9,336 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine and that, of those, more than 500 were being tested for the coronavirus. In a briefing to the African Union on Saturday, Dr Tedros said the WHO was working with African governments to train thousands of health workers and to provide equipment to identify and treat infected people. ""Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems,"" he said. ""We are working hard to prepare countries in Africa for the potential arrival of the virus."" Dr Tedros said some countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, were using experience gained from testing for the Ebola virus to test for the new coronavirus. ""This is a great example of how investing in health systems can pay dividends for health security,"" he said. A team of experts from the WHO is due to arrive in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged, on Saturday. Passengers of the Diamond Princess who have tested negative continue to disembark the ship in Yokohama after more than 14 days quarantined on board. Coronavirus outbreak to cost airlines almost $30bn Are cruise ships really 'floating Petri dishes'? Are coronavirus tests flawed?

Saudi rapper faces arrest for her music video,"Saudi officials have called for the arrest of a female rapper who released a music video for her song Mecca Girl that praises women from the holy city as ""powerful and beautiful"". Social media users reacted angrily, calling the authorities ""hypocritical"". In 2018 the crown prince of the conservative country began a programme of reforms. But activists say repression has increased and there is a crackdown on freedom of expression. The video was released on YouTube last week by a young rapper who identifies herself as Asayel Slay. She raps about women in the city of Mecca, which is Islam's holiest site where millions of Muslims go on Hajj or pilgrimage annually. ""Our respect to other girls but the Mecca girl is sugar candy,"" she sings in the video while men and women dance in a cafÃ©. It was widely shared on social media, and people used hashtag #Mecca_Girl_Represents_Me to praise it. On Thursday governor ofMecca Khaled al-Faisal ordered the arrest of the people behind the video,external, tweeting that it ""insults the customs of Mecca"" and using hashtag ""They're not the girls of Mecca"". How Saudi Arabia's crown prince rose to power Reform and repression go hand-in-hand in Saudi Arabia The Saudi rapper performing at the wheel Asayel Slay's account has been suspended and the video is no longer available on YouTube. One popular tweet read, ""It's the only rap song that doesn't contain a single obscenity, insult, pornographic scene, nudity, hashish or smoking and the rapper is even wearing the hijab. ""The girl faces arrest because the song doesn't suit new Saudi Arabia or old."" This video can not be played Saudi Arabia reforms: Are they good news for women?

Saudi Arabia apologies for video labelling feminism as extemism Social media users accused authorities of projecting an image of modernisation abroad while cracking down at home. ""This is so typical of the Saudi government to do - bring western influencers to artwash the regime  but attack real Saudi women who try to artistically express their cultural identities,"" tweeted Amani Al-Ahmadi, who identifies herself as a Saudi-American feminist. Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is promoting a more modern image of the country abroad as part of his Vision 2030 programme of reform.

Evacuated Britons arrive at quarantine hospital,"The coaches with the evacuees arrived at the hospital in a convoy of vehicles British nationals evacuated from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan have arrived at a hospital where they will spend the next two weeks in quarantine. Coaches carrying 30 British and two Irish citizens arrived at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral on Saturday evening. The group had travelled from an airbase in Wiltshire after leaving Tokyo on a flight late on Friday night. They have so far tested negative for the virus. As the coaches arrived at the hospital just before 18:00, one passenger was pictured making a heart sign with her hands while another gave an OK signal through the coach windows. Arrowe Park Hospital was previously used to quarantine 83 British nationals who were flown back to the UK from Wuhan. The chief executive of Wirral Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, Janelle Holmes, said Arrowe Park was using that experience as a ""blueprint"" for treating the new group. Speaking ahead of the group's arrival, she said: ""The group of people is slightly different. ""Obviously, they have come from a cruise ship rather than from their own homes over in China, but we are working exactly the same as we did before, with the healthcare professionals and Public Health England to make sure they are safe, well managed and comfortable while they are with us."" The plane landed at Boscombe Down, a MoD base in Wiltshire The evacuation flight took off from Tokyo's Haneda Airport late on Friday evening (GMT) and landed at Boscombe Down, a Ministry of Defence base in Wiltshire, about 11:30 GMT on Saturday. In a statement issued after the plane landed, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Foreign Office had ""worked hard"" to get the passengers ""back to the UK securely"". ""Our number one priority has consistently been the health and safety of UK nationals,"" he added. The flighthad previously been delayedafter the British embassy said it was ""logistically complicated"". The plane set off from Haneda Airport, Tokyo, late on Friday evening (GMT) Meanwhile, it has emerged the NHS is working on plans to test people for coronavirus in their own homes, if the outbreak begins to spread in the UK. A pilot scheme has already been launched in London, where tests are being carried out by NHS nurses and paramedics. The health service is planning to expand the scheme to other areas outside of the capital in the coming weeks. Professor Keith Willett, the NHS strategic incident director for coronavirus, said the aim was to avoid the risk of people spreading the infection by going to their GP or A&E. Elsewhere, Italy has reported its second death from the virus - a woman living in the northern region of Lombardy - a day after a 78-year-old man died. Allow Twitter content?

Some 78 Britons were on the Diamond Princess when it was quarantined 16 days ago. Some of the British passengers on the Diamond Princess had already been evacuated over the last week on flights to Hong Kong, organised by the Chinese authorities there, a government source has told the BBC. Others are being treated for the virus in health facilities in Japan. David and Sally Abel, a couple from Northamptonshire who were diagnosed with coronavirus on the cruise ship, have since been told they have pneumonia, their son said. Appearing alongside wife Roberta, Steve Abel said in a YouTube video late on Friday evening that his father's condition was ""very serious"", while his mother has a more mild form of pneumonia. He also said his ""really distressed"" parents - who had been on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary - called him to say they were being moved to a different hospital.

Coronavirus cases double in one day in South Korea,"Virus-hit Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo has transferred some patients to other facilities South Korea says the number of new coronavirus cases in the country has more than doubled in one day. Officials said on Saturday that 229 new cases had been confirmed since Friday, raising the total to 433. In a televised address, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun described the situation as ""grave"". Many of the new cases are linked to a hospital and to a religious group near the south-eastern city of Daegu, authorities have said. Two patients in South Korea have died so far and there are fears the number will rise. Daegu and nearby Cheongdo - where the hospital is situated - have been declared ""special care zones"" and the streets of Daegu are reported to be largely abandoned. South Korea has now reported the largest number of confirmed infections after China - 76,288 cases including 2,345 deaths - and the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan which has seen more than 600 cases. South Korean sect identified as coronavirus hotbed What you need to know about the virus A visual guide to the outbreak Pregnant nurse 'propaganda' sparks backlash The latest developments came as Chinese health authorities reported a decrease in the rate of deaths and new cases of the coronavirus on Saturday. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has expressed concern at the number of new cases with no clear link to China or other confirmed cases. He said the greatest concern now was countries with weaker health systems, particularly in Africa. Outside China, more than 1,200 cases of the virus have been confirmed in 26 countries and there have been at least eight deaths, the WHO says. In other developments: Thirty-two British and other European cruise ship passengers are in quarantine in north-west Englandafter arriving back from Japan Israel refused to allow some 200 non-Israelis to disembark from a plane which had arrived from South Korea, sending them back to Seoul; the 12 Israelis on board were quarantined. Israel suspended all flights from Japan and South Korea on Saturday after confirming its first case of the virus on Friday Italy reported its second death from the virus - a woman living in the northern region of Lombardy - a day after a 78-year-old man became the first person in Italy to die from the new coronavirus. The country now has nearly 60 cases Iran reported its fifth death from the disease, and ordered the closure of schools, universities and cultural centres in 14 provinces. The outbreak is centred on the holy city of Qom but officials warned that the virus may already have spread to ""all cities in Iran"" The new virus, which originated last year in Hubei province in China, causes a respiratory disease called Covid-19. Medical officials first announced 142 new cases on Saturday and then hours later increased the number by 87. In a statement, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said that of the 229 new cases, 95 were related to Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo, which treats the elderly and people with mental health issues. There are now 114 confirmed cases at the hospital - nine staff and 102 patients - it added. Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said the outbreak had entered ""a serious new phase"". He said most of those diagnosed at the hospital had been inpatients for mental illnesses. Some cases showed ""no confirmed epidemiological connections"", meaning it was not clear how they had contracted the virus, he added. This video can not be played People in Daegu have voiced concern over the spread of the virus A 63-year-old man died at the hospital on Wednesday and another patient died on Friday in Busan after being transferred from Daenam Hospital, Yonhap news agency reports. In his national address, Prime Minister Chung asked South Koreans to avoid large gatherings, including religious events. ""The government believes the situation of the Covid-19 infections is turning into a grave phase, and is making every effort to prevent the spread,"" he said. Mr Chung said the government would take action against anyone hoarding face masks or taking part in now-banned mass rallies. KCDC said 62 new cases - 231 in total - were connected toa Christian sect in Daegu called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Authorities have highlighted that a large number of sect followers attended the funeral of the founder's brother from 31 January to 2 February. The agency said it had placed 9,336 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine and that, of those, more than 500 were being tested for the coronavirus. In a briefing to the African Union on Saturday, Dr Tedros said the WHO was working with African governments to train thousands of health workers and to provide equipment to identify and treat infected people. ""Our biggest concern continues to be the potential for Covid-19 to spread in countries with weaker health systems,"" he said. ""We are working hard to prepare countries in Africa for the potential arrival of the virus."" Dr Tedros said some countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, were using experience gained from testing for the Ebola virus to test for the new coronavirus. ""This is a great example of how investing in health systems can pay dividends for health security,"" he said. A team of experts from the WHO is due to arrive in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged, on Saturday. Passengers of the Diamond Princess who have tested negative continue to disembark the ship in Yokohama after more than 14 days quarantined on board.

Hole in wall earns rave reviews on TripAdvisorInternet jokers cause a circular hole outside a bank to rise up the TripAdvisor rankings.Derby,"One japester described the hole, in Bath Street, as ""an adventure not to be missed"" Internet jokers have turned a circular hole in a wall outside a bank into a tourist attraction. Since December 2018, wags have been posting glowing reviews on TripAdvisor for the hole at NatWest in Ilkeston. ""NatWest hole"" is now ranked fourth out of 16 attractions in the Derbyshire town based on user reviews. One reviewer on TripAdvisor offered the spoof advice: ""Can get very busy and you can queue for hours, but it's worth the wait."" The attention has seen the modest hole rise up the rankings Another wag wrote: ""The city of Agra has the Taj Mahal, Paris has the Eiffel Tower and Sydney has its Opera House. ""But they all pale in comparison to the impact on the soul of first laying eyes on Ilkeston's Hole in the Wall."" Paul Miller, chairman of the Ilkeston and District History Society, said he was ""gobsmacked"" at the hole's high ranking. Bennerly Viaduct has a lower ranking on TripAdvisor than the NatWest hole ""It doesn't really say a lot about the area if it's number four,"" he said. ""It's beatBennerley Viaduct. ""I think it looks like a 1970s idea of something to look different. It doesn't really beat the pyramids though does it?"" A NatWest spokeswoman clarified the hole was introduced during a mid-1990s refurbishment as a safety feature so people using the cash machine could see if anyone was lurking behind the wall. It is not the first time tongue-in-cheek reviews have propelled an unlikely attraction up the TripAdvisor rankings. In 2018,a plastic tunnel outside a Bude supermarketbecame the highest ranked place to visit in the Cornish resort - although TripAdvisorbosses later suspended reviewsfor the see-through walkway.

Motorists paid Â£1.7m in pothole compensation,"A public spending watchdog has raised concerns about the impact of funding shortfalls on Northern Ireland's roads Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Ireland's roads, the Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has said. Ms Mallon was reacting to figures which show Â£1.7m in compensation was paid for vehicles damaged by potholes between 2016 and 2019. The figures were obtained by BBC News NI under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. In 2019, Â£500,000 in compensation was paid to drivers. Nichola Mallon said severe winter weather also impacted on the condition of roads In 2018, more than Â£750,000 was paid out by the Department for Infrastructure. Ms Mallon said: ""Like so many people, I am very aware and concerned about the upkeep of our roads. ""Years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.""  118Shore Rd, Strangford (Shore Rd to Downpatrick Rd) 115Browns Bay Rd, Islandmagee (Millbay Rd to Ballytober Rd) 110Blackstaff Rd, Clough (Main St to Carricknab Rd) 103Shore Rd, Belfast (Doagh Rd to Mount St) 96Augher Point Rd, Newtownsville (Kiladroy Rd) The FOI statistics on the number of road defects across Northern Ireland were released to BBC News NI by the Department for Infrastructure. Road defects include cracks and potholes recorded on carriageways, hard shoulders and lay-bys. The data shows in 2019, there were 102,521 road defects recorded across Northern Ireland, a decrease of 24,000 on the previous year. It also confirmed the number of successful vehicle damage claims fell from 3,533 in 2018 to 1,334 in 2019. The road with the largest number of defects (118) in 2019 was the Shore Road in Strangford, County Down. This was followed by the Browns Bay Road in Islandmagee (115) and the Blackstaff Road in Clough (110). Is our pothole problem getting worse? Pothole photos: Your pictures of crumbling roads Last year Northern Ireland's public spending watchdogwarned it would cost more than Â£1bn to deal with structural maintenance. The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Ireland's road network.

""Frustratingly for a number of years now, not enough money has been allocated to my department's budget to maintain all of our roads and repairs are having to operate on a priority basis,"" she said. ""While I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives. ""I have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.

Blue British passports to return in March,"Home Secretary Priti Patel holding one of the new blue passports The first blue British passports for nearly 30 years will be issued next month, the Home Office has said. The current burgundy design is being replaced, following the UK's departure from the European Union. Blue passports were introduced in 1921 and phased out after 1988 when members of the then European Economic Community agreed to harmonise designs. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the passport will ""once again be entwined with our national identity"". Should the British passport be blue? How have passport photos changed in 100 years? UK couple issued different passport versions She said Brexit had given the UK ""a unique opportunity to... forge a new path in the world"" and enabled a return to ""the iconic blue and gold design"". The UK was never formally compelled to change the colour of its passport in the 1980s but did so with other member states. Securing a change in the design became a rallying point for Brexit supporters, with the government announcing in December 2017 that the blue passport would return. The government estimates that all newly-issued passports will be blue from the summer. Until then, they will be issued alongside burgundy passports, which will remain valid for travel until they expire. The UK burgundy passports carried the wording European Union on the cover, although the Passport Office last year began to issue them without such a description as older stocks ran out. The blue passports will be made by Gemalto, owned by French firm Thales. However, they will be personalised with the holder's details in the UK. The back cover will carry an embossment featuring the floral emblems of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. A new blue British passport alongside the current burgundy design The Home Office said the manufacturing carbon footprint of the passports will be reduced to net zero, through projects such as planting trees. It added the new passport will carry updated security features, including a ""super-strength"" polycarbonate data page, containing embedded technologies to keep personal data secure, and involve the ""most secure printing and design techniques"" to combat identity theft and forgery. According to thePassport Index,external, 81 countries have blue passports, including Australia, the United States, Canada, India and Hong Kong.

Coronavirus-hit cruise Britons arrive back in UK,"The coaches with the evacuees arrived at the hospital in a convoy of vehicles British nationals evacuated from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan have arrived at a hospital where they will spend the next two weeks in quarantine. Coaches carrying 30 British and two Irish citizens arrived at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral on Saturday evening. The group had travelled from an airbase in Wiltshire after leaving Tokyo on a flight late on Friday night. They have so far tested negative for the virus. As the coaches arrived at the hospital just before 18:00, one passenger was pictured making a heart sign with her hands while another gave an OK signal through the coach windows. Arrowe Park Hospital was previously used to quarantine 83 British nationals who were flown back to the UK from Wuhan. The chief executive of Wirral Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, Janelle Holmes, said Arrowe Park was using that experience as a ""blueprint"" for treating the new group. Speaking ahead of the group's arrival, she said: ""The group of people is slightly different. ""Obviously, they have come from a cruise ship rather than from their own homes over in China, but we are working exactly the same as we did before, with the healthcare professionals and Public Health England to make sure they are safe, well managed and comfortable while they are with us."" The plane landed at Boscombe Down, a MoD base in Wiltshire The evacuation flight took off from Tokyo's Haneda Airport late on Friday evening (GMT) and landed at Boscombe Down, a Ministry of Defence base in Wiltshire, about 11:30 GMT on Saturday. In a statement issued after the plane landed, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Foreign Office had ""worked hard"" to get the passengers ""back to the UK securely"". ""Our number one priority has consistently been the health and safety of UK nationals,"" he added. The flighthad previously been delayedafter the British embassy said it was ""logistically complicated"". The plane set off from Haneda Airport, Tokyo, late on Friday evening (GMT) Meanwhile, it has emerged the NHS is working on plans to test people for coronavirus in their own homes, if the outbreak begins to spread in the UK. A pilot scheme has already been launched in London, where tests are being carried out by NHS nurses and paramedics. The health service is planning to expand the scheme to other areas outside of the capital in the coming weeks. Professor Keith Willett, the NHS strategic incident director for coronavirus, said the aim was to avoid the risk of people spreading the infection by going to their GP or A&E. Elsewhere, Italy has reported its second death from the virus - a woman living in the northern region of Lombardy - a day after a 78-year-old man died. Allow Twitter content?

Some 78 Britons were on the Diamond Princess when it was quarantined 16 days ago. Some of the British passengers on the Diamond Princess had already been evacuated over the last week on flights to Hong Kong, organised by the Chinese authorities there, a government source has told the BBC. Others are being treated for the virus in health facilities in Japan. David and Sally Abel, a couple from Northamptonshire who were diagnosed with coronavirus on the cruise ship, have since been told they have pneumonia, their son said. Appearing alongside wife Roberta, Steve Abel said in a YouTube video late on Friday evening that his father's condition was ""very serious"", while his mother has a more mild form of pneumonia. He also said his ""really distressed"" parents - who had been on the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary - called him to say they were being moved to a different hospital.

He said his father is so ""weak"" he has been using a wheelchair, and has been told he could be put on a ventilator. This video can not be played Steve Abel told BBC Breakfast his father told him ""we can't take any more of this, it's like a prison"" The Foreign Office said the welfare of all British nationals is of the highest priority to the UK government. They added they are working with the Japanese authorities to ensure those British nationals who are remaining in Japan for health reasons get the best possible care.

"Harry and Meghan to end use of 'SussexRoyal' brandAn application to trademark the SussexRoyal brand has also been removed, a spokesperson says.UK","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are to stop using their ""SussexRoyal"" brand from spring 2020. The couple had been in discussions with aides and senior royals about using the name following their decision this year tostep back from royal duties. But a spokesperson for the couple said it was agreed the word ""royal"" could not be used due to government rules. Applications to trademark the SussexRoyal brand have also been withdrawn. The couple's popular Instagram account uses the name SussexRoyal, as does their website. How might Harry and Meghan make money? Harry arrives in Canada ahead of new chapter Wallis Simpson's hard lessons for Harry and Meghan A spokesperson for the Sussexes said they were ""focused"" on plans to establish their new organisation in the spring. But they had agreed not to name it the Sussex Royal Foundation. Royal author Robert Hardman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the decision on the brand name was a ""setback"" for the couple. ""They've spent a great deal of money registering the trademarks,"" he said. However, branding expert Rita Clifton told the programme the inability to use SussexRoyal would be an ""inconvenience"" rather than an insurmountable problem. She said any brand ""is not just a name and a logo but also what you do"". This was not what Harry and Meghan thought it would be. Their bombshell statement in early January was full of talk about ""a progressive new role"" in the Royal Family, about  ""collaboration"" with other members of the family, about ""continuing to support Her Majesty the Queen"". They thought a hybrid role, half-in, half-out, could be possible - some royal duties, some Commonwealth duties, on their terms, with private lives attached. Instead, there is now nothing royal about them other than their names, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and their private connections with their relatives. There will be no public royal role, no military commands, no royal tours and now not even use of the word ""royal"". The loss of ""SussexRoyal"" will be a blow. It is their public face, their brand, their hugely popular social media name. But ""royal"" could not survive alongside a private existence. The couple have had to bow to the logic of their desire for a new and independent life - they will be royal no more. A spokeswoman for the Sussexes said: ""While the duke and duchess are focused on plans to establish a new non-profit organisation, given the specific UK government rules surrounding use of the word royal, it has been therefore agreed that their non-profit organisation, when it is announced this spring, will not be named Sussex Royal Foundation. ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use 'SussexRoyal' in any territory post-spring 2020."" The spokeswoman said trademark applications that were filed as protective measures ""acting on advice from and following the same model for the Royal Foundation"" have been removed. In a statement on their website, the couple said: ""While there is not any jurisdiction by the monarchy or Cabinet Office over the use of the word 'Royal' overseas, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use 'Sussex Royal' or any iteration of the word 'Royal' in any territory (either within the UK or otherwise) when the transition occurs spring 2020."" It was announced this week that the couplewill formally step down as senior royals from 31 March. They will no longer carry out duties on behalf of the Queen but arrangements will be reviewed after 12 months. A spokesperson for the couple said they intended to split their time between the UK and North America, and would be in the UK ""regularly"". They will attend six events in the UK in February and March, including the Commonwealth Day Service on 9 March. The couple and their son Archie spent time in Canada over Christmas Harry is also expected to attend the London Marathon in April in his capacity as patron, while the couple will also attend the Invictus Games in the Netherlands in May. The couple have been in Canada with their son Archie for much of this year, after briefly returning to the UK in January following an extended six-week Christmas break on Vancouver Island. Before announcing their plans to step back from royal duties in January, they had spoken abouthow they had struggled under the media spotlight.

Hole in wall earns rave reviews on TripAdvisorInternet jokers make a circular hole outside a bank rise up the TripAdvisor rankings.,"One japester described the hole, in Bath Street, as ""an adventure not to be missed"" Internet jokers have turned a circular hole in a wall outside a bank into a tourist attraction. Since December 2018, wags have been posting glowing reviews on TripAdvisor for the hole at NatWest in Ilkeston. ""NatWest hole"" is now ranked fourth out of 16 attractions in the Derbyshire town based on user reviews. One reviewer on TripAdvisor offered the spoof advice: ""Can get very busy and you can queue for hours, but it's worth the wait."" The attention has seen the modest hole rise up the rankings Another wag wrote: ""The city of Agra has the Taj Mahal, Paris has the Eiffel Tower and Sydney has its Opera House. ""But they all pale in comparison to the impact on the soul of first laying eyes on Ilkeston's Hole in the Wall."" Paul Miller, chairman of the Ilkeston and District History Society, said he was ""gobsmacked"" at the hole's high ranking. Bennerly Viaduct has a lower ranking on TripAdvisor than the NatWest hole ""It doesn't really say a lot about the area if it's number four,"" he said. ""It's beatBennerley Viaduct. ""I think it looks like a 1970s idea of something to look different. It doesn't really beat the pyramids though does it?"" A NatWest spokeswoman clarified the hole was introduced during a mid-1990s refurbishment as a safety feature so people using the cash machine could see if anyone was lurking behind the wall. It is not the first time tongue-in-cheek reviews have propelled an unlikely attraction up the TripAdvisor rankings.

Waitrose named best supermarket by Which?,"Waitrose has been rated the best UK in-store supermarket in consumer group Which?'s annual satisfaction survey. The John Lewis-owned chain scored five stars in almost every category, but was ranked joint worst for value. It's the second time it's been voted the top grocery store, despite budget chains Aldi and Lidl being ranked best for value. ""The quality of fresh products is the most important factor when choosing where to shop in store,"" said Which?. ""There's clear room for improvement for the 'big four' - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda - as they continue to trail behind Waitrose and Marks & Spencer for experience, and behind Aldi and Lidl on value,"" pointed out Harry Rose, the editor of Which? Magazine. Asda's Christmas sales hit by 'cautious' spending Sainsbury's named cheapest supermarket of 2019 by Which? Which retailers were the Christmas winners and losers? In the survey of more than 14,000 Which? members, Asda was rated the worst. The consumer group found that shoppers like Asda's range of goods in store, but clearly want more recyclable packaging and products without packaging, as the store gained only one star for this aspect. Customers told Which? they wanted to see more recyclable packaging from supermarket chain Asda The survey revealed that Asda provides neither the noteworthy store experience of Waitrose or M&S, nor the value of Aldi or Lidl. Asda scored just two stars for the quality of its own-label products. The store hit back by pointing out that none of Which?'s members had visited one of its stores recently. An Asda spokesman said: ""We're always happy to take feedback - but as 70% of the Which? panel surveyed haven't visited an Asda in the last six months, we don't believe their findings are a true reflection of the experience of our 18 million weekly shoppers, who are looking for a supermarket that provides great value, range and service to customers working to any budget. ""We are proud that our customers are recognising this, with our online grocery service growing at three times the rate of the market. ""We're constantly striving to improve our offer to our customers - be that through the efforts of our hardworking colleagues, the 1,272 new products we launched in 2019, the 530 awards we won for quality, the 8,000 tonnes of plastic packaging we removed from our stores or the 22nd annual Grocer Award for being the best-priced supermarket."" M&S lived up to its reputation for quality when it comes to food and drink, scoring five stars for both its own-brand and fresh produce. But its overall customer score of 73% left it languishing just below Waitrose, not managing to quite match its rival's in-store experience or product range. Aldi and Lidl were rated best for value, both receiving five stars. The budget supermarkets are seen as the best for those wanting more for their money, with rock-bottom prices making customers much more forgiving of their less-impressive traits, such as long queues, or unhelpful or hard-to-find staff. One Aldi customer said: ""It's not a pleasant place to shop, but value for money is exceptional."" Iceland fell short over its fresh produce and lack of recyclable packaging Morrisons and Sainsbury's came in mid-table, with Tesco sliding in just below and Iceland coming in second-to-bottom. Shoppers told Which? that they like Iceland's value for money, but this was not enough to boost its score overall. The supermarket failed to impress with its fresh produce or product range, and got just one star for availability of recyclable packaging. The Which? study also found that when shopping in store, people were most frustrated by waiting for help at self-service checkouts (26%) and by a lack of staffed checkouts (25%). Here are the supermarkets' overall customer scores, according to Which?. They were rated for store appearance, product range, queues, staff availability and helpfulness, quality of own-label products, availability of recyclable packaging and value for money: Waitrose - 76% Marks & Spencer - 73% Aldi - 71% Lidl - 67% Morrisons - 65% Sainsbury's - 64% Tesco - 61% Iceland - 60% Asda - 58% Asda's Christmas sales hit by 'cautious' spending Sainsbury's named cheapest supermarket of 2019 Christmas retail winners and losers Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

""If you win nine more games then you have the best unbeaten run in English football. Being a United fan that is very sad. ""So the next time Liverpool play, please make them lose."" Daragh received the letter earlier this week Klopp replied, praising Daragh's passion, but explaining Liverpool could not drop points on his behalf.

"Bloomberg to release female staff from gag ordersThe US presidential hopeful says three NDAs were agreed with women ""about comments they said I had made"".US & Canada","Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg has bowed to pressure to release former female employees from non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). He said his company was prepared to void three NDAs ""with women to address complaints about comments they said I had made"". His Democratic White House rivals have been pounding away at him on the issue. Critics of NDAs argue these legal gag orders on employees serve to cover up workplace misconduct. In a campaign statement on Friday, he said his media company Bloomberg LP had trawled through its records over the past three decades or so and identified three NDAs. ""If any of them want to be released from their NDA so that they can talk about those allegations, they should contact the company and they'll be given a release,"" he said. This video can not be played Democratic rivals attack Bloomberg in TV debate ""I've done a lot of reflecting on this issue over the past few days and I've decided that for as long as I'm running the company, we won't offer confidentiality agreements to resolve claims of sexual harassment or misconduct going forward."" He added: ""I recognize that NDAs, particularly when they are used in the context of sexual harassment and sexual assault, promote a culture of silence in the workplace and contribute to a culture of women not feeling safe or supported."" Meet the voters behind Bloomberg's surge The Democratic 2020 race - in five charts Who is Michael Bloomberg? Mr Bloomberg, 78, is one of eight contenders remaining in the race to become the Democratic party's presidential candidate who will take on President Donald Trump, a Republican, in November's election. The former New York City mayor, who is the world's ninth richest man, has reportedly splurged $500m (Â£385m) of his own money on campaigning since jumping into the race last November. During a live TV debate on Wednesday in Las Vegas, one contender, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, criticised Mr Bloomberg as ""a billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians'"". She also challenged him to release female employees from the NDAs, but he declined. Another rival, former US Vice-President Joe Biden, attacked Mr Bloomberg, too. The Democratic 2020 race - in five charts ""All the mayor has to do is say, 'you are released from the nondisclosure agreements,'"" Mr Biden said. Stepping up her attack a day later, Ms Warren, a law professor, said she had even drafted a contract for Mr Bloomberg to sign to release women from the NDAs. ""I used to teach contract law, and I thought I would make this easy,"" she told a CNN town hall event on Thursday in Las Vegas. A 1990 booklet of quotes attributed to the billionaire includes sexist remarks, such as ""if women wanted to be appreciated for their brains, they'd go to the library instead of [luxury department store] Bloomingdale's"". He also reportedly told a pregnant employee she should ""kill it"", which he has denied under oath. In a recently leaked video clip, Mr Bloomberg appears to justify his controversial stop-and-frisk policy when he was New York mayor by saying ""you want to put those cops where the crime is, which mean in minority neighbourhoods"", before adding that 95% of murderers and murder victims are male minorities. He has apologised. During a 2016 talk, the former mayor suggested that farming and factory work required less ""grey matter"" than information technology jobs. ""I could teach anybody, even the people in this room, no offence intended, to be a farmer,"" Mr Bloomberg said. Last year, Mr Bloomberg mocked Democratic candidates for championing transgender issues. ""If your conversation during a presidential election is about some guy wearing a dress and whether he, she, or it can go to the locker room with their daughter, that's not a winning formula for most people,"" he said. NDAs started out as legal contracts to ensure employees did not leak trade secrets. But the hush deals have come under intense scrutiny during the #MeToo movement against sexual assault as some companies have used NDAs in harassment settlements with female employees. The nondisclosure provision prohibits signatories from revealing details, such as allegations of misconduct, or else they could face legal consequences. Critics say NDAs silence victims, protect wrongdoers and shield employers from unfavourable publicity. But it is not just companies that have used these contracts. A porn star, Stormy Daniels, was paid $130,000 to sign an NDA to stop her talking about an alleged 2006 fling with US President Donald Trump, which he denied.

'Our life was like Parasite - but in the Cotswolds'VideoVideoIan Wright tearfully remembers childhood teacher'Moon dust' tested in search for water off EarthVideoVideoMen tell of rescuing woman from submerged car roof,"How the creators of the hit BBC Three series went from sharing a bed to sharing a TV show. And are we getting a Christmas special? When Daisy May and Charlie Cooper were in their 20s they were living at home in the Cotswolds with their mum and dad. Charlie had dropped out of uni and Daisy, after a stint at a prestigious drama school, wasn't finding any work. Their dad had just been made redundant and the whole family had been evicted from their old house because they couldn't afford to pay the rent. Things were so tough that the adult siblings were even sharing a bed. ""It's really strange because I went to go see the film Parasite the other day,"" Daisy says, ""and our lives were so similar to that family. ""We were grown-up children living with our parents. None of us were working. It was really the lowest of the low. ""Charlie and I shared a mattress that was broken in the middle. That's how desperate we were. I know it sounds funny but we were completely desperate. Things couldn't have got any worse."" Parasite, which won Best Picture at the Oscars, tells the story of a penniless family who are struggling with the massive wealth divide in Korean society. Daisy and Charlie when they were kids The siblings, who finish each other's sentences, remember how they found work as cleaners and, in their free time, began to write about their life: going on really long walks, making fun of the strange people around town and pushing each other in trolleys around the Tesco car park. Those jokes and storylines would eventually become the BAFTA-winning BBC Three sitcom This Country, about cousins, Kerry and Lee ""Kurtan"" Mucklowe, growing up poor in the Cotswolds countryside. ""There's no opportunities here for young people in the Cotswolds,"" Charlie says. ""There's so much of us in Kerry and Kurtan. We had that feeling of being doomed and being obsessed with the small things just to fill the days."" One of the most difficult things, they recall, is that when they were writing the show, the family didn't have enough money to pay for the internet. ""We'd have to go down to the library to, like, send out emails,"" Daisy says. ""Even not having the luxury of sending off a script and seeing if you got a response - but instead having to walk all the way to town to go to the library - it's such a... what's the word?"" ""It's like water, isn't it,"" Charlie replies. ""It's a necessity."" ""We didn't even have that,"" Daisy says. And the show, now in its third and final season, deals with things like poverty, the impact of austerity and homelessness in the countryside. ""It's a shock because it's gotten worse, especially with the food banks,"" says Daisy. ""You'd think that Cirencester - and the Cotswolds - is quite an affluent area but the food banks are constantly being exhausted."" According to a recentreport,externalÂ from the Trussell Trust, Cirencester Foodbank gave 2,597 emergency food parcels to people between April 2019 and September 2019, a 25% increase on the same period in the previous year. ""There wasn't any food banks here when we were young,"" Charlie adds. ""Now there's three or four, isn't there? ""We don't know so much about the rest of the country, but in the Cotswolds the divide between the wealthy and poor people is huge and it's getting bigger. And there's not a lot in between."" Daisy says she knows a man near where she lives who cycles half an hour to another town so he can collect a food package for his family. ""He's got a food bank service where he lives but he's too ashamed to go in there."" The pair also agree that more needs to be done to support young working class and rural writers, actors and performers. ""We were lucky because Daisy went to drama school and managed to find an agent so we had contacts when we started writing,"" says Charlie. ""There definitely needs to be more schemes for young people,"" adds Daisy. ""Unfortunately, this industry is about who you know."" Daisy, who says the siblings were inspired by shows like The Royle Family, adds: ""There are different trends when it comes to class in TV and film. At the minute, it feels like there's a lot of public school films and actors but it does swing back around."" ""I think if you're working class and trying to break into this industry,"" Charlie says, ""you need support behind you. If you're working a full time job and then trying to be a writer on the side or be an actor on the side, it's just impossible. ""We were lucky enough that we lived at home with our parents for years while we were writing the show. Without them it probably would never have happened."" Even through all the hardship, though, Daisy and Charlie - like their characters Kerry and Kurtan - always managed to see the funny glimmer of light in the darkness. ""Having a laugh was our only form of entertainment and the only thing that ever really kept us together,"" Charlie says.Â ""What got us through was people telling us that we were funny,"" Daisy says, ""and then we were like, 'Oh my god! There's hope, then, that we could maybe turn this around and make a success out of ourselves.'"" And that success has come thick and fast, with three BAFTAs and three Royal Television Awards under their belts. ""It's been an amazing journey,"" Charlie says, reflecting on the past three seasons.Â Daisy celebrating her BAFTA win in 2018 So do people down the pub treat them differently now that they're BAFTA winners? ""Not really,"" they both say, laughing. ""We're just Daisy andÂ Charlie to them,"" Charlie says. ""We don't get special treatment."" Saying goodbye to the show was tough though, they both agree. ""The whole process was emotional,"" Charlie says. ""Obviously because we lost Michael so close to filming and having to try and plough on so close to the start was really hard."" The actorMichael Sleggs, who played the character Michael ""Slugs"" Slugette in This Country, died at the age of 33 last year.Â ""But then I think we were all hungover on the last day,"" he says, as they both crack up into laughter again. It was recently announced that This Country is following in the footsteps of The Office and getting aUS remake,externalfrom Bridesmaids director Paul Feig and Sex and the City TV writerÂ Jenny Bicks.Â ""It's really exciting,"" Daisy says. ""We've seen some of the early drafts of the script and Jenny is just such a funny writer."" The US version is sticking so closely to the original that they're even having a scarecrow festival, Charlie and Daisy say. ""They know how to make it work for an American audience,"" Daisy says. ""I think I'm happy for them to do what they want with it really."" So what's next? Is thisreallythe end for Kerry and Kurtan? ""After seeing the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special, we'd love to do something like that in a few years,â Charlie says. This Country is available oniPlayerÂ and on BBC One on Mondays at 10.35pm.Â Man told he can't recover Â£598m of Bitcoin from tip Fresh weather warnings for ice across UK Truss legal threat to PM over claim she crashed economy Ryan Giggs - what happened?
