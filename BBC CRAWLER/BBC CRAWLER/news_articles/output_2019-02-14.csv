This was defeated by 16 votes. And the Scottish National Party amendment that the government request a postponement of the Brexit date by at least three months. This was also defeated.

Trump 'in good health' despite obesity,"This video can not be played The president has installed a $50,000 golf simulator in the White House US President Donald Trump has put on weight since his last medical check-up, but remains in ""very good health"", his official doctor Sean Conley says. Mr Trump was receiving a higher dose of medicine to lower his cholesterol levels, his memo said. Mr Trump weighed 243lb (110kg) in last week's examination, which is up from 239lb in early 2018. Other doctors noted that his Body Mass Index (BMI) now fell in excess of 30, which is considered clinically obese. ""It is my determination that the president remains in very good health,"" Dr Conley said in a brief statement issued by the White House after examining the 72-year-old. The news of his report was released minutes after officials announced Mr Trump would declare a ""national emergency"" at the US-Mexico border in a bid to secure funding for a border wall. President Trump 'in very good health' Trump's health: Three big ethics questions What will President Trump's medical reveal? President Trump, who has a common form of heart disease, had previously been asked to lose at least 10lb. The 6ft 3in (1.9m) US president reportedly favours a diet of fast food and diet sodas, and has long faced questions over his health. He famously does not drink alcohol, and says he has never done so. He is also a non-smoker. During his campaign, he produced a letter that said he would be the ""healthiest individual ever elected"", but the doctor named as the author later said Mr Trump had written the letter himself. Last year, Dr Ronny Jackson said the president had ""incredible genes"" and it was not a matter of concern that he only slept for four or five hours a night because this was ""just his nature"". This video can not be played Dr Ronny Jackson said in 2018: ""He has incredible genes"" In the latest release, Dr Conley said he had found no significant health problems during the annual check-up. ""There were no findings of significance or changes to report on his  physical exam, including the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, teeth/gums, heart, lungs, skin, gastrointestinal, and neurologic systems,"" the medical summary said. The report detailed that the dosage of his anti-cholesterol medicine, Rosuvastatin, had been increased from 10mg to 40mg.

Amazon cancels New York campus plan,"Incentives promised to Amazon angered opponents Amazon has said it will not build a new headquarters in New York, citing fierce opposition from state and local politicians. The dramatic turnabout comes just months afterthe firm named New York Cityone of two sites selected for major expansion over the next decades. City and state leaders had agreed to provide about $3bn (Â£2.3bn) in incentives to secure that investment. Those subsidies had prompted fierce backlash in some quarters. Amazon said its plans to build a new headquarters required ""positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long term"". It said: ""A number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned. ""We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion."" In November, Amazon announced plans to invest about $2.5bn and add more than 25,000 ""high-paying"" jobs at campuses in New York and near Washington DC over the next two decades. The news capped a 14-month search for a new site that sawcities and towns across North America competing to woo the e-commerce giant. Long Island City, where Amazon was planning expansion, is one of the fastest growing areas in New York In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill DeBlasio championed the project, which Amazon said would generate more than $10bn in new tax revenue in New York. Polls had found that a majority of New Yorkers also supported Amazon's plan. However, it drew opposition from unions, members of the City Council and others, including newly elected Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, angry over the billions in incentives promised to one of the world's most valuable companies. The risk of rising rents, which have spurred tensions in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, were also a concern. Opponents celebrated Amazon's decision on Thursday. Allow Twitter content?

""When our community fights together, anything is possible, even when we're up against the biggest corporation in the world,"" Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer said. ""Defeating an unprecedented act of corporate welfare is a triumph that should change the way we do economic development deals in our city and state forever."" Amazon supporters said the critics were short-sighted.  They said they were worried about the long-term economic consequences as populist messages appear to gain traction. ""The New York Senate has done tremendous damage,"" Gov Cuomo said. ""They should be held accountable for this lost economic opportunity."" Amazon currently employs more than 5,000 people across New York City. It said it expected its staff numbers in the region to continue to grow. The firm said it would not look for an alternative headquarters site, but would move forward as planned at the site near the Pentagon in Northern Virginia. It will also distribute its growth across its offices in the US and Canada. Amazon is also due to receive incentives for the new campus in Virginia, but that package, which is less generous than the one promised in New York, has been less controversial. Frank Raffaele owns Coffeed, a small chain of coffee shops that started in Long Island City, the neighbourhood where Amazon was expected to expand. He said he was disappointed the project had been dropped over ""political posturing"". ""This was transformative for New York and the fact that it's not going to happen anymore is extremely sad,"" he said. ""This was our chance to shine."" By Natalie Sherman, BBC News, New York Amazon may have expected its search for ""HQ2"" to go smoothly. After all, the firm has won billions in incentives from cities and states, and plenty of good PR, over the last decades by promising jobs at its warehouses. Now it was offering a headquarters. But the subsidies that local officials have lavished on corporations like Amazon in recent years have tested the public's patience. And opponents especially questioned the need to use such incentives to spur expansion in Long Island City - one of the fastest-growing areas of one of the country's most successful cities. Polls showed support among the public, but Amazon, which prides itself on being a nimble business despite its size, didn't become a giant by embracing battles with the potential to tarnish its consumer-focused brand. All the more reason to back away.

Police chase death couple 'not at burglary',"The car veered to the wrong side of the A40 near the junction with Kingsdown Avenue and crashed into a coach A couple killed in a car crash after a police chase were not present at the burglary which sparked the pursuit, it has been revealed. Newlywed teenagers Patrick McDonagh, 19, and pregnant wife Shauna, 18, died when their car collided with a bus while travelling down the wrong side of the A40 in Acton. Officers had pursued the car after an armed burglary in Harrow on Sunday. The police watchdog said the pair were not present when the raid happened. It is believed the couple married last year and were expecting a baby girl, which was due on Valentine's Day. The family of the pair said the couple were ""very much looking forward to the birth of their daughter"". They had already picked out Sienna Marie as her name, they said. The crash happened about 20 minutes after the police pursuit began in response to an aggravated burglary in Harrow A family statement said: ""Patrick and Shauna were a young couple who had recently got married and were very much in love. ""Patrick was a devoted husband to Shauna and they were very much looking forward to the birth of their daughter Sienna Marie who was due to be born on Valentine's Day.""

Why EU leaders are not ready to budge on Brexit,"This video can not be played Why did May lose another Brexit vote? ""Has the prime minister's new defeat in parliament made the EU more likely to compromise?"" I've been asked over and again on BBC programmes followingThursday's vote on Theresa May's Brexit strategy. In a word: no. I understand the logic of the question: Brussels can clearly see the prime minister struggling at home. Ultimately the EU wants a deal, so wouldn't it make sense to give her a helping hand now? Well, not to the EU. Brexit: A really simple guide Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? EU reveals no-deal Brexit plans One Brussels official told me Thursday's vote convinced the EU more than ever that before they contemplated changes to the Brexit deal, they would need to see evidence of a comfortable majority of MPs solidly behind Theresa May. Otherwise, the fear is that the EU would give ground for nothing. If Brexit and party divisions run so deep amongst MPs, so the theory here goes, there would be a risk of Theresa May turning to Brussels every week or so, asking for ""a bit more"" and then another bit more - in order to keep restless MPs onside until 29 March. Will Theresa May be able to offer the EU a solution ""that will fly""? After all, in these politically dramatic times in the UK - a lot can change in very few weeks. EU diplomats tell me they hear the hype: the political claims and counter-claims amongst political factions in the UK; they see letters exchanged between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, threats of mass resignations and dreams of cross-party compromise but no evidence, EU contacts say, of a solution ""that will fly"". So for now, EU leaders still believe this is not the time to budge. They see the UK arguing, debating and negotiating with itself again - as it has done so often during the Brexit process - rather than engaging with Brussels. As a result of all this, the new round of EU-UK negotiations are going nowhere fast. ""Window-dressing"" is how one senior EU figure described the talks to me - with each side simply repeating their red lines to the other. So, the current favourite prediction in Brussels is that things will only be resolved in March. Probably with backs against the wall at the summit of EU leaders in Brussels on 21 March - eight days away from B-day. New ideas for the Brexit border backstop And why then? Because interestingly for those who believe the EU hands too much power to Brussels bureaucrats, the only ones who can change the content of the Brexit deal - signed off by the 27 EU leaders plus Theresa May back in November - are those 27 EU leaders plus Theresa May - not Jean Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk or any other ""Brussels bureaucrat"". Even well-seasoned EU officials don't want to predict with any certainty what may happen if 21 March turns into a showdown Brexit summit. Being within touching distance of a no-deal Brexit which the EU is convinced would be nightmarish, would certainly focus minds, as well as possibly kick-start the famous EU ten-to-midnight, deal-making tendency. ""Who knows what decisions EU leaders might take if faced with an imminent no-deal?"" one senior source told me. ""But it's worth saying that up until now in the Brexit process, it's been the EU leaders taking the hard line in negotiations, not Brussels officials."" Preferable for the EU would be Theresa May agreeing last minute to a permanent customs union, allowing the EU to dramatically change conditions around the backstop. Deal done. Brexit over. Allowing both sides to start talks on what really matters to them: the post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But there's a big risk. That at such a last-minute summit, either Theresa May or EU leaders would not blink enough to get the deal over the line. One EU official insisted the bloc wasn't being ""macho"" about not ""giving in"" to the UK - but rather they needed to see a sustainable solution for everyone involved. Translation: don't expect the EU to act against its own interest. ""We see Theresa May trying to blackmail three groups to get this deal passed,"" he told me ""The EU and particularly Ireland, Labour Party MPs and Brexiteers."" ""The chance of this ending badly - with no deal at all - is uncomfortably high."" Which is why most people you speak to in Brussels think an extension to Article 50 - this Brexit negotiation process - is almost inevitable. Though there's little EU enthusiasm for it. Frustration and despondency with the Brexit process is widespread, and EU leaders (think Spain with the Catalan issue and wobbly minority government, France with the ""yellow vest"" protest movement; Italy in recession again and with its infighting coalition government) face other dilemmas screaming for their attention.

'Tory truce' breaks down,"Plasters lose their stick, revealing the hurt underneath. And the fragile patch that was covering the Tory truce has been well and truly torn. Just when Theresa May wanted to show the European Union that she could hold her party together to win, she lost. And at home the prime minister has been shown in no uncertain terms that she simply can't count on the factions in her party to come through for her. PM defeated over Brexit strategy Brexit motion: How  did my MP vote? Brexit: A really simple guide There were, and still are, suspicions among Eurosceptics that the prime minister doesn't really mean it when she says we'll leave at the end of March, whatever happens. It's no secret that a significant number of government ministers would push as firmly as they could to stop that happening. And on show in Parliament, an increasing determination to make that impossible. That explains the demand from Brexiteers for reassurance that Mrs May is still willing to follow the existing law and leave, whatever happens. But this is more than just a Brexiteer strop over no deal. Brexiteers who have been involved in talks with the government about the so-called Malthouse compromise, a different EU deal proposed by MPs, are frustrated that No 10 has not been more full-throated in support for that proposal. That concern was, it's claimed, part of the reason for abstaining in protest, which resulted in this latest defeat. Government sources suggest Eurosceptics' grievances were rather hungrier than that. Whatever the whole truth, it is plain that Mrs May's challenge is not just to persuade a reluctant EU that she can carry Parliament but to bring a party together that has precious little appetite to do so. This is though, far from the end of this troubled journey. In less than a fortnight, MPs will vote again. PM defeated over Brexit strategy Brexit motion: How did my MP vote?

Former presidential hopeful, and frequent Trump critic, Utah Senator Mitt Romney has said he will reserve judgement on Mr Trump's declaration for now. He did however,reiterate his view that an emergency was not the right approach,external. ""I'd also expect the President to stay within statutory and constitutional limit,"" he tweeted.

Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, a cadre of outspoken young progressives led by New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have already stated their opposition in advance of a scheduled Thursday night vote because they donât like the increased funding for immigration enforcement. The two parties are being pulled in opposite directions â and away from common ground. And those most in tune to the sentiments of the political base, those with higher political ambitions, are among those leading the charge. For the moment these ""no"" votes are symbolic, since the bill is expected to pass anyway. There will come a time, however, when the margins are much narrower â and the balance between principle and pragmatism will be truly tested. For the moment, the scale seems tilted to the former.

She writes that the idea of taking money away from recovery funds to give them to border wall projects ""that the new congressional leadership is unwilling to fully fund, creates extreme anxiety not only in the Puerto Rican community.... but also in the various states where such projects were allocated for disaster recovery and mitigation"". ""I understand the importance of securing our southern border, an effort which I have publicly supported,"" the Republican lawmaker notes.

Reacting to the news, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi pointed to the issue of gun violence - givenit is the one year anniversary of the Parkland school shooting. ""You want to talk about a national emergency? Letâs talk
about today - the one year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic
of gun violence in America. Thatâs a national emergency,"" she said. ""Why donât you declare that
emergency Mr President? I wish you would."" The Supreme Court has never ruled on what defines a national emergency, and that definition may determine whether the president's decision is ultimately deemed lawful. A state of emergency is declared in times of crisis, and effectively allows the president to bypass the usual political process. But the question is whether the situation at the US-Mexico border really is an emergency. On the one hand, more than 2,000 people were turned away or arrested at the border each day during November alone. Supporters say this equals an emergency. Others argue the figure is far lower than a decade ago, and many of the thousands of people who travelled north from Central American countries are presenting themselves as asylum seekers, looking to enter the country legally.

IS runaway teen 'could be prosecuted in UK',"Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 A British woman who ran away to Syria as a schoolgirl to join the Islamic State group has been told she could face prosecution if she returns home. Shamima Begum, now 19 and pregnant,told the Times,externalshe had no regrets but wanted to have her baby in the UK. She said she had heard that Amira Abase, one of the two girls she fled to Syria with, might still be alive. Her father, Abase Hussen, broke down on hearing the news and appealed to the UK government to bring both women home. He said that Ms Begum's comments had given his family hope about Ms Abase. In her interview with the newspaper, Ms Begum, who married an IS fighter, showed little remorse for her involvement with the terror group, saying she was not fazed by seeing ""beheaded heads"" in bins. ""I don't regret coming here,"" she told Times journalist Anthony Loyd, who found her in the camp. ""I'm not the same silly little 15-year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago."" This video can not be played Anthony Loyd of the Times describes how he found Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp ""The caliphate is over. There was so much oppression and corruption that I don't think they deserved victory,"" she said. ""I just want to come home to have my child. I'll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child."" Earlier, security minister Ben Wallace told the BBC he would not risk any British officials' safety trying to bring back Ms Begum, who is currently in a refugee camp in northern Syria. But Mr Wallace said any Britons who had gone to Syria to engage or support terrorist activities should be prepared to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted if they came back to the UK. He said there was no consular assistance in Syria and insisted he would not attempt to rescue Ms Begum. ""I'm not putting at risk British people's lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state,"" he told the BBC. This video can not be played Abase Hussen says he regrets taking his daughter to a rally for the banned Islamist terror group Al-Muhajiroun However, the father of Ms Abase believes that the UK should help bring back both his daughter and Ms Begum. Abase Hussen told the BBC that his daughter had not spoken to him since she sent some texts two years ago, telling him not to worry about her. The Times interview ""gives us some kind of positive hope for the family,"" he said. ""We were just waiting for something to come out."" Ms Begum and Ms Abase, both 15, along with Kadiza Sultana, 16, were pupils at Bethnal Green Academy when they left the UK in February 2015. The schoolfriends flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey after telling their parents they were going out for the day. They later crossed the border into Syria. On arriving in Raqqa, Ms Begum stayed at a house with other newly-arrived brides-to-be. ""I applied to marry an English-speaking fighter between 20 and 25 years old,"" she said. Ten days later she married a 27-year-old Dutch man who had converted to Islam - and has been with him since then. The couple escaped from Baghuz - IS's last territory in eastern Syria - two weeks ago. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left, and she is now one of 39,000 people in a refugee camp in northern Syria. Asked whether living in the one-time IS stronghold of Raqqa had lived up to her aspirations, Ms Begum said: ""Yes, it did. ""It was like a normal life. The life that they show on the propaganda videos - it's a normal life. ""Every now and then there are bombs and stuff. But other than that..."" She said that seeing her first ""severed head"" in a bin ""didn't faze me at all"". ""It was from a captured fighter seized on the battlefield, an enemy of Islam. ""I thought only of what he would have done to a Muslim woman if he had the chance,"" she said. Families flee last IS village in Syria After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? London schoolgirl 'feared dead in Syria' Shamima Begum was legally a child when she pinned her colours to the Islamic State mast. And if she were still under 18 years old, the government would have a duty to take her and her unborn child's ""best interests"" into account in deciding what to do next. But she's now an apparently unrepentant adult - and that means she would have to account for her decisions, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. AnotherBritish jihadi bride, Tareena Shakil,who got out of the war zone with her child, lied to the security services on her return and was jailed for membership of a terrorist group. If Ms Begum got out of the country, that is the kind of charge she could face - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that's a long way off. Assuming she made it to an airport, the UK could temporarily ban her from returning until she agreed to be investigated, monitored and deradicalised. Social services would also certainly step in to consider whether her child should be removed to protect him or her from radicalisation. Analysis: What can the UK do about IS teenager? Watch: The background to the case of Tareena Shakil In her interview, Ms Begum talked about Kadiza Sultana who accompanied her to Syria. She said her school friend had died in a bombing on a house where there was ""some secret stuff going on"" underground. ""I never thought it would happen. Because I always thought if we got killed, we'd get killed together,"" she added. A lawyer for Ms Sultana's family said in 2016 that she was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike. Ms Begum said losing her two children came as a shock. ""It just came out of nowhere, it was so hard."" Her daughter died at the age of one year and nine months and was buried in Baghuz a month ago. Her second child died three months ago at just eight months old of an illness compounded by malnutrition, the Times reports. She said she took him to a hospital but there were no drugs and not enough staff. She said she was now ""really overprotective"" of her unborn child and was scared it would become ill if she stayed in the refugee camp. ""That's why I really want to get back to Britain because I know it will be taken care of - health-wise, at least,"" she said. Her family back in the UK told lawyer Tasnime Akunjee they wanted ""time and space to process what's happened"". This video can not be played We asked people in Bethnal Green, where Shamima Begum used to go to school, whether the teenager should be allowed back to the UK Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent, said it should be remembered that Ms Begum was groomed as a child to become a radicalised woman and was a ""victim of brainwashing"". Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Ms Begum would have to be accepted back into the UK if she had not become a national of any other country. Under international law, it is not possible to render a person stateless. He said he thought it was unlikely she would be allowed to return quickly and expected that, if tried for any offences, she would be tried as an adult, he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett. Sir Peter Fahy, a retired senior police chief who led the Prevent terrorism prevention programme at the time the girls ran away, said he could understand why the government was ""not particularly interested"" in facilitating her return. ""If the woman was showing complete remorse, it would be completely different,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. It would cost a ""vast amount of money"" and the biggest challenge would be for local police to keep her safe and ensure she did not become a lightning rod for both right-wing extremists and Islamic extremists, he added. IS has lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks.

Chernobyl: The end of a three-decade experiment,"Since the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986, an area of more than 4,000 square kilometres has been abandoned. That could be about to change, as Victoria Gill discovered during a week-long trip to the exclusion zone. ""This place is more than half of my life,"" says Gennady Laptev. The broad-shouldered Ukrainian scientist is smiling wistfully as we stand on the now dry ground of what was Chernobyl nuclear power plant's cooling pond. ""I was only 25 when I started my work here as a liquidator. Now, I'm almost 60."" There were thousands of liquidators - workers who came here as part of the mammoth, dangerous clean-up operation following the 1986 explosion. The worst nuclear accident in history. Gennady shows me a coffee table-sized platform, installed here to collect dust. This reservoir's bed dried out when the pumps taking water from the nearby river were finally switched off in 2014; 14 years after the remaining three reactors there were shut down. Analysing dust for radioactive contamination is just a small part of the decades-long study of this vast, abandoned area. The accident turned this landscape into a giant, contaminated laboratory, where hundreds of scientists have worked to find out how an environment recovers from nuclear catastrophe. The damaged reactor is now entombed by a steel ""confinement structure"" as cranes dismantle radioactive remnants within On 26 April, 1986, at 1:23AM, engineers cut power to some systems at Chernobyl nuclear power plant's number 4 reactor. It was a critical point in a test to understand what would happen during a blackout. What engineers did not know was that the reactor was already unstable. The cut-off slowed turbines that drove cooling water to the reactor. As less water turned to more steam, the pressure inside built. By the time operators realised what was happening and tried to shut down the reactor, it was too late. A steam explosion blew the lid off the reactor, exposing the core to the atmosphere. Two people in the plant were killed and, as air fuelled a fire that burned for 10 days, a cloud of radioactive smoke and dust was carried on the wind around Europe. This video can not be played Chernobyl's post-human landscape BBC News Our World: In the Shadow of Chernobyl - Watch Victoria Gill's full report from the exclusion zone on Saturday and Sunday, 16 and 17 February, at 2130 GMT on the BBC News Channel, and afterwardson BBC iPlayer. In 1986, Gennady Laptev (on the right) flew by helicopter daily to collect soil and water samples from around the damaged reactor The first emergency workers rushed in as lethal smoke billowed out. Of 134 who were diagnosed with acute radiation sickness, 28 died within months. At least 19 have died since. Gennady, an environmental scientist with the Ukrainian HydroMeteorological Institute, started work in the zone just three months after the evacuation. ""We used to fly in by helicopter every day from Kiev,"" he explains, ""to collect water and soil samples. ""The important thing then was to understand the extent of the contamination - to draw the first maps of the exclusion zone."" Today, that zone spans Ukraine and Belarus. Covering more than 4,000 sq km - more than twice the size of London. Every community within a 30km radius of the plant was evacuated and abandoned; no-one was allowed to return here to live. In a forgotten, outer portion of the exclusion zone, people were quietly allowed to return home a few months after the disaster. Unlike the ""30km zone"", no checkpoints prevent entry to this semi-abandoned area. Narodichi, a town of more than 2,500 people, is within that more-distant zone. Strict rules govern this officially contaminated district; exclusion zone land must not be cultivated to produce food and it cannot be developed. The people who moved to Chernobyl Cameras reveal the secret lives of Chernobyl wildlife Giant structure covers Chernobyl reactor Narodichi is an officially contaminated town within the outer portion of the exclusion zone Today, though, this part of Ukraine is not easily delineated into two categories - contaminated or clean. Research has shown that Chernobyl's aftermath is more complicated, and the landscape here much stranger - and more interesting - than the stringent ""do not touch"" rules in Narodichi would imply. Fear of radiation could actually be hurting the people of Narodichi far more than the radiation itself. Over Gennady's shoulder, I can see the nuclear power plant - less than a kilometre away from the reservoir bed we're standing on. Gleaming in the sunshine is the huge protective steel ""New Safe Confinement"" that now entombs unit 4. It was slid over the top of the accident's epicentre in 2016. Beneath it, robotic cranes are dismantling 33-year-old, radioactive wreckage. Prof Jim Smith from the UK's University of Portsmouth, a colleague of Gennady's, is a scientist who has studied the aftermath of the disaster since 1990. Here on one of his numerous research trips to the zone, he shows me a dosimeter - a black plastic phone-sized gadget he carries throughout the visit. It measures the external dose of radiation he is getting from the environment. Atoms of the nuclear fuel dust that were scattered here by the 1986 explosion are spontaneously breaking down. They are giving out high-energy rays as they do so, and Jim's dosimeter is detecting the dose of those that we are receiving every hour. The dosimeter calculates the radiation dose we receive every hour The readings are in units (called microsieverts) that only make sense to me in the context of other relatively ""radioactive activities"". At one point in the middle of the flight to Kiev - for example - his dosimeter read 1.8 microsieverts per hour. ""It's currently 0.6,"" Jim says. ""So that's about [a third] of what we were getting on the flight."" With the infamous power plant visible in the background, I'm incredulous. But, Jim explains, we live on a radioactive planet - natural radioactivity is all around us. ""It comes from the Sun's rays, from the food we eat, from the Earth,"" he says. That is why, up at 12,000m on an airliner, with less shielding from Earth's atmosphere, we receive a higher dose. ""Yes, the exclusion zone is contaminated,"" he tells me, ""but if we would put it on a map of radiation dose worldwide - only the small 'hotspots' would stand out. ""Natural radioactivity is all around us - it varies from country to country, from place to place. Most of the area of the exclusion zone gives rise to lower radiation dose rates than many areas of natural radioactivity worldwide."" While the boundary of the exclusion zone has not changed, the landscape has - almost beyond recognition. Where people were forced out, nature has moved in. Wilderness combined with abandoned buildings, farms and villages gives a sense of the post-apocalyptic. Jim and his colleagues spend their days here collecting samples and planting cameras and audio recorders, which silently gather information about what wildlife inhabits this post-human place, and how the radiation affects it. On the second day of our trip to the zone, I follow the team into the Red Forest. This is an exclusion zone hotspot that, because of the direction of the winds in 1986, took the brunt of the shower of radioactive material. We put on dust suits to avoid contaminating our clothing. In the forest, Jim's dosimeter reads 35 - almost 60 times the external dose we were getting in the cooling pond. ""We don't want to be here for too long,"" says Jim. He and the team gather their soil samples swiftly, take some photographs and head back to the car. Wild horses were released into the zone as part of an experiment to reduce the risk of wildfires In the abandoned village of Burayakovka - just over 10km from the power plant - it is a very different approach. Jim and the team take their time exploring the area. The dosimeter reads 1.0 - still less than on the flight. Inside one small, crumbling but still colourful wooden house, the sad truth of what people so suddenly lost here is apparent. A coat still slung over the arm of a chair is now covered in three decades of dust. But what people left behind - through farming and gardening - has turned into a strangely rich habitat and provisions for wild animals. Long-term studies have shown that there is more wildlife in the abandoned villages than anywhere else in the zone. Brown bears, lynx and wild boar are seen roaming here. Dr Maryna Shkvyria, a researcher based at Kiev Zoo, has spent years tracking and studying the larger mammals that moved in when people moved out. Camera trap images reveal that lynx now roam the exclusion zone There are studies suggesting that birds in the most contaminated areas show signs of damage to their DNA, but Maryna's work is adding to a catalogue of research that suggests wildlife is thriving throughout much of the exclusion zone. Chernobyl's wolves, she says, are a particularly striking example. ""After 15 years of studying them, we have a lot of information about their behaviour,"" Maryna explains. ""And the Chernobyl wolf is one of the most natural wolves in Ukraine."" By ""natural"", she means there is very little ""human food"" in the wolves' diet. ""Usually, wolves are around settlements,"" Maryna explains. ""They can eat livestock, crops and waste food - even pets."" But not here where wolves hunt wild prey. Chernobyl's wolves feed on deer and even catch fish. Some images - caught by camera traps - reveal gentler dietary habits. Wolves have been snapped eating fruit from around trees that used to be in people's orchards. There is one group of animals that has made the zone its home and that - strictly speaking- should not really be here. Lack of hunting may have contributed to the success of Chernobyl's wolves In 1998, Ukrainian zoologists released a herd of 30 endangered Przewalski's horses in the zone. The apparent aim was for the horses to graze overgrowth and reduce the risk of wildfire. There are now about 60 of them - in herds dispersed across Ukraine and Belarus. They are native to the open plains of Mongolia, so forests peppered with abandoned buildings should not be ideal habitat. ""But they're really using the forests,"" explains Maryna. ""We even put camera traps in old barns and buildings and they're using them to [shelter] from mosquitoes and heat. ""They even lay down and sleep inside - they're adapting to the zone."" Wildlife might be making the most of what's gradually become a post-human nature reserve, but not every village was left for animals to claim. Some people still live here - deep in the 30km zone. Maria (right) and her neighbour are part of a community of just 15 self-settlers in the zone who grow their own food and make their own vodka On my fourth day here, we visit Maria's house. She is outside in her garden when we arrive at the gate, and - as I try to introduce myself in a few stumbling words of Ukrainian - she interrupts me by wrapping me in a warm hug and kissing me on the cheek. Today is her 78th birthday. She is expecting us and has prepared a celebratory breakfast. Maria ushers me, Jim, his colleague Mike, and our interpreter Denis to a wooden table under a fruit tree. It is a gloriously sunny day and pleasantly warm even at 9am. Maria starts to bring food - fatty salted bacon, a whole fish, sliced sausage and steaming hot, home-grown potatoes. There are two bottles of what appear to be spirits - one colourless, one dark red. ""If you don't like this vodka, you can have the cherry one - I made it,"" she says. Maria and her neighbours make up a tiny community of just 15. Each of these self-settlers, as they are known, travelled back across a patchily enforced exclusion zone boundary and reclaimed their homes in 1986. Signs bearing the names of abandoned communities make up a memorial in the town of Chernobyl Almost every family forced to leave here was given an apartment in a nearby town or city. For Maria and her mother, though, this cottage, with the garden wrapped around it, was home. They refused to abandon it. ""We weren't allowed to come back, but I followed my mum,"" Maria recalls. ""She was 88 back then. She kept saying: 'I will go, I will go'. I just followed her."" There are about 200 self-settlers in total living in the zone and, for an ageing population cut off from the rest of the country, Maria says life is not easy. ""We're all very old,"" she tells me. ""And we take each day as it comes. ""I feel full of life when my children come to visit me from Kiev. Otherwise, it's not so interesting to live here. But you know this is our land - our motherland. It's irreplaceable."" Maria's mobile phone rings and I am struck by the incongruity of our diminutive babushka hostess, standing in her exclusion zone garden, apparently trying to wrap up swiftly a call from her daughter. She is busy with her visitors from the BBC! Remote as it is, this is a close community. As we sit in the garden (knocking back cherry vodka at our Maria's repeated insistence) her neighbour arrives with a birthday gift. She sits on the bench near the garden gate; she can't walk too far. The self-settlers are a tiny minority, though. Most people who so suddenly lost their homes here have no hope of coming back. Pripyat was home to 50,000 people before the accident Most of them lived in Pripyat - a true Soviet dream town, purpose-built for the power plant workers. Just a few kilometres from the plant itself, this town of 50,000 people was emptied overnight. No-one was allowed to return; it is now the archetype of a 20th Century ghost city. Pripyat was, however, recently deemed safe to visit for short periods and has now become one of Ukraine's most talked about tourist attractions. An estimated 60,000 people visited the exclusion zone last year, keen to witness the dramatic decay. Signs of tourism are popping up around the exclusion zone Its bleak notoriety has made it the subject of some dark, social media-based showing-off. Search #chernobyl on Instagram and you will find - among the interesting landscapes and tourist snaps - images of anonymous, costumed characters, sometimes wearing gas masks or holding up creepy-looking dolls for the camera. The town of Chernobyl itself - somewhat confusingly much further from the power plant than Pripyat - is in a less contaminated area. It has become a relatively populous hub. Power plant decommissioning staff, scientists and tourists stay here. Gennady, Jim, me and the rest of the research team are staying in one of its small hotels - a Soviet-style building with an incongruously pretty, well-tended garden around it. This greenery is looked after by Irina, who manages the hotel. She stays here for three months at a time before a colleague takes over. People are only permitted to live in the town for limited periods. Over a cup of tea on our second evening at the hotel, Gennady translates as Irina tells us about her memories of the accident. She lived in Pripyat at the time with her grandmother. Pripyat's abandoned fairground has become an icon On 27 April - a day after the explosion - the town was evacuated. People were ordered to leave immediately. They lined up for buses that would take them away from the town and the plant. Irina was on her way back to her grandmother's apartment at the time. ""A friend of my grandmother's was driving a cattle wagon - taking his livestock out,"" she recalled. ""My grandmother asked if he would take me with him, so I climbed on to the cattle wagon. ""I didn't know what was happening."" Inside our Chernobyl hotel But Irina, not unlike Maria, felt a need to return to the zone. She has never been back to Pripyat, though; it would upset her too much to see it now. But she takes pride in tending the flowers around her Chernobyl hotel. ""I like to make it as pretty as possible for the visitors,"" she tells me. ""So maybe you can tell people back home that Chernobyl is not such a horrible place."" Gennady's 33 years working in the exclusion zone might have been leading up to one meeting at the end of this week. It is being held in a school in Narodichi, the town in the outer zone. Here, scientists, community members, medical experts and officials from the state agency that manages the exclusion zone are gathering to discuss a change that could transform this district's future. For the first time since the boundary was drawn, the zone is set to change. Three decades of research have concluded that much of it is safe - for food to be grown and for the land to be developed. Narodichi is one of its least contaminated places. Jim and Gennady are presenting their conclusions at the meeting. Before it is under way, I have arranged to visit the town's kindergarten, where the children are playing outside in the sunshine. A rainbow-painted picket fence at the edge of their playground contrasts almost ludicrously with grey, half-built tower blocks next door. There were 360 children here before the accident. Tatiana Kravchenko, a woman with a perpetual kind smile and who is wearing a thick, bright pink coat, is the kindergarten manager. She remembers the evacuation. ""The children were evacuated together with teachers to 'clean zones',"" she recalls. ""In three months we were sent back, and we had only 25 children. Eventually, people have come back, new children have been born and gradually the kindergarten started filling up again. Now we have 130 children here."" Most of the time, Tatiana says, she does not think of her community as being within the exclusion zone. ""We forget that we are Chernobyl people; we have other issues to deal with,"" she tells me. ""It's no secret that half of the parents [of these kids] are unemployed, because there is nowhere to work. I wish that we could build something here - that our community could start to bloom."" Back in the meeting, Gennady peers over red-rimmed glasses, attentively listening to what is being said. Discussions are taking longer than expected. Much of the community input seems to reflect Tatiana's thoughts - that it is time for restrictions to be lifted here. But there is a lot at stake. People still fear the legacy of what happened here in 1986 People affected by the accident receive financial compensation from the government. Here, in a town of high unemployment, in a country where the average wage is less than 400USD per month, that income is important. And many still fear Chernobyl radiation - and the effect that it might still have on their health, and the health of their children. After many years of research, understanding and explaining the long-term health legacy of the accident has been infuriatingly complicated. It is conclusive that around 5,000 cases of thyroid cancer - most of which were treated and cured - were caused by the contamination. Authorities failed to prevent contaminated milk from being sold in the region; many who were children at the time drank it receiving large doses of radioactive iodine. That was one of the contaminants blasted out of the reactor. Many suspect that the radiation has or will cause other cancers, but the evidence is patchy. Prof Richard Wakeford, from the University of Manchester's Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, points out that health studies look for a ""signal"" of a specific health effect linked to Chernobyl. They aim to pick out that signal above the ""background noise"" from other causes. That has been incredibly difficult, primarily because of the huge background noise that was the almost simultaneous upheaval of the Soviet Union's collapse. ""It's assumed that there will be some cancers linked to the accident in addition to the thyroid cancers, but detecting them amid that socioeconomic chaos - that had its own impacts on people's health - has proven almost impossible,"" says Prof Wakeford. Cancer also affects between a third and a half of people in Europe, so any Chernobyl signal is likely to be small. Amid reports of other health problems -  including birth defects - it still is not clear if any can be attributed to radiation. Gennady (right) and his colleagues have grown crops in the exclusion zone as part of their research Prof Geraldine Thomas from Imperial College London explains: ""Another confounding factor in this part of the world relates, confusingly, to iodine deficiency."" In its non-radioactive form, iodine is found in milk, green leafy vegetables and seaweed. A lack of it in the diet is a known cause of problems in the early development of the brain and spinal cord. ""So one possible cause of birth defects is actually a lack of iodine in the environment,"" the prof says. All of this means that estimates of cancer cases remain highly contentious. In its seminal 2006 report on the the long-term consequences of the accident, the World Health Organization did conclude that many people's mental health has been damaged - by fear of radiation and severe disruption to their lives. As a scientist who has spent years scrutinising the truth about the contamination in the zone, Gennady admits that he did not expect the people of Narodichi to be afraid of radiation. ""It's a very big factor affecting their lives, even more than 30 years after the accident. This is really something that surprised me,"" he says. That fear can be physically as well as mentally damaging. A sense of fatalism and hopelessness associated with assumptions of being doomed by radiation is thought to contribute to higher rates of of smoking and alcoholism in this region - both of which are definitively bad for people's health. ""It was a terrible thing that happened here,"" says Jim. ""But that tends to dominate people's lives. ""Somehow - and it's very, very difficult - we've got to move towards a situation where people can go back to living their lives without this fear, this radiation blight."" Gennady emerges from the meeting looking a little jaded, but he says he is cautiously optimistic. The map was not officially redrawn today, but, crucially, most people in the room agreed there was a need for change. The Narodichi meeting could be a first step in transforming the district ""The community wants to bring more life here,"" Gennady says. ""And we, as scientists, know that a lot of places here can be easily excluded from this ban, so I think this was a very positive moment."" At the kindergarten, Tatiana has ushered the younger children inside for an afternoon nap. There are rows of adorably tiny beds inside a new wing of the kindergarten that was built with money from a Japanese charity. The close relationship between Japan and Ukraine has been forged by the former being in the early stages of understanding the impact of its own nuclear disaster - at the Fukushima power plant. Looking from the pristine new kindergarten building to the neighbouring derelict block, she says she would support the town's removal from the zone.

Mum and daughter saved from crash by Snapchat,"A mum and her daughter were rescued from a car crash after a 15-year-old tracked them down on Snapchat Maps. Gemma and Martha Fairweather were driving home when their car skidded off a Suffolk road - deep into a ditch. They'd been on a day out in Lowestoft with Gemma's boyfriend Graham and his son Sam. ""We were teetering on the edge on our side,"" Gemma tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""We could see and hear water to the left of us through the window."" The car had come off the road on a blind corner. Gemma says she'd braked when she was dazzled by the lights of an oncoming car on Sunday night. They were unable to get out of the car, and she says every movement they made threatened to rock the car closer to the running water. Gemma says her car skidded off the road on mud and leaves Gemma had taken a ""nice quiet road"" home on purpose so she could drive at a low speed she felt comfortable with. But it meant neither the emergency services or her partner could find them - despite Gemma trying to give details of their location from her Sat Nav. ""The emergency services seemed to be on other roads and couldn't find us,"" Gemma says. ""It was either that or as they were driving past we were so down into the ditch and away from the road that nobody could see us."" But while Gemma was on the phone to the emergency services, she was also messaging Sam, who was looking for them with his dad. ""Sam was texting me saying 'we can't find you' and then he had a really bright idea of going onto Snapchat. ""He said: 'Go onto Snapchat, I'll be able to find you on Snapchat Maps'."" The ambulance service then contacted Graham and Sam, who was able to direct them to Gemma and Martha using Snapchat's location function. ""Just as they turned up, the fire brigade turned up as well, because they were the highest vehicle who could see us in the ditch and see our hazards,"" says Gemma. ""Everybody turned up at once thanks to Sam and his quick thinking with Snapchat."" Sadly Sam - the hero of the story - is currently on a school trip in Belgium and was unable to speak to Newsbeat about his part in the rescue. ""I held her hand and said that things were going to be OK,"" says Gemma about waiting for rescue Gemma says her knowledge of first aid helped her keep her daughter calm, but on the inside she was beginning to panic. ""The thing that was heart-wrenching for me was when Martha turned to me and said 'It was nice to have known you mummy'. ""That will stay with me for the rest of my life without a doubt."" Gemma says she has previously had concerns about sharing her location over social media. ""I did worry about people finding you. But in this instance, it was a really good resource, even for the emergency services."" And Gemma says the incident has even brought her, her partner and their children closer together. ""I don't know if I would have thought 'Yes, Snapchat Maps, you'll be able to find us',"" says Gemma. ""But obviously for a 15-year-old, it was the answer. He was definitely the hero of the day.""

'Third man' named in Skripal poisoning,"Sergei Skripal, 67, and his daughter Yulia survived the attack A third man has been named as a suspect in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury last year. Investigative website Bellingcat,externalclaims that he is Denis Vyacheslavovich Sergeev, a Russian military intelligence officer. It says he came to the UK at the same time as two suspects alleged to have carried out the March 2018 attack. The website claims the officer travelled internationally under the pseudonym Sergey Fedotov. MI6 double agent Sergei Skripal, 67, and his daughter Yulia, then 33, were poisoned with a nerve agent known as novichok in Salisbury. Both of them survived. Prior to the latest claim, two Russian nationals were named as suspects. Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin have been linked to the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. The Kremlin has not commented on the latest report but it has previously expressed doubts over Bellingcat's reports about Mr Chepiga and Mr Mishkin. Bellingcat claims that this photograph is of the third suspect, Denis Vyacheslavovich Sergeev The website says that Mr Fedotov was booked onto a flight which left the UK last March but that he missed it. It says he travelled instead to Rome, from where he went to Moscow. It previously reported that he used a similar travel pattern in 2015 in Bulgaria - missing a booked flight and returning to Moscow from Istanbul. During that trip, Bellingcat says a Bulgarian arms trader, Emilian Gebrav, and his son needed hospital treatment after contact with an unidentified poison. Mr Gebrav survived. The website says that Mr Sergeev travelled with one of the other two suspects on at least one occasion, and made multiple trips to the UK. British officials are understood to be investigating the Bulgarian reports. A Kremlin spokesman previously said Russia did not know ""whether this is true at all"". Picture timeline: What happened to the Skripals? Bellingcat: the site behind the Skripal revelation Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far Responding to the website's initial investigation, a Kremlin spokesman told the BBC: ""We don't know how far this corresponds with reality, whether it's real at all. ""We don't know what the report's authors based their work on - how competent they are - who they are - and whether this is true at all."" The British government blamed the Salisbury attack on the GRU. Prime Minister Theresa May said the attack on Mr Skripal had ""almost certainly"" been approved by the Russian state. Moscow has consistently denied any involvement in the Salisbury poisonings. The Metropolitan Police say they are continuing to pursue a number of lines of enquiry including identifying any other suspects who may have been involved in carrying out or planning the attack.

Deadliest Kashmir militant attack on troops,"This video can not be played The blast took place on a heavily guarded highway At least 40 Indian paramilitary police have been killed in a bomb attack by militants on their convoy in Indian-administered Kashmir. Police told the BBC that a car filled with explosives had rammed a bus carrying the troops to Srinagar. Pakistan-based Islamist group Jaish-e-Mohammad said it was behind the attack. It is the deadliest militant attack on Indian forces in Kashmir since the insurgency against Indian rule began in 1989. The funerals driving youth to militancy Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Kashmir territories - full profile India has called for international sanctions against Jaish-e-Mohammad's leader, Masood Azhar. Pakistan said the attack was a matter of ""grave concern"" but rejected suggestions that it was responsible for it. Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir but only control parts of it. The blast took place on the heavily guarded Srinagar-Jammu highway about 20km (12 miles) from the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir, Srinagar. Indian media reports said that at about 15:15 local time (09:45 GMT) a car carrying between 300 and 350kg (660-770lb) of explosives struck a convoy of about 70 vehicles that was carrying about 2,500 troops to the Kashmir Valley. ""A car overtook the convoy and rammed into a bus with 44 personnel on board,"" a senior police official told BBC Urdu's Riyaz Masroor. The attack is the deadliest on Indian forces in disputed Kashmir for years The official said the death toll might increase because dozens were ""critically injured"". The highway had previously been closed for a week because of snow, reports said. AFP news agency said Jaish-e Mohammad had told local media it had carried out a suicide bombing. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has strongly condemned the attack. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By Ethirajan Anbarasan, BBC South Asia regional editor The Indian security establishment had been chest-thumping in recent months on how they managed to contain the insurgency. This attack though is a reminder the conflict is far from over. The incident could increase tensions between India and Pakistan. The Indian government had already pointed the finger at Pakistan for allegedly supporting militant groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad. Pakistan denies those accusations. Some blame India's Hindu nationalist BJP government for not initiating steps to start peace negotiations with Kashmiri groups and also with Pakistan. The Indian government faces a dilemma - any strong-arm tactics will further alienate the Kashmiri population. But not being seen to be doing anything on the ground will not augur well for Mr Modi, who is seeking re-election in a couple of months. There have been at least 10 suicide attacks since 1989 but this is only the second suicide attack to use a car. Prior to Thursday's bombing, the deadliest attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir this century came in 2002, when militants killed at least 31 people at an army base in Kaluchak near Jammu, most of them civilians and relatives of soldiers. At least 19 Indian soldiers were killed when militants stormed a base in Uri in 2016. Delhi blamed that attack on the Pakistani state, which denied any involvement. This video can not be played In December Yogita Limaye examined why there had been a rise in violence in Kashmir The latest attack also follows a spike in violence in Kashmir that came about after Indian forces killed a popular militant, 22-year-old Burhan Wani, in 2016. More than 500 people were killed in 2018 - including civilians, security forces and militants - the highest such toll in a decade. Is India losing Kashmir? Viewpoint: Will Pakistan mend its ways on terror? Pathankot attack: Pakistan arrests Jaish-e-Mohammad militants India and Pakistan have fought three wars and a limited conflict since independence from Britain in 1947 - all but one were over Kashmir. Started by cleric Masood Azhar in 2000, the group has been blamed for attacks on Indian soil in the past, including one in 2001 on the parliament in Delhi which took India and Pakistan to the brink of war. It is also said to have introduced suicide bombings in Kashmir, with the first such attack taking place in 2000. It has been designated a ""terrorist"" organisation by India, the UK, US and UN and has been banned in Pakistan since 2002. However Masood Azhar remains at large and is reportedly based in the Bahawalpur area in Pakistan's Punjab province. Previous Indian efforts to have him designated a terrorist by the UN have been blocked by China, an ally of Pakistan. India has also demanded his extradition from Pakistan but Islamabad has refused, citing a lack of proof. 2018: Kashmir's violent year.

Peer 'took advantage' of vulnerable women,"Lord Nazir Ahmed denies all the allegations against him A member of the House of Lords has been accused of exploiting his position to pursue sex with vulnerable women who asked him for help, Newsnight reveals. One woman said Lord Nazir Ahmed of Rotherham ""took advantage"" and began a sexual relationship with her after she approached him for assistance. Her case has raised questions about the adequacy of the House of Lords Code of Conduct. Lord Ahmed, 61, denies acting inappropriately. Tahira Zaman, 43, approached Lord Ahmed in February 2017 through a mutual friend, hoping he would help get the police to investigate a Muslim faith healer who she felt was a danger to women. Ms Zaman told BBC Newsnight that Lord Ahmed said he wrote a letter to the Metropolitan Police Commander Cressida Dick about her concerns. She then alleges that he repeatedly asked her for dinner. She says she finally agreed and weeks after the dinner, she contacted him about her case and he invited her to his east London home. ""He was saying I'm beautiful,"" she told Newsnight. The pair went on to have sex on numerous occasions. Tahira Zaman complained about Lord Ahmed's behaviour to the Lords' Commissioner for Standards She accepts the relationship was consensual but said: ""I was looking for help and he took advantage of me. He abused his power."" The relationship ended after two months when Lord Ahmed told her he would not leave his wife, she said. ""I genuinely did believe that he had feelings for me, I'm just so stupidâ¦ and I believed that he was going to help me,"" she said. In her interview with Newsnight, Ms Zaman said she feels exploited by Lord Ahmed because she was suffering from anxiety and depression. In a second case, a woman who wishes to remain anonymous told Newsnight she had also asked Lord Ahmed for help and claims he suggested she should spend the night at his London home. She interpreted this as a proposition for sex, which she refused. Lord Ahmed denies any wrongdoing. In January of last year, Ms Zaman complained about Lord Ahmed's behaviour to the Lords' Commissioner for Standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrieff. ""Lord Ahmed used my trust to repeatedly have intercourse with me,"" she told the commissioner. ""I feel I have been preyed upon due to my vulnerability and used by Lord Ahmed."" But after reviewing her complaint twice, the commissioner said she was unable to investigate. Ms Scott-Moncrieff concluded the code could not have been broken because when Lord Ahmed offered to help her and write to the police, it was not part of his parliamentary work. She wrote to Ms Zaman: ""The behaviour you describe in your email could amount to a breach of personal honour. However, the code only applies in relation to a peer's parliamentary work, and, from your email, it looks as if your initial contact with him was not to do with his parliamentary work."" Newsnight showed the full correspondence between Ms Zaman and the Lords' Commissioner for Standards to Lord Carlile - a barrister and former deputy high court judge. He said the rules should be clarified. ""If someone comes to you for help, particularly if they're vulnerableâ¦and you form a sexual relationship, actually that's disgraceful,"" he said. He added: ""If it is not clear to the commissioner, who is a very experienced lawyer, then I think the rules need to be clarified and in particular the guide to the code of conduct needs to be clarified."" ""She went to Lord Ahmed because she believed he was in a position to do something influential for her"", he added. ""So it's absolutely clear to me that what he was doing was in his role as a member of the House of Lords."" Lord Carlile said a sexual relationship between Lord Ahmed and Ms Zaman could breach two clauses in the code of conduct: one covering conflicts of interest and another which stipulates that Lords must behave on ""their personal honour"". But in a statement to Newsnight, Ms Scott-Moncrieff, said: ""Though credible and substantial, the complaint provided insufficient evidence that contact with the member was in relation to his parliamentary duties... To conclude otherwise, as Lord Carlile has done, is to misunderstand the code."" In a statement, Lord Ahmed told Newsnight: ""I completely deny the allegation that I have exploited my position to pursue an inappropriate relationship with any member of the public (vulnerable or otherwise) or that I have acted inappropriately in the presence of women either in my personal or professional capacity. ""The House of Lords' Commissioner for Standards, Ms Lucy Scott-Moncrieff CBE, assessed the complaint and decided that it did not engage parliamentary inappropriate behaviour about me. She decided to take no further action."" He added: ""I take my duties as a Parliamentarian extremely seriously and would not act so as to undermine my personal or professional reputation.""

Former presidential hopeful, and frequent Trump critic, Utah Senator Mitt Romney has said he will reserve judgement on Mr Trump's declaration for now. He did however,reiterate his view that an emergency was not the right approach,external. ""I'd also expect the President to stay within statutory and constitutional limit,"" he tweeted. Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has just released a statement calling Trump's decision a ""clear abuse of presidential power"". ""President Trumpâs hankering for a wall at the southern border cannot be justified by calling a national emergency."" ""Shame on any member of Congress who doesnât clearly and vigorously speak out on this illegitimate invocation of emergency authorities. ""The chickens will come to roost when the next president uses these powers to call a national emergency on gun control or climate change.""  Earlier this month, the BBC's Vicky Baker traveled to Maryland to meet members of one Latino community to try and find how the fierce political debate about immigration and the border wall was affecting them.

Last month, we put together a collection of charts that tell you all you need to know about the long-promised wall. You can read and see the rest here. Florida's Republican Senator Marco Rubio is just out with this statement: ""We have a crisis at our southern border, but no crisis justifies violating the constitution."" He writes that ""today's national emergency is border security. But a future president may use this exact same tactic to impose"" policies opposed by Republicans. ""I will wait to see what statutory or constitutional power the president relies on to justify such a declaration before making any definitive statement. ""But I am sceptical it will be something I can support."" Senator Lindsey Graham Axios has compiled this handy list,externalof what Republicans have been saying about Mr Trump's plan. Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins thronged by media at the US Congress Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican representative, has shared a statement criticising the President's decision. In it, she says that she shares his concern about the border - but says the emergency could set a dangerous precedent for future presidents to act alone, undermining the constitution.

Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, a cadre of outspoken young progressives led by New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have already stated their opposition in advance of a scheduled Thursday night vote because they donât like the increased funding for immigration enforcement. The two parties are being pulled in opposite directions â and away from common ground. And those most in tune to the sentiments of the political base, those with higher political ambitions, are among those leading the charge. For the moment these ""no"" votes are symbolic, since the bill is expected to pass anyway. There will come a time, however, when the margins are much narrower â and the balance between principle and pragmatism will be truly tested. For the moment, the scale seems tilted to the former.

She writes that the idea of taking money away from recovery funds to give them to border wall projects ""that the new congressional leadership is unwilling to fully fund, creates extreme anxiety not only in the Puerto Rican community.... but also in the various states where such projects were allocated for disaster recovery and mitigation"".

Reacting to the news, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi pointed to the issue of gun violence - givenit is the one year anniversary of the Parkland school shooting. ""You want to talk about a national emergency? Letâs talk
about today - the one year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic
of gun violence in America. Thatâs a national emergency,"" she said. ""Why donât you declare that
emergency Mr President? I wish you would."" The Supreme Court has never ruled on what defines a national emergency, and that definition may determine whether the president's decision is ultimately deemed lawful. A state of emergency is declared in times of crisis, and effectively allows the president to bypass the usual political process. But the question is whether the situation at the US-Mexico border really is an emergency. On the one hand, more than 2,000 people were turned away or arrested at the border each day during November alone. Supporters say this equals an emergency. Others argue the figure is far lower than a decade ago, and many of the thousands of people who travelled north from Central American countries are presenting themselves as asylum seekers, looking to enter the country legally.

"Alesha, six, had 'catastrophic' injuriesA pathologist tells a court the schoolgirl died after significant pressure was applied to her face and neck.Glasgow & West Scotland","Alesha's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel on 2 July last year A pathologist has told the Alesha MacPhail murder trial that the six-year-old died after suffering ""catastrophic"" injuries. Dr John Williams said the cause of death was significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. He also told the court Alesha had 117 injuries, although some could have been caused by vegetation. A 16-year old boy denies abducting, raping and murdering the schoolgirl on the Isle of Bute. The accused cannot be named because he is under the age of 18. It is alleged that Alesha was taken from the home her grandparents shared with her father. Warning: The following contains details of Alesha's injuries Dr Williams was one of the pathologists who carried out the post-mortem examination on her body after she was found in woodland at a disused hotel on 2 July last year. Woman denies killing six-year-old Alesha Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman He told the High Court in Glasgow the injuries to Alesha's neck and face were consistent with being gripped, and those to her nose and mouth were consistent with smothering. He added it was also possible her windpipe was pushed shut. Dr Williams also said Alesha had ""catastrophic"" genital injuries, more severe than he had ever seen before. And he said Alesha's feet appeared to be uninjured which he agreed would be consistent with her being carried to the area. Jurors later heard how the accused's mother called police after learning her son had left the family home in the early hours of 2 July. She had watched CCTV footage from cameras installed at their home. The 54-year-old told the court her son had been at home drinking with friends and she had argued with him over damage caused to furniture. She thought he had then gone to bed. The following day she helped search for Alesha and later checked her CCTV system which covered the front and back of her home. She had installed the CCTV as a precaution when her mother, who suffered from dementia, had lived with her. The court heard the boy had ""gone out, come back, gone out and come back again"" in the early hours of 2 July. Jurors were shown footage in which she identified her son leaving their home at 01:54 on 2 July, wearing all black, and returning at 03:35 no longer wearing his black top. At 03:44, a light is turned on in the bathroom and he is seen leaving a minute later wearing only shorts and carrying an item. The mother said she told her son about the footage and asked him why he was out, to which he said: ""I don't know, I might have been looking for my phone."" She asked him if he knew anything about the missing girl. ""He was lying sleeping,"" she said. ""I asked 'have you seen this little girl - do you or your friends know anything?' ""He said 'no' then just rolled back over. ""We were trying to explain to him that whoever done this would have left DNA. He was not sure what DNA was. ""He was adamant he had nothing to do with it. There was no way they would find his DNA because he had been nowhere near this little girl."" His mother later phoned police to ""eliminate"" her son from inquiries, saying: ""Obviously I really didn't think he had anything to do with it whatsoever."" She described her son as being ""clever at maths"", ""well-liked"" and said he had ""lots of friends"". The court heard the boy later claimed to his mother he had gone out in the early hours to ""buy weed"". Further CCTV footage showed the boy out at about 04:00 shining a torch before running off from his home. His mother was also shown a knife found on the shore of Bute during the murder inquiry. She accepted it was ""very similar"" to knives found in a set at her home. Meanwhile witness Alexander McLachlan contacted police after watching CCTV footage from outside his Bute home in the early hours of 2 July. He told the court it showed ""someone walking as if carrying something"" on the shoreline. Mr McLachlan said: ""I presumed that it was someone carrying a child."" The accused has also been charged with attempting to hide evidence. He has claimed it was Toni McLachlan, the partner of Alesha's father, who killed her. During her evidence to the court on Wednesday, Ms McLachlan insisted she had nothing to do with Alesha's death, telling jurors: ""I loved her to pieces."" The trial, before Lord Matthews, continues. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

Former presidential hopeful, and frequent Trump critic, Utah Senator Mitt Romney has said he will reserve judgement on Mr Trump's declaration for now. He did however,reiterate his view that an emergency was not the right approach,external. ""I'd also expect the President to stay within statutory and constitutional limit,"" he tweeted. Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has just released a statement calling Trump's decision a ""clear abuse of presidential power"". ""President Trumpâs hankering for a wall at the southern border cannot be justified by calling a national emergency."" ""Shame on any member of Congress who doesnât clearly and vigorously speak out on this illegitimate invocation of emergency authorities. ""The chickens will come to roost when the next president uses these powers to call a national emergency on gun control or climate change.""  Earlier this month, the BBC's Vicky Baker traveled to Maryland to meet members of one Latino community to try and find how the fierce political debate about immigration and the border wall was affecting them. Read more The southern border has been one of President Trump's biggest policy promises - and one of his most divisive. Last month, we put together a collection of charts that tell you all you need to know about the long-promised wall. You can read and see the rest here. Florida's Republican Senator Marco Rubio is just out with this statement: ""We have a crisis at our southern border, but no crisis justifies violating the constitution."" He writes that ""today's national emergency is border security. But a future president may use this exact same tactic to impose"" policies opposed by Republicans. ""I will wait to see what statutory or constitutional power the president relies on to justify such a declaration before making any definitive statement. ""But I am sceptical it will be something I can support."" Senator Lindsey Graham Axios has compiled this handy list,externalof what Republicans have been saying about Mr Trump's plan. Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins thronged by media at the US Congress Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican representative, has shared a statement criticising the President's decision. In it, she says that she shares his concern about the border - but says the emergency could set a dangerous precedent for future presidents to act alone, undermining the constitution.

Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, a cadre of outspoken young progressives led by New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have already stated their opposition in advance of a scheduled Thursday night vote because they donât like the increased funding for immigration enforcement. The two parties are being pulled in opposite directions â and away from common ground. And those most in tune to the sentiments of the political base, those with higher political ambitions, are among those leading the charge. For the moment these ""no"" votes are symbolic, since the bill is expected to pass anyway. There will come a time, however, when the margins are much narrower â and the balance between principle and pragmatism will be truly tested. For the moment, the scale seems tilted to the former.

Amazon cancels New York campus planThe internet giant hit local opposition over the roughly $3bn in subsidies it had been promised.Business,"Incentives promised to Amazon angered opponents Amazon has said it will not build a new headquarters in New York, citing fierce opposition from state and local politicians. The dramatic turnabout comes just months afterthe firm named New York Cityone of two sites selected for major expansion over the next decades. City and state leaders had agreed to provide about $3bn (Â£2.3bn) in incentives to secure that investment. Those subsidies had prompted fierce backlash in some quarters. Amazon said its plans to build a new headquarters required ""positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long term"". It said: ""A number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project we and many others envisioned. ""We are disappointed to have reached this conclusion."" In November, Amazon announced plans to invest about $2.5bn and add more than 25,000 ""high-paying"" jobs at campuses in New York and near Washington DC over the next two decades. The news capped a 14-month search for a new site that sawcities and towns across North America competing to woo the e-commerce giant. Long Island City, where Amazon was planning expansion, is one of the fastest growing areas in New York In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill DeBlasio championed the project, which Amazon said would generate more than $10bn in new tax revenue in New York. Polls had found that a majority of New Yorkers also supported Amazon's plan. However, it drew opposition from unions, members of the City Council and others, including newly elected Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, angry over the billions in incentives promised to one of the world's most valuable companies. The risk of rising rents, which have spurred tensions in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, were also a concern. Opponents celebrated Amazon's decision on Thursday. Allow Twitter content?

""When our community fights together, anything is possible, even when we're up against the biggest corporation in the world,"" Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer said. ""Defeating an unprecedented act of corporate welfare is a triumph that should change the way we do economic development deals in our city and state forever."" Amazon supporters said the critics were short-sighted.  They said they were worried about the long-term economic consequences as populist messages appear to gain traction. ""The New York Senate has done tremendous damage,"" Gov Cuomo said. ""They should be held accountable for this lost economic opportunity."" Amazon currently employs more than 5,000 people across New York City. It said it expected its staff numbers in the region to continue to grow. The firm said it would not look for an alternative headquarters site, but would move forward as planned at the site near the Pentagon in Northern Virginia. It will also distribute its growth across its offices in the US and Canada. Amazon is also due to receive incentives for the new campus in Virginia, but that package, which is less generous than the one promised in New York, has been less controversial. Frank Raffaele owns Coffeed, a small chain of coffee shops that started in Long Island City, the neighbourhood where Amazon was expected to expand. He said he was disappointed the project had been dropped over ""political posturing"". ""This was transformative for New York and the fact that it's not going to happen anymore is extremely sad,"" he said. ""This was our chance to shine."" By Natalie Sherman, BBC News, New York Amazon may have expected its search for ""HQ2"" to go smoothly. After all, the firm has won billions in incentives from cities and states, and plenty of good PR, over the last decades by promising jobs at its warehouses. Now it was offering a headquarters. But the subsidies that local officials have lavished on corporations like Amazon in recent years have tested the public's patience. And opponents especially questioned the need to use such incentives to spur expansion in Long Island City - one of the fastest-growing areas of one of the country's most successful cities. Polls showed support among the public, but Amazon, which prides itself on being a nimble business despite its size, didn't become a giant by embracing battles with the potential to tarnish its consumer-focused brand. All the more reason to back away.

Jurors later heard how the accused's mother called police after learning her son had left the family home in the early hours of 2 July. She had watched CCTV footage from cameras installed at their home. The 54-year-old told the court her son had been at home drinking with friends and she had argued with him over damage caused to furniture. She thought he had then gone to bed. The following day she helped search for Alesha and later checked her CCTV system which covered the front and back of her home. She had installed the CCTV as a precaution when her mother, who suffered from dementia, had lived with her. The court heard the boy had ""gone out, come back, gone out and come back again"" in the early hours of 2 July. Jurors were shown footage in which she identified her son leaving their home at 01:54 on 2 July, wearing all black, and returning at 03:35 no longer wearing his black top. At 03:44, a light is turned on in the bathroom and he is seen leaving a minute later wearing only shorts and carrying an item. The mother said she told her son about the footage and asked him why he was out, to which he said: ""I don't know, I might have been looking for my phone."" She asked him if he knew anything about the missing girl. ""He was lying sleeping,"" she said. ""I asked 'have you seen this little girl - do you or your friends know anything?' ""He said 'no' then just rolled back over. ""We were trying to explain to him that whoever done this would have left DNA. He was not sure what DNA was. ""He was adamant he had nothing to do with it. There was no way they would find his DNA because he had been nowhere near this little girl."" His mother later phoned police to ""eliminate"" her son from inquiries, saying: ""Obviously I really didn't think he had anything to do with it whatsoever."" She described her son as being ""clever at maths"", ""well-liked"" and said he had ""lots of friends"". The court heard the boy later claimed to his mother he had gone out in the early hours to ""buy weed"". Further CCTV footage showed the boy out at about 04:00 shining a torch before running off from his home. His mother was also shown a knife found on the shore of Bute during the murder inquiry. She accepted it was ""very similar"" to knives found in a set at her home. Meanwhile witness Alexander McLachlan contacted police after watching CCTV footage from outside his Bute home in the early hours of 2 July. He told the court it showed ""someone walking as if carrying something"" on the shoreline. Mr McLachlan said: ""I presumed that it was someone carrying a child."" The accused has also been charged with attempting to hide evidence. He has claimed it was Toni McLachlan, the partner of Alesha's father, who killed her. During her evidence to the court on Wednesday, Ms McLachlan insisted she had nothing to do with Alesha's death, telling jurors: ""I loved her to pieces."" The trial, before Lord Matthews, continues. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

Shoreham pilot has 'no memory' of tragedy,"Andrew Hill denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence The pilot of a vintage fighter jet has told a court he has no memory of his plane crashing at the Shoreham Airshow or of the days leading up to it. Andrew Hill said he had no memory from three days before the crash to when he woke from a coma the following month. The 54-year-old told the Old Bailey he had spent the last three years ""trying to resolve what happened"". He denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence when his Hawker Hunter jet crashed on 22 August 2015. The court has heard 11 men were killed in the crash on the A27 after Mr Hill failed to complete an aerobatic manoeuvre. As he gave evidence for the second day, Mr Hill, from Sandon in Hertfordshire, said he had no memory of taking off on the day of the crash, or any part of the display. ""Probably most of the last three years have been spent trying on earth to resolve what happened,"" he told jurors. Asked by Karim Khalil QC, defending, if this had been easy, he replied: ""No, because it caused a dreadful tragedy to a lot of people. ""I was the pilot, I was in charge of the aircraft."" The court has heard Mr Hill was performing a ""bent loop"" manoeuvre when the jet crashed Mr Hill later told the court: ""I don't know what I did. I know what the aircraft did."" Footage of the flight from inside the jet shown to the jury showed the aircraft lining up with the road. Asked if that made any sense, Mr Hill said: ""No."" Mr Hill also said: ""I don't accept I was doing a loop."" And questioned if he knew what he was doing, Mr Hill said: ""It doesn't fit into a classic manoeuvre."" Shoreham pilot denies thrill-seeking Errors made during Shoreham re-enactment Shoreham pilot 'fundamentally negligent' He also noted that the plane was not being ""particularly well flown"" and was ""not being controlled properly"". Watching the moment when the aircraft reduced power, Mr Hill said: ""It's the last thing you would want to do."" Asked if he had any explanation, Mr Hill said: ""None at all."" Jurors were told that upon impact with the ground, the pilot's seat ejected, and Mr Hill from it, in what is called ""seat separation"". The court was told that immediately after the crash Mr Hill was asked what happened and he said he did not know. Mr Hill was thrown from the cockpit of the Hawker Hunter after it crashed Asked if he had felt unwell beforehand, Mr Hill said ""yes"", jurors heard. Mr Hill told the court that if he had felt unwell before the flight he would not have flown. Jurors also heard a paramedic said the pilot had told him he had some pain in his chest and also told him ""at some point he blacked out"". Reading a statement by Mr Hill in 2017, his defence counsel quoted him as saying ""people lost their lives as a direct result of an accident I was involved in"". Asked if he had continued to think like this, Mr Hill told the court: ""Yes, it's the dominant thought of my life."" Earlier, the court heard how Mr Hill had ""embarrassed"" himself by flying too close to the crowd at the Southport air show in 2014. He recalled having a ""nasty dawning moment"", but managed to turn his plane around, ending the display shortly before being ordered to by controllers on the ground. The prosecution has also accused him of another breach in procedure at Shoreham Airshow in 2014. The court was told he flew over Lancing College, near the airport, despite it being prohibited, but Mr Hill denied this had happened. However, jurors heard him agree that a video from a camera fitted in his cockpit made it look like he had. The trial continues.

Philip will not be prosecuted over crash,"The Duke of Edinburgh will not face prosecution over his road crash near the Sandringham estate, the Crown Prosecution Service has said. The 97-year-old voluntarily gave up his driving licence on Saturday after hisLand Rover Freelander collided with another vehiclein Norfolk last month. He later apologised to the occupants of the other car - two women and a baby. The CPS says it decided that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute the duke. Chris Long, Chief Crown Prosecutor from CPS East of England, said: ""We took into account all of the circumstances in this case, including the level of culpability, the age of the driver and the surrender of the driving licence."" Prince Philip, 97, gives up driving licence Is age a factor behind the wheel? The duke escaped injury after his vehicle landed on its side following the collision with a Kia on 17 January on the A149 near the Queen's country estate. Two days later Norfolk Police gave him ""suitable words of advice"" afterhe was pictured driving without a seat belt. He wrote to one of the passengers in the Kia - Emma Fairweather, who broke her wrist in the accident. In the letter, dated 21 January andreproduced by the Sunday Mirror,external, the duke acknowledged the ""very distressing experience"". ""I would like you to know how very sorry I am for my part in the accident,"" he wrote, on Sandringham House headed paper. ""The sun was shining low over the main road. In normal conditions I would have no difficulty in seeing traffic coming... but I can only imagine that I failed to see the car coming, and I am very contrite about the consequences."" Ms Fairweather had previously criticised the duke for a lack of communication following the crash. Witnesses described how they saw the Land Rover roll and end up on the other side of the road. One man, who helped free the duke from his car, said he sawthe vehicle ""careering"" across the road. This video can not be played Prince Philip was 94 when he drove the Obamas and his wife, the Queen The duke, who is four months short of his 98th birthday, famously drove the Obamas when the then-US president and First Lady visited Windsor in 2016.

Airbus scraps A380 giant jet as sales slump,"European aircraft manufacturer Airbus has pulled the plug on its struggling A380 superjumbo, which entered service just 12 years ago. Airbus said last deliveries of the world's largest passenger aircraft, which cost about $25bn (Â£19.4bn) to develop, would be made in 2021. The decision comes after Emirates, the largest A380 customer, cut its order. The A380 faced fierce competition from smaller, more efficient aircraft and has never made a profit. The A380's future had been in doubt for several years as orders dwindled. Butin a statement,externalon Thursday, Airbus said the ""painful"" decision to end production was made after Emirates reduced its latest order. The Dubai-based airline is cutting its overall A380 fleet size from 162 to 123. Emirates said it would take delivery of 14 further A380s over the next two years, but has also ordered 70 of Airbus' smaller A330 and A350 models. ""Emirates has been a staunch supporter of the A380 since its very inception,"" said the airlines' chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum. ""While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the programme could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,"" he added. Why did the Airbus A380 fail? The order cut meant keeping production going was not viable, said Airbus chief executive Tom Enders, who is due to step down in April. There was ""no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years"" he said. Airbus has taken a â¬463m charge for shutdown costs, but it is expected that the repayment of government loans could be waived to help cushion the blow. The aerospace giant said the financial impact of the decision was ""largely embedded"" in the firm's 2018 results, which showed a net profit for 2018 of â¬3bn (Â£2.6bn) up nearly 30% from the previous year. Airbus said it would deliver between 880 and 890 new commercial aircraft this year. Airbus employs 6,000 people at its main wings factory at Broughton in Flintshire Airbus said it would start discussions with partners regarding the ""3,000 to 3,500 positions potentially impacted over the next three years"". The BBC understands that around 200 jobs in the UK could be under threat from the decision. Airbus confirmed it hopes to redeploy a ""significant"" number of affected staff to other projects. Mr Enders said: ""It needs to be evaluated. It's clear we make a lot of wings in Britain and a few wings for the A380. ""Hopefully we can redeploy a significant number of our employees there and re-use also the infrastructure."" Airbus UK makes the wings for its wide variety of aircraft in the UK. The company employs about 6,000 staff at its main wings factory at Broughton in Flintshire, as well as 3,000 at Filton, near Bristol, where wings are designed and supported. Parts of the A380 are manufactured in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, with final assembly and finishing split between Toulouse and Hamburg. Airbus had already cut staffing as A380 orders dried up, and the future of employment at the company very much now depends on the success of its new generation of aircraft. Unite, the largest union representing aerospace workers in the UK and Ireland, said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the news, adding it would seek ""urgent assurances"" from Airbus that there would be no job losses because of the decision. ""We are of the firm belief that with a full order book in single aisle planes, such as the A320, that our members affected can be redeployed on to other work in Airbus,"" said Rhys McCarthy, Unite's national officer for aerospace. The spacious jet, which had its first commercial flight in 2007 with Singapore Airlines, was popular with passengers but it was complicated and expensive to build, in part thanks to the way production was spread across various locations. But ultimately demand for the A380 from airlines dried up as the industry shifted away from larger planes in favour of smaller, wide-body jets. When Airbus was conceiving the A380, Boeing was also considering plans for a superjumbo. But the US company decided to scrap the idea in favour of its smaller, efficient - and more successful - 787 Dreamliner. ""The very clear trend in the market is to operate long-haul aircraft with two engines [such as] Boeing's 787 and 777, and Airbus's A330 and A350,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of Flight Global. Airbus had been working on a revamped A380 to make it more efficient, but needed sufficient launch orders to make the huge investment viable. Despite Airbus' website describing the Airbus as the ""future of long-distance travel"" the last aircraft will be delivered in 2021. Analysis: By Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter When Airbus's A380 first took off it was hailed as a technological marvel that would meet airlines' needs for a new large aircraft to connect the world's crowded airport hubs - London, New York, Dubai, Tokyo. Airbus said the market for the giant planes would be 1,500. After today's decision to end production, it will have made just over 250. In hindsight, airlines were already turning their back on very large aircraft when the A380 made its debut. Advances in engine technology meant planes no longer needed four engines to fly long distances - and carriers were able to use a new generation of light, fuel-efficient, twin-engined aircraft to link secondary cities, bypassing the crowded hubs altogether. Even though Airbus was aware of the threat posed by these new types of plane, they pressed ahead. There was a bigger game afoot - Airbus needed to negate Boeing's 747, believing that the profits the American company made on 747 sales were helping it cross-subsidise other, smaller planes. The A380 succeeded in that - the last passenger 747 was built two years ago - but Boeing will have a kind of last laugh. Freighter versions of the 747 will be built past 2021, meaning the venerable jumbo jet will outlive the plane sent to kill it. Why did the Airbus A380 fail?

Abortion advice row after Call the Midwife,"Call the Midwife has won praise for tackling sensitive issues The BBC has been criticised for not linking directly to information on abortion after the issue was dealt with in an episode of Call the Midwife. Doctors, midwives and pro-choice charities highlighted the issue after the BBC's Action Line website was advertised after the programme aired. Excluding abortion was ""stigmatising"", they said. The BBC said while it does not link to campaign groups there was no reason not to link to abortion advice. A spokesperson said: ""Abortion is a controversial subject across the UK, but there's no reason why the BBC cannot link to advice sites which provide information on it."" It said some groups may not be selected for Action Line links because they are ""campaigning organisations"". The episode of Call the Midwife, broadcast on 3 February, featured Jeannie, who found herself unexpectedly pregnant with her third child. Refused a legal termination, she paid an illegal provider and died from an infection. After the episode, viewers were directed to the BBC's Action Line if they had been affected by the issues raised. In the episode, Jeannie Tennant did not want a third child A joint letter,externalfrom the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Marie Stopes UK, the sexual health advice service Brook and the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) praised the programme for having ""repeatedly handled this issue sensitively and courageously"". But they said that people visiting the Action Line website found that abortion was not explicitly mentioned. Instead, there was a link to information about pregnancy on the NHS website - which features abortion information elsewhere. The healthcare organisations called on the BBC to include links to evidence-based information about terminations. Katherine O'Brien, head of policy and research at BPAS, said it was ""highly stigmatising to the women we care for and to the doctors and midwives who provide them with care"" to treat abortion differently from other medical procedures."" She said it was ""inadequate"" to expect women to search the NHS website after being directed to Action Line at the end of the programme. The1967 Abortion Act,externalestablished legal abortion in most of the UK, but in Northern Irelandterminations are only permitted when a woman's life is at riskor if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. John Deighan, deputy CEO of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, an anti-abortion group, said the Action Line site was right not to include links on abortion. He said: ""The issues raised in the 'Call the Midwife' programme are controversial. I can understand reservations over which helpline numbers would have been appropriate to provide."" Call the Midwife has previously won plaudits for tackling issues such asfemale genital mutilation,cleft lips and palates, andsickle cell disease.

"Patisserie Valerie rescue saves 2,000 jobs","Patisserie Valerie is being bought out of administration in a deal that will save nearly 2,000 jobs. The management team at the coffee and cake chain has secured backing from investment firm Causeway Capital to take over 96 shops. Sister brand Philpotts has also been sold in a separate deal, saving a further 21 stores. Collectively the chains fetched Â£13m - a fraction of what the group was once worth. Patisserie Valerie's parent company, Patisserie Holdings, collapsed in January following an accounting scandal. Patisserie Valerie's chief executive, Steve Francis, who is leading the management team buy-out, said the move would end ""a disruptive period of uncertainty for the business"" and provide the foundation for ""an exciting future"". Matt Scaife, a partner at Dublin-based Causeway Capital, said Patisserie Valerie was a ""much loved"" heritage brand that his firm looked forward to helping return to growth. Luke Johnson, until recently the firm's chairman and biggest shareholder, said: ""While I'm naturally deeply disappointed at the events that led us to this point, I wish the company well."" Is your Patisserie Valerie branch closing? Patisserie Valerie scandal worse than thought Patisserie Valerie staff 'not being paid' The mysterious Madame Valerie revealed The entrepreneur, whose stake in the group was worth Â£165m back in October, will no longer be involved in the business. Mr Francis told the Financial Times that he and other managers would own ""more than the usual 10% [of Patisserie Valerie], but nowhere near control"". Another subsidiary, Baker & Spice, is still seeking a buyer but Patisserie Holdings said there had been ""strong interest"". Patisserie Valerie was plunged into crisis in October when accounting irregularities were uncovered. It hired KPMG to try to salvage the brand which dates back nearly 100 years. KPMG closed 70 outlets, with the loss of 920 jobs. Restructuring talks broke down in January, leaving no option but administration. The Serious Fraud Office is carrying out a criminal investigation into Patisserie Valerie and finance director Chris Marshwas arrested and released on bail after having been suspendedby the company. Also under investigation, by the Financial Reporting Council, are former Patisserie Valerie auditors Grant Thornton. The first Patisserie Valerie opened in Soho in 1926, established by Belgian husband and wife team Theo and Esther Vermeirsch. Esther, born Esther van Gyseghem, became known as Madame Valerie. The chain expanded rapidly across the UK after entrepreneur Luke Johnson invested in the brand in 2006.

Call for louder tram horns after man's death,"A man died at Saughton tram stop in Edinburgh last year Rail investigators have called for louder warning horns to be fitted to Edinburgh trams following the death of a pedestrian. Carlos Correa Palacio, 53, died in September after being hit at the Saughton tram stop in Broomhouse Drive. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has advised Edinburgh Trams Limited to increase the sound pressure levels of the horns. The company said it was modifying the horns and testing was under way. Mr Palacio suffered serious injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident on 11 September - the first fatality directly involving a Scottish tram since 1959. Carlos Correa Palacio died after being hit by a tram in Edinburgh Previous recent accidents have been linked to the tram tracks rather than trams themselves. The RAIB published safety advice in an interim report on Thursday having investigated the accident. The agency found that the warning horn was up to eight decibels short of the levels specified by guidance - meaning it was not suitably noticeable above background noise. Investigators said the tram driver saw Mr Palacio approaching the crossing and applied the service brake to reduce the tram's speed, as well as sounding repeated warnings using the tram's bell. They said Mr Palacio did not respond to the audible warnings and continued onto the crossing. It is reported the driver then operated the emergency brake - which automatically activated the warning horn - before arriving at the crossing. It was concluded the tram was too close to be able to stop before reaching it. The tram's speed at the time of the collision was approximately 31mph (50kmph). The maximum line speed at this Saughton stop section is about 43mph (70kmph). The RAIB safety advice reads: ""Edinburgh Trams Limited is advised to increase the sound pressure level of the warning horn fitted to its trams. ""In the meantime, it should consider measures to mitigate risks at locations where audible warnings may be required. ""In particular, consideration should be given to the appropriateness of the current warning horn or bell as a method of warning to pedestrians using footpath crossings over off-street track sections with high line speeds."" Edinburgh tram extension cost soars to Â£207m Edinburgh's trams see passenger numbers jump 10% Edinburgh Trams Limited said modifications to warning horns are being implemented across their fleet. A spokeswoman for Edinburgh Trams said: ""When Edinburgh Trams commenced passenger service in May 2014 we were satisfied that suitable and sufficient testing of the audible warning horn had been undertaken. ""We want to provide a safe tramway for our customers and take cognisance of the notice issued today by the RAIB. ""We continue to work with the RAIB and do not wish to predetermine the outcomes of their final report which is expected in the spring.""

LiveMPs debate Brexit,"MPs vote to reject a government motion on Brexit Some Brexiteers were unhappy with it, saying it implies support for ruling out a no-deal Brexit Amendments put forward by Labour and the SNP were also rejected Tory MP Anna Soubry decided not to push her amendment to a vote It would have called on ministers to publish certain no-deal briefing papers Sophie Morris and Richard Morris The UK formally suspends trade talks with Canada, the first time it has done so with a potential partner since Brexit. The defeat by 45 votes has no legal force but No 10 had warned it would make the PM's EU talks more difficult. Theresa May has suffered a fresh defeat in a vote in the Commons on her approach to Brexit strategy by 303 to 258. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called on the prime minister after the debate ended to ""admit her Brexit strategy has failed"". Tory Brexiteer rebels abstained, saying the government's motion implied a no-deal Brexit would be ruled out when it came to negotiations with the EU. Ministers said that was not the case but defeat would make life more difficult for the PM as she discussed the future of her deal with the EU. Analysis Five Conservative MPs demonstrated that they do not back the government's current Brexit strategy this evening by voting against the government's main Brexit motion. Peter Bone, Sir Christopher Chope, Anne Marie Morris, Sarah Wollaston and Philip Hollobone all rebelled against the government, with 66 further Conservative MPs abstaining from the vote. The DUP voted with the government, while four Labour MPs rebelled and a further four abstained. The government was defeated on the main Brexit motion by 303 votes to 258, a majority of 45. In the earlier vote on the SNP's amendment which sought to postpone the Brexit date by at least three months, two Conservative MPs, Ken Clarke and Sarah Wollaston, defied the government and voted to extend Article 50. A further nine Conservative MPs abstained from voting on this amendment. The SNP's amendment was defeated by 315 votes to 93, a government majority of 222. Theresa May has suffered a fresh defeat in a Commons vote on her Brexit strategy, losing by 303 to 258. Sky News political correspondent tweets Allow Twitter content?

Labour unity call amid split rumours,"This video can not be played Chris Leslie: ""I certainly feel like we are being played like fools by the leadership of the Labour party."" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has urged his party's MPs to stay united amid speculation some might leave over dissatisfaction with Jeremy Corbyn. Asked if a breakaway was ""unstoppable"", Mr Watson said: ""I hope it isn't."" Some MPs are frustrated at Mr Corbyn's refusal to back a further Brexit referendum, despite a vote at the party conference to keep the option open. Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie told MPs backbenchers were ""being played for fools"" by the leadership. ""The idea that the Labour party is not together and arguing against this disaster is, for me, entirely heartbreaking,"" he said, during the latest Brexit debate in the Commons. He pointed out an amendment tabled by Mr Corbyn, which attempts to ensure MPs are given a vote on Theresa May's deal by 27 February, makes no specific mention of a further referendum with the option of remaining in the EU. ""Why are we regressing on our policy passed at the September conference?,"" he asked. Could Brexit cause a Labour split? Labour's Brexit tribes What's behind Corbyn's Brexit letter to May? Earlier, Treasury spokesman Clive Lewis had told pro-EU activists the ramifications ""will be severe"" if Labour is seen to facilitate a ""Tory Brexit"". ""We are now sending some mixed messages out there and that is dangerous,"" he said. And backbencher Angela Smith told BBC Look North backbench MPs were uncomfortable with the leader's stances on a number of issues. ""We are being pushed to the edge on Brexit, on Venezuela, on anti-Semitism, and it's for Jeremy Corbyn... to show the Labour party is a broad church,"" she said. Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn in the Commons But Mr Watson told BBC Radio 4's World At One: ""I want this party to stay together. People should stay and fight their corner. We need an electorally viable Labour Party."" He said people should ""do everything they can"" to stop a breakaway. ""For the last two years, I've been trying to hold everyone together. I think we need all voices round the top table of the Labour Party. We need all factions represented. People expect the Labour Party to be united."" Another who attended the Another Europe is Possible event, Rachael Maskell, played down the threat of a breakaway. She said Labour MPs had a responsibility to focus on getting into government. ""Noises off do not help our party to achieve that,"" she added. By BBC Political Correspondent Iain Watson Some people close to the Labour leadership believe a breakaway is all but inevitable - but that it will be small. This is partly because the anti-Corbyn forces aren't entirely united. None of the people at the pro-referendum event addressed by Clive Lewis will break away even though some are very unhappy with the party's Brexit stance. They are on the left. And other pro-Europeans from the Blair/Brown era who are minded to go aren't united on timing. For them, there has to be a series of triggers first: Jeremy Corbyn has to be seen, as it were, to be the midwife of Brexit He has to be perceived as not tackling  anti-Semitism robustly enough If not all the triggers are pulled, some MPs in this group will stay put. Then we have a cluster of politicians who really really dislike Jeremy Corbyn - and quite a few are potentially facing de-selection by their local parties. But some are Eurosceptic and would have difficulty joining a pro-EU breakaway. So it may be more likely that people initially resign the whip rather than conjure up a whole new party.

How amendments could alter Brexit process,"MPs are trying to influence the Brexit process in a number of ways, as Theresa May continues her bid to get the EU to change the deal. The prime minister has asked MPs to approve a motion on Thursday simply acknowledging that process is ongoing and restating their support for the approach. Several MPs tabled amendments setting out alternative plans and Commons Speaker John Bercow has selected three to be put to a Commons vote. Even if they won the backing of a majority of MPs, the proposals would not be binding on the government. However, they could put pressure on Mrs May to change course. She has adopted proposals from two successful backbench amendments tabled in January. One asked her to seek alternatives to the""backstop"",which aims to prevent the return of customs checkpoints on the Irish border in the event that no trade deal has come into force. The other rejected leaving the EUwithout a formal exit deal. The selected proposals are below. Use our guide to Brexit jargon or follow the links for further explanation.

Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn's amendment was defeated by 322 votes to 306, giving the government a majority of 16. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, centre, tabled the amendment on behalf of his party Sought to postpone the Brexit date by at least three months. This had the backing of Liberal Democrats, as well as the SNP contingent. However, most Labour MPs abstained and so the amendment was defeated by 93 votes to 315. Anna Soubry's amendment had the backing of Labour MPs including Chris Leslie, left, and Chuka Umunna, right Instructed the government to publish within seven days ""the most recent official briefing document relating to business and trade on the implications of a no-deal Brexit presented to cabinet"". This had the backing of some mostly Remain-supporting Labour and Conservative backbenchers. But Ms Soubry withdrew the amendment after Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris indicated that Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington would meet her and would be publishing the relevant information. Ms Soubry welcomed the move but said she reserved the right to lay the amendment again at end of February if the government did not publish the documents.

MPs voting on May's Brexit strategy,"MPs are voting on whether to back the government's Brexit strategy. They have rejected a Labour call for another vote on the withdrawal deal by 27 February by 322 votes to 306. The Commons also rejected an SNP call to delay Brexit by at least three months by 315 votes to 93 votes, after Labour abstained in the vote. Conservative backbencher Anna Soubry has withdrawn her amendment calling for official papers on the impact of a no-deal Brexit to be published. Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris indicated that Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington would meet Ms Soubry and would be publishing some information. Ms Soubry welcomed the move and said she reserved the right to lay the amendment again at end of February. The Labour amendment called for a vote on the withdrawal deal by 27 February, or for the government to allow Parliament to decide what happens next. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer had argued that would ""ensure a hard stop"" to prevent the prime minister ""running down the clock"" in a bid to force MPs to back her deal.

The government has warned a rebellion could damage the prime minister's negotiating position, as she seeks to make changes to the controversial backstop ""insurance policy"" in the deal to avoid customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. During Thursday's debate, former Brexit secretary David Davis urged Mr Barclay to be ""clear"" about whether the UK would still be leaving the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. Mr Barclay confirmed that it would but was challenged by Lib Dem MP Tom Brake about why he was respecting one Commons vote, but not the other. Mr Barclay replied that the Commons ""has said two different things"" as it had also passed legislation to say the UK would leave the EU on 29 March, ""by a large margin"" adding: ""The legislation frankly takes precedence over that motion.""

Ms Greening, a former education secretary who backs another EU referendum, described this approach as ""fundamentally wrong and anti-democratic"". Fellow Conservative Dame Caroline Spelman said ""equal respect"" must be given to both Commons motions adding: ""If he fails to do that, it is contemptuous of this House."" And Father of the House Ken Clarke said it was ""ridiculous"" to stick with the ""arbitrary"" 29 March departure date if no deal was in place. But DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said taking ""no deal"" off the table would weaken the UK's negotiating position: ""So those who call for no deal to be taken off the table are actually playing into the hands of the possibility of a no deal."" And Tory backbencher Peter Bone told MPs: ""The truth is that a no-deal Brexit, which of course is a deal coming out on WTO rules, is the answer. It gives clarity to business and it delivers what the British people voted for in June 2016."" Mr Barclay said the government's priority was to secure a deal and said: ""The only way to avoid 'no deal' is either to secure a deal on the terms the prime minister has set out... the only other option would be to revoke Article 50 (the process by which the UK will leave the EU)."" For Labour, Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister was ""pretending to make progress while running down the clock"".

MPs voting on Brexit next steps,"MPs are voting on whether to back the government's Brexit strategy. They have rejected a Labour call for another vote on the withdrawal deal by 27 February by 322 votes to 306. The Commons also rejected an SNP call to delay Brexit by at least three months by 315 votes to 93 votes, after Labour abstained in the vote. Conservative backbencher Anna Soubry has withdrawn her amendment calling for official papers on the impact of a no-deal Brexit to be published. Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris indicated that Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington would meet Ms Soubry and would be publishing some information. Ms Soubry welcomed the move and said she reserved the right to lay the amendment again at end of February. The Labour amendment called for a vote on the withdrawal deal by 27 February, or for the government to allow Parliament to decide what happens next. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer had argued that would ""ensure a hard stop"" to prevent the prime minister ""running down the clock"" in a bid to force MPs to back her deal.

LIVE: MPs debate Brexit How amendments could alter Brexit process Labour unity call amid split rumours Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide But that has angered some Tory Brexiteers as MPs backed two motions on 29 January - one seeking an alternative to the controversial ""backstop"" element of the withdrawal deal and another one backing for a separate move to stop Brexit happening without a formal deal.

The government has warned a rebellion could damage the prime minister's negotiating position, as she seeks to make changes to the controversial backstop ""insurance policy"" in the deal to avoid customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. During Thursday's debate, former Brexit secretary David Davis urged Mr Barclay to be ""clear"" about whether the UK would still be leaving the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. Mr Barclay confirmed that it would but was challenged by Lib Dem MP Tom Brake about why he was respecting one Commons vote, but not the other. Mr Barclay replied that the Commons ""has said two different things"" as it had also passed legislation to say the UK would leave the EU on 29 March, ""by a large margin"" adding: ""The legislation frankly takes precedence over that motion."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Ms Greening, a former education secretary who backs another EU referendum, described this approach as ""fundamentally wrong and anti-democratic"". Fellow Conservative Dame Caroline Spelman said ""equal respect"" must be given to both Commons motions adding: ""If he fails to do that, it is contemptuous of this House."" And Father of the House Ken Clarke said it was ""ridiculous"" to stick with the ""arbitrary"" 29 March departure date if no deal was in place. But DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said taking ""no deal"" off the table would weaken the UK's negotiating position: ""So those who call for no deal to be taken off the table are actually playing into the hands of the possibility of a no deal."" And Tory backbencher Peter Bone told MPs: ""The truth is that a no-deal Brexit, which of course is a deal coming out on WTO rules, is the answer. It gives clarity to business and it delivers what the British people voted for in June 2016."" Mr Barclay said the government's priority was to secure a deal and said: ""The only way to avoid 'no deal' is either to secure a deal on the terms the prime minister has set out... the only other option would be to revoke Article 50 (the process by which the UK will leave the EU)."" For Labour, Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister was ""pretending to make progress while running down the clock"". And he expressed anger at the ""macho way"" some Brexiteers talked about ""marching off the cliff"" without a deal and said he would ""take whatever steps are necessary"" to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

He pointed out an amendment tabled by Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, to ensure MPs get a vote on Theresa May's deal by 27 February, makes no mention of a further referendum with the option of remaining in the EU. ""The idea that the Labour Party is not together and arguing against this disaster is, for me, entirely heartbreaking,"" he said.

Deadliest Kashmir militant attack in years,"This video can not be played The blast took place on a heavily guarded highway At least 40 Indian paramilitary police have been killed in a bomb attack by militants on their convoy in Indian-administered Kashmir. Police told the BBC that a car filled with explosives had rammed a bus carrying the troops to Srinagar. Pakistan-based Islamist group Jaish-e-Mohammad said it was behind the attack. It is the deadliest militant attack on Indian forces in Kashmir since the insurgency against Indian rule began in 1989. The funerals driving youth to militancy Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Kashmir territories - full profile India has called for international sanctions against Jaish-e-Mohammad's leader, Masood Azhar. Pakistan said the attack was a matter of ""grave concern"" but rejected suggestions that it was responsible for it. Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir but only control parts of it. The blast took place on the heavily guarded Srinagar-Jammu highway about 20km (12 miles) from the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir, Srinagar. Indian media reports said that at about 15:15 local time (09:45 GMT) a car carrying between 300 and 350kg (660-770lb) of explosives struck a convoy of about 70 vehicles that was carrying about 2,500 troops to the Kashmir Valley. ""A car overtook the convoy and rammed into a bus with 44 personnel on board,"" a senior police official told BBC Urdu's Riyaz Masroor. The attack is the deadliest on Indian forces in disputed Kashmir for years The official said the death toll might increase because dozens were ""critically injured"". The highway had previously been closed for a week because of snow, reports said. AFP news agency said Jaish-e Mohammad had told local media it had carried out a suicide bombing. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has strongly condemned the attack. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By Ethirajan Anbarasan, BBC South Asia regional editor The Indian security establishment had been chest-thumping in recent months on how they managed to contain the insurgency. This attack though is a reminder the conflict is far from over. The incident could increase tensions between India and Pakistan. The Indian government had already pointed the finger at Pakistan for allegedly supporting militant groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad. Pakistan denies those accusations. Some blame India's Hindu nationalist BJP government for not initiating steps to start peace negotiations with Kashmiri groups and also with Pakistan. The Indian government faces a dilemma - any strong-arm tactics will further alienate the Kashmiri population. But not being seen to be doing anything on the ground will not augur well for Mr Modi, who is seeking re-election in a couple of months. There have been at least 10 suicide attacks since 1989 but this is only the second suicide attack to use a car. Prior to Thursday's bombing, the deadliest attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir this century came in 2002, when militants killed at least 31 people at an army base in Kaluchak near Jammu, most of them civilians and relatives of soldiers. At least 19 Indian soldiers were killed when militants stormed a base in Uri in 2016. Delhi blamed that attack on the Pakistani state, which denied any involvement. This video can not be played In December Yogita Limaye examined why there had been a rise in violence in Kashmir The latest attack also follows a spike in violence in Kashmir that came about after Indian forces killed a popular militant, 22-year-old Burhan Wani, in 2016. More than 500 people were killed in 2018 - including civilians, security forces and militants - the highest such toll in a decade. Is India losing Kashmir? Viewpoint: Will Pakistan mend its ways on terror? Pathankot attack: Pakistan arrests Jaish-e-Mohammad militants India and Pakistan have fought three wars and a limited conflict since independence from Britain in 1947 - all but one were over Kashmir. Started by cleric Masood Azhar in 2000, the group has been blamed for attacks on Indian soil in the past, including one in 2001 on the parliament in Delhi which took India and Pakistan to the brink of war. It is also said to have introduced suicide bombings in Kashmir, with the first such attack taking place in 2000. It has been designated a ""terrorist"" organisation by India, the UK, US and UN and has been banned in Pakistan since 2002. However Masood Azhar remains at large and is reportedly based in the Bahawalpur area in Pakistan's Punjab province. Previous Indian efforts to have him designated a terrorist by the UN have been blocked by China, an ally of Pakistan. India has also demanded his extradition from Pakistan but Islamabad has refused, citing a lack of proof. 2018: Kashmir's violent year.

"Mugger jailed for killing woman, 100","Artur Waszkiewicz had denied manslaughter and robbery but was found guilty on Wednesday A mugger who killed a 100-year-old widow in a handbag robbery has been jailed for 15 years. Zofija Kaczan suffered a broken neck in the attack and died of pneumonia brought on by her injuries on 6 June. Artur Waszkiewicz, 40, preyed on her as she walked to church near her home in Normanton, Derby. Judge Nicholas Dean QC said Waszkiewicz was a ""cowardly petty criminal"" whose dangerous attack had led to ""awful consequences"". Nazi prison camp survivor Mrs Kaczan was robbed near her home in Empress Road on 28 May 2018. During the sentencing hearing, Derby Crown Court heard Zofija Kaczan had been ""robbed of her life"" Heroin addict Waszkiewiczhad denied manslaughter and robbery but was found guiltyon Wednesday at Derby Crown Court. Judge Dean handed him 15 years for manslaughter and seven for robbery to run concurrently. Waszkiewicz has 24 previous convictions for 51 offences, including battery in 2014. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Defence QC David Nathan said he was ""not a monster"". But Judge Dean replied: ""What he is, is a cowardly petty criminal. ""What he did was dangerous. What he did led to awful, awful consequences."" This video can not be played Zofija Kaczan death: 100-year-old's killer caught on CCTV Addressing Waszkiewicz, Judge Dean said he had ""demonstrated arrogance"" during the trial. ""True to your nature as a petty criminal and heroin addict, this was opportunist crime of the meanest, most despicable type,"" he said. ""All this for modest gain and for you to satisfy your craving for heroin."" On the day of the bag-snatch, Waszkiewicz needed an ""easy target"" to steal from so he could meet a drug dealer and buy heroin. After spotting Polish-born Mrs Kaczan, he knocked her to the floor, took her handbag and left her to bleed in the middle of the road. Judge Dean added: ""There is tragic irony in the fact that Mrs Kaczan had survived the unimaginable horror of a Nazi concentration camp and slave labour, as well as imminent execution, only to meet her end because of the cowardly and sordid actions of a petty criminal and drug addict on the streets of Derby. ""Mrs Kaczan would not have wanted her life to be defined by the circumstances of her death. ""She had prayed for and forgiven her attacker which is testament to the good person she was."" Mrs Kaczan, described as a grandmother with a heart of gold, suffered multiple injuries in the attack Mrs Kaczan had been separated from her family during the war but had managed to ""find peace"" with her husband when she moved to Derby in 1948. Friend Anna Zimand told the BBC: ""You feel justice has been done and yet there is a degree of sadness."" Mrs Kaczan's carer Angelika Cybulska said she had planned to go on one final holiday with the 100-year-old. In a statement read by prosecutor Kate Brunner QC, Ms Cybulska said: ""Now she has gone it has taken a massive part of my heart away and I miss her daily. ""I am so distraught she had to die in this way."" A receipt with Artur Waszkiewicz's fingerprint on it was found in the stolen bag Police arrested Waszkiewicz, of Wolfa Street, Derby, after finding his fingerprint on a receipt in the handbag and spotting his Seat Leon car on CCTV at the crime scene. He attempted to cover his tracks in the days following the robbery - cleaning his car, drastically altering his appearance by cutting his hair and changing the insurance details on the car. Despite his efforts, the killer was arrested and was found hiding under a bed at his mother's home in London.

Trump - rout of IS imminent,"Donald Trump: ""Their land is gone"" US President Donald Trump has said territory held by the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could be ""100%"" liberated as early as next week. ""It should be announced, probably some time next week, that we will have 100% of the caliphate,"" he told a gathering of coalition partners. However, he also cautioned that he wanted to ""wait for the official word"". US military and intelligence officials say IS could stage a comeback without sustained counter-terrorism pressure. Families flee last IS village in Syria Trump rewrites US Syria policy After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Mr Trump shocked coalition allies in December when he declared that the group had been defeated, amid reports he wanted to pull out US soldiers within 30 days. But he later slowed the withdrawal after several resignations from key defence officials and strong criticism from Republicans and allies abroad. The global coalition against IS, now numbering nearly 80 nations, was formed in 2014 after the group overran swathes of territory and went on to launch terror attacks outside the region. ""Their land is gone,"" he told Wednesday's conference in Washington. ""The Isis [IS] caliphate has been decimated."" But the group still had ""tiny sections that can be so dangerous"", he said, and ""foreign fighters must not gain access"" to the US. US ground troops first became involved in Syria in 2015 He also referred to the IS propaganda machine, which recruited fighters from Europe and other regions. ""For a period of time they used the internet better than we did,"" he said. ""They used the internet brilliantly but now it's not so brilliant."" The US leader thanked coalition partners, saying, ""We will be working together for many years to come."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pledged the US would continue to fight IS, despite withdrawing troops from Syria. He called the troop pullout a ""tactical change... not a change in the mission"", and said the world was entering an ""era of decentralised jihad"". It has certainly lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks. A suspected IS member captured by US-backed forces near the Syrian border with Iraq last week On Tuesday the head of the US military's Central Command, Gen Joseph Votel, told a Senate committee up to 1,500 IS militants remained in a 20 sq mile (52 sq km) pocket on Syria's border with Iraq. 'IS attack' kills US troops in Syria The enduring appeal of violent jihad The group, he said, still had ""leaders, fighters, facilitators, resources and the profane ideology that fuels their efforts"". Meanwhile, a report by a US defence department watchdog cited Central Command as saying that without sustained pressure IS ""could likely resurge in Syria within six to 12 months"". Another challenge is what to do with the hundreds of foreign fighters captured by the SDF, as well as their families. Governments in their home countries are reluctant to take back radicalised militants who swore allegiance to Islamic State. By Barbara PlettUsher, BBCstate department correspondent President Trump's comments were more than a month late, as he did not consult his allies about his decision in December to withdraw US troops from Syria. The shock from the surprise announcement has settled, but coalition members want to know how this is going to play out. It's not clear that the administration has sorted that out. Both Mr Trump and Mike Pompeo called on other nations to take on more commitments for the continued campaign against the IS group, but said they were still in the fight - America would continue to lead it, Mr Pompeo said. Mr Trump had previously suggested that some of the troops in Syria could be moved to American bases in neighbouring Iraq, from where they could launch commando operations across the border as necessary. But there are still no official details about how the US will continue the counter-terrorism pressure Mr Trump's generals and intelligence officials have said is necessary to stop IS militants from staging a comeback.

The highway had previously been closed for a week because of snow, reports said. AFP news agency said Jaish-e Mohammad had told local media it had carried out a suicide bombing. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has strongly condemned the attack. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By Ethirajan Anbarasan, BBC South Asia regional editor The Indian security establishment had been chest-thumping in recent months on how they managed to contain the insurgency. This attack though is a reminder the conflict is far from over. The incident could increase tensions between India and Pakistan. The Indian government had already pointed the finger at Pakistan for allegedly supporting militant groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad. Pakistan denies those accusations. Some blame India's Hindu nationalist BJP government for not initiating steps to start peace negotiations with Kashmiri groups and also with Pakistan. The Indian government faces a dilemma - any strong-arm tactics will further alienate the Kashmiri population. But not being seen to be doing anything on the ground will not augur well for Mr Modi, who is seeking re-election in a couple of months. There have been at least 10 suicide attacks since 1989 but this is only the second suicide attack to use a car. Prior to Thursday's bombing, the deadliest attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir this century came in 2002, when militants killed at least 31 people at an army base in Kaluchak near Jammu, most of them civilians and relatives of soldiers. At least 19 Indian soldiers were killed when militants stormed a base in Uri in 2016. Delhi blamed that attack on the Pakistani state, which denied any involvement. This video can not be played In December Yogita Limaye examined why there had been a rise in violence in Kashmir The latest attack also follows a spike in violence in Kashmir that came about after Indian forces killed a popular militant, 22-year-old Burhan Wani, in 2016. More than 500 people were killed in 2018 - including civilians, security forces and militants - the highest such toll in a decade. Is India losing Kashmir? Viewpoint: Will Pakistan mend its ways on terror? Pathankot attack: Pakistan arrests Jaish-e-Mohammad militants India and Pakistan have fought three wars and a limited conflict since independence from Britain in 1947 - all but one were over Kashmir. Started by cleric Masood Azhar in 2000, the group has been blamed for attacks on Indian soil in the past, including one in 2001 on the parliament in Delhi which took India and Pakistan to the brink of war. It is also said to have introduced suicide bombings in Kashmir, with the first such attack taking place in 2000. It has been designated a ""terrorist"" organisation by India, the UK, US and UN and has been banned in Pakistan since 2002. However Masood Azhar remains at large and is reportedly based in the Bahawalpur area in Pakistan's Punjab province. Previous Indian efforts to have him designated a terrorist by the UN have been blocked by China, an ally of Pakistan. India has also demanded his extradition from Pakistan but Islamabad has refused, citing a lack of proof. 2018: Kashmir's violent year.

"Alesha, 6, had 'catastrophic' injuries","Alesha's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel on 2 July last year A pathologist has told the Alesha MacPhail murder trial that the six-year-old died after suffering ""catastrophic"" injuries. Dr John Williams said the cause of death was significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. He also told the court Alesha had 117 injuries, although some could have been caused by vegetation. A 16-year old boy denies abducting, raping and murdering the schoolgirl on the Isle of Bute. The accused cannot be named because he is under the age of 18. It is alleged that Alesha was taken from the home her grandparents shared with her father. Warning: The following contains details of Alesha's injuries Dr Williams was one of the pathologists who carried out the post-mortem examination on her body after she was found in woodland at a disused hotel on 2 July last year. Woman denies killing six-year-old Alesha Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman He told the High Court in Glasgow the injuries to Alesha's neck and face were consistent with being gripped, and those to her nose and mouth were consistent with smothering. He added it was also possible her windpipe was pushed shut. Dr Williams also said Alesha had ""catastrophic"" genital injuries, more severe than he had ever seen before. And he said Alesha's feet appeared to be uninjured which he agreed would be consistent with her being carried to the area. Jurors later heard how the accused's mother called police after learning her son had left the family home in the early hours of 2 July. She had watched CCTV footage from cameras installed at their home. The 54-year-old told the court her son had been at home drinking with friends and she had argued with him over damage caused to furniture. She thought he had then gone to bed. The following day she helped search for Alesha and later checked her CCTV system which covered the front and back of her home. She had installed the CCTV as a precaution when her mother, who suffered from dementia, had lived with her. The court heard the boy had ""gone out, come back, gone out and come back again"" in the early hours of 2 July. Jurors were shown footage in which she identified her son leaving their home at 01:54 on 2 July, wearing all black, and returning at 03:35 no longer wearing his black top. At 03:44, a light is turned on in the bathroom and he is seen leaving a minute later wearing only shorts and carrying an item. The mother said she told her son about the footage and asked him why he was out, to which he said: ""I don't know, I might have been looking for my phone."" She asked him if he knew anything about the missing girl. ""He was lying sleeping,"" she said. ""I asked 'have you seen this little girl - do you or your friends know anything?' ""He said 'no' then just rolled back over. ""We were trying to explain to him that whoever done this would have left DNA. He was not sure what DNA was. ""He was adamant he had nothing to do with it. There was no way they would find his DNA because he had been nowhere near this little girl."" His mother later phoned police to ""eliminate"" her son from inquiries, saying: ""Obviously I really didn't think he had anything to do with it whatsoever."" She described her son as being ""clever at maths"", ""well-liked"" and said he had ""lots of friends"". The court heard the boy later claimed to his mother he had gone out in the early hours to ""buy weed"". Further CCTV footage showed the boy out at about 04:00 shining a torch before running off from his home. His mother was also shown a knife found on the shore of Bute during the murder inquiry. She accepted it was ""very similar"" to knives found in a set at her home. Meanwhile witness Alexander McLachlan contacted police after watching CCTV footage from outside his Bute home in the early hours of 2 July. He told the court it showed ""someone walking as if carrying something"" on the shoreline. Mr McLachlan said: ""I presumed that it was someone carrying a child."" The accused has also been charged with attempting to hide evidence. He has claimed it was Toni McLachlan, the partner of Alesha's father, who killed her. During her evidence to the court on Wednesday, Ms McLachlan insisted she had nothing to do with Alesha's death, telling jurors: ""I loved her to pieces."" The trial, before Lord Matthews, continues. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

The Tonypandy riots saw troops sent to control striking miners who wrecked shops and mine owners' property. The wartime PM was voted the greatest Briton in a BBC poll in 2002. His grandson Sir Nicholas Soames described Mr McDonnell's remark as ""a very foolish and stupid thing to say"". The Conservative MPtold The Telegraph,external: ""I think my grandfather's reputation can withstand a publicity-seeking assault from a third-rate, Poundland Lenin. I don't think it will shake the world."" And the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The British public will reach its own judgement on this characterisation of Sir Winston Churchill."" The spokesman added that Theresa May had a portrait of Churchill hanging on the wall of her study in Number 10 and paid tribute to his ""strong leadership, determination and unwavering personality"" which ""inspired our country through our darkest hour"". Churchill riots memo up for auction Rhondda recalls Tonypandy Riots Asked about his comments later, Mr McDonnelltold ITV News,externalthe Churchill ""was obviously a hero during the Second World War but there was another side to Churchill"".

Shoreham pilot admits previous show error,"Andrew Hill denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence The pilot of a vintage fighter jet has told a court he has no memory of his plane crashing at the Shoreham Airshow or of the days leading up to it. Andrew Hill said he had no memory from three days before the crash to when he woke from a coma the following month. The 54-year-old told the Old Bailey he had spent the last three years ""trying to resolve what happened"". He denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence when his Hawker Hunter jet crashed on 22 August 2015. The court has heard 11 men were killed in the crash on the A27 after Mr Hill failed to complete an aerobatic manoeuvre. As he gave evidence for the second day, Mr Hill, from Sandon in Hertfordshire, said he had no memory of taking off on the day of the crash, or any part of the display. ""Probably most of the last three years have been spent trying on earth to resolve what happened,"" he told jurors. Asked by Karim Khalil QC, defending, if this had been easy, he replied: ""No, because it caused a dreadful tragedy to a lot of people. ""I was the pilot, I was in charge of the aircraft."" The court has heard Mr Hill was performing a ""bent loop"" manoeuvre when the jet crashed Mr Hill later told the court: ""I don't know what I did. I know what the aircraft did."" Footage of the flight from inside the jet shown to the jury showed the aircraft lining up with the road. Asked if that made any sense, Mr Hill said: ""No."" Mr Hill also said: ""I don't accept I was doing a loop."" And questioned if he knew what he was doing, Mr Hill said: ""It doesn't fit into a classic manoeuvre."" Shoreham pilot denies thrill-seeking Errors made during Shoreham re-enactment Shoreham pilot 'fundamentally negligent' He also noted that the plane was not being ""particularly well flown"" and was ""not being controlled properly"". Watching the moment when the aircraft reduced power, Mr Hill said: ""It's the last thing you would want to do."" Asked if he had any explanation, Mr Hill said: ""None at all."" Jurors were told that upon impact with the ground, the pilot's seat ejected, and Mr Hill from it, in what is called ""seat separation"". The court was told that immediately after the crash Mr Hill was asked what happened and he said he did not know. Mr Hill was thrown from the cockpit of the Hawker Hunter after it crashed Asked if he had felt unwell beforehand, Mr Hill said ""yes"", jurors heard. Mr Hill told the court that if he had felt unwell before the flight he would not have flown. Jurors also heard a paramedic said the pilot had told him he had some pain in his chest and also told him ""at some point he blacked out"". Reading a statement by Mr Hill in 2017, his defence counsel quoted him as saying ""people lost their lives as a direct result of an accident I was involved in"". Asked if he had continued to think like this, Mr Hill told the court: ""Yes, it's the dominant thought of my life."" Earlier, the court heard how Mr Hill had ""embarrassed"" himself by flying too close to the crowd at the Southport air show in 2014. He recalled having a ""nasty dawning moment"", but managed to turn his plane around, ending the display shortly before being ordered to by controllers on the ground. The prosecution has also accused him of another breach in procedure at Shoreham Airshow in 2014. The court was told he flew over Lancing College, near the airport, despite it being prohibited, but Mr Hill denied this had happened. However, jurors heard him agree that a video from a camera fitted in his cockpit made it look like he had. The trial continues. Shoreham pilot denies thrill-seeking Errors made during Shoreham re-enactment Shoreham pilot not ejecting 'saved lives' Shoreham pilot 'fundamentally negligent' 'No sign' Shoreham crash pilot blacked out Pilot 'can not explain' Shoreham crash Shoreham jurors given tour of similar jet Crash pilot stopped in previous show Crash pilot 'drilled in escape manoeuvre' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Full list of the reported roads affected by snow and ice this morning New adaptation of Macbeth hits the Brighton stage Warning of 'hazardous' icy conditions following snow in Sussex UK Weather: Yellow weather warning for ice issued for Sussex Greens call for voters to have their say on âdevolutionâ plans Extra storey and penthouse flat approved by planners New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

""Music was a point of control for him,"" she added, saying the star had belittled her own musical career. ""He would always tell me, 'You're not a real musician, because you don't play an instrument.'"" Moore, who is now a successful actress, says her musical career stalled because of Adams' behaviour Another woman, identified only by her middle name, Ava, told the paper her relationship with Adams started in 2013, when she was a teenage bass player. Although they never met, she shared 3,217 text messages she had exchanged with Adams over a nine-month period when she was 15 and 16, describing how their correspondence became sexually explicit. In one text he wrote to her: ""I would get in trouble if someone knew we talked like this"". The newspaper reported that Adams, then 40, ""fretted about Ava's age"" and repeatedly asked for reassurances that she was over 18. ""If people knew they would say I was like R Kelley lol,"" he wrote in one message, referring to the R&B singer, who has facedallegations of inappropriate relationships with teenagers, which he denies. Adams' lawyer said the star ""did not recall having online communications with anyone related to anything outside of music,"" adding that ""if, in fact, this woman was underage, Mr Adams was unaware"".

A&E waits at worst level for 15 years,"A&E waits in England have reached their worst level since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004. The deterioration in performance came after hospitals appeared to be coping well in the early part of winter. During January, only 84.4% of patients were treated or admitted in four hours - well below the 95% threshold. It means nearly 330,000 patients waited longer than they should with hospitals reporting significant problems finding beds for those needing to be kept in. More than 80,000 patients were kept waiting an extra four hours or more to be transferred to a ward after their wait in A&E. These are known as trolley waits, since patients are left in temporary waiting areas while a bed is found. All this comes despite relatively low levels of flu. The last time the target was met was July 2015.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Dr Nick Scriven, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said it was clear the NHS was under ""severe strain"". He said hospitals had seen significant overcrowding with many intensive care units completely full. He said this had had a knock-on effect on ambulances, which were being delayed dropping off patients at A&E. ""Although there is less minor illness associated with flu this year, there are more severely ill people than last year, which is putting an even bigger strain on the critical care facilities in our hospitals. ""Any NHS worker will tell you that the stresses and strains are very real and ongoing with no let-up in sight."" Prof John Appleby, chief economist of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said it was clear that the NHS was ""fighting a losing battle"" in trying to meet its commitments. He added: ""There is a risk that we lose sight of these problems as Brexit distracts us. This situation has a serious impact on hundreds of thousands of patients, and will be demoralising for many staff."" An NHS England spokesman accepted there were significant pressures, but pointed out that in some respects performance had improved. He said that when performance was combined with December, this winter was actually slightly better than last. There are also more patients coming to A&E than there were last year, which needed to be taken into account, while the mass cancellation of non-emergency treatments that was ordered during last January did not happen this year. There is also a sense that the wider system is working better. Some patients face delays being discharged form hospital because there is a lack of community care available to support them. These delays have fallen compared to two winters ago, suggesting council care teams and NHS services are in a better position to provide support to hospitals. And in the coming years, the budget for the NHS is due to rise by more than 3% compared to the 1-2% it has seen since 2010. Figures for January are not available yet for the other UK nations. But earlier in the winter, the data shows that all parts of the NHS were struggling and missing their A&E targets. Performance in Wales and Northern Ireland was worse than it was in England, whereas Scotland was broadly similar. And when you look at the other core targets, covering cancer care and routine operations, performance is below what it should be everywhere. Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said poor performance was being ""normalised"", adding the system was in ""chronic crisis mode"". ""This does not allow staff to deliver the quality of care they would wish and patients should rightly expect.""

Ministers under fire over 'no deal' position,"MPs are voting on whether to back the government's Brexit strategy. They have rejected a Labour call for another vote on the withdrawal deal by 27 February by 322 votes to 306. The Commons also rejected an SNP call to delay Brexit by at least three months by 315 votes to 93 votes, after Labour abstained in the vote. Conservative backbencher Anna Soubry has withdrawn her amendment calling for official papers on the impact of a no-deal Brexit to be published. Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris indicated that Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington would meet Ms Soubry and would be publishing some information. Ms Soubry welcomed the move and said she reserved the right to lay the amendment again at end of February. The Labour amendment called for a vote on the withdrawal deal by 27 February, or for the government to allow Parliament to decide what happens next. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer had argued that would ""ensure a hard stop"" to prevent the prime minister ""running down the clock"" in a bid to force MPs to back her deal.

What can UK do about IS teen?,"""I'm not the same silly little schoolgirl who ran away four years ago,"" Ms Begum said Shamima Begum, one of three schoolgirls who left London in 2015 to join the Islamic State group, has said she wants to return to the UK. But what problems does that throw up? Shamima Begum is from Bethnal Green in east London and left home in 2015 at the height of the power of the self-styled Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. She and two friends - Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana - flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey after lying to their parents about their plans for the day. Their aim was to join another friend, Sharmeena Begum, who had left in late 2014. The trio were picked up by smugglers working for the IS group and taken across the border into the group's territory in northern Syria. Once there, they were to be married off as jihadi brides to the foreign fighters who had flooded in from across the world. The group aimed to raise a new generation of children supportingits so-called caliphate- and grooming young women to the cause was key to that plan. This video can not be played Anthony Loyd of the Times describes how he found Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp Like other British young women, she was first kept in a house with more prospective brides. Evidence from other cases has revealed that these guest houses were used to further indoctrinate the women with the group's ideology and prepare them for their new lives. Once a suitable match was found, the women were married off one-by-one. All the Bethnal Green group were given husbands. Kadiza Sultana was reportedly killed two years ago following an airstrike on Raqqa. Shamima Begum's fighter husband is reported to have been Yago Riedijk -  a Dutch English-speaking convert. In her interview with the Times, she says their first two children died of complications linked to both malnutrition and a lack of drugs inside the war zone. They fled Raqqa as the air strikes worsened, and as the militant group's territory shrank, the couple - now expecting their third child - were squeezed into the last IS stronghold. Eventually the teenager gave up and headed to a refugee camp. When the teenager and her friends ran off to Syria, their families and the security services were hoping that they had been groomed and brainwashed, but would come to their senses and attempt to find some way out. Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamima Begum at Gatwick Airport in 2015 But the security services in London were also deeply concerned that the girls would be a propaganda tool to help IS recruit others from their community. Five more teenage girls who were suspected of being groomed alongside Ms Begum and her friends were subjected to family court action to control their movements and care. They can't be named for legal reasons. Fromthe tone of Shamima Begum's Times interview,external, she does not appear to regret her decision. She describes being unfazed by seeing the decapitated head of an anti-IS fighter, whom she described as an ""enemy of Islam"". In the short term, no. The British government has no consular staff to help her in Syria. Ministers won't order personnel to risk their lives to help out someone who joined a banned terror group. But suppose she got out of the refugee camp and crossed into Turkey. Could she just get on a flight home? Almost certainly not. She may not have any travel documents - IS recruits were forced to hand over their passports and, in fact, some burnt them as a sign of their allegiance to the self-styled state. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Prevent scheme: Extreme right-wing referrals up by 36% The Britons signing up for Jihad The Home Office is able to cancel passports to prevent people moving freely - this is a well-used counter-terrorism tactic to prevent fighters crossing borders. It's not known whether it has happened in this case. The UK has the power to strip Ms Begum of her nationality, providing she is not left stateless. This seems unlikely because she was not a fighter. If she did reach a safe location, security chiefs in London could control any possible return through a Temporary Exclusion Order. This controversial legal tool - which was used nine times in 2017 - bars a British citizen from returning home until they have agreed to investigation, monitoring and, if required, deradicalisation. Shamima Begum was legally a child when she went to join Islamic State. And if she were still under 18 years of age, the government would have a duty to take her ""best interests"" into account in deciding what to do next. But she is now an apparently unrepentant adult, and if she wants to come back she would have to account for her decisions and face possible prosecution, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. She says she is nine months pregnant. If her baby is safely delivered and she then wants to return to the UK, that is a slightly different and more complex issue. Ms Begum was 15 when she left the UK in 2015 Assuming that Ms Begum is still British, her child would be too. And that would trigger legal duties to take into account the baby's welfare. That doesn't mean that the UK would risk the lives of security service personnel to get her out - far from it. But social services would almost have to take a view about what to do with mother and daughter if they were able to return. According to the latest figures, since 2015 about 100 children in England and Wales have been ""safeguarded"" by the family courts from being taken to conflict areas in Syria and Iraq. This involves each child becoming a ""ward of court""- meaning a judge makes decisions about their future - or they are removed from their families and placed into care. Some of the cases have involved evidence that a parent was brainwashing the child. So Ms Begum's mindset would be critical in any decision about the future of her child. The UK's specialist counter-terrorism prosecutors vigorously pursue anyone with a link to dangerous groups who has not satisfactorily accounted for their actions. There would be a strong public interest to do so - and there is also a precedent. Tareena Shakil from Burton-upon-Trent is another British jihadi bride who got out of the war zone. Intelligence services established she had been married off - but she lied about this when she left to return to the UK with her child - and wassubsequently jailed for membership of a terrorist group. That is exactly the kind of prosecution that Ms Begum could face if she returned - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that is a long, long way off. If Shamima Begum did get back to the UK, she would be subject to the closest possible scrutiny. Irrespective of a prosecution decision, she would be offered the chance to enter into a deradicalisation programme. A government-approved ""intervention provider"" would work with her to challenge her thinking and beliefs. These are highly trained experts in theology, psychology and other specialisms that are called upon to break the mental hold that a cult has over its recruits. This work is very hard - and not always successful. But the intervention providers would almost certainly be the only experts able to advise counter-terrorism chiefs whether Shamima Begum could ever readjust to a normal life. More than 40,000 citizens from 80 countries have become affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) group in Iraq and Syria, according tothe International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation's 2018 report,external. Of the roughly 5,000 Europeans who departed to join IS, about 1,200 are estimated to have returned,according to a 2018 European Parliament report,external. The report breaks down figures for six countries. France accounted for the highest number of those that travelled to Iraq and Syria (1,910), followed by Germany (960), and the UK (850). The proportion of people that have returned varies. Half those that left the UK have returned, the highest rate among the six countries examined in the report. About 30% have returned to Germany and Belgium and just 12% to France. Across EU countries, dealing with the returning fighters is primarily based on criminal investigation and risk assessment. Rehabilitation and reintegration schemes have been introduced inside and outside prison. Other measures include restrictions on movement and powers to withdraw or refuse to issue passports. Safaa Boular was one of the youngest people accused in the UK of terror offences. Last year she was given a life sentence for plotting an attack. Alongside her mother and sister, who were also jailed, Boular was part of the UK's first all-female IS cell.

IS schoolgirl wants to return to UK,"Ms Begum was 15 when she left the UK in 2015 One of three schoolgirls who left east London in 2015 to join the Islamic State group says she has no regrets, but wants to return to the UK. In an interview with the Times,external, Shamima Begum, now 19,  talked about seeing ""beheaded heads"" in bins - but said that it ""did not faze her"". Speaking from a refugee camp in Syria, she said she was nine months pregnant and wanted to come home for her baby. She said she'd had two other children who had both died. She also described how one of her two school friends that had left the UK with her had died in a bombing. The fate of the third girl is unclear. Families flee last IS village in Syria After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? London schoolgirl 'feared dead in Syria' Bethnal Green Academy pupils Ms Begum and Amira Abase were both 15, while Kadiza Sultana was 16, when they left the UK in February 2015. They flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey after telling their parents they were going out for the day. They later crossed the border into Syria. This video can not be played Anthony Loyd of the Times describes how he found Shamima Begum in a Syrian refugee camp After arriving in Raqqa, she stayed at a house with other newly arrived brides-to-be, she told the Times. ""I applied to marry an English-speaking fighter between 20 and 25 years old,"" she said. Ten days later she married a 27-year-old Dutch man who had converted to Islam. She has been with him since then, and the couple escaped from Baghuz -  the group's last territory in eastern Syria - two weeks ago. Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left, and she is now one of 39,000 people in a refugee camp in northern Syria. Asked by Times journalist Anthony Loyd whether her experiences of living in the one-time IS stronghold of Raqqa had lived up to her aspirations, Ms Begum said: ""Yes, it did. It was like a normal life. The life that they show on the propaganda videos - it's a normal life. ""Every now and then there are bombs and stuff. But other than that..."" She said that seeing her first ""severed head"" in a bin ""didn't faze me at all"". ""It was from a captured fighter seized on the battlefield, an enemy of Islam. ""I thought only of what he would have done to a Muslim woman if he had the chance,"" she said. ""I'm not the same silly little 15-year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago,"" she told Mr Loyd. ""I don't regret coming here."" Shamima Begum was legally a child when she pinned her colours to the Islamic State mast. And if she were still under 18 years old, the government would have a duty to take her and her unborn child's ""best interests"" into account in deciding what to do next. But she's now an apparently unrepentant adult - and that means she would have to account for her decisions, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. AnotherBritish jihadi bride, Tareena Shakil,who got out of the war zone with her child, lied to the security services on her return and was jailed for membership of a terrorist group. If Ms Begum got out of the country, that is the kind of charge she could face - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that's a long way off. Assuming she made it to an airport, the UK could temporarily ban her from returning until she agreed to be investigated, monitored and deradicalised. Social services would also certainly step in to consider whether her child should be removed to protect him or her from radicalisation. Watch: The background to the case of Tareena Shakil But Ms Begum said the ""oppression"" had come as a ""shock"" and said she felt the IS ""caliphate"" was at an end. ""I don't have high hopes. They are just getting smaller and smaller,"" she said. ""And there is so much oppression and corruption going on that I don't really think they deserve victory."" She referred to her husband having been held in a prison where men were tortured. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police A lawyer for the family of Kadiza Sultana said in 2016 that she was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike. Ms Begum told the Times her friend had died in a bombing on a house where there was ""some secret stuff going on"" underground. She added: ""I never thought it would happen. At first I was in denial. Because I always thought if we got killed, we'd get killed together."" Ms Begum said losing two children ""came as a shock. It just came out of nowhere, it was so hard"". Her first child, a girl, died at the age of one year and nine months, and was buried in Baghuz a month ago. Her second child - the first to die - died three months ago at the age of eight months, of an illness that was compounded by malnutrition, the Times reports. She told the paper she took him to a hospital. ""There were no drugs available, and not enough medical staff,"" she said. As a result she said she was ""really overprotective"" of her unborn child. She said this concern also contributed to her decision to leave Baghuz. ""I was weak,"" she said. ""I could not endure the suffering and hardship that staying on the battlefield involved. ""But I was also frightened that the child I am about to give birth to would die like my other children if I stayed on."" She said she remained scared her unborn baby would become ill in the refugee camp. ""That's why I really want to get back to Britain because I know it will be taken care of - health-wise, at least,"" she said. She said she should be giving birth ""any day now"". ""I'll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child."" Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer who was instructed by the Bethnal Green girls' families after they ran away, said the families had told him they now wanted ""time and space to process what's happened"". This video can not be played Shamima's sister Renu Begum addressed her in her appeal: ''We love you more than anybody could love you'' Security minister Ben Wallace said he could not comment on Ms Begum's case for legal reasons but said any Britons who had gone to Syria to engage or support terrorist activities should be prepared to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted if they came back to the UK. He said there was no consular assistance in Syria so any Briton wanting help would need to find consular services elsewhere in the region. Asked whether the government would be rushing to bring home people such as Ms Begum, he said: ""I'm not putting at risk British people's lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state."" He added that while the UK had a duty of care to children of Britons in Syria, he also had a duty towards all UK citizens and would do what was ""proportionate and necessary"" to keep people safe. Sir Peter Fahy, a retired senior police chief who led the Prevent terrorism prevention programme at the time the girls ran away, said he could understand why the government was ""not particularly interested"" in facilitating her return. ""If the woman was showing complete remorse, it would be completely different,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. It would cost a ""vast amount of money"" and the biggest challenge would be for local police to keep her safe and ensure she did not become a lightning rod for both right-wing extremists and Islamic extremists, he added. Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent, said it should be remembered that Ms Begum was groomed as a child to become a radicalised woman and was a ""victim of brainwashing"". IS has lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul, in Iraq, and Raqqa, in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks.

'Know your heart risk like your Pin code',"Most cases of cardiovascular disease are preventable through a healthy diet and lifestyle People are being encouraged to know their cholesterol and blood pressure numbers as well as they know their bank Pin code - because it could save their life. These numbers flag up early signs of cardiovascular disease, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Forty health organisations have teamed up to urge more people to go for a routineNHS health check,external. Doctors should also identify and treat at-risk patients better, they say. Cardiovascular disease (CVD),externalcauses one in four deaths in England, the equivalent of someone dying every four minutes, according to Public Health England and NHS England. Poor heart and artery health can also lead to heart failure, kidney disease, arterial disease and vascular dementia. So, health bodies are leading efforts to improve the detection and treatment of three conditions that contribute to CVD - atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure and high cholesterol - over the next 10 years. These conditions often have no symptoms, which is why health experts are recommending people aged over 40 take up a free NHS health check. These can be booked at GP surgeries. They are also available at some local pharmacies and shopping centres. PHE recommendschecking your local area,externalto find out where they are being offered. People over 30 are being urged to take theHeart Age Test,external. Keith had to give up work after his second heart attack Keith Wilson, from Liverpool, had a heart attack out of the blue at 37. ""I had no symptoms and no reason to believe I was sick in any way,"" he says. His father had died of heart disease in his late 60s so he assumed it was something that happened to older people. ""I just didn't consider I was going to get it. I was complacent,"" he says. After a second heart attack, Keith spent the next three to four years in and out of hospital receiving treatment. He had to give up work and this really affected his family and young son. Now 60, Keith is mindful of his health and keeps a close eye on how much he drinks and exercises. He gave up smoking straight after his heart attacks. Cholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. It can build up in the artery walls, restricting blood flow to the heart, brain and rest of the body. It can be measured with a blood test. Total cholesterol levels,externalshould be: 5mmol/L or less for healthy adults 4mmol/L or less for those at high risk You are at high risk if you have a family history of heart disease, heart attacks or strokes, are overweight or have high blood pressure. Blood pressure is recorded using two numbers - the systolic pressure at which the heart pumps blood around your body and the diastolic pressure which measures resistance to blood flow in the blood vessels. high blood pressure,externalis usually 140/90mmHg or higher ideal blood pressure is usually between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg low blood pressure is lower than 90/60mmHg Cardiovascular disease can be characterised by a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries Most cases of CVD are preventable and, alongside free health checks, PHE recommends people should: stop smoking eat healthily keep to a healthy weight drink at safe levels The report also calls on health professionals to improve the way they manage patients at risk of CVD. By 2029, PHE and NHS England want: 80% of people with high blood pressure detected and treated - up from 57% currently 75% of 40- to 74-year-olds having cholesterol levels measured - fewer than 50% currently take up the free health check 45% of 40- to 74-year-olds at high risk of CVD treated with statins - up from from 35% currently These targets will help meet the commitment to prevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and cases of dementia, as set out in the government's long-term plan for the NHS. But there is no new funding for these new targets. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: ""We know our Pin numbers but not the numbers that save our lives. ""Thousands of heart attacks and strokes can be prevented by more people knowing their blood pressure and cholesterol numbers and by seeking help early."" Prof Stephen Powis, NHS medical director, said reducing health inequalities was also a priority, with people in the most deprived communities four times more likely to die prematurely from CVD than those in the most well off. England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Almost half of those with high blood pressure are going about their daily lives without it being detected or treated. ""Millions of people are needlessly at risk of heart attacks or strokes when it could be prevented. ""So, I want to help more people take the time out to protect their future health and get checked."" Five million people are estimated to have undiagnosed high blood pressure in England.

Theme park screams 'could disturb elderly',"Screaming from rides could prompt complaints from neighbours, the park fears A theme park is objecting to plans to build new retirement homes nearby because it fears residents may complain of screams from people on the rides. Thorpe Park bosses say they are considering legal action over a planning application for a retirement home complex next to the park. They say the development could be ""detrimental"" to the park's business. A planning application for the development of a neighbouring Grade II listed building has been deferred. The application for the development next to the Surrey theme park had been due to be approved by Runnymede Borough Council on Wednesday, but was delayed while discussions between the park's owners and developer Eden Retirement Living continue, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Merlin Entertainment said the development of 79 apartments could impact future investment at the attraction because residents might object to noise coming from the rides and visitors. In a bid to ""protect its position"" the firm said the impact of the complex would be ""significant and detrimental to its ongoing operations"". Merlin Entertainments also owns Legoland and Alton Towers Linda Gillham, councillor for the Thorpe ward, said: ""The main problem is that future residents may complain about noise, but in recent years the village residents have not complained about noise."" Staff get 'black eyes' for abuse awareness Uni hits back in trans toilet row The mini hospital cars calming children A noise survey carried out in July 2018 found that ""noise emitted from the theme park consists of screams from patrons and the noise created by the passing of a roller-coaster car"".

'Too few' poor white university students,"More than half of England's universities have fewer than 5% poor white students in their intakes, says an analysis of admissions figures. The report, from the National Education Opportunities Network (Neon), shows low numbers of white students from deprived areas in many top universities. There are 3% at the University of Oxford, compared with 28% at Teesside. The study says too few universities have clear targets to recruit white working-class students. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has warned of communities feeling ""left behind"". Labour says tackling the recruitment problem revealed by this report must be a ""priority"". Justine Greening, the first Conservative education secretary to have gone to a comprehensive school, says the figures should be a ""wake-up call"". ""We need new ideas, including on student finance, to make sure more white working class students have a fair chance to get into university,"" she says. The study, from an organisation promoting wider access into higher education, calls for a ""national initiative"" to tackle the educational underachievement of disadvantaged white youngsters across schools, colleges and universities. The admissions figures show the problem in recruiting white students from poorer backgrounds, particularly to some prestigious universities. Researchers warn that fewer than a fifth of universities have targets for poor white students - and that there are only ""variable"" efforts to improve participation. Even if a target of 5% of poor white students were to be set across universities, it would mean another 10,000 students going to university, says the research. League table changes 'toxic' for poor white schools Why do white working class students fail in school? Universities to target white, working class boys The study looks at white students from so-called ""low-participation neighbourhoods"" - areas where few people usually go to university. In total numbers, white students, of all social backgrounds, are the biggest group going to university, show figures from the Ucas admissions service. But in terms of a proportion of the population, white youngsters are less likely to go to university than Asian or black teenagers. The report calls for a much wider definition of what it means to improve access to university The latest application figures, for courses in the autumn, show that applications from white students are declining, while they are increasing for Asian and black youngsters. Cutting across this is a widening gender divide - with women much more likely than men to apply to university. When these factors combine, it means that white, working-class men become among the most under-represented groups in university. The study says projects to widen entry into university might need to be ""redefined"". The report shows a starkly divided picture in where poor white students are likely to attend. They are particularly likely to take higher education courses in local further education colleges. Among those going to university, 70% go to new universities, with low numbers going to some high-ranking institutions. Cambridge has 2%, Warwick and Bristol 3%, Durham 4%. At University of Sunderland, 27% are white students from deprived areas and 22% in Staffordshire University. The numbers are particularly low in London universities - many of them 1% or 2%. But these figures might be affected by the high overall levels of young people in London going to university - much higher than elsewhere in England. Because of such high entry rates, even from deprived youngsters, there are relatively few ""low-participation neighbourhoods"" in London, or young people who would fall into this category. The high cost of living in London could also deter some poorer students from elsewhere from coming to study in the capital. Graeme Atherton, report co-author and director of Neon, warned of ""big variability"" in the chances of different groups to get to university. ""We need to know more about why this variability exists and do more to eliminate it,"" he says. The director for fair access at the Office for Students, Chris Millward, said the study reveals ""the scale of work to be done"". He said universities will have to ""set out the work they will do to reduce the gaps in higher education participation and attainment between the most and least advantaged"". A spokeswoman for Universities UK said ""18-year-olds from the most disadvantaged areas in England are more likely to go to university than ever before"" - and this would be further helped if the government restored ""maintenance grants for those most in need"". Labour's shadow universities minister, Gordon Marsden, said the ""government and the Office for Students must work with universities on this as a priority"". ""This important study shows we must improve poor access to universities for disadvantaged young white children and especially boys,"" said Mr Marsden. Justine Greening, the former education secretary who has launched a social mobility project, said ""Britain can't afford talent going to waste"" and calls for ""ambitious and bold"" moves to widen access to university. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: ""White British disadvantaged boys are the least likely of any large ethnic group to go to university. ""We need to ask ourselves why that is and challenge government, universities and the wider system to change that. ""It's vital that we do this to make sure that no part of our country feels as though it has been left behind."" Rankings 'toxic' for poor white schools Why do poor white pupils fail in school?

"A&E waits at worst level for 15 yearsNearly 330,000 A&E patients waited for more than four hours last month in England.Health","A&E waits in England have reached their worst level since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004. The deterioration in performance came after hospitals appeared to be coping well in the early part of winter. During January, only 84.4% of patients were treated or admitted in four hours - well below the 95% threshold. It means nearly 330,000 patients waited longer than they should with hospitals reporting significant problems finding beds for those needing to be kept in. More than 80,000 patients were kept waiting an extra four hours or more to be transferred to a ward after their wait in A&E. These are known as trolley waits, since patients are left in temporary waiting areas while a bed is found. All this comes despite relatively low levels of flu. The last time the target was met was July 2015.  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Dr Nick Scriven, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said it was clear the NHS was under ""severe strain"". He said hospitals had seen significant overcrowding with many intensive care units completely full. He said this had had a knock-on effect on ambulances, which were being delayed dropping off patients at A&E. ""Although there is less minor illness associated with flu this year, there are more severely ill people than last year, which is putting an even bigger strain on the critical care facilities in our hospitals. ""Any NHS worker will tell you that the stresses and strains are very real and ongoing with no let-up in sight."" Prof John Appleby, chief economist of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said it was clear that the NHS was ""fighting a losing battle"" in trying to meet its commitments. He added: ""There is a risk that we lose sight of these problems as Brexit distracts us. This situation has a serious impact on hundreds of thousands of patients, and will be demoralising for many staff."" An NHS England spokesman accepted there were significant pressures, but pointed out that in some respects performance had improved. He said that when performance was combined with December, this winter was actually slightly better than last. There are also more patients coming to A&E than there were last year, which needed to be taken into account, while the mass cancellation of non-emergency treatments that was ordered during last January did not happen this year. There is also a sense that the wider system is working better. Some patients face delays being discharged form hospital because there is a lack of community care available to support them. These delays have fallen compared to two winters ago, suggesting council care teams and NHS services are in a better position to provide support to hospitals. And in the coming years, the budget for the NHS is due to rise by more than 3% compared to the 1-2% it has seen since 2010. Figures for January are not available yet for the other UK nations. But earlier in the winter, the data shows that all parts of the NHS were struggling and missing their A&E targets. Performance in Wales and Northern Ireland was worse than it was in England, whereas Scotland was broadly similar. And when you look at the other core targets, covering cancer care and routine operations, performance is below what it should be everywhere. Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said poor performance was being ""normalised"", adding the system was in ""chronic crisis mode"". ""This does not allow staff to deliver the quality of care they would wish and patients should rightly expect.""

"Police admit failings over loyalist deathsPolice failed to disclose ""significant information"" about a loyalist gun attack that killed five people.Northern Ireland","This video can not be played Police ""never sought to deliberately withhold"" information - PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has been accused of a ""cover-up"" after it failed to reveal ""significant information"" about a loyalist gun attack that left five people dead. The attack at Sean Graham's bookies in south Belfast in 1992 was carried out by the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). The PSNI has apologised and said it never sought to deliberately withhold the information. However, Chief Constable George Hamilton is facing a call to resign. Billy McManus, whose father was one of the victims of the attack, said: ""They're saying he's retiring and he wants to retire  - he should resign. ""He's led us up a garden path. He knew, the PSNI knew these files were here, they just hid them, from the Police Ombudsman."" The Police Ombudsman has opened new inquiry lines after finding out about more material linked to the attack. It said that the problem had arisen due to issues including human error, ""the sheer volume of the material involved and the limitations of the archaic IT systems"". The families of the victims have previously said they believe there was collusion between the killers and security forces in the betting shop shootings. This video can not be played Tommy Duffin voices frustration at investigation Tommy Duffin, whose father, Jack, was shot dead in the attack, said the PSNI's initial failure to disclose all of the information was unacceptable. ""It's just been cover-up after cover-up after cover-up of RUC-Special Branch collusion in my opinion - plain and utter collusion,"" he told BBC News NI. ""We know it went on and we know it went on through the Troubles and they're experts at it. ""They're still getting away with it to this day."" No-one has been convicted over the killings. The Police Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said his staff became aware that police were preparing to disclose material as part of impending civil proceedings. His office then asked for that material and it helped his staff to ""identify significant evidence relevant to a number of our investigations"", he added. Five men were killed in the betting shop attack in south Belfast ""Police have now also identified a computer system, which they say had not been properly searched when responding to previous requests for information,"" said Dr Maguire. ""It would seem information which police told us did not exist has now been found."" The material has led the Police Ombudsman to examine new lines of inquiry into the Ormeau shootings, events connected to loyalist paramilitaries in the north west of Northern Ireland between 1988 and 1994 and the murder of teenager Damien Walsh at a coal depot in west Belfast in 1993. Police Ombudsman reports into those investigations will now be delayed. Dr Maguire said that ""in the interests of public confidence in policing"" he has asked Stormont's Department of Justice to commission an independent review into the methods police use to disclose information. The Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ) said the development showed that ""the practice (of withholding information and delaying disclosure) is still continuing"". ""[It] is deeply shocking and the claim that it is due to human error simply insults our intelligence,"" it added. ""The Police Ombudsman's office relies on the PSNI acting in good faith to assist it in its investigations as RUC archive material remains within its control. ""These developments clearly expose the lack of willingness or capacity of the PSNI to provide full disclosure to the Police Ombudsman to allow him to carry out independent and effective investigations."" Mark Sykes, who was injured in the shooting, said he felt ""sick, angry and lied to"". ""We had been told time and time again when we met Mr Maguire that he had all the information that he needed to do this report,"" he added. ""To be told yesterday that there were documents withheld from him was sickening."" The PSNI's Deputy Chief Constable, Stephen Martin, apologised to the families of the attack victims. ""We deeply regret that the researchers responding to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland's (PONI) request were unable to find and disclose it,"" he said. The attack in February 1992 was carried out by the Ulster Freedom Fighters The ""error became apparent"", he said, when a researcher working elsewhere in the PSNI ""found the material while preparing for disclosure in response to civil litigation"". He said that there was a number of reasons why one researcher found the material while others did not, including ""differing levels of experience and knowledge of our researchers"". Mr Martin said that the PSNI's chief constable has concluded that the best interim solution for public confidence in policing would be to give ""appropriately vetted"" Police Ombudsman staff ""full and unfettered access"" to its legacy systems. He also said the PSNI hoped to make substantial changes to its procedures for disclosing information in the coming months and it welcomed any independent review of its system. A spokesperson for Relatives for Justice claimed there was a ""systemic problem in terms of disclosure concerning state killings and in particular killings where collusion is a feature"". Policing Board chair Anne Connolly said it was ""essential"" that there was ""full disclosure of material to allow the Police Ombudsman's Office to do its job"". She added that the PSNI's search systems and checking processed were ""not meeting legislative duties around disclosure and therefore require review"". In 2015, the PSNI's chief constable apologised after it was discovered thatthe weapon used in the Ormeau Road killings was on display in the Imperial War Museum in London.

English authorities 'plan council tax rise',"Refuse collecting and other council services are among those under pressure Almost all councils in England plan to increase council tax and many will be cutting services, research suggests. Three-quarters of local authorities are set to increase tax by more than 2.5% from April, the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU) said. It comes as almost a third of councils surveyed said they were planning to cut spending on adult social care, and a quarter may reduce children's care. The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils had ""little choice"". The survey, by the LGiU think tank and the Municipal Journal, found eight in 10 councils believe the current funding system is ""unsustainable"". The figures are based on the responses from 158 senior council figures, including leaders, chief executives and finance directors, representing 123 of the 353 English local authorities. Some 97% of local authorities surveyed were planning to raise council tax in 2019-20, but more than half (53%) still expect to have to dip into their reserves to cover costs. The average council tax for a Band D home in England was Â£1,671 in 2018-19. A local referendum is needed to increase council tax by 3% or more in most areas. Authorities responsible for social care are allowed to increase council tax by a further 2%. Despite this, 29% of those who answered the survey said intended to ""reduce activity"" in adult social care in 2019-20. Local authorities have a legal obligation to set a balanced budget, where they do not plan to spend more than they have coming in, for the forthcoming year, beginning 1 April. The LGIU and Municipal Journal do not name the councils that are planning to raise taxes, however some councils have already held votes or confirmed their intentions publicly. They include: Northamptonshire County Council,which is in financial difficulty, has been given permission by the government to put its tax up by 5% Gloucestershire County Council will raise council tax by 4.99%, equivalent to Â£5.13 a month more for a Band D household Oldham Council is increasing bills 3.99%, adding Â£62 to the yearly Band D bill Cornwall Council's cabinet has recommended an increase of 3.99% in April, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service Oxford City Council is increasing council tax by 2.99%, about Â£8.94 on a Band D bill, which on top of Oxfordshire County Council's bill makes a total of Â£1,776.63 Some councils are also looking to increase the amount of council tax they can raise by charging more for empty homes. Owners of long-term empty homes in Manchester will be charged a higher premium on their council tax under a series of measures that could raise Â£1m. Council spending cuts, in seven charts Khan confirms council tax hike plans Manchester tax rise to pay for extra police Long-term empty homeowners already pay an extra 50% on their council tax but under proposals approved by the city council's executive, any homes empty for two years or more will be charged double council tax from April. Stockport Council has also proposed scrapping discounts on empty homes and properties under renovation. LGiU chief executive Jonathan Carr-West said councils had no option but to adopt ""drastic measures"" if they were to make ends meet. ""We know that council funding is broken. Councils are making do by increasing council tax as much as they can, increasing charging and dipping in to their reserves,"" he said. Richard Watts, the chairman of the LGA's resources board, said: ""Many councils feel they have little choice but to ask residents to pay more council tax again this year to help them try and protect their local services."" The local referendum rule only applies in England. The National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament have the power to cap local authorities' council tax rises. Northern Ireland has arates system,externalinstead of council tax. In Conwy in Wales, council leaders haveset an increase of 9.6%, while taxpayers in Scotland,will see bills rise up to 4.79%.

Theme park screams 'could disturb elderly'Thorpe Park owners fear noise from rides could spark complaints from a nearby retirement home.Surrey,"Screaming from rides could prompt complaints from neighbours, the park fears A theme park is objecting to plans to build new retirement homes nearby because it fears residents may complain of screams from people on the rides. Thorpe Park bosses say they are considering legal action over a planning application for a retirement home complex next to the park. They say the development could be ""detrimental"" to the park's business. A planning application for the development of a neighbouring Grade II listed building has been deferred. The application for the development next to the Surrey theme park had been due to be approved by Runnymede Borough Council on Wednesday, but was delayed while discussions between the park's owners and developer Eden Retirement Living continue, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Merlin Entertainment said the development of 79 apartments could impact future investment at the attraction because residents might object to noise coming from the rides and visitors. In a bid to ""protect its position"" the firm said the impact of the complex would be ""significant and detrimental to its ongoing operations"". Merlin Entertainments also owns Legoland and Alton Towers Linda Gillham, councillor for the Thorpe ward, said: ""The main problem is that future residents may complain about noise, but in recent years the village residents have not complained about noise."" Staff get 'black eyes' for abuse awareness Uni hits back in trans toilet row The mini hospital cars calming children A noise survey carried out in July 2018 found that ""noise emitted from the theme park consists of screams from patrons and the noise created by the passing of a roller-coaster car"".

Trump ex-aide lied despite plea deal,"Paul Manafort was found guilty of multiple fraud charges in 2018 Donald Trump's former election campaign chief Paul Manafort breached his plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller by lying to prosecutors, a US judge says. US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that Manafort ""made multiple false statements"" to the FBI, Mr Mueller's office and a grand jury. Mr Mueller leads a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. Manafort has pleaded guilty to some charges, avoiding a separate trial. He was convicted of financial fraud in August, relating to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. He then accepted a plea deal on other charges in return for co-operating with Mr Mueller's investigation. Winners and losers from Manafort's plea deal Manafort: The man who helped Trump win Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? In her ruling on Wednesday, Judge Berman Jackson said there was evidence that showed Manafort had lied about three different topics, including his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant. Prosecutors claim Mr Kilimnik had ties to Russian intelligence. However, the judge cleared Manafort, 69, of allegations that he lied on two other subjects. The verdict means that Manafort - who has been held in a detention centre in Virginia since June - could now potentially face harsher sentences or have charges against him re-filed. Last year, Mr Mueller said that Manafort lied ""on a variety of subject matters"" after signing the plea deal. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""I feel very badly for Paul Manafort"" Last August, Manafort was convicted on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts. A month later he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice in a plea bargain with Mr Mueller. The agreement avoided a second trial on money laundering and other charges. The plea deal meant Manafort would face up to 10 years in prisonand would forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts - but deadlocked charges from the previous trial would be dismissed. It was the first criminal trial arising from the Department of Justice's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the presidential election. However, the charges related only to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign. Manafort worked for the Trump presidential campaign for five months in 2016 and was in charge when Mr Trump clinched the Republican party nomination. President Trump has branded the Mueller investigation a ""witch hunt"" and insisted there was no collusion between his team and Russia. Manafort was charged by Mr Mueller last October and during the trial he was accused of using 31 foreign bank accounts in three different countries to evade taxes on millions of dollars. Prosecutors presented evidence of Manafort's luxurious lifestyle, saying it was only possible because of his bank and tax fraud.

Police admit failings over loyalist deaths,"This video can not be played Police ""never sought to deliberately withhold"" information - PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has been accused of a ""cover-up"" after it failed to reveal ""significant information"" about a loyalist gun attack that left five people dead. The attack at Sean Graham's bookies in south Belfast in 1992 was carried out by the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). The PSNI has apologised and said it never sought to deliberately withhold the information. However, Chief Constable George Hamilton is facing a call to resign. Billy McManus, whose father was one of the victims of the attack, said: ""They're saying he's retiring and he wants to retire  - he should resign. ""He's led us up a garden path. He knew, the PSNI knew these files were here, they just hid them, from the Police Ombudsman."" The Police Ombudsman has opened new inquiry lines after finding out about more material linked to the attack. It said that the problem had arisen due to issues including human error, ""the sheer volume of the material involved and the limitations of the archaic IT systems"". The families of the victims have previously said they believe there was collusion between the killers and security forces in the betting shop shootings. This video can not be played Tommy Duffin voices frustration at investigation Tommy Duffin, whose father, Jack, was shot dead in the attack, said the PSNI's initial failure to disclose all of the information was unacceptable. ""It's just been cover-up after cover-up after cover-up of RUC-Special Branch collusion in my opinion - plain and utter collusion,"" he told BBC News NI. ""We know it went on and we know it went on through the Troubles and they're experts at it. ""They're still getting away with it to this day."" No-one has been convicted over the killings. The Police Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said his staff became aware that police were preparing to disclose material as part of impending civil proceedings. His office then asked for that material and it helped his staff to ""identify significant evidence relevant to a number of our investigations"", he added. Five men were killed in the betting shop attack in south Belfast ""Police have now also identified a computer system, which they say had not been properly searched when responding to previous requests for information,"" said Dr Maguire. ""It would seem information which police told us did not exist has now been found."" The material has led the Police Ombudsman to examine new lines of inquiry into the Ormeau shootings, events connected to loyalist paramilitaries in the north west of Northern Ireland between 1988 and 1994 and the murder of teenager Damien Walsh at a coal depot in west Belfast in 1993.

KPMG closed 70 outlets, with the loss of 920 jobs. Restructuring talks broke down in January, leaving no option but administration. The Serious Fraud Office is carrying out a criminal investigation into Patisserie Valerie and finance director Chris Marshwas arrested and released on bail after having been suspendedby the company. Also under investigation, by the Financial Reporting Council, are former Patisserie Valerie auditors Grant Thornton. The first Patisserie Valerie opened in Soho in 1926, established by Belgian husband and wife team Theo and Esther Vermeirsch. Esther, born Esther van Gyseghem, became known as Madame Valerie.

"English authorities 'plan council tax rise'The expected increases come as many local authorities plan to cut spending, research suggests.England","Refuse collecting and other council services are among those under pressure Almost all councils in England plan to increase council tax and many will be cutting services, research suggests. Three-quarters of local authorities are set to increase tax by more than 2.5% from April, the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU) said. It comes as almost a third of councils surveyed said they were planning to cut spending on adult social care, and a quarter may reduce children's care. The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils had ""little choice"". The survey, by the LGiU think tank and the Municipal Journal, found eight in 10 councils believe the current funding system is ""unsustainable"". The figures are based on the responses from 158 senior council figures, including leaders, chief executives and finance directors, representing 123 of the 353 English local authorities. Some 97% of local authorities surveyed were planning to raise council tax in 2019-20, but more than half (53%) still expect to have to dip into their reserves to cover costs. The average council tax for a Band D home in England was Â£1,671 in 2018-19. A local referendum is needed to increase council tax by 3% or more in most areas. Authorities responsible for social care are allowed to increase council tax by a further 2%. Despite this, 29% of those who answered the survey said intended to ""reduce activity"" in adult social care in 2019-20. Local authorities have a legal obligation to set a balanced budget, where they do not plan to spend more than they have coming in, for the forthcoming year, beginning 1 April. The LGIU and Municipal Journal do not name the councils that are planning to raise taxes, however some councils have already held votes or confirmed their intentions publicly. They include: Northamptonshire County Council,which is in financial difficulty, has been given permission by the government to put its tax up by 5% Gloucestershire County Council will raise council tax by 4.99%, equivalent to Â£5.13 a month more for a Band D household Oldham Council is increasing bills 3.99%, adding Â£62 to the yearly Band D bill Cornwall Council's cabinet has recommended an increase of 3.99% in April, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service Oxford City Council is increasing council tax by 2.99%, about Â£8.94 on a Band D bill, which on top of Oxfordshire County Council's bill makes a total of Â£1,776.63 Some councils are also looking to increase the amount of council tax they can raise by charging more for empty homes. Owners of long-term empty homes in Manchester will be charged a higher premium on their council tax under a series of measures that could raise Â£1m. Council spending cuts, in seven charts Khan confirms council tax hike plans Manchester tax rise to pay for extra police Long-term empty homeowners already pay an extra 50% on their council tax but under proposals approved by the city council's executive, any homes empty for two years or more will be charged double council tax from April. Stockport Council has also proposed scrapping discounts on empty homes and properties under renovation. LGiU chief executive Jonathan Carr-West said councils had no option but to adopt ""drastic measures"" if they were to make ends meet. ""We know that council funding is broken. Councils are making do by increasing council tax as much as they can, increasing charging and dipping in to their reserves,"" he said. Richard Watts, the chairman of the LGA's resources board, said: ""Many councils feel they have little choice but to ask residents to pay more council tax again this year to help them try and protect their local services."" The local referendum rule only applies in England. The National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament have the power to cap local authorities' council tax rises. Northern Ireland has arates system,externalinstead of council tax. In Conwy in Wales, council leaders haveset an increase of 9.6%, while taxpayers in Scotland,will see bills rise up to 4.79%.

McDonnell calls Churchill a 'villain',"This video can not be played Speaking at a Politico event, shadow chancellor John McDonnell called Churchill a ""villain"" Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has called Sir Winston Churchill a ""villain"" over his role in dealing with striking miners in 1910. Asked at a Politico website event, for a one-word answer on whether Churchill was a hero or villain, he paused and replied: ""Tonypandy - villain"". The Tonypandy riots saw troops sent to control striking miners who wrecked shops and mine owners' property. The wartime PM was voted the greatest Briton in a BBC poll in 2002. His grandson Sir Nicholas Soames described Mr McDonnell's remark as ""a very foolish and stupid thing to say"". The Conservative MPtold The Telegraph,external: ""I think my grandfather's reputation can withstand a publicity-seeking assault from a third-rate, Poundland Lenin. I don't think it will shake the world."" And the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The British public will reach its own judgement on this characterisation of Sir Winston Churchill."" The spokesman added that Theresa May had a portrait of Churchill hanging on the wall of her study in Number 10 and paid tribute to his ""strong leadership, determination and unwavering personality"" which ""inspired our country through our darkest hour"".

Private donors back family drug courts,"A group of private backers has stepped in to fund a national unit supporting courts which help parents deal with drug or alcohol addiction so their children are not taken into care. The unit, which supports the 13 Family Drug and Alcohol Courts (FDACs), mostly in England, was forced to close last year when government funding was cut. Since then, Â£280,000 has been pledged to fund a new national unit. The aim is to expand the special courts to help more families stay together. Supporters say this saves taxpayer money in the long run. FDACs are led by specially trained judges and work closely with a team of social workers, psychiatrists and substance misuse workers. 'How I got my children back' Addict scheme 'reunites families' Their day-to-day work was not affected by the closure of the national unit - but the unit was needed to set up new courts, co-ordinate the existing ones and train staff. Research has found children are less likely to be taken permanently into care in cases heard in FDACs, and less likely to experience further neglect and abuse. Parents are also more likely to stop using drugs. Charlie, 36, not her real name, went to an FDAC after she became addicted to opiates. Her mental health had deteriorated after ending a domestic violence relationship of over a decade. She says social care gave her ""chance after chance"", but eventually she ended up in care proceedings for her five children. As part of the proceedings, she was required to undergo parenting assessments and attend meetings about her drug misuse. ""They want to know you are in that process of change,"" she says. ""They want to make sure that I'm understanding my addiction, where that addiction has come from, and actually how I've not probably safeguarded my children."" Charlie describes going through the process as ""the scariest thing I've ever done"", but says she still felt supported by the court. The judge addressed her directly, not through a solicitor. Everyone wore normal clothes. Her son even got to have his photo taken in the judge's chair. ""It makes you feel that bit more relaxed,"" she says. Having the same judge also gave her confidence that the court understood her situation. ""One time the judge came down hard on me, but it was honest. And coming from a judge made it feel different. ""That's the highest person you can get saying 'look what you've done'. It's scary."" Despite the harsh words, she said she's always felt like she was treated fairly. ""I felt like I've always been listened to by the judge. The court reads the paperwork, but they also look at the parent."" Professor Judith Harwin, from Lancaster University, welcomed the news and said that her team's research on FDACs was ""very positive."" Theyfound,externalthat 58% of the mothers who used an FDAC did not return to misusing drugs or alcohol, compared with 24% who went through ordinary court. Mary Ryan, a former lawyer who was part of the original team that set up the system, said the courts designed to prevent parents coming back into the system over and over without their problems being sorted out and were ""value for money"". ""We believe this should be much more widely available to children and families across the country,"" she said. Phil Bowen, director of the Centre for Justice Innovation, which will direct the new national unit, said the funding would help expand the valuable work of the courts. ""They get to the root of difficulties faced by parents struggling with substance misuse using a therapeutic, problem-solving approach, giving vulnerable children a better start in life, keeping families together and saving taxpayer money,"" he said. FDACs help families in which children are put at risk by parental substance misuse. Most families seen by them have additional problems such as domestic abuse or parental mental health difficulties. The court works with social workers, substance misuse specialists, psychiatrists and mentors to help parents keep their children. Parents are given a ""trial for change"" that gives them the chance to overcome their problems with the support of professionals. The same judge reviews the case every fortnight, usually without lawyers present. The courts were modelled on US-style problem-solving courts. The first one was set up in London in 2008, with cross-government funding. The Department of Education supported the rollout of FDACs, of which there are now 13 in England and Northern Ireland. However last year it withdrew funding for the national unit which supports the courts, forcing it to close. After the government stopped financing the national unit, a fundraising campaign was launched by the co-founders of Hall Brown Family Law Solicitors. It followed a meeting with Judge Nicholas Crichton, who founded the first Family Drug and Alcohol Court in 2008, and the Earl of Listowel, who is one of the courts' most prominent advocates in parliament. The campaign was subsequently backed by LCM Wealth, which advises high net worth families; family law firm Family Law in Partnership; and AddCounsel, a provider of bespoke behavioural health programmes, along with other anonymous supporters. A government spokesman said the courts offered ""important support"" for families. He said the government was also investing Â£16bn in public health services and had set out a wide-ranging drug strategy to help families facing problems with substance misuse. This video can not be played 'My priority wasn't to sit and play with toys .. it was using [drugs]"" One woman, ""Claire"", had been addicted to heroin for more than 10 years when she went into FDAC. She told the BBC in 2015that she was put on an intensive detoxification and therapy programme. Her children were taken away and placed with her own mother. ""It is really hard - really draining,"" she said. She went through regular tests, meaning she could not lie about her drug use. When the programme finished, and she was clean, she got her children back.

Philippine news boss bailed amid outcry,"This video can not be played Maria Ressa says the rule of law was broken when she was arrested Award-winning Philippine journalist Maria Ressa has been freed on bail, a day after her arrest on charges of ""cyber-libel"" drew international condemnation. Ms Ressa is CEO of Rappler, a news website critical of the government. She was arrested at its headquarters on Wednesday by agents from the National Bureau of Investigation. Press freedom advocates see this as a government attempt to silence the news organisation. Ms Ressa has been accused of ""cyber-libel"" over a seven-year-old report on a businessman's alleged ties to a former judge. The charges - the latest in a string against her - carry a potential 12 years in prison. AFP news agency reports that bail was fixed at 100,000 pesos ($1,900; Â£1,470), and that it is the sixth time Ms Ressa has been obliged to post bail. ""Every one of the cases that have been filed against me and against Rappler are ludicrous,"" Ms Ressa told the BBC after her release. ""They are used as political tools and the crazy thing is we are just doing our jobs."" Ms Ressa is a veteran Philippine journalist who was named a Time Magazine Person of the Year in 2018 for her work holding power to account in an increasingly hostile environment. She spent much of her career as a regional bureau chief at US broadcaster CNN before co-founding Rappler in 2012. Rappler is known in the Philippines for its hard-hitting investigations. It is one of few media organisations that openly criticises President Rodrigo Duterte, regularly interrogating the accuracy of his public statements and condemning his sometimes deadly policies.

In particular, Rappler has published a number of reports critical of Mr Duterte's war on drugs, which police say has killed around 5,000 people in the last three years. In December, it also reported on his public admission that he sexually assaulted a maid. The charges of ""cyber-libel"" relate to a seven-year-old report on a businessman's alleged ties to a former judge. The libel law is controversial, and came into force in September 2012 - four months after her article was published. The state of media in the Philippines Why Rappler is raising Philippine press freedom fears Officials first filed the case against Ms Ressa in 2017, but it was dismissed by the NBI because the one-year limit for bringing libel cases had lapsed. However, in March 2018,the NBI reopened the matter,external. This new arrest comes just two months after Ms Ressa posted bail on tax fraud charges, which she says are also ""manufactured"". She could serve up to a decade in prison if convicted of just one count of tax fraud. Activists and press freedom groups around the world have criticised the Rappler CEO's detention. Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called it an ""outrageous"" arrest that ""must be condemned by all democratic nations"". Human rights group Amnesty International said the Duterte government was using legal threats to ""relentlessly intimidate and harass"" journalists. Within the Philippines, the National Union of Journalists said the move would backfire, and called for protests to be held on Friday. President Duterte has previously denied that charges against Maria Ressa are politically motivated, but has publically branded Rappler a ""fake news outlet"" and banned its staff from covering his events. Last year,the state revoked the site's licence. In response,Rappler said it would ""continue to operate as it files the necessary motions for reconsideration with the courts"".,external Saying the unsayable: Philippine President Duterte Duterte: The 'strongman' of the Philippines Philippines country profile A spokesman for President Duterte insisted the government has nothing to do with the libel case, and does not pursue critical journalists. ""That's absolutely unrelated. The president has been criticised and he does not bother,"" Salvador Panelo told DZMM radio. BBC Philippines Correspondent Howard Johnson reports that journalists there are subjected to threats by supporters of the president, however. Some argue that the press is biased against Mr Duterte, and that reports focus on his bloody drug war at the expense of his achievements while in office. Speaking to reporters after her arrest, Ms Ressa said she was ""shocked that the rule of law has been broken to a point that I can't see it"". Footage streamed on Facebook,externalshowed plain-clothes party officials speaking with her, while several of the site's journalists live-tweeted what was happening. Officers from the National Bureau of Investigations (NBI) reportedly ordered them to stop filming and taking photos. Ms Ressa told the BBC that an officer told one of her staff that they could be ""next"" - which she described as an attempt to intimidate reporters. Allow Twitter content?

Taxi drivers accused of serious sex crimes,"Private hire drivers have been accused of sex crimes over 150 miles away from where they are licensed Taxi drivers licensed by a council which is accused of threatening public safety are suspected of serious sexual offences. Reports of child sexual exploitation are among allegations made against drivers licensed in Wolverhampton, but who also operate across England. Fears have been raised drivers are ""shopping around"" to find the easiest way to obtain a licence. Wolverhampton council said it stripped licences from suspects immediately. This week,the government said it was tightening taxi safety guidelinesand considering stopping drivers from operating hundreds of miles away from where they were licensed. City of Wolverhampton Council hasincreased the number of licences it issueseightfold since the Deregulation Act 2015 was introduced, meaning drivers no longer needed to live or work in the area of the local authority that granted them a licence. The situation has led to a chaotic picture emerging around the country, with authorities unable to control all cabbies working in their area. Taxi and cab drivers have staged go-slow protests against the current regulations around the country, saying they leave the public at risk. This video can not be played ""I was sitting in the back of the taxi and he put his hand on my knee"" Wolverhampton licensing bosses have insisted they informed relevant authorities when serious reports of crimes were made, but several councils have told the BBC they were unaware of the allegations. The BBC has been unable to determine whether the drivers accused of offences have faced criminal proceedings. The city council added it had been at the forefront of calls for a national database of drivers. The BBC has learned there have been seven allegations of child sexual exploitation (CSE) made, and 16 serious sexual allegations against drivers licensed in Wolverhampton. The report made furthest from the West Midlands city came from a complainant more than 150 miles away. They include: A driver working in Southampton when a serious sexual allegation was made against him in October 2017 A Wolverhampton taxi driver accused of being involved in child sexual exploitation on 16 June 2017 in Bolsover, Derbyshire A serious sexual allegation recorded as taking place in Mansfield, more than 70 miles away, on 3 October 2016 One allegation of CSE made in Shropshire in January 2018 along with two other serious sexual allegations in 2017 In Telford, where authorities have dealt witha high-profile CSE scandal, a serious sexual allegation was reported in April 2018 Prof Rod Thomson, Shropshire Council's director of public health, said the authority was ""concerned that public safety is being threatened and environmental aspirations diluted in cases where drivers and vehicle proprietors 'shop around' to be licensed by local authorities that demand lower standards and then exclusively or predominantly work in an area or areas where standards are higher and licences more difficult to obtain"". He backed plans for a government review into licensing, saying it should ""bring it up-to-date and to create a regime that is fit for the 21st Century"". None of the councils for the areas where offences were alleged could confirm whether they had been made aware of the suspect driver operating in their area. Taxi drivers have held protests around the country over cross-border hiring In Birmingham, where there have been four serious sexual allegations against drivers licensed in Wolverhampton, the council said it was concerned the Deregulation Act had ""resulted in a situation where there are many vehicles and drivers in the city over whom the council has no enforcement powers"". In Wolverhampton itself, there were four allegations of CSE and four serious sexual allegations. The licensing authority has been made aware of complaints against drivers via police, other councils and by passengers themselves. The authority said it dealt with complaints robustly, with all safeguarding issues dealt with within a day ""regardless of where the driver is in the country"". In one instance, a council officer drove more than 100 miles to a suspect driver's home and ""took his licence away from him on his doorstep"". Six of the drivers in the CSE reports had their licences taken from them but the seventh complaint was not upheld. Police were informed in all cases, it said. In May 2017, the chair of Wolverhampton's licensing committee, Alan Bolshaw, wrote to Sajid Javid, who was then Communities and Local Government Secretary, urging him to create a national database of drivers so that adequate background checks could be carried out, even suggesting the council fund it. However, there remains no official system of ensuring all authorities are aware of suspected criminal activity, although the council ""refutes any accusation"" of failing to pass on details. But it added: ""We are currently developing a referral mechanism that would inform, in writing, all the relevant safeguarding, policing and licensing authorities in an area when we take action in relation to a driver licensed by us, but operating in their area."" On Tuesday, the Department for Transport announced new proposals for taxi and private hire drivers to have to pass enhanced criminal record checks before being granted a licence. Every council in England would be told to carry out checks on all applicants. Current guidelines allow councils to set their own driver standards, including whether to make the checks. Under the plans, those with specific previous convictions would face minimum bans ""in all but truly exceptional circumstances"". CCTV may also be fitted to cars, with an encrypted system so footage could only be accessed if a crime was reported. The topic of taxi safety comes after the case of ""black cab rapist"" John Worboys, who police believe may have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women he picked up in London between 2002 and 2008. Predators can use relaxed rules to become taxi drivers and gain access to vulnerable passengers, a victim's charity said. ""The first thing to say is that the majority of taxi drivers out there are working hard to make a living and are trained to actually help vulnerable people,"" said Phil Ashford, from the National Working Group (NWG) for tackling child sexual exploitation. ""But there are some who will use their position of power and authority to take advantage of vulnerable people, particularly as taxi journeys are often one-on-one situations. ""In terms of my experience working on the front line and from working in some cases, there are some drivers that are predatory. ""They will know for example, that the children live together in residential care homes and become friendly with them, and quite easily take advantage of a particular vulnerability by being approachable by offering a sense of fulfilment to that child by offering things that are perceived to be quite adult or responsible such as alcohol, drugs and gifts, and begin grooming them that way before abusing them."" 'Most congested' roads in UK revealed What's your area like for young people? Failed Garden Bridge project cost Â£53m Mr Ashford welcomed news of the government's proposals for tougher legislation. ""At the moment, some drivers can take advantage of a loophole where they can apply to get a licence in an authority that has less stringent assessments and ply their trade in an area which does. ""What is really important is that we make sure we bring the taxi drivers in on this. I understand they may feel like they're being unfairly targeted but you know this is about protecting children and protecting drivers' business reputation."" Taxi drivers in Wolverhampton say they have been protesting about the issue for years Established taxi drivers in Wolverhampton have previously protested over what they said was a fall in standards since the Deregulation Act was introduced. Raheel Shah, chairman of Wolverhampton Private Hire Drivers' Association and a taxi driver himself, said: ""We have been protesting for more than three years over this.

Name checks on payments face delay,"A system making a recipient's name as important as the bank account number and sort code when payments are made could be delayed by up to 18 months. The Confirmation of Payee system means anyone making a payment will be alerted if the name does not match the account. It is designed to prevent millions of pounds worth of fraud and regulators wanted it to start in July. But UK Finance, which represents banks, said the system would not be ready until ""some time next year"". The Payment Systems Regulator, which will ultimately set the deadline, said it wanted the new rules to be in place as soon as possible, but only when they could be effective. At present, anyone making a payment adds the intended recipient's name, but it is ignored by the bank. Only the account number and sort code need to match for the payment to be successful, so fraudsters pose as someone legitimate to trick victims into paying them money. When setting up a new payment, or amending an existing one, banks will be able to check the name on the account of the person or organisation you are paying. If you use the correct account name, you will receive confirmation that the details match, so you can proceed with the payment If you use a similar name to the account holder, you will be provided with the actual name of the account holder to check. You can update the details and try again, or contact the intended recipient to check the details If you enter the wrong name for the account holder, you will be told the details do not match and advised to contact the person or organisation you are trying to pay. The aim of Confirmation of Payee is to cut down on so-called authorised push payment (APP) scams, in which people are conned into sending money to another account. One APP victim was Angelene Bungay, of Shrewsbury, who wasduped into paying Â£13,000 to someone posing as the buildercarrying out her loft conversion. She was not refunded by her bank. Banks typically refund only about a fifth of the money that goes missing, pointing to legislation that says customers may be liable if they authorise the payment and are negligent. Hundreds of millions of pounds have been lost in this kind of scam, with some victims losing life-changing sums. During evidence to the Commons' Treasury Committee, Stephen Jones, of UK Finance, said for the first time that it was the intention that victims would be reimbursed when neither the bank or the victim were to blame for the fraud. This could eventually be funded from insurance, although other options are being considered. He also said that Confirmation of Payee would not be ready by July, which was the regulator's suggestion during consultation, but some time next year. He said it had not dropped down the list of banks' priorities, but was a complex change in their IT and processing systems. ""This is a big change at a time of a lot of change,"" he told the committee. A spokesman for the regulator, the PSR, said: ""We want to see Confirmation of Payee brought in as soon as possible and also make sure that when it is introduced, it is an effective way to stop this crime taking place. ""As it stands, we are still working through the responses to our consultation and so no decisions on timing have been made."" Consumer groups have previously accused banks of dragging their heels on introducing the system. Gareth Shaw, from Which?, said: ""Any extended delay to this vital measure would be a huge betrayal of bank customers and is likely to result in millions of pounds being lost unnecessarily to bank transfer scams, with devastating consequences for the victims.""

English authorities 'plan council tax hike',"Refuse collecting and other council services are among those under pressure Almost all councils in England plan to increase council tax and many will be cutting services, research suggests. Three-quarters of local authorities are set to increase tax by more than 2.5% from April, the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU) said. It comes as almost a third of councils surveyed said they were planning to cut spending on adult social care, and a quarter may reduce children's care. The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils had ""little choice"". The survey, by the LGiU think tank and the Municipal Journal, found eight in 10 councils believe the current funding system is ""unsustainable"". The figures are based on the responses from 158 senior council figures, including leaders, chief executives and finance directors, representing 123 of the 353 English local authorities. Some 97% of local authorities surveyed were planning to raise council tax in 2019-20, but more than half (53%) still expect to have to dip into their reserves to cover costs. The average council tax for a Band D home in England was Â£1,671 in 2018-19. A local referendum is needed to increase council tax by 3% or more in most areas. Authorities responsible for social care are allowed to increase council tax by a further 2%. Despite this, 29% of those who answered the survey said intended to ""reduce activity"" in adult social care in 2019-20. Local authorities have a legal obligation to set a balanced budget, where they do not plan to spend more than they have coming in, for the forthcoming year, beginning 1 April. The LGIU and Municipal Journal do not name the councils that are planning to raise taxes, however some councils have already held votes or confirmed their intentions publicly. They include: Northamptonshire County Council,which is in financial difficulty, has been given permission by the government to put its tax up by 5% Gloucestershire County Council will raise council tax by 4.99%, equivalent to Â£5.13 a month more for a Band D household Oldham Council is increasing bills 3.99%, adding Â£62 to the yearly Band D bill Cornwall Council's cabinet has recommended an increase of 3.99% in April, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service Oxford City Council is increasing council tax by 2.99%, about Â£8.94 on a Band D bill, which on top of Oxfordshire County Council's bill makes a total of Â£1,776.63 Some councils are also looking to increase the amount of council tax they can raise by charging more for empty homes. Owners of long-term empty homes in Manchester will be charged a higher premium on their council tax under a series of measures that could raise Â£1m. Council spending cuts, in seven charts Khan confirms council tax hike plans Manchester tax rise to pay for extra police Long-term empty homeowners already pay an extra 50% on their council tax but under proposals approved by the city council's executive, any homes empty for two years or more will be charged double council tax from April. Stockport Council has also proposed scrapping discounts on empty homes and properties under renovation. LGiU chief executive Jonathan Carr-West said councils had no option but to adopt ""drastic measures"" if they were to make ends meet. ""We know that council funding is broken. Councils are making do by increasing council tax as much as they can, increasing charging and dipping in to their reserves,"" he said. Richard Watts, the chairman of the LGA's resources board, said: ""Many councils feel they have little choice but to ask residents to pay more council tax again this year to help them try and protect their local services."" The local referendum rule only applies in England. The National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament have the power to cap local authorities' council tax rises. Northern Ireland has arates system,externalinstead of council tax. In Conwy in Wales, council leaders haveset an increase of 9.6%, while taxpayers in Scotland,will see bills rise up to 4.79%.

Paedophile jailed for abusing hundreds,"A Colombian man who admitted sexually abusing nearly 300 children has been sentenced to 60 years in prison. Juan Carlos SÃ¡nchez Latorre committed the crimes in 2007-08, a court in the city of Barranquilla ruled. SÃ¡nchez Latorre, in his late 30s, used the alias Big Bad Wolf to share images and videos of the abuse online. He was arrested in Venezuela a year ago with a fake identity card after five years on the run. During the trial, SÃ¡nchez Latorre pleaded guilty to sexually abusing 276 boys and girls. Prosecutors said he had approached his victims online and then met them at shopping centres, offering them money in exchange for sexual contact. If they refused, they were often attacked, the prosecutors said. The authorities believe SÃ¡nchez Latorre committed other crimes in Venezuela before being finally arrested in the city of Maracaibo and extradited to Colombia in September 2018. His neighbours said they had never suspected that he could be a dangerous paedophile.

MPs set to debate Brexit next steps,"MPs are voting on whether to back the government's Brexit strategy. They have rejected a Labour call for another vote on the withdrawal deal by 27 February by 322 votes to 306. The Commons also rejected an SNP call to delay Brexit by at least three months by 315 votes to 93 votes, after Labour abstained in the vote. Conservative backbencher Anna Soubry has withdrawn her amendment calling for official papers on the impact of a no-deal Brexit to be published. Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris indicated that Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington would meet Ms Soubry and would be publishing some information. Ms Soubry welcomed the move and said she reserved the right to lay the amendment again at end of February. The Labour amendment called for a vote on the withdrawal deal by 27 February, or for the government to allow Parliament to decide what happens next. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer had argued that would ""ensure a hard stop"" to prevent the prime minister ""running down the clock"" in a bid to force MPs to back her deal.

The government has warned a rebellion could damage the prime minister's negotiating position, as she seeks to make changes to the controversial backstop ""insurance policy"" in the deal to avoid customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. During Thursday's debate, former Brexit secretary David Davis urged Mr Barclay to be ""clear"" about whether the UK would still be leaving the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. Mr Barclay confirmed that it would but was challenged by Lib Dem MP Tom Brake about why he was respecting one Commons vote, but not the other. Mr Barclay replied that the Commons ""has said two different things"" as it had also passed legislation to say the UK would leave the EU on 29 March, ""by a large margin"" adding: ""The legislation frankly takes precedence over that motion.""

Ms Greening, a former education secretary who backs another EU referendum, described this approach as ""fundamentally wrong and anti-democratic"". Fellow Conservative Dame Caroline Spelman said ""equal respect"" must be given to both Commons motions adding: ""If he fails to do that, it is contemptuous of this House."" And Father of the House Ken Clarke said it was ""ridiculous"" to stick with the ""arbitrary"" 29 March departure date if no deal was in place. But DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said taking ""no deal"" off the table would weaken the UK's negotiating position: ""So those who call for no deal to be taken off the table are actually playing into the hands of the possibility of a no deal."" And Tory backbencher Peter Bone told MPs: ""The truth is that a no-deal Brexit, which of course is a deal coming out on WTO rules, is the answer. It gives clarity to business and it delivers what the British people voted for in June 2016."" Mr Barclay said the government's priority was to secure a deal and said: ""The only way to avoid 'no deal' is either to secure a deal on the terms the prime minister has set out... the only other option would be to revoke Article 50 (the process by which the UK will leave the EU)."" For Labour, Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister was ""pretending to make progress while running down the clock"". And he expressed anger at the ""macho way"" some Brexiteers talked about ""marching off the cliff"" without a deal and said he would ""take whatever steps are necessary"" to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

Airbus to stop making A380 superjumbo,"European aircraft manufacturer Airbus has pulled the plug on its struggling A380 superjumbo, which entered service just 12 years ago. Airbus said last deliveries of the world's largest passenger aircraft, which cost about $25bn (Â£19.4bn) to develop, would be made in 2021. The decision comes after Emirates, the largest A380 customer, cut its order. The A380 faced fierce competition from smaller, more efficient aircraft and has never made a profit. The A380's future had been in doubt for several years as orders dwindled. Butin a statement,externalon Thursday, Airbus said the ""painful"" decision to end production was made after Emirates reduced its latest order. The Dubai-based airline is cutting its overall A380 fleet size from 162 to 123. Emirates said it would take delivery of 14 further A380s over the next two years, but has also ordered 70 of Airbus' smaller A330 and A350 models. ""Emirates has been a staunch supporter of the A380 since its very inception,"" said the airlines' chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum. ""While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the programme could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,"" he added. Why did the Airbus A380 fail? The order cut meant keeping production going was not viable, said Airbus chief executive Tom Enders, who is due to step down in April. There was ""no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years"" he said. Airbus has taken a â¬463m charge for shutdown costs, but it is expected that the repayment of government loans could be waived to help cushion the blow. The aerospace giant said the financial impact of the decision was ""largely embedded"" in the firm's 2018 results, which showed a net profit for 2018 of â¬3bn (Â£2.6bn) up nearly 30% from the previous year. Airbus said it would deliver between 880 and 890 new commercial aircraft this year. Airbus employs 6,000 people at its main wings factory at Broughton in Flintshire Airbus said it would start discussions with partners regarding the ""3,000 to 3,500 positions potentially impacted over the next three years"". The BBC understands that around 200 jobs in the UK could be under threat from the decision. Airbus confirmed it hopes to redeploy a ""significant"" number of affected staff to other projects. Mr Enders said: ""It needs to be evaluated. It's clear we make a lot of wings in Britain and a few wings for the A380. ""Hopefully we can redeploy a significant number of our employees there and re-use also the infrastructure."" Airbus UK makes the wings for its wide variety of aircraft in the UK. The company employs about 6,000 staff at its main wings factory at Broughton in Flintshire, as well as 3,000 at Filton, near Bristol, where wings are designed and supported. Parts of the A380 are manufactured in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, with final assembly and finishing split between Toulouse and Hamburg. Airbus had already cut staffing as A380 orders dried up, and the future of employment at the company very much now depends on the success of its new generation of aircraft. Unite, the largest union representing aerospace workers in the UK and Ireland, said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the news, adding it would seek ""urgent assurances"" from Airbus that there would be no job losses because of the decision. ""We are of the firm belief that with a full order book in single aisle planes, such as the A320, that our members affected can be redeployed on to other work in Airbus,"" said Rhys McCarthy, Unite's national officer for aerospace. The spacious jet, which had its first commercial flight in 2007 with Singapore Airlines, was popular with passengers but it was complicated and expensive to build, in part thanks to the way production was spread across various locations. But ultimately demand for the A380 from airlines dried up as the industry shifted away from larger planes in favour of smaller, wide-body jets. When Airbus was conceiving the A380, Boeing was also considering plans for a superjumbo. But the US company decided to scrap the idea in favour of its smaller, efficient - and more successful - 787 Dreamliner. ""The very clear trend in the market is to operate long-haul aircraft with two engines [such as] Boeing's 787 and 777, and Airbus's A330 and A350,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of Flight Global. Airbus had been working on a revamped A380 to make it more efficient, but needed sufficient launch orders to make the huge investment viable. Despite Airbus' website describing the Airbus as the ""future of long-distance travel"" the last aircraft will be delivered in 2021. Analysis: By Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter When Airbus's A380 first took off it was hailed as a technological marvel that would meet airlines' needs for a new large aircraft to connect the world's crowded airport hubs - London, New York, Dubai, Tokyo. Airbus said the market for the giant planes would be 1,500. After today's decision to end production, it will have made just over 250. In hindsight, airlines were already turning their back on very large aircraft when the A380 made its debut. Advances in engine technology meant planes no longer needed four engines to fly long distances - and carriers were able to use a new generation of light, fuel-efficient, twin-engined aircraft to link secondary cities, bypassing the crowded hubs altogether. Even though Airbus was aware of the threat posed by these new types of plane, they pressed ahead. There was a bigger game afoot - Airbus needed to negate Boeing's 747, believing that the profits the American company made on 747 sales were helping it cross-subsidise other, smaller planes. The A380 succeeded in that - the last passenger 747 was built two years ago - but Boeing will have a kind of last laugh. Freighter versions of the 747 will be built past 2021, meaning the venerable jumbo jet will outlive the plane sent to kill it. Why did the Airbus A380 fail?

Airbus said last deliveries of the world's largest passenger aircraft, which cost about $25bn (Â£19.4bn) to develop, would be made in 2021. The decision comes after Emirates, the largest A380 customer, cut its order. The A380 faced fierce competition from smaller, more efficient aircraft and has never made a profit. The A380's future had been in doubt for several years as orders dwindled. Butin a statement,externalon Thursday, Airbus said the ""painful"" decision to end production was made after Emirates reduced its latest order. The Dubai-based airline is cutting its overall A380 fleet size from 162 to 123. Emirates said it would take delivery of 14 further A380s over the next two years, but has also ordered 70 of Airbus' smaller A330 and A350 models. ""Emirates has been a staunch supporter of the A380 since its very inception,"" said the airlines' chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum. ""While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the programme could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,"" he added. Why did the Airbus A380 fail? The order cut meant keeping production going was not viable, said Airbus chief executive Tom Enders, who is due to step down in April. There was ""no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years"" he said. Airbus has taken a â¬463m charge for shutdown costs, but it is expected that the repayment of government loans could be waived to help cushion the blow. The aerospace giant said the financial impact of the decision was ""largely embedded"" in the firm's 2018 results, which showed a net profit for 2018 of â¬3bn (Â£2.6bn) up nearly 30% from the previous year. Airbus said it would deliver between 880 and 890 new commercial aircraft this year. Airbus employs 6,000 people at its main wings factory at Broughton in Flintshire Airbus said it would start discussions with partners regarding the ""3,000 to 3,500 positions potentially impacted over the next three years"". The BBC understands that around 200 jobs in the UK could be under threat from the decision. Airbus confirmed it hopes to redeploy a ""significant"" number of affected staff to other projects. Mr Enders said: ""It needs to be evaluated. It's clear we make a lot of wings in Britain and a few wings for the A380. ""Hopefully we can redeploy a significant number of our employees there and re-use also the infrastructure."" Airbus UK makes the wings for its wide variety of aircraft in the UK. The company employs about 6,000 staff at its main wings factory at Broughton in Flintshire, as well as 3,000 at Filton, near Bristol, where wings are designed and supported. Parts of the A380 are manufactured in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, with final assembly and finishing split between Toulouse and Hamburg. Airbus had already cut staffing as A380 orders dried up, and the future of employment at the company very much now depends on the success of its new generation of aircraft. Unite, the largest union representing aerospace workers in the UK and Ireland, said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the news, adding it would seek ""urgent assurances"" from Airbus that there would be no job losses because of the decision. ""We are of the firm belief that with a full order book in single aisle planes, such as the A320, that our members affected can be redeployed on to other work in Airbus,"" said Rhys McCarthy, Unite's national officer for aerospace. The spacious jet, which had its first commercial flight in 2007 with Singapore Airlines, was popular with passengers but it was complicated and expensive to build, in part thanks to the way production was spread across various locations. But ultimately demand for the A380 from airlines dried up as the industry shifted away from larger planes in favour of smaller, wide-body jets. When Airbus was conceiving the A380, Boeing was also considering plans for a superjumbo. But the US company decided to scrap the idea in favour of its smaller, efficient - and more successful - 787 Dreamliner. ""The very clear trend in the market is to operate long-haul aircraft with two engines [such as] Boeing's 787 and 777, and Airbus's A330 and A350,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of Flight Global. Airbus had been working on a revamped A380 to make it more efficient, but needed sufficient launch orders to make the huge investment viable. Despite Airbus' website describing the Airbus as the ""future of long-distance travel"" the last aircraft will be delivered in 2021. Analysis: By Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter When Airbus's A380 first took off it was hailed as a technological marvel that would meet airlines' needs for a new large aircraft to connect the world's crowded airport hubs - London, New York, Dubai, Tokyo. Airbus said the market for the giant planes would be 1,500. After today's decision to end production, it will have made just over 250. In hindsight, airlines were already turning their back on very large aircraft when the A380 made its debut. Advances in engine technology meant planes no longer needed four engines to fly long distances - and carriers were able to use a new generation of light, fuel-efficient, twin-engined aircraft to link secondary cities, bypassing the crowded hubs altogether. Even though Airbus was aware of the threat posed by these new types of plane, they pressed ahead. There was a bigger game afoot - Airbus needed to negate Boeing's 747, believing that the profits the American company made on 747 sales were helping it cross-subsidise other, smaller planes. The A380 succeeded in that - the last passenger 747 was built two years ago - but Boeing will have a kind of last laugh. Freighter versions of the 747 will be built past 2021, meaning the venerable jumbo jet will outlive the plane sent to kill it. Why did the Airbus A380 fail?

"FBI releases serial killer's drawingsIt is hoped the images by Samuel Little, who confessed to 90 killings, will aid identification.US & Canada","The FBI released Samuel Little's drawings in the hope that the victims could be identified. The FBI has released the portraits a serial killer drew of his victims in the hope that they can be identified. Samuel Little, 78, confessed to killing 90 people over three decades last year, while already serving three life sentences for murder. The killings took place across the US between 1970 and 2005. Investigators say he targeted ""marginalised and vulnerable women"", and that some of their bodies went unidentified and deaths uninvestigated. Having heard all of his confessions, they believe he could be one of the most prolific serial killers in US history. Los Angeles, California: 'White female between 23-25 years old killed in 1996' 'White female killed in 1984. Met victim in Columbus, Ohio. Body disposed of somewhere in Northern Kentucky' Little, a former competitive boxer, would knock his victims out with punches before strangling them - meaning that there were not always ""obvious signs"" that the person had been killed. Now, they are hoping that Little's drawings can help them to finally find out who the victims were so that their families can be notified. ""With no stab marks or bullet wounds, many of these deaths were not classified as homicides but attributed to drug overdoses, accidents, or natural causes,"" the FBI said in its initial report in November last year. 'White female between 20-25 years old killed in 1972. Victim possibly from Massachusetts' 'Black female, age 26, killed between 1976 and 1979. Met victim in St. Louis, Missouri. Victim possibly called Jo' Although Little has been convicted of three murders, the FBI believes that he is responsible for many more. Little was first caught in 2012 when he was arrested on a drugs charge in a homeless shelter in Kentucky, and extradited to California. Once he was in police custody in Los Angeles, officers carried out DNA testing on him. The results linked him to three unsolved murders from 1987 and 1989, which were all in Los Angeles County. He pleaded not guilty at trial, but was eventually convicted and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences, with no chance of parole. 'Black female between 28-29 years old killed in 1984. Victim picked up in Memphis, Tennessee' Houston, Texas: 'Black female between 25-28 years old killed between 1976 and 1979 or in 1993' His three known victims were beaten and strangled, before their bodies were dumped in alleyways or bins. Before being convicted of murder Little had already built up an extensive criminal record, with offences from armed robbery to rape in a number of different states across the US. US serial killer 'confesses to 90 murders' Why was there a spike in serial killers? Little's case was passed on to the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Programme (ViCAP), which analyses people who serially commit violent and and sexual crimes. They then share their findings with local law enforcement in different areas, in order to check them against any unsolved crimes. ViCAP, tasked with doing a full background check on Little, noticed that the three LA killings were very similar to a number of unsolved deaths dating back to the 1970s. 'Black female between 35-45 years old killed in 1977. Met the victim in Gulfport, Mississippi. Victim possibly from Pascagoula. Victim possibly worked at Ingalls Shipyard.' 'Black female killed in 1976 or 1977. Body disposed of somewhere outside Wichita Falls (city unspecified).' Crime analyst Christina Palazzolo writes on the FBI website that they ""found a case out of Odessa, Texas, that sounded very much like him, and we could place him passing through the area around the same time"". In spring last year, investigators set up an interview with Little, hoping to find out more information. Knowing that he wanted to move prisons, they struck a deal - he could move prisons if he talked. Then, during the interview, Ms Palazzolo says ""he went through city and state and gave [us] the number of people he killed in each place"". Once he was done, he had confessed to 90 killings. The FBI says it has so far been able to verify 34 of these. Many of Little's victims were sex workers, people with substance abuse issues and trans women, whose deaths may not have been investigated or would have been ruled to be accidental at the time. His memory of the killings was mostly precise, as he could give details about where they happened and what car he was driving.  But he was unable to remember specific dates - which, investigators say, has caused further issues with identifying the victims. Agents are continuing to question Little and collect drawings of his victims. Other images are described as: Las Vegas, Nevada: 'Black female, age 40, killed in 1993' Monroe, Louisiana: 'Black female, age 24, killed between 1987 and the early 1990s' 'Phoenix, Arizona: 'White female killed in 1997. Victim possibly called Ann' White female, age 26, killed in 1983 or 1984. Victim possibly from Griffith, Georgia' Atlanta, Georgia: 'Black female between 23-25 years old killed in 1984. Victim possibly a college student' 'Hispanic female in her 40s. Killed in 1988 or 1996. Victim possibly from Phoenix' Atlanta, Georgia: 'Black female between 35-40 years old killed in 1981' Miami, Florida: 'Black [trans female], age 18, killed in 1971 or 1972.

Trump ex-aide lied to prosecutors,"Paul Manafort was found guilty of multiple fraud charges in 2018 Donald Trump's former election campaign chief Paul Manafort breached his plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller by lying to prosecutors, a US judge says. US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that Manafort ""made multiple false statements"" to the FBI, Mr Mueller's office and a grand jury. Mr Mueller leads a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election. Manafort has pleaded guilty to some charges, avoiding a separate trial. He was convicted of financial fraud in August, relating to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. He then accepted a plea deal on other charges in return for co-operating with Mr Mueller's investigation. Winners and losers from Manafort's plea deal Manafort: The man who helped Trump win Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? In her ruling on Wednesday, Judge Berman Jackson said there was evidence that showed Manafort had lied about three different topics, including his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant. Prosecutors claim Mr Kilimnik had ties to Russian intelligence. However, the judge cleared Manafort, 69, of allegations that he lied on two other subjects. The verdict means that Manafort - who has been held in a detention centre in Virginia since June - could now potentially face harsher sentences or have charges against him re-filed. Last year, Mr Mueller said that Manafort lied ""on a variety of subject matters"" after signing the plea deal. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""I feel very badly for Paul Manafort"" Last August, Manafort was convicted on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts. A month later he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice in a plea bargain with Mr Mueller. The agreement avoided a second trial on money laundering and other charges. The plea deal meant Manafort would face up to 10 years in prisonand would forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts - but deadlocked charges from the previous trial would be dismissed. It was the first criminal trial arising from the Department of Justice's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the presidential election. However, the charges related only to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign. Manafort worked for the Trump presidential campaign for five months in 2016 and was in charge when Mr Trump clinched the Republican party nomination. President Trump has branded the Mueller investigation a ""witch hunt"" and insisted there was no collusion between his team and Russia. Manafort was charged by Mr Mueller last October and during the trial he was accused of using 31 foreign bank accounts in three different countries to evade taxes on millions of dollars. Prosecutors presented evidence of Manafort's luxurious lifestyle, saying it was only possible because of his bank and tax fraud.

"'Too few' poor white university studentsPoor white students are not being recruited by many leading universities, says study.Family & Education","More than half of England's universities have fewer than 5% poor white students in their intakes, says an analysis of admissions figures. The report, from the National Education Opportunities Network (Neon), shows low numbers of white students from deprived areas in many top universities. There are 3% at the University of Oxford, compared with 28% at Teesside. The study says too few universities have clear targets to recruit white working-class students. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has warned of communities feeling ""left behind"". Labour says tackling the recruitment problem revealed by this report must be a ""priority"". Justine Greening, the first Conservative education secretary to have gone to a comprehensive school, says the figures should be a ""wake-up call"". ""We need new ideas, including on student finance, to make sure more white working class students have a fair chance to get into university,"" she says. The study, from an organisation promoting wider access into higher education, calls for a ""national initiative"" to tackle the educational underachievement of disadvantaged white youngsters across schools, colleges and universities. The admissions figures show the problem in recruiting white students from poorer backgrounds, particularly to some prestigious universities. Researchers warn that fewer than a fifth of universities have targets for poor white students - and that there are only ""variable"" efforts to improve participation. Even if a target of 5% of poor white students were to be set across universities, it would mean another 10,000 students going to university, says the research. League table changes 'toxic' for poor white schools Why do white working class students fail in school? Universities to target white, working class boys The study looks at white students from so-called ""low-participation neighbourhoods"" - areas where few people usually go to university. In total numbers, white students, of all social backgrounds, are the biggest group going to university, show figures from the Ucas admissions service. But in terms of a proportion of the population, white youngsters are less likely to go to university than Asian or black teenagers. The report calls for a much wider definition of what it means to improve access to university The latest application figures, for courses in the autumn, show that applications from white students are declining, while they are increasing for Asian and black youngsters. Cutting across this is a widening gender divide - with women much more likely than men to apply to university. When these factors combine, it means that white, working-class men become among the most under-represented groups in university. The study says projects to widen entry into university might need to be ""redefined"". The report shows a starkly divided picture in where poor white students are likely to attend. They are particularly likely to take higher education courses in local further education colleges. Among those going to university, 70% go to new universities, with low numbers going to some high-ranking institutions. Cambridge has 2%, Warwick and Bristol 3%, Durham 4%. At University of Sunderland, 27% are white students from deprived areas and 22% in Staffordshire University. The numbers are particularly low in London universities - many of them 1% or 2%. But these figures might be affected by the high overall levels of young people in London going to university - much higher than elsewhere in England. Because of such high entry rates, even from deprived youngsters, there are relatively few ""low-participation neighbourhoods"" in London, or young people who would fall into this category. The high cost of living in London could also deter some poorer students from elsewhere from coming to study in the capital. Graeme Atherton, report co-author and director of Neon, warned of ""big variability"" in the chances of different groups to get to university. ""We need to know more about why this variability exists and do more to eliminate it,"" he says. The director for fair access at the Office for Students, Chris Millward, said the study reveals ""the scale of work to be done"". He said universities will have to ""set out the work they will do to reduce the gaps in higher education participation and attainment between the most and least advantaged"". A spokeswoman for Universities UK said ""18-year-olds from the most disadvantaged areas in England are more likely to go to university than ever before"" - and this would be further helped if the government restored ""maintenance grants for those most in need"". Labour's shadow universities minister, Gordon Marsden, said the ""government and the Office for Students must work with universities on this as a priority"". ""This important study shows we must improve poor access to universities for disadvantaged young white children and especially boys,"" said Mr Marsden. Justine Greening, the former education secretary who has launched a social mobility project, said ""Britain can't afford talent going to waste"" and calls for ""ambitious and bold"" moves to widen access to university. Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: ""White British disadvantaged boys are the least likely of any large ethnic group to go to university. ""We need to ask ourselves why that is and challenge government, universities and the wider system to change that. ""It's vital that we do this to make sure that no part of our country feels as though it has been left behind."" Rankings 'toxic' for poor white schools Why do poor white pupils fail in school?

"Failed Garden Bridge project cost ÃÂ£53mAround ÃÂ£43m came out of the public's pocket, Transport for London said.London","A review of the project said Â£43m of taxpayers' money had been spent A failed plan to build a bridge covered with trees and flowers over the River Thames in central London cost a total of Â£53m, it has been revealed. A Transport for London (TfL) inquiry showed the Garden Bridge Trust spent Â£161,000 on a website and Â£417,000 on a gala for the abandoned project. The design of the bridge cost more than Â£9m and the charity paid its executives Â£1.7m. Around Â£43m came from the public's pocket, TfL added. Doubts began to surround the project, overseen by Boris Johnson, after it lost the support of London Mayor Sadiq Khan in April 2017. It was officially abandoned in August of that year aftera review recommended it be scrapped. Some of the main expenditure on the failed project In July 2015, up to Â£60m of public funding was made available to the trust - Â£30m each from Transport for London (TfL) and the Department for Transport (DfT). TfL will now pay a final Â£5.5m of public money to the trust as part of the scheme's cancellation agreement, which the transport body said was 40% lower than what it could have been. The payout will help refund donors including Â£3,200 to the winner of a Garden Bridge auction prize who did not receive their promised game of ""table tennis with Boris Johnson"". Labour London Assembly member, Tom Copley AM, said: ""It's galling to see the costs of Boris' botched Bridge continuing to escalate for London's taxpayers. ""David Cameron needs to answer why, in his eagerness to see Boris Johnson's scheme go through, he intervened to overrule the advice of senior civil servants in order to extend the underwriting for the Bridge."" This was the tiara on the Thames that lost its shine and then died. The project promised a lot but delivered nothing, swallowing Â£43m of public money in the process. The biggest expenditure was the Â£21m contract to build the bridge - with campaigners still wanting to know why that was allowed when land had not even been secured. There is an incredible amount of detail in the recent Transport for London report: it cost Â£161k for a website and Â£417k for a gala fundraiser. Critics say the spending was gratuitous. And while many wanted the bridge, others did not. The questions won't stop here. Caroline Pidgeon, chair of the London Assembly's transport committee, said: ""The details of wasted money spent on the Garden Bridge project is the final confirmation of the utter folly of the project. ""The Garden Bridge Trust have squandered public money in a way no responsible charity should have behaved. ""No charity needs to spend Â£160,000 on a website or over Â£400,000 on a gala dinner."" Director of City Planning at TfL, Alex Williams, said: ""We worked to ensure that the cost to the public sector has been kept to a minimum. ""We have now confirmed the final payment legally required under the terms of the underwriting agreement made by the Government. This formally ends our involvement with the project."" Plans proposed more than 270 trees and 2,000 shrubs would be planted on the bridge The idea of a ""floating paradise"" as a memorial to Princess Diana was suggested by Joanna Lumley as far back as 1998 The plan gathered momentum in 2012 and the following year then mayor Boris Johnson supported the scheme, pledging that TfL would help deliver it. It was also backed by then chancellor George Osborne Planning permission was granted in 2014 The scheme has been beset by problems over its funding andlacked support from some residents In September 2016,Sadiq Khan ordered a reviewto find out if value for money was being achieved In October 2016, the National Audit Office revealed David Cameron ignored the advice of his own civil servants not to provide further taxpayer funds to the Garden Bridge Trust because of the risks of it not going ahead In January 2017, accounts filed with Companies House showeda Â£56m shortfall in the trust's accounts In April, Dame Margaret Hodgeconcluded it would be better to ditch the projectrather than risk uncertain costs Following this report,Mr Khan withdrew his support In December 2017, Mr Johnsonwas called before the London Assemblyto give evidence on the project's failure MP calls for Garden Bridge inquiry Garden Bridge officially abandoned Garden Bridge complaint rejected Architects' Journal Leading law firm launches largest recruitment drive in its history Met Office issues 'hazardous' ice warning on roads across London after snow London crime statistics: Is knife crime worsening?

Mugger guilty of killing 100-year-old womanSofija Kaczan died of pneumonia after suffering a fractured neck when her handbag was snatched.Derby,"This video can not be played Zofija Kaczan death: 100-year-old's killer caught on CCTV A mugger has been found guilty of killing a 100-year-old woman whose neck was broken in a handbag robbery. Zofija Kaczan died of pneumonia on 6 June in Normanton, Derby, days after the attack. Mrs Kaczan was robbed near her home in Empress Road, Normanton, on 28 May as she made her way to church. Artur Waszkiewicz, 40, of Wolfa Street, Derby, had denied manslaughter and robbery but was convicted at Derby Crown Court. Police said Artur Waszkiewicz ""showed absolutely no concern for Mrs Kaczan"" Heroin addict Waszkiewicz knocked his victim to the floor, took her handbag and left her to bleed in the middle of the road. Polish-born Mrs Kaczan, who survived a Nazi camp during the Second World War, suffered multiple injuries, including a fractured neck and cheekbone. She later died of pneumonia brought on by the injuries. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Det Ch Insp Darren De'ath from Derbyshire Police said: ""This was a horrendous crime that shocked me, my colleagues, the community in which it happened and indeed the whole country. ""Mrs Kaczan survived the Nazi occupation of Poland before coming to Derby in 1948 to start her life afresh."" He added the victim was in ""remarkable health"" and was seen ""regularly walking to the church close to her home"". Mrs Kaczan, described as a grandmother with a heart of gold, suffered multiple injuries in the attack St Maksymilian Kolbe, the church Mrs Kaczan attended, said she was an active member of their community who enjoyed shopping, having her hair done and attending lunches at the Polish Centre followed by bingo. A spokeswoman said she had a ""very difficult early life"" but had found ""stability and tranquillity"" in Derby. ""That tranquillity was shattered by the brutal events of 28 May 2018,"" the spokeswoman added. ""Despite the pain and suffering that she was in for the last week of her life, she had the capacity to pray for her attacker before she died."" Zofija Kaczan prayed for her attacker before she died The jury deliberated for just over two hours before unanimously convicting Waszkiewicz. The defendant, wearing a black velvet jacket and velvet slipper shoes, looked straight ahead and showed no emotion as the verdicts were delivered. He was caught on CCTV driving a Seat Leon before robbing Mrs Kaczan - slowing down as soon as he saw a ""small, vulnerable"" woman on her own. He needed an ""easy target"" to steal from so he could meet a drug dealer a short time later to buy heroin. A receipt with Artur Waszkiewicz's fingerprint on it was found in the stolen bag, the jury heard After the bag-snatch, Waszkiewicz fled to London and hid under a bed at his mother's house to try to avoid arrest. He had also cut his long hair and changed the insurance details on his car. He was arrested after his fingerprint was recovered from a receipt in the handbag. Waszkiewicz, who was also born in Poland, was so desperate for cash to feed his addiction he had tried to sell his dog and asked a neighbour for money in the past. He had previous convictions for shoplifting, creating false identification documents and battery. He is due to be sentenced on Thursday.

Asked at a Politico website event, for a one-word answer on whether Churchill was a hero or villain, he paused and replied: ""Tonypandy - villain"". The Tonypandy riots saw troops sent to control striking miners who wrecked shops and mine owners' property. The wartime PM was voted the greatest Briton in a BBC poll in 2002. His grandson Sir Nicholas Soames described Mr McDonnell's remark as ""a very foolish and stupid thing to say"". The Conservative MPtold The Telegraph,external: ""I think my grandfather's reputation can withstand a publicity-seeking assault from a third-rate, Poundland Lenin. I don't think it will shake the world."" And the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The British public will reach its own judgement on this characterisation of Sir Winston Churchill."" The spokesman added that Theresa May had a portrait of Churchill hanging on the wall of her study in Number 10 and paid tribute to his ""strong leadership, determination and unwavering personality"" which ""inspired our country through our darkest hour"".

MPs set to debate Brexit next stepsTheresa May could face another defeat as some Tory Brexiteers may refuse to back the government.UK Politics,"MPs are voting on whether to back the government's Brexit strategy. They have rejected a Labour call for another vote on the withdrawal deal by 27 February by 322 votes to 306. The Commons also rejected an SNP call to delay Brexit by at least three months by 315 votes to 93 votes, after Labour abstained in the vote. Conservative backbencher Anna Soubry has withdrawn her amendment calling for official papers on the impact of a no-deal Brexit to be published. Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris indicated that Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington would meet Ms Soubry and would be publishing some information. Ms Soubry welcomed the move and said she reserved the right to lay the amendment again at end of February. The Labour amendment called for a vote on the withdrawal deal by 27 February, or for the government to allow Parliament to decide what happens next. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer had argued that would ""ensure a hard stop"" to prevent the prime minister ""running down the clock"" in a bid to force MPs to back her deal.

Brexit: A really simple guide But that has angered some Tory Brexiteers as MPs backed two motions on 29 January - one seeking an alternative to the controversial ""backstop"" element of the withdrawal deal and another one backing for a separate move to stop Brexit happening without a formal deal.

The government has warned a rebellion could damage the prime minister's negotiating position, as she seeks to make changes to the controversial backstop ""insurance policy"" in the deal to avoid customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. During Thursday's debate, former Brexit secretary David Davis urged Mr Barclay to be ""clear"" about whether the UK would still be leaving the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. Mr Barclay confirmed that it would but was challenged by Lib Dem MP Tom Brake about why he was respecting one Commons vote, but not the other. Mr Barclay replied that the Commons ""has said two different things"" as it had also passed legislation to say the UK would leave the EU on 29 March, ""by a large margin"" adding: ""The legislation frankly takes precedence over that motion.""

Ms Greening, a former education secretary who backs another EU referendum, described this approach as ""fundamentally wrong and anti-democratic"". Fellow Conservative Dame Caroline Spelman said ""equal respect"" must be given to both Commons motions adding: ""If he fails to do that, it is contemptuous of this House."" And Father of the House Ken Clarke said it was ""ridiculous"" to stick with the ""arbitrary"" 29 March departure date if no deal was in place. But DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said taking ""no deal"" off the table would weaken the UK's negotiating position: ""So those who call for no deal to be taken off the table are actually playing into the hands of the possibility of a no deal."" And Tory backbencher Peter Bone told MPs: ""The truth is that a no-deal Brexit, which of course is a deal coming out on WTO rules, is the answer. It gives clarity to business and it delivers what the British people voted for in June 2016."" Mr Barclay said the government's priority was to secure a deal and said: ""The only way to avoid 'no deal' is either to secure a deal on the terms the prime minister has set out... the only other option would be to revoke Article 50 (the process by which the UK will leave the EU)."" For Labour, Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister was ""pretending to make progress while running down the clock"". And he expressed anger at the ""macho way"" some Brexiteers talked about ""marching off the cliff"" without a deal and said he would ""take whatever steps are necessary"" to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

He pointed out an amendment tabled by Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn, to ensure MPs get a vote on Theresa May's deal by 27 February, makes no mention of a further referendum with the option of remaining in the EU. ""The idea that the Labour Party is not together and arguing against this disaster is, for me, entirely heartbreaking,"" he said.

The prime minister has promised to return to the Commons on 26 February with a further statement - triggering another debate and votes the following day - if a deal has not been secured by that date. If a deal is agreed, MPs will have a second ""meaningful vote"", more than a month after Mrs May's deal was rejected in the first one.

"PM plays down Brexit 'deal or delay' reportTheresa May tells MPs not to rely on hearsay, as Brexit dominates Prime Minister's Questions.UK PoliticsComments","Theresa May has played down reports that she could force MPs to choose between backing her deal or accepting a delay to EU withdrawal. ITV News said,externalchief UK negotiator Olly Robbins was overheard in a Brussels bar saying the EU was likely to allow an extension to the Brexit process. The PM suggested MPs should not rely on ""what someone said to someone else as overheard by someone else, in a bar"". ""It is very clear the government's position is the same,"" she said. ""We triggered Article 50 (the process by which the UK leaves the EU)... that had a two-year time limit, that ends on the 29 March. ""We want to leave with a deal, and that's what we are working for."" Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict No-deal Brexit plan for Channel Tunnel Kuenssberg: Will May delay vote to last minute? Commons Live: MPs discuss trade deals The prime minister has said she will lift the requirement for a 21-day period before any vote to approve an international treaty, which means she could delay the final Brexit vote until days before the UK is due to leave the EU. No 10 insists Mrs May still plans to hold a vote on a deal as soon as possible but Labour has accused her of ""running down the clock"" in an effort to ""blackmail"" MPs into backing her deal. And European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that ""no news is not always good news"", saying the EU was ""still waiting for concrete, realistic proposals from London"". Allow Twitter content?

At Prime Minister's Questions, the SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford urged Mrs May to rule out holding a ""meaningful vote"" on the deal with less than two weeks to go until Brexit. ""The prime minister must stop playing fast and loose - businesses are begging for certainty,"" he said. Mrs May said the way to give businesses certainty was to back the deal she had negotiated with the EU. But Mr Blackford told her she had been ""rumbled by your own loose-lipped senior Brexit adviser"". It was a reference to the ITV report that Mr Robbins was overheard saying he expected MPs to be presented with a choice of backing either a reworked withdrawal deal, or a potentially significant delay to Brexit. MPs rejected the deal negotiated with the EU by a historic margin in January and the prime minister says she is seeking legally-binding changes to the controversial ""backstop"" - the ""insurance policy"" aimed at avoiding a return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says MPs would force the PM to delay Brexit, rather than accept a no-deal scenario The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 29 March, whether or not a deal has been approved by the Commons. On Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn pointed to thedecision to scrap a no-deal Brexit contract with a ferry company that had no shipsas a ""spectacular failure"" which was ""a symptom of the utter shambles of this government and its no-deal preparations"". He described the prime minister's Brexit strategy as ""costly, shambolic and deliberately evasive"". Mrs May accused Mr Corbyn of preferring ""ambiguity and playing politics to acting in the national interest"" saying MPs did not know if he backed another referendum, a deal or Brexit. ""People used to say he was a conviction politician - not any more,"" she said. The PM has promised to return to the Commons on 26 February with a further statement - triggering another debate and votes the following day - if a deal has not been secured by that date. If a deal is agreed, MPs will have a second ""meaningful vote"", more than a month after Mrs May's deal was rejected in the first one. No 10 has indicated it is willing to make concessions on protection for workers but Labour's push for a closer future customs relationship than Mrs May proposes, remains a sticking point. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer met Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay on Wednesday for what he described as ""frank and serious discussions"". But he said he was given ""no suggestion"" that the prime minister was ""diluting red lines"". He added that he had ""set out the Labour Party position, which is the two options: On one hand a close economic relationship, on the other a public vote"". He said the battle for now is ""to stop the prime minister running down the clock"". Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has acknowledged that the prime minister cannot back Labour's Brexit proposals, and said he thinks Parliament is going to end up taking over the Brexit process. Asked at a Politico event on Wednesday how Labour was going to achieve its plans, including staying in a customs union, because, ""you know she can't back it... she'll split her party"", Mr Donnell replied: ""Yeah... yeah"". ""I genuinely think we're now into hard-nosed negotiations between pockets of support in all the different politics,"" he said. He accepted that the general election Labour has been calling for was ""unlikely"". Labour has tabled an amendment for Thursday that would force the government to come back to Parliament by the end of the month to hold a substantive vote in the Commons on its plan for Brexit. ""Our amendment says there should be a hard stop on February 26. The prime minister must either put up her deal or allow Parliament to take control,"" said Sir Keir. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mrs May told MPs on Tuesday she was discussing a number of options with the EU to secure legally-binding changes to the backstop, including replacing it with ""alternative arrangements"", putting a time limit on how long it can stay in place, or a unilateral exit clause so the UK can leave it at a time of its choosing. MPs are due to vote again on the Brexit process on Thursday in what was expected to be a routine procedure acknowledging the government's efforts.

They are angry at being asked to support the PM's motion, which combines the view backed by a majority of MPs last month that the government should seek an alternative to the backstop with a separate move to stop Brexit happening without a formal deal. How MPs aim to alter Brexit process Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide The group's deputy chairman, Mark Francois, told the BBC members had ""pleaded"" with Downing Street to change the wording, which he said goes back on what she has previously told MPs. ""We cannot vote for this as it is currently configured because it rules out no deal and removes our negotiating leverage in Brussels."" Most MPs want to avoid a no-deal scenario, fearing chaos at ports and disruption to business. However, some Brexiteers have played down that prospect arguing it is an example of ""Project Fear"". Meanwhile, Labour have highlighted a government risk assessment that says ""precisely four"" of about 40 documents designed to replicate the existing 40 EU free trade agreements have been signed. The party's trade spokesman Barry Gardiner said of the agreements, which were promised to be ready immediately after Brexit: ""Nine are off-track, 19 significantly off-track, four are not possible to be completed by March 2019 and two are not even being negotiated."" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox responded: ""A number of negotiations are at an advanced stage.
