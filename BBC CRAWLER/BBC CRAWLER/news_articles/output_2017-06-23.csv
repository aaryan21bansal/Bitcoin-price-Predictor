Hundreds of flats evacuated over fire risk fears,"This video can not be played Camden residents react to tower block evacuations More than 700 flats in tower blocks on an estate in the Swiss Cottage area of north-west London have been evacuated because of fire safety concerns. Camden Council said people in four towers on the Chalcots estate were moved for ""urgent fire safety works"". The council added it was booking hotels but around 100 residents have spent the night on air beds in a leisure centre. The estate's cladding is similar to Grenfell Tower in west London, where a fire is feared to have killed 79. Chalcots was refurbished between 2006 and 2009 by the same firm, Rydon, that oversaw work at Grenfell Tower in 2015-16. Camden Council said it will remove external thermal cladding from five tower blocks on the Chalcots estate. It also said there were concerns about the insulation of gas pipes going into flats, and fire doors. The council initially announced the evacuation of one tower block, Taplow, but later extended the move to all five tower blocks it had checked. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the council then announced that one of the five - Blashford - did not need to be evacuated, and residents could return. Blashford is smaller and has ""several different design elements"". This video can not be played Air beds laid out in Swiss Cottage leisure centre Residents of the estate attended a public meeting with council officials on Thursday evening. The council's Labour leader, Georgia Gould, said the decision to evacuate the buildings was made at 18:30 BST on Friday. She said the fire service ""told us they could not guarantee our residents' safety in those blocks"". Some residents said the first they heard of the evacuation was on the news. The council has secured 270 hotel rooms so far. Emergency accommodation was set up at Swiss Cottage leisure centre and at the Camden Centre in King's Cross. ""We're encouraging all residents to stay with friends and family if they can, otherwise we'll provide accommodation,"" the council said. ""I know it's difficult, but Grenfell changes everything and I just don't believe we can take any risk with our residents' safety and I have to put them first,"" Ms Gould said. This video can not be played Sajid Javid: ""Absolutely the right decision"" to evacuate buildings She said the work is expected to take three to four weeks. Residents will be allowed in at the weekend to collect more possessions under escort from the fire brigade. Prime Minister Theresa Maytweeted,external: ""My thoughts are with residents being evacuated in Camden while their homes are made safe tonight."" She said the government was ""offering every support we can"" to residents and officials working at the estate. Alex Regan, BBC News As the sun set on Swiss Cottage, there was frustration among residents of the Chalcots estate. With tower blocks being evacuated, the streets were teeming with neighbours, children, and cameramen. Camden Council employees wearing hi-viz vests stood outside the Taplow tower, speaking to residents. Some of them only realised their homes were being evacuated after hearing news reports. Most were not in the mood to talk. One woman shouted angrily at a TV cameraman: ""Can you tell me what's going on?"" Confusion as evacuation begins This video can not be played Camden Council head Georgia Gould: 'Residents' safety comes first' Teacher Kim Price, who lives in Blashford tower with her 14-year-old son, said: ""At 4pm today they said it would be okay and that all the checks were fine. ""And now all of a sudden the news is saying we should get out. ""We've had two letters in two days saying 'you're not safe' then 'you're safe'. I don't really know what to do."" Edward Strange, who lives in an 11th floor flat with his wife and young daughter, said the evacuation was a ""complete overreaction"". He told the BBC there had been two previous fires in the block which were easily contained. ""I've got a young daughter, a wife and a cat, I've also got a job. They said it'd take four to six weeks. If the council says four to six weeks it'll take four to six months."" Among those evacuated was Peter Bertram, 94, who has lived on the estate for 46 years. The former RAF airman, who served in World War Two, said having to leave his home at short notice was a ""shock"". ""My neighbour told me 'Get this and that'. It happened so quick, I don't have the energy for that now. It's an experience."" Bob O'Toole, chair of Chalcots Estate residents' association, told BBC Breakfast that contractors had been working overnight in several of the tower blocks. ""A lot of people are annoyed because of the way [the evacuation] was done. They're saying it was left too late in the evening. But Camden Council didn't get the information till late, and they acted on that as quickly as possible."" Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said other areas, such as Plymouth and Manchester, had seen measures introduced such as 24-hour fire wardens and did not need evacuating. ""What was very different here is that the local fire service found multiple other failures in fire safety that should have already been in place in the towers, and as a result of that, they've made this quite correct decision."" Mr Javid also said the government would ""work with"" any local authorities and housing associations that needed financial support to carry out necessary fire safety work in tower blocks. ""Public safety is absolutely paramount, you cannot put a price on people's lives. So local authorities have to do whatever it takes to get their buildings safe."" The estate underwent a Â£66m refurbishment Samples from the tower blocks on the Chalcots estate were examined this week Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said people who were in towers where cladding was being investigated would be ""living in fear"". ""I've had hundreds of constituents contacting my office over the last week, asking whether the buildings they're living in are safe. ""People need to give significant weight to the voice of residents, and if they do want to be moved, if they feel unsafe and haven't been reassured, then provision should be put in place [to move them]."" Camden Council agreed a contract with Rydon Construction torefurbish the Chalcots estate in May 2006 at a cost of Â£66m. The work took more than three and a half years. Five towers received new cladding, and 711 flats were modernised with new wiring, heating, kitchens and bathrooms. Friday night's announcement came as theMetropolitan Police said the Grenfell Tower fire started in a fridge-freezer, and outside cladding and insulation failed safety tests. 'Safety comes first' for tower block dwellers Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire London fire: Who are the victims? A national operation to identify buildings with cladding similar to that used in Grenfell Tower has seen local authorities send samples for independent tests. The Department for Communities and Local Government said 14 residential high-rise buildings in nine local authority areas have now been found with cladding that raises safety concerns.

Radiohead mesmerise fans at Glastonbury,"Thom Yorke thanked the Eavis family ""for having us at your lovely farm today"" Absorbing, challenging and achingly beautiful - Radiohead delivered a typically Radiohead sort of set for Glastonbury's opening night. The Oxford quintet emerged, bathed in white light, to the haunting piano refrain of Daydreaming, from last year's A Moon Shaped Pool album. Two hours and 25 songs later, they closed with Karma Police, singing: ""For a minute there, I lost myself."" It felt like a perfect metaphor for the band's power to transport an audience. The performance came on the 20th anniversary of Radiohead's first headline set at Glastonbury. That show, which took place just weeks after they released OK Computer, has often been called the festival's best ever. Glastonbury quiz: Test your knowledge In pictures: Glastonbury highlights However, frontman Thom Yorke recently told BBC 6 Music he had been on the verge of walking off the stage, after the band's monitors exploded, meaning they could not hear each other. ""I just went over to Ed [O'Brien, guitarist] and said, 'I'm off mate, see you later,'"" he recalled. ""He turned around and went, 'If you do, you'll probably live the rest of your life regretting it.' I went, 'Good point.'"" This video can not be played Thom Yorke on Radiohead's 1997 Glastonbury performance BBC Glastonbury - How to watch and listen Bradley Cooper surprises Glastonbury fans Get to know Glastonbury's headliners Full Glastonbury line-up There were no such problems on Friday night, as the band embarked on a career-spanning set that held their experimental and anthemic qualities in perfect balance. Airbag was thrilling, Pyramid Song devastating, and Everything In It's Right Place a pulsing, twisted Radiohead version of a club classic. They even pulled out the much-maligned Creep - the angsty, teenage anthem that gave them early success, but became a millstone around their necks as they matured into a fearlessly experimental art-rock outfit. Things got political - briefly - during No Surprises, where the lyric ""bring down the government, they don't speak for us,"" elicited a huge cheer from the festival's left-leaning audience. As the song ended, Yorke commented: ""See you later, Theresa. Just shut the door on your way out."" That aside, the frontman rarely spoke during the set, except to thank Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis ""for having us at your lovely farm today"". ""Thank you very much for coming to this field to listen to us this evening,"" he added during the encore. ""Probably we'll see you in some other fields over the weekend."" Radiohead were preceded on the Pyramid Stage by indie-dance band The xx, whose spiralling, hypnotic songs soundtracked dusk on Worthy Farm. Immediately before them, rock group Royal Blood celebrated with champagne on stage as their second album, How Did We Get So Dark, entered the charts at number one. Speaking to the BBC, singer Mike Kerr said the band were bowled over by the two events converging. ""We definitely have a sense that this is a one-off thing. It's something I'll look back on as a very special time."" Elsewhere on Friday, there were sets from Sleaford Mods, Clean Bandit, Dizzee Rascal, The Lemon Twigs and Flaming Lips. Lorde's stage show was one of the day's most elaborate Lorde performed as her second album, Melodrama, entered the charts at number five On The Other Stage, pop star Lorde began her set ""trapped"" inside a clear plastic box that tilted back-and-forth above her band. Once she emerged onto the stage, she dedicated a recently-released song, The Louvre, to anyone in the audience who was harbouring a secret crush. ""Shut your eyes and listen to the song, and just will it to happen,"" she said. ""Maybe they will kiss you tonight. Who knows?"" The star last visited Glastonbury as a guest of Metallica in 2014 ActorBradley Cooper appeared on the Pyramid Stageto film a scene for his new movie, a remake of the musical A Star Is Born. He then introduced Kris Kristofferson, who was watched from the side of the stage by fellow Hollywood star Brad Pitt. Johnny Depp also joined the singer-songwriter, who was 81 yesterday, playing guitar on one of the songs. Depp caused controversy on Thursday, as he joked about assassinating Donald Trump during an appearance at Glastonbury.He has since apologised. Former footballer David Beckham also made his first visit to Glastonbury, to help organiser Michael Eavis launch a new social housing project. He planted a tree at the development in the nearby village of Pilton, before heading to the event with his 18-year-old son, Brooklyn. If they stick around until Saturday, they will see acts including Stormzy, Katy Perry, Liam Gallagher and headliners the Foo Fighters. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will also appear on the Pyramid Stage to introduce US rap act Run The Jewels.

Sex game death man guilty of manslaughter,"Kevin Adams left Dohoon Kim tied up with a gas mask on his face A man whose sexual partner died after he left him tied up with a gas mask on his face has been found guilty of manslaughter. Dohoon Kim, 36, was found dead on the bedroom floor after meeting Kevin Adams, 54, at Mr Adams' home in Swindon for sex in June 2015. Bristol Crown Court heard the pair had taken drugs before engaging in ""extreme"" sexual activity. Adams was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter. The court heard Adams, of Exmouth Street, Swindon, met Mr Kim on a dating website two years earlier. In the early hours of 12 June, Adams called 999 saying Mr Kim, from Slough, Berkshire, was unresponsive and not breathing. Dohoon Kim, 36, was found dead at Adams' home in Exmouth Street, Swindon in June 2015 When paramedics arrived, they found Mr Kim had been dead for some time with a gas mask to one side of him and a pile of ropes and restraints nearby. A post-mortem examination found Mr Kim had an ""excessive"" level of mephedrone - sometimes known as M-Cat - in his body. It was concluded he died from a combination of the restriction of his airways and the effect of the drugs both he and Adams had taken. The jury decided Adams had failed to remove the gas mask or restraints or check the condition of Mr Kim, who was left lying on the floor, before he went to sleep. Adams will be sentenced on Monday.

Saudis 'foil suicide attack' in Mecca,"The building collapsed after a suicide bomber blew himself up, the Saudi interior ministry said Saudi Arabia says it has foiled a ""terrorist action"" against the Grand Mosque in Mecca - Islam's holiest site. A suicide bomber blew himself up when security forces surrounded the building he was in, the interior ministry says. The building collapsed, injuring 11 people, including police officers. Five other suspected militants have been taken into custody, officials say. Millions of Muslims from around the world have gathered in Mecca for the end of Ramadan. Saudi officials released no further details about the foiled attack. Muslim worshippers pray at the Kaaba at the Grand Mosque in Mecca Saudi Arabia has in recent years seen a series of deadly attacks, many of which were claimed by so-called Islamic State. Most assaults have targeted the country's Shia minority and security forces. In July 2016, four security officers were killed in a suicide attack near the Prophet's Mosque in Medina.

UK's Brexit offer 'below expectations',"This video can not be played May: I want to give EU residents certainty European leaders have criticised the UK's offer to EU nationals after Brexit - with one senior figure claiming it could ""worsen the situation"" for them. European Council President Donald Tusk said the plan was ""below expectations"" while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there had been ""no breakthrough"". Theresa May conceded there were differences between the two sides. But the prime minister said those who had ""made their lives and homes"" in the UK would have their rights guaranteed. She also suggested that while rights would be enforced by British courts, they could also be enshrined in international law if the agreement was included in the final treaty of withdrawal. Q&A: What is UK offer? May unveils Brexit offer for EU citizens Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? Brexit: All you need to know Both the UK and the rest of the EU say they want to come to an arrangement to secure the status of the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries. This video can not be played EU chief's one word response to May's plan Under plans announced on Thursday by Mrs May, the UK envisages giving all EU citizens the right to stay after the UK's exit - due on 30 March 2019 - and granting those resident for at the least five years the same rights to welfare, pensions and education as UK citizens. However, no cut-off date for the package has been specified by Downing Street and further details of the plans will not be released until Monday. The offer has received a mixed response from EU leaders with some describing it as a ""good start"" but calling for more detail. Speaking at a joint press conference with French president Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was a ""long way to go"". ""That was a good beginning but - and I'm trying to word this very carefully - it was not a breakthrough,"" she said. ""We don't want a wedge to be driven between us. We do want to make our interests very clear and if there is no guarantee for the full freedoms, then this exercise will have to lead to a situation where there are certain effects on the future relationship between the UK and the 27 member states."" Mr Tusk, who represents the other EU 27 nations, said the EU would ""analyse line by line"" the UK's proposals when they were published in full but his ""first impression is that the UK's offer is below our expectations and that it risks worsening the situation of citizens"". And Joseph Muscat, the prime minister of Malta - who currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU - warned of people being ""treated differently"" depending on when they arrived in the UK. By political editor Laura Kuenssberg While complex, this summit was perhaps a brief respite from the brooding turmoil in her own party, where questions about the viability of her leadership lurk. Governing is doing, not fending off enemies - and at least today, Theresa May has done that. There was also a big hint about how the British negotiators hope to get round one of the big obstacles. As we've discussed before one of the big gaps between the two negotiating sides here are who will police the rules on citizen's rights. So, if something goes wrong, who can they appeal to, how will their rights be protected. The EU side is adamant that it can only be the European Court of Justice. Theresa May has been totally insistent that it can't be them. At the press conference this afternoon she repeated that it would be the British courts in charge. So far, so the same. But she then tantalisingly - if you are a nerd like me - said that because the rights would be agreed as part of the withdrawal treaty, they would be therefore subject to international law. Therefore, theoretically, that means they could be enforced by an international court of some variety. Lawyers suggest that is not likely to be the Hague, but could be some kind of new organisation that had British and European lawyers involved.Read more EU nationals in the UK currently have a right to permanent residence, granted after they have lived in the UK, legally and continuously, for five years. The European Union has said EU citizens should continue enjoying the same rights as they do now on a lifetime basis, enforceable by the European Court of Justice. But the UK's view is that British courts should have jurisdiction as they will be enshrined in UK law. This video can not be played ""There are still so many unknowns"" on future of EU citizens says ex-Czech Europe Minister Mrs May said there had been a ""very positive"" discussion with other EU countries. She acknowledged differences over their enforcement but said she ""remained of the view that this is a fair and serious offer"". 'Devil in the detail' of EU citizens deal EU prepares to move agencies from London ""Let's be clear about what we're saying. What we're saying is that those citizens from EU countries who have come to the United Kingdom, those EU citizens who have made their lives and homes in the UK will be able to stay and we will guarantee their rights,"" she said. The PM said the issue would be one of the first to be discussed and she wanted an agreement as soon as possible. In response to claims by the former chancellor George Osborne,in an article for the Evening Standard,external, that she had ""blocked"" calls for the UK to offer a unilateral guarantee of rights in the aftermath of last year's referendum, she said that was ""certainly not my recollection"" of events. Anne-Laure Donskoy, founding member of the 3million - which aims to protect the rights of EU citizens living in the UK - said the UK's offer was ""disappointing"" and ""really falls short of our expectations"". ""It is like a teaser this statement, it gives you general direction of travel potentially, but there are things in the statement that need to be unpicked."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the government to guarantee all UK-based EU citizens full residency rights, saying the current offer ""doesn't go far enough and leaves uncertainty for those who have been here for less than five years"". ""These are people who are working here and have families here - we have to end their uncertainty.""

Term-time holiday dad found guilty,"Jon Platt admitted he was relieved the case had come to an end A father who fought a long-running legal battle after taking his daughter on a term-time holiday to Disney World Florida has been found guilty over the unauthorised trip. Jon Platt was convicted of failing to secure his child's regular attendance. He lost an earlier legal challenge at the Supreme Court in April, despite winning previous legal battles in a case brought by Isle of Wight Council. Platt was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay Â£2,000. Jon Platt lost his legal challenge at the Supreme Court in April The case - over a Â£120 fine - returned to Isle of Wight Magistrates' Court earlier where Paul Greatorex QC, for Platt, had argued the prosecution should not continue and was an ""abuse of process"". He suggested none of the documents published by the council or the primary school on attendance made it clear when a penalty notice would be given. ""It's completely vague, it does not give the guidance that parents are entitled to expect,"" he said. Mr Platt told the court he did not believe he had seen a number of documents from the school setting out changes to absence rules. He said a form from the school, when he applied for the seven-day absence in 2015, had noted that attendance of between 90% and 95% was satisfactory, which his child fell into. Truancy prosecutions in England in 2015 Proceeded against:  19,920 (16,430 in 2014) Found guilty: 14,890 (12,479 in 2014) Fined: 11,493, average fine Â£176. Immediate custody: 8 Suspended sentence: 111 Community sentence: 553 Conditional discharge: 2,280 Absolute discharge: 306 Source: PA But Ben Rich, counsel for Isle of Wight Council, said giving clear guidance did not mean spelling out every consequence of any action. He argued the school was not required to make sure that every letter sent home was read, and that the council's code of conduct had made it clear that a penalty notice could be issued for a term-time holiday. Giving the judgment, magistrate Jeannie Walker said: ""The circumstances of this case fall squarely into that breach of school rules."" The case has cost taxpayers Â£140,000. Speaking after the hearing Mr Platt said he was ""disappointed"" by the verdict. ""I didn't want to lose but there's a part of me that is actually relieved. ""If we'd won today, it seems pretty clear the Isle of Wight Council on the abuse of process argument may well have sought to appeal to the High Court and I desperately needed this all to be over.""

Router hack risk 'not just on Virgin Media',"Virgin Media's Super Hub 2 had a weak default password A weakness that left thousands of Virgin Media routers vulnerable to attack also affects devices by other providers, security experts suggest. Virgin Media's Super Hub 2 was criticised for using short default passwords that could easily be cracked by attackers. But experts raised concerns that older routers provided by BT, Sky, TalkTalk and others were also at risk. They recommend users change their router password from the default. This video can not be played How safe is your router? ""It's a bit unfair that Virgin Media has been singled out here. They made a mistake - but so have many other internet service providers,"" said Ken Munro from security firm Pen Test Partners. ""This problem has been known about for years, yet still ISPs [internet service providers] issue routers with weak passwords and consumers don't know that they should change them."" The weakness in Virgin Media's Super Hub 2 was highlighted in an investigation by consumer group Which? The company has sinceadvised customers,externalusing default network and router passwords to update them immediately. However, a BT spokeswoman told the BBC: ""We are not impacted by the hub issues affecting Virgin Media."" Other providers have yet to comment. Many routers are sent to customers with a default wi-fi password already set up. Some use a long password with mixture of upper and lower-case letters, numbers and sometimes symbols. But others use short passwords with a limited selection of characters, and many follow a pattern than can be identified by attackers. The Virgin Media Super Hub 2 used passwords that were just eight characters long, and used only lower-case letters. That gives cyber-criminals a framework to help them crack passwords quickly, using a dedicated computer. ""Because the default wi-fi password formats are known, it's not difficult to crack them,"" said Mr Munro. Once an attacker has access to your wi-fi network, they can seek out further vulnerabilities. Default passwords that follow patterns are easier to crack Mr Munro said the problem was well-known, but the Which? investigation had reignited discussion. ""It has popped up again because attention has been drawn to the fact that very few people change their wi-fi password from the one written on the router,"" he told the BBC. Experts recommend that people change the default wi-fi password and router's admin password, using long and complex passwords to make life more difficult for attackers.

US police shoot at dog but kill teenager,"Armando Garcia-Muro was trying to restrain the dog when he was shot and killed Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies mistakenly shot and killed a teenager when a bullet ricocheted off the pavement during a dog attack, they say. The 17-year-old died when a ""skip"" round struck him in the chest at around 03:40 local time on Thursday. Two officers fired shots at the dog, which moments earlier had bitten one officer's knee. It had been restrained by the boy, but had broken free again. An officer was also hit in the leg by a bullet fragment, investigators say. Los Angeles Sheriff Captain Christopher Bergner said Armando Garcia-Muro's death was ""an extremely, extremely unfortunate incident"". ""Our initial impression was [the deputies] didn't even see the individual coming around from the side of the building,"" he said during a press conference near the location where the shooting occurred in the city's Palmdale neighbourhood. Armando was about to enter his final year of high school.

He said that five officers had arrived at the residence on Thursday morning after receiving reports of a loud party. The dog attacked deputies, who then retreated to call for backup and medical support, but it then attacked again, officers stated. After being struck by bullets, the dog retreated, and officers following to be sure that it was contained and unable to attack again. That's when they discovered Armando's body, about 30ft (10 metres) behind where the dog had been. Deputies provided medical aid at the scene. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he died.

Skirt-wearing boys win shorts victory,"The pupils acted to bring about a change in uniform policy Boys who wore skirts to school in a protest have won the right to wear shorts to lessons from next year. The boys from Exeter's ISCA Academy had been told shorts were banned because they were not part of the uniform. But the school has now said ""as summers are becoming hotter"" shorts will be brought in as uniform next year. It said it could not allow an immediate change to uniforms because it ""would put undue pressure on some of our families"". More on the school skirt protest, and other stories from across Devon and Cornwall. It also said that, ""recognising the recent temperatures"", students were allowed not to wear their jumper or blazer. Ties were allowed to be undone and pupils were allowed to have the top button on their shirts undone and to wear their shirts untucked ""if they are feeling very hot"". It added that none of the estimated 30 boys had been penalised for wearing skirts in the protest. Theschool uniform guidelines,externalcurrently allow male pupils to wear trousers.

Reality Check: What has happened since the Brexit vote?,"It's a year since the referendum in which the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, and it's safe to say that no-one yet knows how this is going to turn out. This month's general election has only served to heighten the sense that much of the Brexit process is still unknown - particularly the final destination. So what has changed in the past year? Well, in terms of the process, in March the UK triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, the formal route out of the EU that has never been put to the test before. And - after an unexpected UK election that produced an unexpected result - formal face-to-face negotiations on the terms of divorce finally began earlier this week. But there has been only one day of meetings between the two chief negotiators - David Davis and Michel Barnier - and there is an enormous amount still to do. That worries EU officials in particular. Brexit and the UK economy one year on UK's Brexit offer 'below expectations' The next few months will be crucial. By October we should know whether a deal looks achievable on the elements of separation that the EU intends to focus on first: citizens' rights, a financial settlement, and the future status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. For now, all we know is that the two-year period for Article 50 negotiations is due to come to an end on 29 March 2019, and unless all parties agree on an extension, that is when the UK will leave the EU. Amid all this uncertainty, what about some of the claims that reverberated around the referendum campaign last year? The claim:Â£350m a week going to the EU that could go to the NHS The verdict:The famous Â£350 million-a-week slogan daubed on the side of a Vote Leave bus has beendebunked many times. It wasn't true then, and it isn't true now. The UK didn't send Â£350m a week to the EU because the rebate was deducted before any money was sent, and there's no sign that such a sum will be plucked from a magic money tree to be sent to the NHS when we leave. A big concern for the NHS post-Brexit is whether it will be able to recruit the staff it needs to keep services going. The number of nurses from the EU registering to work in the UK has dropped from 1,304 in July 2016 to just 46 in April 2017. That's a problem because 6.9% of nurses and health visitors in the NHS and 9.3% of doctors come from countries elsewhere in the EU (and the European Economic Area). The fall in the number of EU nurses registering for work is part of a pattern that has seennet migration to the UK falleven before Brexit happens. Thelatest figures from the ONS,externalshow fewer EU citizens arriving in the UK and more leaving. What we don't yet know is what kind of immigration system the government plans to introduce when it brings free movement of people from the rest of the EU to an end. The claim:Another prominent claim from the leave campaign in the run-up to the referendum last year was that Turkey was on the verge of joining the EU, and the UK couldn't do anything to stop it. The verdict:Again,not true thenand not true now. In fact, since the referendum, Turkey has lived through an attempted military coup, a massive crackdown on opposition and dissent, and a sharp deterioration in human rights. Several countries are calling openly for stuttering membership talks to come to an end, and Turkey feels further away than ever from joining the EU. The claim:There were many warnings of dire economic consequences from the remain side during the referendum campaign. The verdict:A Treasury analysis that a leave vote wouldtip the UK into recessionand cause an ""immediate and profound"" economic shock has proven to be unfounded. That may be partly because so little actually happened in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result. It took nine months to trigger Article 50, and for much of the past year there was a sense of a phoney war as the country digested what had just taken place. But many of the economic forecasts were about what might happen after we actually leave, and we're nowhere near that point yet. However, there has been one clear economic consequence of the Brexit vote that has had a knock-on effect on inflation: a sustained fall in the value of the pound. During the course of the past year, sterling has fallen by as much as 19.3% against the US dollar and 15.5% against the euro. It has recovered slightly, but on Thursday the pound was 15% lower than it was on 23 June 2016 relative to the dollar, and 13.2% lower against the euro. The claim:Another economic argument, used this time by the leave campaign, was that the UK would be well advised to leave an economic union that was in terminal decline. The verdict:In fact the latest projections from the OECD predict that the UK economy will grow by 1.6% this year and 1% next year, while the euro area will grow by 1.8% in both 2017 and 2018. The World Bank is more optimistic about the UK economy, and the eurozone still has some serious underlying issues to grapple with. Perceptions can change quickly, but the election in France of a new young president in Emmanuel Macron has reinforced the idea that perhaps - just perhaps - the EU has got its mojo back, just as the UK shuffles towards the exit door. So where do we go from here? All in all, it feels like there still has not been an honest debate in the UK about what Brexit actually means in practice. Both the main parties avoided any serious detail during the course of the election campaign. But debate has resumed aboutalternative models- the Swiss model and the Norwegian model - that were discussed at length before and after the referendum, only to be discarded once Theresa May announced that she was determined that the UK would leave the single market and the customs union. Debate about the long-term destination, and the prospects for a lengthy transition period, will intensify in the coming months. But there is an urgent need for progress on some of the more immediate practical issues. As a direct result of the decision to leave the EU, the government plans legislation that will totally recast national policy on immigration, customs, trade, agriculture and fisheries, nuclear safeguards and international sanctions, as well as the ""Repeal Bill"" that will transpose all EU rules and regulations into British law. It is a vast undertaking. It is remarkable how much we still don't know about how this process is going to unfold. One year on from the referendum, we are in many ways none the wiser.

Radiohead on rare form at Glastonbury,"Thom Yorke thanked the Eavis family ""for having us at your lovely farm today"" Absorbing, challenging and achingly beautiful - Radiohead delivered a typically Radiohead sort of set for Glastonbury's opening night. The Oxford quintet emerged, bathed in white light, to the haunting piano refrain of Daydreaming, from last year's A Moon Shaped Pool album. Two hours and 25 songs later, they closed with Karma Police, singing: ""For a minute there, I lost myself."" It felt like a perfect metaphor for the band's power to transport an audience. The performance came on the 20th anniversary of Radiohead's first headline set at Glastonbury. That show, which took place just weeks after they released OK Computer, has often been called the festival's best ever. Glastonbury quiz: Test your knowledge In pictures: Glastonbury highlights However, frontman Thom Yorke recently told BBC 6 Music he had been on the verge of walking off the stage, after the band's monitors exploded, meaning they could not hear each other. ""I just went over to Ed [O'Brien, guitarist] and said, 'I'm off mate, see you later,'"" he recalled. ""He turned around and went, 'If you do, you'll probably live the rest of your life regretting it.' I went, 'Good point.'"" This video can not be played Thom Yorke on Radiohead's 1997 Glastonbury performance BBC Glastonbury - How to watch and listen Bradley Cooper surprises Glastonbury fans Get to know Glastonbury's headliners Full Glastonbury line-up There were no such problems on Friday night, as the band embarked on a career-spanning set that held their experimental and anthemic qualities in perfect balance. Airbag was thrilling, Pyramid Song devastating, and Everything In It's Right Place a pulsing, twisted Radiohead version of a club classic. They even pulled out the much-maligned Creep - the angsty, teenage anthem that gave them early success, but became a millstone around their necks as they matured into a fearlessly experimental art-rock outfit. Things got political - briefly - during No Surprises, where the lyric ""bring down the government, they don't speak for us,"" elicited a huge cheer from the festival's left-leaning audience. As the song ended, Yorke commented: ""See you later, Theresa. Just shut the door on your way out."" That aside, the frontman rarely spoke during the set, except to thank Glastonbury organisers Michael and Emily Eavis ""for having us at your lovely farm today"". ""Thank you very much for coming to this field to listen to us this evening,"" he added during the encore. ""Probably we'll see you in some other fields over the weekend."" Radiohead were preceded on the Pyramid Stage by indie-dance band The xx, whose spiralling, hypnotic songs soundtracked dusk on Worthy Farm. Immediately before them, rock group Royal Blood celebrated with champagne on stage as their second album, How Did We Get So Dark, entered the charts at number one. Speaking to the BBC, singer Mike Kerr said the band were bowled over by the two events converging. ""We definitely have a sense that this is a one-off thing. It's something I'll look back on as a very special time."" Elsewhere on Friday, there were sets from Sleaford Mods, Clean Bandit, Dizzee Rascal, The Lemon Twigs and Flaming Lips. Lorde's stage show was one of the day's most elaborate Lorde performed as her second album, Melodrama, entered the charts at number five On The Other Stage, pop star Lorde began her set ""trapped"" inside a clear plastic box that tilted back-and-forth above her band. Once she emerged onto the stage, she dedicated a recently-released song, The Louvre, to anyone in the audience who was harbouring a secret crush. ""Shut your eyes and listen to the song, and just will it to happen,"" she said. ""Maybe they will kiss you tonight. Who knows?"" The star last visited Glastonbury as a guest of Metallica in 2014 ActorBradley Cooper appeared on the Pyramid Stageto film a scene for his new movie, a remake of the musical A Star Is Born. He then introduced Kris Kristofferson, who was watched from the side of the stage by fellow Hollywood star Brad Pitt. Johnny Depp also joined the singer-songwriter, who was 81 yesterday, playing guitar on one of the songs. Depp caused controversy on Thursday, as he joked about assassinating Donald Trump during an appearance at Glastonbury.He has since apologised. Former footballer David Beckham also made his first visit to Glastonbury, to help organiser Michael Eavis launch a new social housing project. He planted a tree at the development in the nearby village of Pilton, before heading to the event with his 18-year-old son, Brooklyn. If they stick around until Saturday, they will see acts including Stormzy, Katy Perry, Liam Gallagher and headliners the Foo Fighters. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will also appear on the Pyramid Stage to introduce US rap act Run The Jewels.

Children electrocuted in Turkish pool,"Those affected were treated at the scene but could not be saved Three children and two adults who tried to rescue them have been electrocuted in a water park in north-western Turkey, local media say. The incident happened in the town of Akyazi, in Sakarya province, 100km (62 miles) east of Istanbul. The park manager and his son dived in to help the three children. The five, believed to be all Turkish, were taken to hospital but could not be saved. It was unclear how the pool had become electrified. Rescuers and park personnel flushed the pool's water away as others turned off electricity in the facility. One other person was injured in the incident and taken to hospital. An investigation has already begun. The Hurriyet newspaper named the park manager as Mehmet Kaya, 58, and his son as Kadir Kaya, 30. The children were aged 12, 15 and 17, Turkish media said.

Tesco wages to rise 10.5% over two years,"Hourly pay rates for Tesco store staff will rise by 10.5% over the next two years, the supermarket has said. But pay remains lower than at Aldi and Lidl and overtime pay on Sundays and Bank Holidays is being cut. Currently Tesco workers are paid Â£7.62 an hour, which will rise to Â£8.42 an hour by November 2018. The pay rise will put Tesco workers' pay above the Â£7.90 level that the National Living Wageis expected to,externalreach by 2018. The National Living Wage is the effective minimum wage for adults aged 25 and over, and is currently Â£7.50. Those under the age of 25 are entitled to a lower minimum wage rate. Statutory minimum pay rates will continue to rise until at least 2020, according to recent government Budgets, and companies are planning for those changes, as well as striving to remain competitive with rivals in order to recruit and retain staff. Wage growth in the UK has been slow in recent years, but inflation has risen and other supermarkets have increased the wages they pay. Aldi recently announced a rise in hourly pay to Â£8.53 an hour; Lidl's website says it pays store staff Â£8.45 an hour. Tesco said it would increase hourly pay in three stages: to Â£8.02 in November 2017, then to Â£8.18 in July 2018 and to Â£8.42 in November 2018. ""This reward package sees our biggest investment in store pay for a decade, and gives colleagues a sustainable pay deal that rewards them for everything they do, while allowing us to also attract new talent,"" said Tesco UK chief executive, Matt Davies. The retailer said maternity pay terms had also been improved. But extra pay for Sundays and bank holidays will be reduced from time-and-a-half to time-and-a-quarter after July 2018. ""This is designed to meet the government legislative requirement around the minimum wage. ""As expected, most of the businesses who have had to face up to this rise have had to reduce premiums and other perks that employees benefitted from in order to meet the core wage rises,"" said retail analyst Steve Dresser.

Bradley Cooper surprises Glastonbury fans,"The star last visited Glastonbury as a guest of Metallica in 2014 Film star Bradley Cooper made a surprise appearance on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, as he shot a scene for his new film. The Hangover star is currently directing and starring in a remake of A Star Is Born, the Judy Garland-starring musical about an up-and-coming singer. He appeared at Glastonbury ahead of Kris Kristofferson's set, holding a guitar and followed by cameras. Cooper and his co-star Lady Gaga shot similar scenes at Coachella in April. Before leaving the stage, Cooper thanked the audience: ""You guys were awesome, that was great - it's my sheer pleasure to introduce Kris Kristofferson."" The festival opened on Friday morning with a minute's silence, to honour those affected by the recent tragedies in London and Manchester. The moment of reflection was led by New Order's Peter Hook, whose daughter attended the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester last month, where 22 people died. ""Can we please use this as a chance to send our hopes and our prayers for love, life and freedom,"" he said. ""[They're] the things we're all here to celebrate. ""We send our sympathies to everyone affected by the events in London and Manchester, and everyone affected in Grenfell tower. God bless you all."" As the silence ended, Happy Mondays singer Rowetta, appearing alongside Hook in a Manchester T-shirt announced: ""You got the love"".

Chrissie Hynde, wearing a Motorhead t-shirt, dedicated the song Hymn To Her to organisers Michael and Emily Eavis, and paid tribute to the late Clash frontman Joe Strummer. ""If he's still anywhere near this planet, he's here today,"" she said, as novelist John Niven watched from the side of the stage. He had a recentTwitter spat with JK Rowling,externalover the language he used to describe Prime Minister Theresa May. Dua Lipa said she danced on stage ""like I'd never danced before"" In the afternoon, pop star Dua Lipa drew one of the biggest crowds so far to the John Peel stage. Thousands of people packed out the tent, with the audience stretching beyond the perimeter, as she played hits including Hotter Than Hell, Be The One and Blow Your Mind (Mwah). Speaking to the BBC as she came off stage, the 20-year-old was clearly overwhelmed. ""It's been my favourite, favourite performance on stage I've ever done,"" she beamed. ""I've never seen so many people. ""It was just the most magical day in my life. Maybe even the best day of my life, apart from the day my brother and sister were born."" However, Dua threw herself into the performance so heavily she caused herself an injury. ""I've mashed my tailbone,"" she said. ""It was already bruised, then I went on stage and danced like I'd never danced before. Now I can barely walk."" Organisers Michael Eavis posed for selfies with fans, and sang Elvis in a karaoke bar, on Thursday Later on Friday, Radiohead top the bill, exactly 20 years after their first headline appearance. Guitarist Ed O'Brien said they would ""leave their ego at the gate"" and embrace the spirit of the festival. Footballer David Beckham is also due to visit Worthy Farm on Friday, after organiser Michael Eavis invited him to open a local social housing project. Although Friday marks the start of festivities, revellers have been arriving since gates opened on Wednesday. Those in the know were treated to ""secret"" sets by indie band Circa Waves and alt-pop experimentalists Everything Everything on Thursday night at the small Williams' Green stage. For Everything Everything, the short, 40-minute performance gave them the opportunity to revisit the scene of ""the best gig we've ever had in our lives"". This video can not be played Everything Everything on their not-so-secret show Two years ago, the band played the stage in the same week they released third album, Get To Heaven, ""and in the time that elapsed, the listeners had learnt all the words and were singing them back"", singer John Higgs told BBC News. ""It was a really amazing, moving moment for us all."" Thursday's show was almost a re-run of that show, as fans joined in with the band's new single, Can't Do. Although their set was not part of the official line-up, several thousand fans got wind of the show, and the audience spilled out of the tent into the surrounding fields. The festival kicked off after two days of build-up ""I keep getting texts from people I haven't seen for years saying, 'Oh, you're playing tonight, aren't you?'"" joked drummer Michael Spearman. ""You can't really keep anything secret, not in this day and age,"" added Higgs. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Failings led to murder by patient,"Len Hodkin with his mother Sally Hodkin, 58, who was killed by Nicola Edgington in 2011 A series of NHS and police failings led to the brutal murder of a woman by a psychiatric patient, a report has found. Nicola Edgingtonattacked Sally Hodkin, 58, with a butcher's knifein Bexleyheath, south London, in 2011. The attack happened six years after Edgington had killed her own mother. On the day of the murder, Edgington repeatedly called police and told A&E staff she needed to be sectioned because she felt like killing someone. Edgington was taken to Oxleas House mental health unit in Greenwich to be admitted, but was allowed to walk out of the unit on 10 October 2011 to commit the crime. She got a bus to Bexleyheath, bought a large knife from Asda and stole a steak knife from a butcher's shop. She then stabbed grandmother Mrs Hodkin and another woman in the street. She was convicted of murder and attempted murder for those two attacks. Edgington had previously been convicted in 2006 of the manslaughter of her mother Marion at her home in Forest Row, East Sussex, and ordered to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act. Nicola Edgington had been ordered to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act after being convicted in 2006 of killing her mother The damning report,externalcommissioned by NHS England and released on Friday found staff at the Bracton Centre, run by Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, deemed Edgington fit for discharge after three years. It said Bracton Centre staff were too willing to accept Edgington's version of events and said documents failed to detail all concerns about her behaviour before discharge. She was released in 2009 and allowed to live in the community. After she was freed, Edgington was moved to accommodation with low levels of supervision and was also allowed to visit her husband in Jamaica. Oxleas staff also failed to take seriously warnings made by her brother and sister that Edgington was still unwell and potentially dangerous, the report said. The report found correspondence from the trust to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), which approved the discharge, ""did not fully reflect"" concerns that had been raised about her disruptive, abusive and rude behaviour on the ward. It also did not document her denial of any memory of killing her mother and her ""fixation on making fast progress to discharge"". Overall, ""reports... did not accurately reflect disruptive and aggressive behaviours described in the clinical notes"", NHS England concluded. The MoJ also asked for details of any concerns during the Jamaica trip, which could have led to Edgington being readmitted to a mental health unit, but these where never handed over by the trust. When Edgington was discharged, Greenwich Police should have been informed of her release but the trust failed to forward on the paperwork, the report added. On the day of the murder, when Edgington was taken to Oxleas House following several hours in A&E asking to be sectioned, a member of Oxleas staff missed an opportunity to give her the highest risk rating. She was put down for 15-minute observations - a level deemed ""inadequate"" by investigators, who believed she should have had one-to-one monitoring while waiting to be admitted to the unit. The report also pointed to missed opportunities by the police to section Edgington under the Mental Health Act on the day of the murder. Police staff also did not carry out a Police National Computer (PNC) check during their repeated interactions with her which would have alerted them to her conviction for manslaughter. Mrs Hodkin's son Len, 40, a solicitor from Eltham, said Edgington should ""never have been released in the first place"" after killing her own mother and should have been ""recalled to hospital when her behaviour deteriorated"" after she was discharged. He added his mother's death was ""entirely preventable"".

Is Depp in trouble over Trump remarks?,"This video can not be played Johnny Depp: ""When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?"" Actor Johnny Depp has caused controversy after he appeared to threaten US President Donald Trump at the Glastonbury Festival. ""When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?"" he asked the crowd. It is a crime in the US to make threats against the president, so could his remarks get him into trouble? As he introduced a screening of his film The Libertine, Johnny Depp asked the audience: ""Can you bring Trump here?"" After receiving jeers from the crowd, he added: ""You misunderstand completely. When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?"" The comment seemed to be a reference to the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by actor John Wilkes Booth in 1865. ""I want to clarify,"" he added. ""I'm not an actor. I lie for a living [but] it's been a while. Maybe it's about time."" Johnny Depp talks of Trump 'assassination' Under the United States Code,external(Title 18, Section 871), threatening the US president is a class E felony. Anyone who ""knowingly and wilfully"" makes ""any threat to take the life of, to kidnap, or to inflict bodily harm"" upon the US president could be sentenced to up five years and/or be fined. It also includes the vice-president and presidential candidates. The US Secret Service is the agency tasked with investigating suspected cases. And US media reported that the service was aware of the actor's comments. But, when it comes to statements made by artists, courts have usually declared the cases to be protected speech under the First Amendment to the US Constitution. Stanford University Law Professor Nathaniel Persilytold USA Today newspaper:,external""People are allowed to wish the president dead,"" up to the point they express a real intent to harm him. ""To threaten someone you need words that encourage some sort of action."" No.Singer Madonna said earlier this yearthat she had thought ""an awful lot about blowing up the White House"", sparking furious reaction from Trump supporters. She later said her remarks were taken out of context. Reacting to the controversy, one Secret Service official told the New York Post that any action against her would depend on whether the remarks were considered a genuine threat - which could also be the case with Johnny Depp now. The official said then:,external""It's all about intent. Is she intending to do harm to the White House or President Trump? Otherwise it will be characterised as inappropriate."" Other cases includedrapper Snoop Dogg, who shot a toy gun at a Donald Trump character in a music video andcomedian Kathy Griffin, who posted a photo in which she appeared to hold a fake bloodied head that resembled Mr Trump. 'Comedy's golden opportunity in Trump era' This video can not be played Fired comedian Kathy Griffin weeps: ""Trump broke me"" And earlier this month,a show in New Yorkdepicted the assassination of a Julius Caesar that resembled Mr Trump, sparking not only criticism but also threats. Despite the angry responses sparked by all those cases, there was no public acknowledgment that officials were investigating them as genuine threats against the president. But, after the storm caused by Griffin's photos, the Secret Servicesaid on Twitter,externalthat it had a ""robust protective intelligence division"" monitoring ""open source reporting and social media"" to evaluate threats, adding that: And here is an example of that: a man in the state of Illinoiswas charged this month,externalwith threatening the president after posts he made on Facebook. Perhaps it all goes down to the controversial nature of Mr Trump. Artists say it is part of their work to be provocative and have often cited freedom of expression to protect what they do and to convey political messages. But critics, including Trump supporters and the president himself, say many have crossed the line of what it is acceptable, suggesting a double standard when it comes to remarks against the president. Comedy writer 'suspended' over Barron Trump jibe But during the presidential campaign last year, Mr Trump himselfwas accused by his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, of inciting violence by saying that gun rights supporters could stop her from winning. He was not investigated.

Hundreds of flats evacuated over cladding,"This video can not be played Camden residents react to tower block evacuations More than 700 flats in tower blocks on an estate in the Swiss Cottage area of north-west London have been evacuated because of fire safety concerns. Camden Council said people in four towers on the Chalcots estate were moved for ""urgent fire safety works"". The council added it was booking hotels but around 100 residents have spent the night on air beds in a leisure centre. The estate's cladding is similar to Grenfell Tower in west London, where a fire is feared to have killed 79. Chalcots was refurbished between 2006 and 2009 by the same firm, Rydon, that oversaw work at Grenfell Tower in 2015-16. Camden Council said it will remove external thermal cladding from five tower blocks on the Chalcots estate. It also said there were concerns about the insulation of gas pipes going into flats, and fire doors. The council initially announced the evacuation of one tower block, Taplow, but later extended the move to all five tower blocks it had checked. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the council then announced that one of the five - Blashford - did not need to be evacuated, and residents could return. Blashford is smaller and has ""several different design elements"". This video can not be played Air beds laid out in Swiss Cottage leisure centre Residents of the estate attended a public meeting with council officials on Thursday evening. The council's Labour leader, Georgia Gould, said the decision to evacuate the buildings was made at 18:30 BST on Friday. She said the fire service ""told us they could not guarantee our residents' safety in those blocks"". Some residents said the first they heard of the evacuation was on the news. The council has secured 270 hotel rooms so far. Emergency accommodation was set up at Swiss Cottage leisure centre and at the Camden Centre in King's Cross. ""We're encouraging all residents to stay with friends and family if they can, otherwise we'll provide accommodation,"" the council said. ""I know it's difficult, but Grenfell changes everything and I just don't believe we can take any risk with our residents' safety and I have to put them first,"" Ms Gould said. This video can not be played Sajid Javid: ""Absolutely the right decision"" to evacuate buildings She said the work is expected to take three to four weeks. Residents will be allowed in at the weekend to collect more possessions under escort from the fire brigade.

She said the government was ""offering every support we can"" to residents and officials working at the estate.

With tower blocks being evacuated, the streets were teeming with neighbours, children, and cameramen. Camden Council employees wearing hi-viz vests stood outside the Taplow tower, speaking to residents. Some of them only realised their homes were being evacuated after hearing news reports.

The former RAF airman, who served in World War Two, said having to leave his home at short notice was a ""shock"". ""My neighbour told me 'Get this and that'. It happened so quick, I don't have the energy for that now. It's an experience."" Bob O'Toole, chair of Chalcots Estate residents' association, told BBC Breakfast that contractors had been working overnight in several of the tower blocks. ""A lot of people are annoyed because of the way [the evacuation] was done. They're saying it was left too late in the evening. But Camden Council didn't get the information till late, and they acted on that as quickly as possible."" Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said other areas, such as Plymouth and Manchester, had seen measures introduced such as 24-hour fire wardens and did not need evacuating. ""What was very different here is that the local fire service found multiple other failures in fire safety that should have already been in place in the towers, and as a result of that, they've made this quite correct decision."" Mr Javid also said the government would ""work with"" any local authorities and housing associations that needed financial support to carry out necessary fire safety work in tower blocks.

Camden Council agreed a contract with Rydon Construction torefurbish the Chalcots estate in May 2006 at a cost of Â£66m. The work took more than three and a half years.

'Safety comes first' for tower block dwellers,"Steve spent the night away from his tower block home Residents of three Plymouth tower blocks have been speaking to the BBC after learning the cladding on the structures has been given the lowest safety rating. Steve spent the night elsewhere after learning of the results of the tests on the three Mount Wise blocks, which were carried out following theGrenfell Tower tragedy. On receiving news of the rating, Steve said he wasn't prepared to risk spending the night at his high-rise flat. He said it was ""human instinct"" to be concerned. ""It was just the initial thought of finding out about our flats after what happened in London,"" he said. ""You think, if it happened in London... it doesn't bear thinking about."" Steve, 34, lives in the Tamar tower, one of the three Mount Wise towers named Tavy, Tamar and Lynher, which are coloured blue, red and green respectively. The blocks, which dominate the Devonport industrial area of the city, are due to have their cladding taken off in a few days, according to the local MP. They are run by housing provider Plymouth Community Homes (PCH). Devonport is the most deprived of Plymouth's39 neighbourhoods,externaland among the poorest 10% nationally. Its residents have a life expectancy of 10 years less than those people living in the city's most affluent areas. Steve, who lives on the seventh floor, said he'd never had any problems and that PCH were ""spot on"". ""Our alarms have always been really good - if anything they're too sensitive - but you'd much rather that than not know about a fire. They go off if you boil the kettle. ""They [PCH] were coming round yesterday - they even changed my letterbox to a different one because of safety. ""It's still in our protocol to stay put [if a fire breaks out], but I'd be trying to get out. When you think of the times I have had my children stay here, it just brings it home."" The towers, which house a total of 270 flats, were designed and built in the early 1960s and reclad in 2000. John Clark, CEO of Plymouth Community Homes, said the safety tests were carried out as an ""immediate response"" to the government's instruction following the Grenfell Tower tragedy. He said: ""It [the cladding] has been found to be aluminium-coated with a polyethylene core, which has been rated as category 3 under the new controlled test conditions. ""The fire rating scale goes from 0 to 3 (with 0 being the highest safety score and 3 being the lowest)."" There are immediate changes, such as additional fire protection panelling being added to stairwells and checks on fire doors. And there are longer-term changes to be made, such as the installation of heat detectors and a sprinkler system. John Charrington, 67, also lives in Tamar. He said: ""I'm a bit nervous while the cladding is still on. ""When I saw the pictures from London I thought 'that's the cladding going up'. You could see the way it was whizzing up the building. ""The next day people were chatting about whether it was safe. ""There's been lots of people here checking the buildings and photographing alarms, but I've got no idea how long it's going to take them."" Diane McHenry, who has lived in Tavy for 24 years, said she cried when she saw the Grenfell Tower fire on TV. ""I felt safe anyway - we have good smoke alarms - but it's good that they're taking it off. It's filthy and disgusting and should have come down years ago."" Poster Ian Harley, who is chair of Mount Wise Towers Residents Association, said his phone didn't stop ringing for two days after the Grenfell tragedy. ""Obviously people were very concerned,"" he said. ""Having said that, we managed to get hold of PCH and they have been incredibly quick in getting on top of this. ""They carried out three inspections to look at specific issues within a matter of hours. When asked how concerned residents are, he said ""they're not"". ""We've already got a smoke alarm system, carbon monoxide alarms in every flat. All the doors have been uprated - the law only requires 30-minute fire doors to isolate each flat and PCH have insisted on 60 minutes, so much, much, much better than anything the law requires. ""They've taken on board what we say. When it comes to tenant safety and security, the cost implications seem to go out the window. The bottom line is, safety comes first.""

More questions than answers - what you want to know about Brexit,"What do you want to know about the Brexit talks? As EU citizens living in the UK and UK expats in other EU states continue to ponder their futures,Brexit negotiations have started in Brussels. Over the past year, we have been inviting you to send in your questions about the whole process. We have already answered some questions... Could the UK take over existing EU trade deals? Brexit court ruling: Your questions answered ... but others are still awaiting definitive answers, which may only become clear at the every end of the negotiations. So, for now, here are your questions awaiting answers: Many of the questions below are examples which were asked multiple times and in many ways, while others are specific to those who asked. Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals? What rights will EU citizens lose under the current proposal? What will happen to the matter of combining pension contributions from different EU countries to build up your pensions, and will this remain? Can UK-born children of EU nationals (living here more than 20 years) be able to register as British citizens rather than naturalising? What kind of document will I be provided with to prove I have rights to stay in the UK as a citizen, travelling to Europe and back? If one already has a document certifying permanent residency would he/she still need to apply for ""UK settled status""? Will the ""settled status"" be lost if you leave the UK for two years (like Permanent Residency)? What happens to EU citizens who have not lived in the UK for five years? I plan to retire to France within the next two years to join close friends and to buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit? I am due to marry my German fiancee this year when she moves to the UK. Will spouses still be required to have five years of residence? I'm an EU national, three-and-a-half years in the UK. My wife is a resident married to an EU national. Is her status going to change? I'm a Brit living in Europe with a brain tumour and a daughter born in 2001 in Finland: Will my daughter be allowed to stay in UK if we have to relocate? How does this offer differ from the already existing application process for permanent residency which is based on five-year residence? Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019? Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over EU citizens rights living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit? How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? By the UGC and Social Media Team What happens now that a deal's been done?

'My miracle daughter died from asthma',"Olivia Dennis was 10 when she died from an asthma attack Lisa Dennis is looking at photos of her daughter Olivia - a blonde girl with a radiant smile. These are special moments, frozen in time. Olivia died four years ago, aged 10, after having an asthma attack. Her parents did not even know their gymnastics-loving daughter had the condition. But Olivia is not the only child to lose their life to asthma. According to the latest data for England and Wales, 37 children and teenagers died from the disease in 2014. The figure has risen over the past five years. But many of these deaths are thought to be preventable. Lisa vividly remembers the night Olivia died. It was a bitterly cold night, and they were at home in Kent. Lisa, who is married and has a younger son, told BBC News: ""We'd tried so long to have children, and when she came along, it was just a miracle for us. ""Olivia was a really special, beautiful girl. ""That night, she was on all fours on the bed - and struggling to breathe. ""She collapsed onto the floor. I tried CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation], but unfortunately it didn't work. Olivia's parents want an end to complacency about asthma ""I'll never forget being at the hospital and the consultant asking us if Olivia was asthmatic. ""I said, 'No, but she has an inhaler.' He said to us there and then, 'Your daughter is asthmatic.'"" Lisa's ongoing grief is compounded by her frustration about what she says is a lack of awareness of asthma. She had been given an inhaler for an allergy, but Lisa says the word ""asthma"" was never mentioned to the family, and the medicine was issued by repeat prescription. Asthma is a common but unpredictable illness It affects the airways and can lead to shortness of breath, coughing and a tight feeling in the chest One in 11 children is affected Inhalers need to be used regularly and effectively The blue inhalers provide relief during an attack, while the brown ones are for more regular use to prevent flare-ups Steroids via an inhaler reduce the inflammation from asthma The UK has some of the highest asthma death rates in Europe The feeling is shared by Dr Satish Rao, from Birmingham Children's Hospital, who runs an NHS service in the West Midlands for difficult asthma cases. He said: ""One of the biggest frustrations for us is the complacency among healthcare professionals about asthma in children and young people. ""We have struggled to convince professionals that asthma is a serious illness, and that patients can die from a severe attack. ""It's probably because it's a common illness, and quite often we hear staff saying, 'Oh, it's just asthma.'"" Dr Rao believes many deaths could be prevented by better information about when to seek medical help. And he is aware of 16 cases in his region where schools have to work very closely with families and give them extra support to make sure the children keep their condition under control. The number of child asthma deaths has risen steadily from 17 in 2010 to 37 in 2014. Portsmouth GP Dr Andy Whittamore, who is also Asthma UK's clinical lead, says it can be difficult to get young patients to adhere to taking their medicine. He said: ""With children particularly, there's lots of fear about the medicine itself - and from their parents too. ""Steroids have got a bad press because of abuse by bodybuilders and doping in the Olympics. ""But the doses we give are in very low levels - and if taken correctly, they only go directly into the lungs."" These misconceptions can be fuelled by stigma, with asthmatic children in particular not wanting to be seen as weak or inferior. Asthma UK has even found that teenagers sometimes shied away from using inhalers because they thought their shape resembled that of sex toys. Bereaved mother Lisa believes much more can be done. She said: ""Everyone needs to look at their children - especially anyone with an inhaler - because asthma is a killer. ""And I think doctors need to recognise that and make families aware because this is serious, desperately serious."" Lisa wants to see awareness posters in GP surgeries, more regular reviews and plans for young asthma patients, and an improved inhaler design so the actual device contains advice for bystanders helping with an attack. These are simple measures, which could help save lives.

Laura Kuenssberg: Ideas on the table for citizens' rights,"Hostility at home, barely warmer in Brussels. There was relief that the UK is at last putting its ideas on the table but concerns over the British plans for EU citizens reflect Theresa May's fundamental bind. She faces a united opposing front here in Brussels, at least for now. There are clashing expectations from the public at home - who want different things from departure. And of course varying strands of thought and demands from inside her own party. Even a leader at the peak of their powers would struggle to deal with all that. While complex, this summit was perhaps a brief respite from the brooding turmoil in her own party, where questions about the viability of her leadership lurk. Governing is doing, not fending off enemies - and at least today, Theresa May has done that. There was also a big hint about how the British negotiators hope to get round one of the big obstacles. As we've discussed before one of the big gaps between the two negotiating sides here are who will police the rules on citizen's rights. So, if something goes wrong, who can they appeal to, how will their rights be protected. The EU side is adamant that it can only be the European Court of Justice. Theresa May has been totally insistent that it can't be them. At the press conference this afternoon she repeated that it would be the British courts in charge. So far, so the same. But she then tantalisingly - if you are a nerd like me - said that because the rights would be agreed as part of the withdrawal treaty, they would be therefore subject to international law. Therefore, theoretically, that means they could be enforced by an international court of some variety. Lawyers suggest that is not likely to be the Hague, but could be some kind of new organisation that had British and European lawyers involved. Sources in government have suggested it is a course the UK is likely to pursue, even though it has not been the subject of extensive discussions yet between the two sides. It could be, hypothetically, an elegant solution to avoid the clash, if the EU is amenable. Sources on the UK side also suggest that it's unreasonable of the EU to expect EU judges to continue to rule on British citizens abroad, as well as expecting EU judges to continue to rule on EU citizens in Britain. If the arrangement is truly to be reciprocal, they argue, then wouldn't it be more fair for British judges to rule on British expats abroad, and vice versa. There are many long, tangled arguments ahead, but at least, in the last forty eight hours, ideas are now being discussed. UK's Brexit offer 'below expectations' What is UK offering EU citizens?

Macron goes on a Brussels charm offensive,"Mr Macron attended his first meeting of the European Council An enormous smile on the red carpet. A flirtatious wink for the BBC's political editor. Emmanuel Macron laid on the charm from the second he stepped out of his limo at his first meeting of the European Council in Brussels. At the president's mid-summit press conference, French journalists fought each other for the microphone to ask him a question. Everyone else just took pictures on their phones. He wooed the EU, saying it was ""a pleasure"" being there, ""to look at so many subjects that are dear to me."" The German newspaper Der Spiegel called him ""The Summit Conqueror"". ""Macronmania"" was the word used by others. In the build-up to these talks, Brussels officials pointed to Mr Macron's election as proof that voters still believed in the EU. ""It's a return to the time of Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel,"" said one diplomat, referring to the duopoly that has often dominated the European Union. ""It's better than just having Chancellor Merkel running things on her own,"" he added. France's ambitious man 'on the move' The meteoric rise of France's youngest president Is he the anti-Trump? The double act was sealed with a joint press conference at the end of the summit. It was standing-room only. ""When France and Germany disagree, then Europe cannot progress,"" he said. The German-French duopoly has often dominated the EU It left journalists pondering what to call them: Merckron or Macrel? Although some commentators felt the Frenchman struck a more protectionist tone than Mrs Merkel, who spoke approvingly of upcoming EU trade deals. European Parliament President Antonio Tajani observed Mr Macron's first encounter with his 27 counterparts. ""He's a highly intelligent man, at ease with the other leaders. But charm isn't an issue. They're politicians,"" he told the BBC. And Mr Macron is being taught the realities of summit life. His comments about an influx of eastern European workers being one of the causes of the UK's vote to leave the EU prompted a diplomatic row with some of his colleagues. ""Poland is open to co-operation but it depends on Macron what it will look like: whether he will want to show off his hostility to eastern Europe in the media or have a fact-based discussion,"" said the Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo. And it looks like Mr Macron's big idea of giving the EU powers to block some foreign investment in sensitive areas of the European economy will be watered down. ""It's been downgraded,"" said one diplomatic source. In Brussels Mr Macron is learning that the smile and the winks only get him so far.

Reality Check: What's happened since Brexit vote?,"It's a year since the referendum in which the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, and it's safe to say that no-one yet knows how this is going to turn out. This month's general election has only served to heighten the sense that much of the Brexit process is still unknown - particularly the final destination. So what has changed in the past year? Well, in terms of the process, in March the UK triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, the formal route out of the EU that has never been put to the test before. And - after an unexpected UK election that produced an unexpected result - formal face-to-face negotiations on the terms of divorce finally began earlier this week. But there has been only one day of meetings between the two chief negotiators - David Davis and Michel Barnier - and there is an enormous amount still to do. That worries EU officials in particular. Brexit and the UK economy one year on UK's Brexit offer 'below expectations' The next few months will be crucial. By October we should know whether a deal looks achievable on the elements of separation that the EU intends to focus on first: citizens' rights, a financial settlement, and the future status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. For now, all we know is that the two-year period for Article 50 negotiations is due to come to an end on 29 March 2019, and unless all parties agree on an extension, that is when the UK will leave the EU. Amid all this uncertainty, what about some of the claims that reverberated around the referendum campaign last year? The claim:Â£350m a week going to the EU that could go to the NHS The verdict:The famous Â£350 million-a-week slogan daubed on the side of a Vote Leave bus has beendebunked many times. It wasn't true then, and it isn't true now. The UK didn't send Â£350m a week to the EU because the rebate was deducted before any money was sent, and there's no sign that such a sum will be plucked from a magic money tree to be sent to the NHS when we leave. A big concern for the NHS post-Brexit is whether it will be able to recruit the staff it needs to keep services going. The number of nurses from the EU registering to work in the UK has dropped from 1,304 in July 2016 to just 46 in April 2017. That's a problem because 6.9% of nurses and health visitors in the NHS and 9.3% of doctors come from countries elsewhere in the EU (and the European Economic Area). The fall in the number of EU nurses registering for work is part of a pattern that has seennet migration to the UK falleven before Brexit happens. Thelatest figures from the ONS,externalshow fewer EU citizens arriving in the UK and more leaving. What we don't yet know is what kind of immigration system the government plans to introduce when it brings free movement of people from the rest of the EU to an end. The claim:Another prominent claim from the leave campaign in the run-up to the referendum last year was that Turkey was on the verge of joining the EU, and the UK couldn't do anything to stop it. The verdict:Again,not true thenand not true now. In fact, since the referendum, Turkey has lived through an attempted military coup, a massive crackdown on opposition and dissent, and a sharp deterioration in human rights. Several countries are calling openly for stuttering membership talks to come to an end, and Turkey feels further away than ever from joining the EU. The claim:There were many warnings of dire economic consequences from the remain side during the referendum campaign. The verdict:A Treasury analysis that a leave vote wouldtip the UK into recessionand cause an ""immediate and profound"" economic shock has proven to be unfounded. That may be partly because so little actually happened in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result. It took nine months to trigger Article 50, and for much of the past year there was a sense of a phoney war as the country digested what had just taken place. But many of the economic forecasts were about what might happen after we actually leave, and we're nowhere near that point yet. However, there has been one clear economic consequence of the Brexit vote that has had a knock-on effect on inflation: a sustained fall in the value of the pound. During the course of the past year, sterling has fallen by as much as 19.3% against the US dollar and 15.5% against the euro. It has recovered slightly, but on Thursday the pound was 15% lower than it was on 23 June 2016 relative to the dollar, and 13.2% lower against the euro. The claim:Another economic argument, used this time by the leave campaign, was that the UK would be well advised to leave an economic union that was in terminal decline. The verdict:In fact the latest projections from the OECD predict that the UK economy will grow by 1.6% this year and 1% next year, while the euro area will grow by 1.8% in both 2017 and 2018. The World Bank is more optimistic about the UK economy, and the eurozone still has some serious underlying issues to grapple with. Perceptions can change quickly, but the election in France of a new young president in Emmanuel Macron has reinforced the idea that perhaps - just perhaps - the EU has got its mojo back, just as the UK shuffles towards the exit door. So where do we go from here? All in all, it feels like there still has not been an honest debate in the UK about what Brexit actually means in practice. Both the main parties avoided any serious detail during the course of the election campaign. But debate has resumed aboutalternative models- the Swiss model and the Norwegian model - that were discussed at length before and after the referendum, only to be discarded once Theresa May announced that she was determined that the UK would leave the single market and the customs union. Debate about the long-term destination, and the prospects for a lengthy transition period, will intensify in the coming months. But there is an urgent need for progress on some of the more immediate practical issues. As a direct result of the decision to leave the EU, the government plans legislation that will totally recast national policy on immigration, customs, trade, agriculture and fisheries, nuclear safeguards and international sanctions, as well as the ""Repeal Bill"" that will transpose all EU rules and regulations into British law. It is a vast undertaking. It is remarkable how much we still don't know about how this process is going to unfold. One year on from the referendum, we are in many ways none the wiser.

The desperate fight for IS 'capital' Raqqa,"This video can not be played ""Welcome to Raqqa"": Watch Gabriel Gatehouse's full report As a battle to eject so-called Islamic State from Mosul grinds on, across the border in Syria, an alliance of US-backed fighters is advancing on the IS stronghold of Raqqa. The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse is one of the first reporters to reach the city. This has been a long and brutal road. Driving through the suburbs of Raqqa towards the centre, we pass collapsed buildings, hit by American air strikes, and pockmarked shop fronts, caught between the advance of the Syrian Democratic Forces and the retreating fighters who call themselves Islamic State. As the SDF, a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, pushes forwards, carts emerge, piled high with people and belongings, flying white flags. Some of these families sought refuge in Raqqa from other battles in Syria's long war, only to find themselves now back at the centre of the fighting. Others are emerging from years inside a living nightmare. ""They slaughtered us,"" says one man, a local house painter. ""They told us we were unbelievers, even though we are Muslims from birth, fasting and praying."" There are still tens of thousands ofpeople inside Raqqa, hostages to a regime that has been killing anyone who tries to leave. A Kurdish fighter looks across Raqqa after a coalition air strike ""We pray that God will have revenge against Islamic State,"" a woman says, clutching a small child. ""Everything that's happened to us is because of them."" The SDF made rapid advances through the outskirts of the city earlier this month, their progress eased by US air strikes and artillery. That bombardment continues: every so often the dull thud of a falling shell is followed by a cloud of dust over the centre of the city. A rare glimpse inside Raqqa Life inside 'Islamic State' Has IS's leader been killed? Trump and the battle for eastern Syria But now that SDF forces have reached the edge of the old city, the advance has slowed. IS fighters are hemmed in inside these narrow streets. Bombed from the air and surrounded on three sides, they are fighting back, with all the means at their disposal. We drive closer towards the centre. A sound overhead signals the presence of an IS drone: a small, remote-controlled helicopter that can drop a hand grenade, unseen, from the sky. On the top floor of a building overlooking the old city, a group of SDF fighters suddenly comes under fire. ""Sniper, sniperâ¦"" someone shouts. A woman in camouflage fatigues lies face-down on the ground and loads a heavy-calibre sniper rifle, loosing off rounds in the direction of the IS fire. Among the Kurds, men and women fight alongside one another. The sniper's name is Delilah. She is 22 years old, and was studying to become a nurse. But it is here, on the front lines, that she seems to have found her true calling. ""When I hit my target and I kill the enemy I become very happy,"" she says, laughing in between bursts of heavy gunfire. ""It boosts our morale and our power. We are protecting our friends and our people."" Delilah swapped nursing studies for the front line Returning from the front, exhausted fighters describe intense, all-night battles, as so-called Islamic State uses its network of tunnels to stage sneak attacks behind the SDF lines. ""They surrounded us. They were shooting from every side,"" says an Arab fighter who calls himself Mashuk. ""They caught one of us, they took him hostage. But we managed to get him back."" Drones, tunnels, suicide bombs, snipers: even in war, IS has weaponised fear. It has done this perhaps more successfully than any other group. The battle for Raqqa will be a long, hard fight.

Questions not answers: what you still don't know about Brexit,"What do you want to know about the Brexit talks? As EU citizens living in the UK and UK expats in other EU states continue to ponder their futures,Brexit negotiations have started in Brussels. Over the past year, we have been inviting you to send in your questions about the whole process. We have already answered some questions... Could the UK take over existing EU trade deals? Brexit court ruling: Your questions answered ... but others are still awaiting definitive answers, which may only become clear at the every end of the negotiations. So, for now, here are your questions awaiting answers: Many of the questions below are examples which were asked multiple times and in many ways, while others are specific to those who asked. Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals? What rights will EU citizens lose under the current proposal? What will happen to the matter of combining pension contributions from different EU countries to build up your pensions, and will this remain? Can UK-born children of EU nationals (living here more than 20 years) be able to register as British citizens rather than naturalising? What kind of document will I be provided with to prove I have rights to stay in the UK as a citizen, travelling to Europe and back? If one already has a document certifying permanent residency would he/she still need to apply for ""UK settled status""? Will the ""settled status"" be lost if you leave the UK for two years (like Permanent Residency)? What happens to EU citizens who have not lived in the UK for five years? I plan to retire to France within the next two years to join close friends and to buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit? I am due to marry my German fiancee this year when she moves to the UK. Will spouses still be required to have five years of residence? I'm an EU national, three-and-a-half years in the UK. My wife is a resident married to an EU national. Is her status going to change? I'm a Brit living in Europe with a brain tumour and a daughter born in 2001 in Finland: Will my daughter be allowed to stay in UK if we have to relocate? How does this offer differ from the already existing application process for permanent residency which is based on five-year residence? Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019? Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over EU citizens rights living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit? How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? By the UGC and Social Media Team What happens now that a deal's been done?

Camden flats to be evacuated over cladding,"This video can not be played Camden residents react to tower block evacuations More than 700 flats in tower blocks on an estate in the Swiss Cottage area of north-west London have been evacuated because of fire safety concerns. Camden Council said people in four towers on the Chalcots estate were moved for ""urgent fire safety works"". The council added it was booking hotels but around 100 residents have spent the night on air beds in a leisure centre. The estate's cladding is similar to Grenfell Tower in west London, where a fire is feared to have killed 79. Chalcots was refurbished between 2006 and 2009 by the same firm, Rydon, that oversaw work at Grenfell Tower in 2015-16. Camden Council said it will remove external thermal cladding from five tower blocks on the Chalcots estate. It also said there were concerns about the insulation of gas pipes going into flats, and fire doors. The council initially announced the evacuation of one tower block, Taplow, but later extended the move to all five tower blocks it had checked. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the council then announced that one of the five - Blashford - did not need to be evacuated, and residents could return. Blashford is smaller and has ""several different design elements"". This video can not be played Air beds laid out in Swiss Cottage leisure centre Residents of the estate attended a public meeting with council officials on Thursday evening. The council's Labour leader, Georgia Gould, said the decision to evacuate the buildings was made at 18:30 BST on Friday. She said the fire service ""told us they could not guarantee our residents' safety in those blocks"". Some residents said the first they heard of the evacuation was on the news. The council has secured 270 hotel rooms so far. Emergency accommodation was set up at Swiss Cottage leisure centre and at the Camden Centre in King's Cross. ""We're encouraging all residents to stay with friends and family if they can, otherwise we'll provide accommodation,"" the council said. ""I know it's difficult, but Grenfell changes everything and I just don't believe we can take any risk with our residents' safety and I have to put them first,"" Ms Gould said. This video can not be played Sajid Javid: ""Absolutely the right decision"" to evacuate buildings She said the work is expected to take three to four weeks. Residents will be allowed in at the weekend to collect more possessions under escort from the fire brigade. Prime Minister Theresa Maytweeted,external: ""My thoughts are with residents being evacuated in Camden while their homes are made safe tonight."" She said the government was ""offering every support we can"" to residents and officials working at the estate. Alex Regan, BBC News As the sun set on Swiss Cottage, there was frustration among residents of the Chalcots estate. With tower blocks being evacuated, the streets were teeming with neighbours, children, and cameramen. Camden Council employees wearing hi-viz vests stood outside the Taplow tower, speaking to residents. Some of them only realised their homes were being evacuated after hearing news reports. Most were not in the mood to talk. One woman shouted angrily at a TV cameraman: ""Can you tell me what's going on?"" Confusion as evacuation begins This video can not be played Camden Council head Georgia Gould: 'Residents' safety comes first' Teacher Kim Price, who lives in Blashford tower with her 14-year-old son, said: ""At 4pm today they said it would be okay and that all the checks were fine. ""And now all of a sudden the news is saying we should get out. ""We've had two letters in two days saying 'you're not safe' then 'you're safe'. I don't really know what to do."" Edward Strange, who lives in an 11th floor flat with his wife and young daughter, said the evacuation was a ""complete overreaction"". He told the BBC there had been two previous fires in the block which were easily contained. ""I've got a young daughter, a wife and a cat, I've also got a job. They said it'd take four to six weeks. If the council says four to six weeks it'll take four to six months."" Among those evacuated was Peter Bertram, 94, who has lived on the estate for 46 years. The former RAF airman, who served in World War Two, said having to leave his home at short notice was a ""shock"". ""My neighbour told me 'Get this and that'. It happened so quick, I don't have the energy for that now. It's an experience."" Bob O'Toole, chair of Chalcots Estate residents' association, told BBC Breakfast that contractors had been working overnight in several of the tower blocks. ""A lot of people are annoyed because of the way [the evacuation] was done. They're saying it was left too late in the evening. But Camden Council didn't get the information till late, and they acted on that as quickly as possible."" Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said other areas, such as Plymouth and Manchester, had seen measures introduced such as 24-hour fire wardens and did not need evacuating. ""What was very different here is that the local fire service found multiple other failures in fire safety that should have already been in place in the towers, and as a result of that, they've made this quite correct decision."" Mr Javid also said the government would ""work with"" any local authorities and housing associations that needed financial support to carry out necessary fire safety work in tower blocks. ""Public safety is absolutely paramount, you cannot put a price on people's lives. So local authorities have to do whatever it takes to get their buildings safe."" The estate underwent a Â£66m refurbishment Samples from the tower blocks on the Chalcots estate were examined this week Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said people who were in towers where cladding was being investigated would be ""living in fear"". ""I've had hundreds of constituents contacting my office over the last week, asking whether the buildings they're living in are safe. ""People need to give significant weight to the voice of residents, and if they do want to be moved, if they feel unsafe and haven't been reassured, then provision should be put in place [to move them]."" Camden Council agreed a contract with Rydon Construction torefurbish the Chalcots estate in May 2006 at a cost of Â£66m. The work took more than three and a half years. Five towers received new cladding, and 711 flats were modernised with new wiring, heating, kitchens and bathrooms. Friday night's announcement came as theMetropolitan Police said the Grenfell Tower fire started in a fridge-freezer, and outside cladding and insulation failed safety tests.

Trump casts doubt on Russia investigator,"Mr Mueller has come under pressure from influential conservatives President Donald Trump has questioned the neutrality of Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in last year's US election. Mr Trump said Mr Mueller's friendship with James Comey, who had been heading the inquiry until sacked from his role as FBI chief, was ""bothersome"". Asked on Fox News whether Mr Mueller should step down, Mr Trump said: ""We're going to have to see."" However, Mr Trump did call Mr Mueller an ""honourable man"". Mr Mueller was given the role of special counsel by the justice department to lead its investigation into alleged Russian interference after Mr Comey was sacked on 9 May. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded Legal 'dream team' probing Trump What is the special counsel looking into?,external Mr Mueller has not given any details of his investigation but US media have reported he is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling it a ""witch hunt"". This video can not be played Russia probe is 'ridiculous' - Trump He did so again in his interview with Fox & Friends on Friday, saying ""there has been no obstruction. There has been no collusion."" He called the accusations of obstruction of justice ""ridiculous"". Asked whether Mr Mueller should recuse himself from the inquiry because of his friendship with Mr Comey, Mr Trump said: ""Well he's very, very good friends with Comey which is very bothersome.

Mr Flynn was sacked in February for failing to reveal the extent of his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington. Mr Comey testified he was ""sure"" Mr Mueller was looking at whether Mr Trump had obstructed justice. US media said Mr Mueller was also examining whether Mr Comey's sacking was an attempt by the president to alter the course of the investigation. On 16 June, Mr Trump sent out a tweetappearing to accept he was under investigation, although later his aides suggested that was not the intention. On Thursday, Mr Trump also made it clear that he had not made secret recordings of his conversations with Mr Comey, despite an earlier hint to the contrary. This video can not be played Trump injects reality TV suspense into ""Comey tapes"" saga His tweet came a day before he was required by Congress to hand over any such tapes. Mr Trump had kick-started speculation of the recordings in a tweet he posted days after firing Mr Comey, saying: ""James Comey better hope there are no 'tapes' of our conversations."" Allegations of collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials during the election have dogged the president's first five months in office.

Grenfell Tower fire began in fridge-freezer,"The Grenfell Tower fire in London started in a fridge-freezer, and outside cladding and insulation failed safety tests, police say. The Metropolitan Police say manslaughter, health and safety, and fire safety charges will be considered. A total of 79 people are feared dead after the blaze destroyed 151 homes in the Kensington tower block and nearby. In Salford, cladding is to be removed from nine of its residential tower blocks because of safety concerns. The city's mayor Paul Dennett said: ""Government tests are under way but is already clear the cladding on our blocks must be removed. There will be no waiting around... while there are any questions about the safety of our residents."" Meanwhile, the government has ordered immediate testing of the Hotpoint fridge-freezer that was involved in the Grenfell fire. The model was manufactured between 2006 and 2009. Whirlpool, which acquired the Hotpoint brand in 2014, said: ""We offer our most profound condolences to the victims, those who have lost loved ones, homes, and possessions, and to their friends and families."" Nine of those who died on 14 June have been formally identified so far. Nine people remain in hospital, with three people still in critical care. 'Safety comes first' for tower block dwellers Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire London fire: Who are the victims? Six questions for the investigation Police said the fire had not been started deliberately and the speed with which the fire spread was ""unexpected"". A national operation to identify buildings with cladding similar to that used in Grenfell Tower has seen local authorities send samples for independent tests. The Department for Communities and Local Government said 14 residential high-rise buildings in nine local authority areas have now been found with cladding that raises safety concerns. The buildings identified are: Horatia House and Leamington House in Somerstown, Portsmouth, where the city council is removing cladding after testing found it was a fire risk Three high-rise blocks on theMount Wise Tower estate in Plymouth, where cladding made of similar material to Grenfell Tower was found Five high-rise blocks onCamden Council's Chalcots estatein north London where officials are preparing to remove cladding Braithwaite House, one of eight blocks tested on an Islington Council estate Denning Point tower block in east London where Tower Hamlets Council said the cladding ""did not fully comply"" with requirements TheVillage 135 development in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, where 78 panels were being removed from one area of the site Clements Court tower in Cranford, west London, where Hounslow Council says it will remove the outer cladding from the building Rivers Apartments in Tottenham, north Londonhas cladding incorporated as part of its design but after a safety audit was said to be considered a ""low fire risk"". The Department for Education said all bodies responsible for safety in schools in England are being instructed to carry out checks to identify any buildings that may require further investigation. One building is being checked in Northern Ireland as a precautionary measure. But no buildings giving cause for concern have been found in Wales, while the Scottish Government said no council or housing association high-rise block in Scotland had cladding of the type used in Grenfell Tower.

But a spokesman said: ""We have not named the victims or issued further details on request of the families. The families of all these victims have been informed."" Photographs released by police showed the charred remains inside a flat Preliminary tests on the samples of insulation showed it burned soon after the test started, and more quickly than the cladding tiles. However, they both failed the police's safety tests - which are similar to those being carried out by the UK government.

Det Supt McCormack says the tests carried out on the cladding and insulation were ""small scale"" but added: ""All I can say at the moment is they [the tiles and insulation] don't pass any safety tests."" The cladding, insulation, fixings and installation will be examined, both individually and in terms of how they worked together. ""The investigation will be exhaustive,"" said Det Supt McCormack. ""As we learn more, the scope and scale may well grow. We will look at the refurbishment. We are looking at the panelling and the entire facade of the building."" Samples from the tower block in Camden were found to be a safety concern, and are now removed She said she wanted to hear about anyone who was in the tower, whether or not they were meant to be in the building. She said: ""I do not want there to be any victims of this tragedy that we do not know about. ""Our priority is to understand who was in Grenfell Tower. We are not interested in people's reasons for being in Grenfell Tower.""

UAE princesses guilty of servant abuse,"The case dates back to 2008 but only came to court this year, after the defence's many procedural challenges Eight princesses from the UAE have been convicted of human trafficking and degrading treatment of their servants by a Brussels court. They were given 15-month suspended jail terms and ordered to pay â¬165,000 (Â£145,000; $185,000) each, with half the sum suspended. They were accused of holding more than 20 servants they brought with them on a 2008 visit in near slavery. But they were acquitted of the more serious charge of inhumane treatment. The princesses had denied all the charges. Their lawyer, Stephen Monod, said he was ""satisfied to note that the Belgian justice has appropriately assessed this case which has generated many misconceptions for nearly 10 years"". Raped, pregnant and afraid of being jailed Kuwait's abused domestic workers have 'nowhere to turn' He was unable to confirm that his clients would pay their fines, saying they had not yet decided whether to appeal. Sheikha Hamda al-Nahyan and her seven daughters did not attend the trial and rights activists said it was highly unlikely that the UAE would extradite them had they been jailed. The case came to light when one of the servants escaped from the hotel where the princesses had hired a floor of luxury suites. They said they were forced to be available 24 hours a day, had to sleep on the floor, were never given a day off, were prevented from leaving the hotel and were forced to eat the princesses' leftovers. The princesses are relatives of UAE President Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed, pictured here visiting the British Royal family in 2013 But the case took nine years to get under way, partly due to legal challenges to proceedings by the defence. Myria, a Belgian rights group which helped bring the case to court, said the importance of Friday's judgement ""can hardly be overstated"". ""Not because it is the end stage of a procedure that has been epic in length and complexity, nor because the location of the transgression was a prestigious hotel and the main perpetrators princesses. ""Domestic personnel hailing from all over the world, employed in an administrative and social limbo, in a secluded area presumed beyond the reach of the rule of law, were heard in a court of law and recognised as victims of human trafficking."" At the time of the trial, Nicholas McGeehan, an expert on migrant workers in the Gulf for Human Rights Watch, told the BBC that it would be ""hugely significant"" if one of the wealthiest families in the world was publicly linked with trafficking and slavery. He argued that despite being abolished in law, domestic slavery continues in Gulf states - ""perpetuated by ruling elites for whom it serves an important societal purpose in conferring status"". He added: ""It's top-down and tolerated.""

Glastonbury to open with minute's silence Johnny Depp hints at Trump 'assassination' Get to know the headliners 12 things that will definitely happen BBC Glastonbury - How to watch and listen BBC Weather - latest forecast Full Glastonbury line-up Here's what they had to say, and a look at their history at Glastonbury. Radiohead are headlining Glastonbury for the third time, 20 years after they first topped the bill. That show, played just two weeks after the release of OK Computer, was named the best gig of all time by Q Magazine but Thom Yorke recently revealed he nearly walked off stage in frustration after the band's monitors blew up, leaving them unable to hear each other. ""I just went over to Ed [O'Brien, guitarist] and said, 'I'm off mate, see you later,'"" he told BBC 6 Music. ""He turned around and went, 'If you do, you'll probably live the rest of your life regretting it.' I went, 'Good point.'"" In the intervening years, Radiohead have done more than any other band to push the boundaries of rock music, stretching dark, brooding electronics over Yorke's keening vocals. Their most recent album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rekindled their relationship with melody, and is bound to form the core of their set on Friday night. Annie Mac: How are you all feeling about this? Ed O'Brien:To be honest, a little nervous. A few days ago we were doing the setlist for a show in Denmark and we all fessed up: We had the Glastonbury tingles. You know, that anticipation and slight nerves. It means a lot. It's a huge one. What does it feel like to stand on that stage and look out to 100,000 people? The first time we played it in '97, it felt like we were looking out upon this scene of devastation. The rain was horrendous. But the interesting thing is, when it's really right, it doesn't feel like there's a divide. There's a feeling of the band and the audience experiencing this thing together. Can you tell us anything at all about what you'll be doing on Friday night? There won't be any sort of guest appearances! I thought that Coldplay with Barry Gibb last year was brilliant [but] we're not that kind of band. What advice would you give to people who are virgin Glastonbury headliners? It's all about humility. For me, the bands who don't do it on that stage - or anywhere in Glastonbury - are the ones who turn up with their shades on, and it's all about them. You've got to remember, you're just closing the night. You're not headlining, you're one part of this huge, great, amazing beautiful festival. You're providing maybe two hours of soundtrack to people's enjoyment and experience at that moment. You've got to leave your ego and shades at the gate. Foo Fighters were all set to headline Glastonbury two years ago when Dave Grohl fell off stage and broke his leg in Gothenburg, Sweden. With two weeks' notice, Florence + The Machine were drafted in to take the band's slot, and Grohl spent the rest of the year recuperating (and performing from a specially-constructed throne). Now, he's back on two feet, and ready to rock. Powered by a seemingly endless supply of both hit singles and rock star charisma, the band are perfect headliner material. Fist-pumping anthems like The Pretender, Best of You and Times Like These are likely to be joined by new single Run, but hopefully the band will avoid the temptation to break out brand new tracks from the forthcoming album Concrete & Gold - ""a record that sounds like Motorhead doing Sgt Pepper's,"" according to Grohl. Expect the mosh pit to be full for this one. Annie Mac: Would it be right to say this show will be a pinnacle in your career? Dave Grohl:We last played Glastonbury in 1998 and we were in our infancy then. We were halfway down the bill, it was pouring with rain and I think there was some sort of Euro cup final thing happening, so about 90% of the audience disappeared once we hit the stage. We were supposed to be back a couple of years ago and unfortunately I had to call in sick. So this is a big make-up date for me. We get to headline Glastonbury but also I get to do it standing on two legs. It means a lot to me, personally. It's part of my recovery in a weird way. You've had two extra years of a build-up to this headlining slot. Are you feeling like it's going to be better than it was then? Now there's more purpose to us playing the gig. You know, Florence + The Machine took our place as headliners and I saw footage of them playing one of our songs, Times Like These, and I got really emotional and thought, ""What a beautiful gesture"". But [it was] also a beautiful moment that connected the band and the audience, so I can't wait to play that song. I've been thinking about this for two years. Playing a song like Times Like These in front of that audience for the first time, standing up on two legs, is huge. It's a big deal, personally. In just six short years, Ed Sheeran has graduated from Glastonbury's tiny Croissant Neuf stage to the top of the bill. He proved his ability to get people on his side in 2014, when he inherited Dolly Parton's record-breaking Pyramid Stage audience, and got them all waving their shirts in the air during Sing. Amazingly, he does all of this by himself. No band, no backing singers, no pyrotechnics. It's just Ed, slapping his hand against his acoustic guitar and layering up harmonies on a loop pedal, like a digital one man band. Music snobs might turn their noses up at his more saccharine songs, but the Sunday night slot is traditionally reserved for an artist who can bring the crowd together for an undemanding sing-song. And in that respect, Ed fits the bill perfectly. Annie Mac: How are you feeling about this weekend? Ed Sheeran:Really, really, really excited. I'm actually more excited about this than I was about playing Wembley [Stadium] - because when you're playing your own shows, you're not really winning anyone over. They've all parted with cash to buy a ticket. Knowing that there are people in the audience that possibly don't like my music at all... that excites me. What's the plan for the set? I'm doing it all by myself. I think the key to any festival set is just play songs that people know. I'm not going to be like, ""here's a new song that I wrote last week"". It's all going to be songs people have heard. Some [of the] songs I don't even play in my set anymore because they've been over done, but I'm remembering that this is the first time that a lot of people are going to see me. What about getting some special guests out... like Stormzy? Stormzy is playing on Friday, so I don't think he's going to be around. But Beoga - who are the Irish band that play on Galway Girl - are there on Sunday, so I might get them up and have a bit of a jam. Will you be at the festival all weekend? I don't like big crowds of people, ironically! So I'm not a big festival-goer. I'm actually taking the opportunity to be at home for two days and then I'm going to go in on Sunday. And I've got every single member of my family coming so it's going to be like a wedding reception afterwards.

Did Goldie just reveal who Banksy is?,"Goldie referred only to a man named ""Rob"" during the chat There are more rumours about the identity of Banksy, after Goldie appeared to reveal who he is in an interview. The DJ referred to a man called Rob in a chat about the elusive graffiti artist on the Distraction Pieces podcast. But Goldie didn't elaborate beyond the first name and there was no follow-up question from presenter Scroobius Pip. There are two possible figures who have been linked to Banksy in the past, who the DJ could have been referring to. The first is Massive Attack'sRobert Del Naja. Robert Del Naja (right) is a member of Massive Attack His name has come up in connection with the Bristol street artist - a Scottish journalist linked him to being Banksy inan investigation,externallast year. Other reports have claimed that Banksy is a collective group of artists headed by Del Naja. Another possible candidate isRobin Gunningham. AMail On Sunday report,external""revealed"" him to be the man behind Banksy in 2008. A pro-EU artwork by Banksy appeared in Dover recently The report said Gunningham was from a comfortable, middle-class background and was privately educated at Bristol Cathedral School. Goldie was speaking to presenter Scroobius Pip Goldie told Scroobius Pip: ""For something like graffiti, which has inspired the world with font or anything to do with anyone wearing a baseball cap and sneakers, at its centre it is still misunderstood. ""But give me a bubble letter and put it on a T-shirt and write Banksy on it and we're sortedâ¦ We can sell it now. ""No disrespect to Rob, I think he is a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over."" There have also been reports that Banksy's real name is Robin Banks - but this may have been one of Gunningham's street nicknames. We may never know for sure, but Goldie's slip of the tongue will likely reignite the rumour mill.

Hugh Grant offers missing medals reward,"The film star said anonymity was ""guaranteed"" for anyone who returned the medals Hugh Grant has offered a Â£1,000 reward for the return of a blind WW2 veteran's medals which went missing at a motorway service station. Alfred Barlow, 95, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, was returning from a pilgrimage to Normandy, France, on 8 June when he noticed they were missing. He was at Norton Canes Services, near Walsall on the M6 Toll. The Love Actually and Bridget Jones's Diary star tweeted that anonymity was ""guaranteed"" for whoever returned them. Speaking on Thursday, the blind veteran said losing the medals had been ""very distressing"". ""These medals are worth very little to sell, but to me they are priceless,"" he said. His wife and grandson noticed the medals were missing when Mr Barlow returned from the toilet. His grandson retraced their steps and made inquiries in all the outlets, as well as at the designated lost property depot, but said they were nowhere to be found. 1939-1945 Star The France & Germany Star 1939-1945 War Medal The Palestine Medal Mr Barlow served with 3rd Reconnaissance (Recce) Regiment, 3rd Division, and landed on Sword Beach at 10:00 BST on D-Day, 6 June 1944.

Brexit and the UK economy one year on,"Before last year's Brexit vote, there were warnings from many economists that the UK would suffer a catastrophic economic shock and be catapulted into recession by a Leave vote. As it turned out, those predictions were a touch pessimistic. But one year on, what do economists and businesses think of the aftermath of the vote? And what do they think the future holds? David Owen, chief European financial economist for Jefferies, still thinks the UK could be in for a rough ride. ""For six months or so after the Brexit vote, the UK economy as a whole also held up surprisingly well, helped by the significant monetary easing announced by the Bank of England last August and the move down in the currency,"" he says. ""But recent weeks have seen growing signs of the wheels coming off the UK recovery, with real incomes squeezed by the decline seen in real wages."" UK wage growthslowed down this yearandstarted to lag behind inflation in May. Prices are rising in the shops faster than people's wages are going up, meaning the amount people have to spend is going down in real terms. In the future, ""much will depend on what deal the UK ultimately manages to strike with the rest of the EU, but with Brexit discussions now commencing, uncertainty and political risk will dominate discussion,"" he adds. Last year, not all economists thought the shock to the economy would be so profound. Martin Beck of Oxford Economics said then that although the Brexit vote would hit the UK, it would avoid recession. Since a majority of voters chose to leave the EU, it was ""not obvious"" that business and consumers would cut back on spending immediately, he says. However, he still believes that UK growth will slow down, partly because of ""uncertainty over Brexit negotiations and uncertainty as to what the outcome will be"". After the Brexit vote, the pound dropped sharply against the euro. It is still trading about 14% down against the dollar. Reality Check: What has happened since the Brexit vote? As a result of that devaluation, UK consumers are starting to be squeezed by price inflation. However, exporters are feeling the double benefit of a weaker pound and no change to tariffs to the EU at the moment, Mr Beck says. What happens next to the UK economy ""depends on the deal"" that the UK government manages to come up with. Research done by Oxford Economics ""suggests a long-run hit to the economy"" with a gradual cumulative effect. By 2030, the UK will have missed out on 3% to 4% of growth, he adds. Last year, some economists were positively gung-ho for Brexit. Prof Patrick Minford of Cardiff University is a member of Economists for Free Trade, formerly known as Economists for Brexit. Prof Minford says that ""the consensus was for a recession"", but ""we thought it [the UK economy] would be pretty much unaffected"". However, he says Economists for Brexit ""didn't get the scale of the devaluation right"" for sterling. They thought devaluation would be about 6% and it turned out to be more like 15%. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, he says. Having a devalued pound boosts demand for exports, Prof Minford says. Businesses invest more money because they can sell more easily abroad. And more expensive foreign goods encourage consumers to buy British, giving an extra push for business investment, he adds. The devaluation is ""likely to remain for quite some time"" because of the length of the Brexit negotiations. He says that the eventual agreement is likely to be a compromise between soft and hard Brexit. If negotiations are derailed, this may be positive for stock market sentiment, as the UK could move towards free trade agreements faster. But the economy will probably move towards having more of an emphasis on free trade gradually, he adds. Mr Beck of Oxford Economics also says that being outside the customs union with the EU may bring benefits. Trade with the EU may not be as important as building trade links with rapidly growing large economies such as China and India, he says. Even before Brexit, exports to the EU had been falling relative to other markets. China and India are ""growing very quickly"", whereas European countries are wealthy and so are growing more slowly as a market, Mr Beck says. Some economists have a completely different take on where they think the economy is heading. Douglas McWilliams, deputy chairman of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said after the Brexit vote that he expected a boom. But now there will be a hit to the UK economy due to uncertainty and a fall in immigration. The creative industries fuel a large chunk of the UK economy, he says, and without immigrants to stimulate new ways of thinking, business will be hobbled. ""The real benefit [to immigration] is that skill bottlenecks are solved,"" he says. Eventually, the UK will ""change what we make and sell"" in the longer term. But he expects negative effects on the economy to outweigh positive effects until 2030. Business lobby group the CBI says that growth in the UK economy will ""shift down a gear"" in the short term as household spending slows down. ""The less likely a Brexit deal starts to look, the harder it will be for firms to recruit and retain talent as well as push the button on big investment decisions. We must get Brexit right,"" says CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn. Big firms such as Rolls Royce have said they wantas little change as possible after Brexit. And car-makers are worried about a trade ""cliff edge"" if tariffs are suddenly imposed on EU imports and exports. Finally, what do people in the UK think about Brexit? Joe Twyman from pollsters YouGov says that in the main, they haven't changed their mind from how they voted last year. ""Nothing has changed, because nothing has changed,"" he says. ""Negotiations have just started."" One interesting twist is that 26% of the population that voted Remain believe the UK should go ahead with Brexit, because that's how the majority voted, he says. However, he adds that the political situation is ""very fluid"", and depending on how the negotiations go, those opinions could easily shift.

Five electrocuted at Turkish water park,"Those affected were treated at the scene but could not be saved Three children and two adults who tried to rescue them have been electrocuted in a water park in north-western Turkey, local media say. The incident happened in the town of Akyazi, in Sakarya province, 100km (62 miles) east of Istanbul. The park manager and his son dived in to help the three children. The five, believed to be all Turkish, were taken to hospital but could not be saved. It was unclear how the pool had become electrified. Rescuers and park personnel flushed the pool's water away as others turned off electricity in the facility. One other person was injured in the incident and taken to hospital. An investigation has already begun. The Hurriyet newspaper named the park manager as Mehmet Kaya, 58, and his son as Kadir Kaya, 30. The children were aged 12, 15 and 17, Turkish media said.

Film shines light on London's sex industry,"The film depicts a world of brutal crime and crushed hopes and dreams In 2009, a Chinese woman called Anna killed herself near London's Heathrow Airport. Her friends later learned that she had been working as a prostitute in an illegal massage parlour. One of those friends, Jenny Lu, a Taiwanese art school graduate, began a journey to find out about her secret life. It resulted in Lu's first feature film, The Receptionist, which premieres in Taiwan on Friday and at the Edinburgh Film Festival in the UK next week. Some readers may find aspects of this story upsetting. ""I met Anna in Chinatown at a dinner gathering. She looked really normal,"" recalls director Lu. ""She came from a little village in China. She went to London because she wanted a better life. But she ended up living a double life that no-one knew about. ""I felt really sad. How come no-one knew about this and no-one was able to help?"" Through a mutual friend, Lu tracked down women who had worked with Anna at a massage parlour. They were immigrants from mainland China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Other parlours employed women from well-off economies including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea or Japan. Like some of the women, Anna arrived in the UK on a fake marriage. Many women pay a lot of money for fake marriages or fake passports to get to the UK ""She was married to a British guy but he didn't have a job. Anna's family had paid a lot of money to arrange this fake marriage for her. She worked really hard to try to pay back the debt and to support her brother in China,"" Ms Lu explains. Other women came here on fake passports. Some were divorced and wanted to start a new life in the UK. Some wanted to earn money to support their children. Others, including those from Taiwan, were language students enticed by money. After arriving in the UK, many realised it was much harder than they had expected to survive, not to mention achieve their dream, so they resorted to working at the massage parlours, Lu said. The Receptionist is based on the lives of the employees and clients at a massage parlour in London, as seen through the eyes of a Taiwanese graduate employed as a receptionist there. It unabashedly portrays the treatment the women endure, including being subjected to abuse and extreme fetishes. Gangsters demanded ""protection"" money from the women, and would beat, rob and rape them if they didn't pay up, knowing they wouldn't dare call the police. The women are abused, beaten and raped by the criminals 'protecting' them Though the scenes in the film are fictionalised, they are all based on the experiences of Anna and her colleagues. ""The actors initially didn't believe the script. So I arranged for them to meet the women,"" she tells. The women charged the men around Â£120 ($152) for sexual intercourse. The parlour owner would keep 50% to 60% of that. While some women eventually quit, many stayed even though they were not forced to, and even after they had made some money. Not fluent in English, they worried they would have a hard time finding a well-paid job. ""They always say they want to leave after a year or a few monthsâ¦ but they get used to making quick money,"" Ms Lu says. The women live practically in total isolation from the outside world ""They don't want to choose other jobs where they can't earn as much. They think: 'How can I afford to keep living if I don't do this?'"" ""It's a dangerous mindset. It's like a hole they dig for themselves. So many people can't get out."" The women rarely went out because they feared the neighbours would find out. They worked day and night. Their curtains were always drawn. ""What surprised me was that many of the women had never actually seen any London landmarks,"" said Lu. My 25 years as a prostitute What is it like selling sex in London? The mothers secretly working as sex workers Many were the pride of their family when they went abroad.  They were ashamed to go home or tell their family the truth. Some try to forget their past and the normal life they used to have. ""It's like a person with no soul. They don't want to think too much,"" Lu explains. Tina, the receptionist, hides her job from her boyfriend - but he later finds out Anna was 35 years old when she killed herself. She had only been in the UK for two years and had been working in the sex industry for about a year. ""Some of her friends think she got pressured because her family kept asking for money,"" the director says. ""Others thought she couldn't accept the job she was doing, so every day was a struggle."" ""And a friend had borrowed money from her to open a restaurant. When she asked for the money back, that friend threatened to tell her family what she did for a living. She was panicky."" ""She thought about her family a lot; she hadn't really wanted to go abroad."" This was very different from Lu's own life - her family was able to support her studies, enabling her to pursue her goal of becoming a filmmaker. ""It was a shock for me because previously, I had never had the opportunity to meet people like that,"" the director says. Jenny Lu's film has already been nominated for several international awards Despite a low budget - Â£300,000 mostly from two Taiwanese government subsidies and a little raised from Kickstarter - Lu's film has been selected for screening in the Edinburgh International Film Festival, and has been nominated by the Milan International Film Awards and Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards. ""I'm delighted people feel something after watching the film,"" Lu says. ""The message I want to send is even if you've walked far and chased your dream for so long, turn back and look at where you came from, what your initial dream was. Many people forget."" Lu plans to show the women the film when she returns to the UK, so they will see that she has told Anna's story. What is it like selling sex in London?

London fire: Inquest versus inquiry,"At least 79 people are now missing, presumed dead, following the fire in west London Following the tragedy at Grenfell Tower there have been calls for both an inquest and a public inquiry. Theprime minister has announced that there will be a public inquiry, but how will that differ from an inquest? More importantly, which will provide the best chance of delivering answers to the critical and haunting questions of what caused the fire, and which organisations or individuals bear responsibility? An inquest is an independent inquiry into a violent or unexplained death, so as a matter of course, there will be inquests into those who lost their lives in Grenfell Tower. Inquests are held in public and conducted by a coroner. The coronial system can be traced back to the 11th century. The inquest is inquisitorial and not adversarial - that is, the process does not seek to determine or apportion responsibility for the death. Its remit is limited: it solely determines who, where and how the deceased died. But inquests can be expanded if Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to life - is invoked. There is a general duty on the part of the state to protect life, and Article 2 inquests are held where the state or a public body may have played a part in the death of a person, or failed to protect a life when it knew - or ought to have known - of a real and immediate risk to the life of that person. The Hillsborough inquests found that all 96 Liverpool fans had been unlawfully killed in 1989 Such inquests will generally be conducted with a jury, and can be greatly expanded to become wider reaching inquiries into not only by what means the deceased died, but also the circumstances surrounding the death. This can cover the involvement of a range of private and public organisations. Therecent inquest into the death of 96 football fans at Hillsborough in 1989was an example of this expanded ""Article 2"" type of inquest. The coroner can make what are known as Regulation 28 recommendations to prevent future deaths. This involves writing to individuals, bodies or organisations and advising what they need to do to prevent future deaths or guard against danger to the public. However, these recommendations have no legal force. The person, body or organisation in question may face overwhelming moral pressure to comply, but would not be under a legal duty to do so. Sometimes the bodies or organisations concerned will already have reviewed or changed systems or practices in advance of the inquest. If they have not and they do not comply with the recommendations, it is then down to government to legislate to change the law to prevent or guard against further loss of life. Judge Frances Kirkham made clear recommendations after the 2009 Lakanal House fire The lack of legal force behind coroners' recommendations was seen after the inquests in 2013 intothe death of three adults and three children who died in a fire at the Lakanal House flats in Camberwell, south-east London. The coroner, Judge Frances Kirkham, made clear recommendations,external, which included updating the building regulations and clarification of the ""stay put"" policy which advises residents to remain in their flats in the event of a fire. Those recommendations were not followed by ministers. What does have legal force is the inquest's determination as to the cause of death, commonly known as the ""verdict"".  The verdicts available to a coroner or a jury are prescribed by statute. These include suicide, accident, open verdict and unlawful killing. Where there is a jury inquest, the coroner will advise the jury as to what verdicts are available to them. The legal consequences of a verdict can be seen for example in unlawful killing. Here there is a presumption - though not an absolute obligation - that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will take action against those responsible. The CPS is currently considering criminal charges against a range of people and organisations following the finding last year that 96 fans were unlawfully killed at the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Public inquiries are designed to establish what happened, learn from events, prevent any recurrence, and reassure. Unlike inquests they do hold people to account. However, public inquiries are set up by the government.  It appoints the chair who is normally a senior judge. The Grenfell Tower inquiry is likely to be established under the Inquiries Act, which means the chair will have statutory powers to summon witnesses, compel them to give evidence on oath and produce evidence. That can strengthen the power of an inquiry over an inquest. Counsel to the inquiry can put detailed questions to witnesses, both on behalf of the inquiry itself and at the request of key interested parties. Relatives of the Bloody Sunday victims react to the Saville Report, which stated that all victims were innocent Some take the view that because the government establishes the public inquiry, holds its purse strings and sets its terms of reference, it can lack independence. Public inquires have also been criticised for the time they take and the cost to the public purse.The ""Bloody Sunday"" inquiryinto the deaths of 13 people during the troubles in Northern Irelandtook 12 years and cost around Â£200m- though some estimates put the figure far higher. However, there are many examples of robust, independent public inquires that have been conducted efficiently. The ""Mid Staffs"" inquiry into the scandal of poor care at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust conducted by Robert Francis QC, which was run on a punishing timetable and made a raft of important recommendations taken on board by government, is often held up as an example of how a public inquiry should be run. Robert Francis QC was widely praised for the way he ran the Mid Staffs public inquiry However, it should be noted that like a coroner's recommendations, those of a public inquiry have no legal force. The Mid Staffs example also illustrates the critical importance of selecting the right person to chair the inquiry. That person sets the tone and needs the right mix of high level interpersonal skills to communicate with the families of victims and win their trust, the intellectual ability to master technical evidence and regulations (this will cover complex construction issues and building regulations in the case of Grenfell Tower), and the personality to drive the inquiry legal teams effectively and efficiently. Both can work well. Hillsborough is an example of a long and painstaking inquest that addressed the needs of victims' families. Robert Francis QC met relatives of patients who were mistreated at Stafford Hospital The Mid Staffs public inquiry was an example of a successful inquiry that did the same. There are however issues around the representation of victims and their families. At inquiries, victims and their families are given the status of ""core participants"", and it is up to the chair to ensure that they are given legal advice and representation that puts them on an equal footing with well-funded private and public bodies. The money for that representation comes direct from government and legal aid does not apply. At inquests, publicly-funded legal representation is not automatic. However, following a tragedy on the scale of Grenfell Tower, it would in all likelihood be provided. Whether this would ensure ""equality of arms"" with other bodies involved in inquests, is open to question. In the Queen's speech, the government announced plans to introduce an independent public advocate for all public disasters, who would act on behalf of bereaved families and also support them at public inquests. There is no detail on quite how the public advocate will operate, but it would seem that the role is one of supporting families rather than representing them at inquests, Inquests will generally not be held or completed until all criminal investigations and prosecutions have taken place. Public inquiries can take place alongside criminal investigations, but must be respectful of them and not prejudice their outcome. Lord Justice Leveson had to conduct his inquiry at the same time as criminal proceedings This was seen inthe Leveson Inquiry into press standardswhich had to tread carefully around concurrent criminal prosecutions. Some will favour an inquest, others a public inquiry. The truth is that both, if well run, well funded and with powerful recommendations that are acted upon by government, can be highly effective ways of progressing justice and ensuring that similar avoidable tragedies never happen again.

Ex-UVF leader admits 200 terror charges,"Gary Haggarty was facing charges relating to a 16-year period between 1991 and 2007 A former senior loyalist paramilitary turned so-called supergrass has pleaded guilty to 200 charges, including five murders. Gary Haggarty appeared at Belfast Crown Court this morning amid heavy security. The 45-year-old replied ""guilty"" to the charges put to him. In addition to five murders, he also admitted five attempted murders, 23 conspiracies to murder and four counts of directing terrorism. This video can not be played Kieran Fox said his father's murderer should ""never see daylight"" He was given five life sentences for the murders, but these will be significantly reduced as he is an assisting offender under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA). All of the killings, and the majority of the other offences, took place while Haggarty was working as a police informer. Relatives of the five people he admitted killing and their lawyers watched this morning's court hearing via video link from Laganside Courts. Kieran Fox, the son of one of Haggarty's murder victims, expressed anger at the deal offered to the killer. Mr Fox said that, considering the seriousness of the offences Haggarty had admitted, he should go to jail and ""never see daylight"". The scene of the murder of two of Haggarty's victims on North Queen Street, Belfast The murders he admitted to were: John Harbinson, a Protestant who died after being handcuffed and beaten by a UVF (Ulster Volunteer Force) gang on the Mount Vernon estate, in north Belfast, in May 1997. Sean McParland, a 55-year-old Catholic father of four, who died a week after being shot while babysitting his grandchildren at his daughter's house, in Skegoneill Avenue, in February 1994. Catholic workmen Eamon Fox (44), a father of six, and Gary Convie (24), a father of one, were shot dead while eating their lunch in a car in North Queen Street on 17 May 1994. Sean McDermott, a 37-year-old Catholic, shot dead in his car near Antrim in August 1994. Haggarty also admitted aiding and abetting the murder of Peter McTasney, a 26-year-old Catholic shot dead in his home in Newtownabbey in February 1991. Eamon Fox and Gary Convie were shot dead while eating their lunch in 1994 The investigation into Haggarty's activities has lasted more than seven years. It's one of the largest ever conducted by the police service in Northern Ireland. He's been living at a secret address in England since offering to give evidence against former UVF colleagues he claims were also involved in his crimes. As a former UVF commander for north Belfast and south east Antrim, he's the most senior loyalist ever to become a supergrass. Haggarty was interviewed more than 1,100 times at secret locations in England and Wales after offering to become what is now officially called ""an assisting offender"". He has also offered to give evidence against a number of former police officers he's accused of collusion while he was working as an informer from 1993 to 2004. The BBC understands he told his interviewers that some of his Special Branch handlers not only protected him from arrest and prosecution, but also actively encouraged his activities. Those allegations are the subject of a separate, parallel investigation by the Police Ombudsman. The public prosecution service is to decide whether to prosecute two retired Special Branch officers based on files sent by the Police Ombudsman. Sean McParland was shot and killed while babysitting his grandchildren The police bristle at the very mention of the word supergrass because of its association with a series of high-profile trials in the 1980s. Hundreds of republicans and loyalists were convicted on the word of informers and suspects who agreed to give evidence in return for reduced sentences and new identities and lives outside of Northern Ireland. These deals were done at a political level, with details kept secret. Technically they were assisting offenders but became known as ""touts"" and ""supergrasses"" in the local community. The system collapsed in 1985 because of concerns about the credibility of the evidence provided by the supergrasses, with members of the judiciary complaining that they were being used as political tools to implement government security policy. In 2005 a change in law implemented safeguards for trials of this kind. Haggarty signed an agreement to become an assisting offender under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA). There was tight security for Haggarty's appearance at Belfast Crown Court After today's court hearing Haggarty was taken to Maghaberry high security prison, where he will be held in solitary confinement until a decision is made about whether to use him as an assisting offender. Haggarty has also admitted 304 less serious offences. These will be taken into consideration by the judge when deciding what sentence he will face. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has to decide if it regards him as a ""witness of truth"". If it does, he will be back in court in the witness box, not the dock. Niall Murphy, a solicitor representing some of the victims' families, said: ""On 8th September the court will convene again and at that time a direction will be issued from the prosecution service as to their assessment of Mr Haggarty's credibility to be taken forward as an assisting offender and it is on that basis that future prosecutions will be determined."" He said Haggarty is due to be sentenced at the end of September: ""At that time a full set of facts will be read out into the court. ""It is only really then that the depth of the detail of his career in the UVF and the supervision offered by Special Branch can be assessed."" Gary Haggarty was the ex-commander of the Ulster Volunteer Force's north Belfast unit The PPS has received files relating to four UVF murders based on information provided by Gary Haggarty, and now must decide whether to use him as a witness. It is understood that up to 15 loyalists, including a number of senior UVF members, could be charged if they conclude that his evidence is credible and reliable. Haggarty could also be a witness in cases against former Special Branch officers he said helped, protected and encouraged him. Det Supt Richard Campbell, from PSNI's Serious Crime Branch, said: ""It has been a very long, arduous and painful process for these families. ""I hope today's proceedings have made a significant contribution to the process of ultimately bringing closure to all the families of the victims of Mount Vernon UVF during that time.""

Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier?,"This video can not be played Warmbier's roommate in N Korea describes the trip When Otto Warmbier was buried in his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio on Thursday, the story of how an apparently healthy young American man slipped into a coma in a North Korean jail probably went with him. Warmbier was brought home to the US last week after 17 months in detention in the secretive state. His parents learned only shortly before his arrival that he had been unconscious for more than a year, and he died on Monday. At his parents' behest, no post-mortem examination was performed. The coroners carried out an external examination and said radiological images and other medical records were being reviewed. Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center said they had found no obvious signs of physical abuse. An MRI showed severe brain damage consistent with heart failure. The lack of an autopsy might seem strange, given the intense speculation over how Warmbier became so gravely unwell, but medical professionals said the procedure was unlikely to yield clues after all this time. ""An autopsy may show that the brain lacked oxygen for a period of time but it wouldn't necessarily tell us why,"" said S Andrew Josephson, director of inpatient neurology at the University of California at San Francisco. North Korea tourism: A dangerous gamble? How did Otto Warmbier end up in a coma? How do you solve a problem like North Korea? There are some spontaneous medical situations that could cause that kind of oxygen deprivation, but they would be ""extremely rare for a young, otherwise healthy person with no known cardiac or pulmonary conditions"", Dr Josephson said. A sudden heart arrhythmia or severe asthma attack that went untreated would be among the more innocent possibilities, he said. Some form of poisoning or asphyxiation among the more malicious. Interference with the function of the heart or the lungs can be transient though, and leave no long-term marks either internally or externally beyond the damage to the brain. Doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center said they found no obvious signs of trauma. The North Korean account of events claimed that Warmbier contracted botulism, a type of poisoning caused by a bacterial infection, and was given a sleeping pill from which he never awoke. Botulism could in theory cause extensive brain damage over time if it damaged a patient's ability to breathe alone, said Dr Eric Rosenthal, associate director of the Neurosciences Intensive Care Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, but only if basic treatment like a ventilator was not administered. ""It's not something we would see in the US,"" he said. The amount of time lapsed in this case would make it difficult to get to the truth, he said. ""There are certain signs that can be recognised on an autopsy in the acute phase, but this far out it becomes exceedingly hard to be specific."" Warmbier was arrested in early January last year after removing a propaganda sign from the wall of a hotel. He was subjected to a sham trial and then a forced TV confession. According to North Korean officials, he fell into a coma shortly after that. His family said they do not buy the state's account, and Warmbier's doctors in Cincinnati said they found no evidence of botulism in the young man. With his body now in the ground, the only explanation about what happened to him would have to come from the North Korean regime. That is an unlikely scenario, said Aidan Foster-Carter, a Korea analyst at Leeds University. ""The only way we would know for sure would be if someone directly involved were to defect and tell us, but even in those cases you can't always believe what people say,"" he said. ""And even if the regime produced something that purported to be an explanation of what happened, I'm not sure you could trust it."" For years North Korea denied any involvement in the disappearance of 13 Japanese citizens between 1977 and 1983. Then in 2002, in an effort to improve ties, Pyongyang admitted kidnapping the 13 to train North Korean spies on Japanese culture. But doubts were soon cast over the regime's version of events. There was scepticism over the number of people abducted - with some Japanese estimates putting the figure as high as 60 - and over the real fate of the eight supposed to have died. Japanese officials said tests on a jawbone and some ashes returned by North Korea as a gesture of goodwill, supposedly from a missing young man, showed they probably belonged to an elderly woman. North Korea said the victims had been buried, but that their graves were washed away by floods. Warmbier speaks tearfully at a press conference in Pyongyang Finding the bona fide truth about what happened to Otto Warmbier would probably require nothing short of the collapse of the North Korean regime, said Marcus Noland, a Korea analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""It would have to be like the uncovering of the Stasi files - a complete regime collapse, internal archives become available and someone gets hold of the Otto Warmbier file,"" he said. ""Even if it were to come to diplomatic negotiations, the track record of the North Koreans providing accurate information is far from perfect."" President Trump has largely passed up opportunities to criticise foreign human rights abuses but he has put sharp focus on individual US citizens detained abroad. He called North Korea a ""brutal regime"" over its treatment of Warmbier and said the US would ""handle it"". Others went further. Republican Senators Marco Rubio and John McCain both said Warmbier had been ""murdered"". But for all the outrage now, the issue is likely to fall down the list of diplomatic priorities once the news cycle moves on.  ""If and when serious diplomacy starts, all governments have to prioritise,"" said Mr Foster-Carter. Expending political capital on a dead man would be unlikely. In a statement published after his death, the Warmbier family paid tribute to their son and mourned that they would never hear his voice again. An honest explanation of why he died now seems just as remote. ""I suspect the executive summary in this case is: we will never know,"" Mr Foster-Carter said.

Grenfell Tower fire began in fridge freezer,"The Grenfell Tower fire in London started in a fridge-freezer, and outside cladding and insulation failed safety tests, police say. The Metropolitan Police say manslaughter, health and safety, and fire safety charges will be considered. A total of 79 people are feared dead after the blaze destroyed 151 homes in the Kensington tower block and nearby. In Salford, cladding is to be removed from nine of its residential tower blocks because of safety concerns. The city's mayor Paul Dennett said: ""Government tests are under way but is already clear the cladding on our blocks must be removed. There will be no waiting around... while there are any questions about the safety of our residents."" Meanwhile, the government has ordered immediate testing of the Hotpoint fridge-freezer that was involved in the Grenfell fire. The model was manufactured between 2006 and 2009. Whirlpool, which acquired the Hotpoint brand in 2014, said: ""We offer our most profound condolences to the victims, those who have lost loved ones, homes, and possessions, and to their friends and families."" Nine of those who died on 14 June have been formally identified so far. Nine people remain in hospital, with three people still in critical care. 'Safety comes first' for tower block dwellers Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire London fire: Who are the victims? Six questions for the investigation Police said the fire had not been started deliberately and the speed with which the fire spread was ""unexpected"". A national operation to identify buildings with cladding similar to that used in Grenfell Tower has seen local authorities send samples for independent tests. The Department for Communities and Local Government said 14 residential high-rise buildings in nine local authority areas have now been found with cladding that raises safety concerns. The buildings identified are: Horatia House and Leamington House in Somerstown, Portsmouth, where the city council is removing cladding after testing found it was a fire risk Three high-rise blocks on theMount Wise Tower estate in Plymouth, where cladding made of similar material to Grenfell Tower was found Five high-rise blocks onCamden Council's Chalcots estatein north London where officials are preparing to remove cladding Braithwaite House, one of eight blocks tested on an Islington Council estate Denning Point tower block in east London where Tower Hamlets Council said the cladding ""did not fully comply"" with requirements TheVillage 135 development in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, where 78 panels were being removed from one area of the site Clements Court tower in Cranford, west London, where Hounslow Council says it will remove the outer cladding from the building Rivers Apartments in Tottenham, north Londonhas cladding incorporated as part of its design but after a safety audit was said to be considered a ""low fire risk"". The Department for Education said all bodies responsible for safety in schools in England are being instructed to carry out checks to identify any buildings that may require further investigation. One building is being checked in Northern Ireland as a precautionary measure. But no buildings giving cause for concern have been found in Wales, while the Scottish Government said no council or housing association high-rise block in Scotland had cladding of the type used in Grenfell Tower. The Metropolitan Police said four more victims - three men and one woman - have been formally identified. But a spokesman said: ""We have not named the victims or issued further details on request of the families. The families of all these victims have been informed."" Photographs released by police showed the charred remains inside a flat Preliminary tests on the samples of insulation showed it burned soon after the test started, and more quickly than the cladding tiles. However, they both failed the police's safety tests - which are similar to those being carried out by the UK government. Some 250 specialist investigators have been deployed to find out what happened. Every company involved in the building and refurbishment of Grenfell Tower will also be looked at as part of the investigation.

Union 'will tell members to wear dresses',"The porters' request to wear three-quarter-length trousers was declined A union says it will instruct members to wear dresses if a dispute over a hospital porter suspended for rolling up his trousers in hot weather is not resolved. Michael Wood, a porter at Watford General Hospital, said he was facing disciplinary action from his employers Medirest. The company says porters should ""wear appropriate uniform at all times"". The GMB said it would tell porters to wear dresses if he was not reinstated. The row follows a successful protest by boys atprotest on Thursday by about 30 boys at the ISCA Academy in Exeterwho wore skirts to school because shorts were not part of the school's uniform. The school has now changed the rules meaning boys will be allowed to shorts in lessons from next year. Union official Mick Dooley said: ""What we're hoping to do is get round the table and get Michael back to work, failing that, the chief executive of Watford General Hospital, [is] going to see her porters wearing dresses. ""We're going to put out a message to porters [to start] wearing dresses and start wearing skirts."" Mr Wood, 46, said he rolled up his black-coloured polyester trousers to three-quarter-length on Wednesday - the hottest June day for 40 years - but was called to the office and asked to roll them down again. When he said he ""could not promise"" not to roll them back up, he was sent home. Michael Wood said he was facing disciplinary action from his employers Medirest ""Our health and safety is paramount in the hospital, when you're struggling to work when you're sweating, you become irritable and argumentative,"" Mr Wood said. ""I wouldn't mind wearing a dress - at least I'd be cool."" On Wednesday, temperatures in nearby Harpenden peaked at 31.5C. Mr Dooley said: ""Because of the unusually high temperatures, the NHS managers in Watford General have adopted a reasonable approach towards their workforce. ""However, Medirest consider suspending safety reps is the preferred option."" He said Mr Wood had been ""treated unfairly"" and ""should be reinstated immediately"". Medirest said it would be inappropriate to comment on an individual case where an investigation is ongoing but added the ""health and safety of our colleagues is always our number one priority"". ""Due to the nature of their job and health and safety requirements, it is important that porters wear appropriate uniform at all times,"" a statement said.

Glastonbury opens with minute's silence,"The star last visited Glastonbury as a guest of Metallica in 2014 Film star Bradley Cooper made a surprise appearance on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, as he shot a scene for his new film. The Hangover star is currently directing and starring in a remake of A Star Is Born, the Judy Garland-starring musical about an up-and-coming singer. He appeared at Glastonbury ahead of Kris Kristofferson's set, holding a guitar and followed by cameras. Cooper and his co-star Lady Gaga shot similar scenes at Coachella in April. Before leaving the stage, Cooper thanked the audience: ""You guys were awesome, that was great - it's my sheer pleasure to introduce Kris Kristofferson."" The festival opened on Friday morning with a minute's silence, to honour those affected by the recent tragedies in London and Manchester. The moment of reflection was led by New Order's Peter Hook, whose daughter attended the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester last month, where 22 people died. ""Can we please use this as a chance to send our hopes and our prayers for love, life and freedom,"" he said. ""[They're] the things we're all here to celebrate. ""We send our sympathies to everyone affected by the events in London and Manchester, and everyone affected in Grenfell tower. God bless you all."" As the silence ended, Happy Mondays singer Rowetta, appearing alongside Hook in a Manchester T-shirt announced: ""You got the love"".

The Pretenders opened The Other Stage, drawing a huge crowd to hear hits including Brass In Pocket, I'll Stand By You and Back on The Chain Gang. Chrissie Hynde, wearing a Motorhead t-shirt, dedicated the song Hymn To Her to organisers Michael and Emily Eavis, and paid tribute to the late Clash frontman Joe Strummer. ""If he's still anywhere near this planet, he's here today,"" she said, as novelist John Niven watched from the side of the stage. He had a recentTwitter spat with JK Rowling,externalover the language he used to describe Prime Minister Theresa May. Dua Lipa said she danced on stage ""like I'd never danced before"" In the afternoon, pop star Dua Lipa drew one of the biggest crowds so far to the John Peel stage. Thousands of people packed out the tent, with the audience stretching beyond the perimeter, as she played hits including Hotter Than Hell, Be The One and Blow Your Mind (Mwah). Speaking to the BBC as she came off stage, the 20-year-old was clearly overwhelmed. ""It's been my favourite, favourite performance on stage I've ever done,"" she beamed. ""I've never seen so many people. ""It was just the most magical day in my life. Maybe even the best day of my life, apart from the day my brother and sister were born."" However, Dua threw herself into the performance so heavily she caused herself an injury. ""I've mashed my tailbone,"" she said. ""It was already bruised, then I went on stage and danced like I'd never danced before. Now I can barely walk."" Organisers Michael Eavis posed for selfies with fans, and sang Elvis in a karaoke bar, on Thursday Later on Friday, Radiohead top the bill, exactly 20 years after their first headline appearance. Guitarist Ed O'Brien said they would ""leave their ego at the gate"" and embrace the spirit of the festival. Footballer David Beckham is also due to visit Worthy Farm on Friday, after organiser Michael Eavis invited him to open a local social housing project. Although Friday marks the start of festivities, revellers have been arriving since gates opened on Wednesday. Those in the know were treated to ""secret"" sets by indie band Circa Waves and alt-pop experimentalists Everything Everything on Thursday night at the small Williams' Green stage. For Everything Everything, the short, 40-minute performance gave them the opportunity to revisit the scene of ""the best gig we've ever had in our lives"". This video can not be played Everything Everything on their not-so-secret show Two years ago, the band played the stage in the same week they released third album, Get To Heaven, ""and in the time that elapsed, the listeners had learnt all the words and were singing them back"", singer John Higgs told BBC News. ""It was a really amazing, moving moment for us all."" Thursday's show was almost a re-run of that show, as fans joined in with the band's new single, Can't Do. Although their set was not part of the official line-up, several thousand fans got wind of the show, and the audience spilled out of the tent into the surrounding fields. The festival kicked off after two days of build-up ""I keep getting texts from people I haven't seen for years saying, 'Oh, you're playing tonight, aren't you?'"" joked drummer Michael Spearman.

Messi 'could swap jail sentence for fine',"Lionel Messi was found guilty of tax fraud in 2016 Football star Lionel Messi could avoid a 21-month prison sentence for tax fraud by paying a fine, Spanish media are reporting. Spain's state prosecutor would swap jail time for a fine of â¬255,000 ($285,000; Â£224,000), which equates to â¬400 for each day behind bars. The final decision on the fine rests in the hands of the Spanish courts. Messi, along with his father Jorge, was found guilty of defrauding Spain of â¬4.1m between 2007 and 2009. The court in Barcelona found they used tax havens in Belize and Uruguay. Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? Lionel Messi's career in photos Messi statue unveiled in Buenos Aires As well as the jail terms, the Barcelona star and Argentina international was fined about â¬2m and his father â¬1.5m. They made a voluntary â¬5m ""corrective payment"", equal to the alleged unpaid tax plus interest, in August 2013. Messi's appeal against the sentence was rejected by the Supreme Court last month, but his father's jail time was reduced because he paid some of the taxes. However, Messi was never expected to serve time in jail, as under the Spanish system, prison terms of under two years can be served under probation.

EU: Brexit rights offer 'insufficient',"This video can not be played May: I want to give EU residents certainty European leaders have criticised the UK's offer to EU nationals after Brexit - with one senior figure claiming it could ""worsen the situation"" for them. European Council President Donald Tusk said the plan was ""below expectations"" while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there had been ""no breakthrough"". Theresa May conceded there were differences between the two sides. But the prime minister said those who had ""made their lives and homes"" in the UK would have their rights guaranteed. She also suggested that while rights would be enforced by British courts, they could also be enshrined in international law if the agreement was included in the final treaty of withdrawal. Q&A: What is UK offer? May unveils Brexit offer for EU citizens Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? Brexit: All you need to know Both the UK and the rest of the EU say they want to come to an arrangement to secure the status of the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries. This video can not be played EU chief's one word response to May's plan Under plans announced on Thursday by Mrs May, the UK envisages giving all EU citizens the right to stay after the UK's exit - due on 30 March 2019 - and granting those resident for at the least five years the same rights to welfare, pensions and education as UK citizens. However, no cut-off date for the package has been specified by Downing Street and further details of the plans will not be released until Monday. The offer has received a mixed response from EU leaders with some describing it as a ""good start"" but calling for more detail. Speaking at a joint press conference with French president Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was a ""long way to go"". ""That was a good beginning but - and I'm trying to word this very carefully - it was not a breakthrough,"" she said. ""We don't want a wedge to be driven between us. We do want to make our interests very clear and if there is no guarantee for the full freedoms, then this exercise will have to lead to a situation where there are certain effects on the future relationship between the UK and the 27 member states."" Mr Tusk, who represents the other EU 27 nations, said the EU would ""analyse line by line"" the UK's proposals when they were published in full but his ""first impression is that the UK's offer is below our expectations and that it risks worsening the situation of citizens"". And Joseph Muscat, the prime minister of Malta - who currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU - warned of people being ""treated differently"" depending on when they arrived in the UK. By political editor Laura Kuenssberg While complex, this summit was perhaps a brief respite from the brooding turmoil in her own party, where questions about the viability of her leadership lurk. Governing is doing, not fending off enemies - and at least today, Theresa May has done that. There was also a big hint about how the British negotiators hope to get round one of the big obstacles. As we've discussed before one of the big gaps between the two negotiating sides here are who will police the rules on citizen's rights. So, if something goes wrong, who can they appeal to, how will their rights be protected. The EU side is adamant that it can only be the European Court of Justice. Theresa May has been totally insistent that it can't be them. At the press conference this afternoon she repeated that it would be the British courts in charge. So far, so the same. But she then tantalisingly - if you are a nerd like me - said that because the rights would be agreed as part of the withdrawal treaty, they would be therefore subject to international law. Therefore, theoretically, that means they could be enforced by an international court of some variety. Lawyers suggest that is not likely to be the Hague, but could be some kind of new organisation that had British and European lawyers involved.Read more EU nationals in the UK currently have a right to permanent residence, granted after they have lived in the UK, legally and continuously, for five years. The European Union has said EU citizens should continue enjoying the same rights as they do now on a lifetime basis, enforceable by the European Court of Justice. But the UK's view is that British courts should have jurisdiction as they will be enshrined in UK law. This video can not be played ""There are still so many unknowns"" on future of EU citizens says ex-Czech Europe Minister Mrs May said there had been a ""very positive"" discussion with other EU countries. She acknowledged differences over their enforcement but said she ""remained of the view that this is a fair and serious offer"". 'Devil in the detail' of EU citizens deal EU prepares to move agencies from London ""Let's be clear about what we're saying. What we're saying is that those citizens from EU countries who have come to the United Kingdom, those EU citizens who have made their lives and homes in the UK will be able to stay and we will guarantee their rights,"" she said. The PM said the issue would be one of the first to be discussed and she wanted an agreement as soon as possible. In response to claims by the former chancellor George Osborne,in an article for the Evening Standard,external, that she had ""blocked"" calls for the UK to offer a unilateral guarantee of rights in the aftermath of last year's referendum, she said that was ""certainly not my recollection"" of events. Anne-Laure Donskoy, founding member of the 3million - which aims to protect the rights of EU citizens living in the UK - said the UK's offer was ""disappointing"" and ""really falls short of our expectations"". ""It is like a teaser this statement, it gives you general direction of travel potentially, but there are things in the statement that need to be unpicked."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the government to guarantee all UK-based EU citizens full residency rights, saying the current offer ""doesn't go far enough and leaves uncertainty for those who have been here for less than five years"". ""These are people who are working here and have families here - we have to end their uncertainty.""

10 sports stars who became actors,"Flintoff and Beckham are the latest former sportsmen to embark on acting careers Andrew ""Freddie"" Flintoff may not be the first name that springs to mind when you think of musical theatre - but that could be about to change. The former cricketer is tomake his stage debutthis autumn in a musical version of the Fat Friends TV show. Flintoff's casting sees him follow in the footsteps of David Beckham, who was recently seen making a cameo appearancein Guy Ritchie's King Arthur film. Here are 10 other former sports stars who have given the acting game a go, either in their free time or after hanging up their boots, gloves and swimming trunks. Cantona playing for Manchester United in 1997 and at the Rome Film Festival in 2015 The former striker is still known as ""King Eric"" amongst Manchester United fans thanks to the pivotal role he played in the club's 1990s revival. Since retiring from football in 1997, though, Cantona has carved a new career for himself as an actor - thanks in no small part to a certain Ken Loach. It was Loach who got Cantona to play himself in 2009's Looking for Eric, a comic fable that made much hay out of the Frenchman's quasi-mythical stature and his penchant for gnomic utterances. Though he's mostly limited himself to French films since, he was more widely seen in 2014 western The Salvationas a burly Corsican enforcer,external. Carano in the ring in 2008 and on the red carpet in 2013 The Texan athlete's formidable skills at Muay Thai and MMA (mixed martial arts) so impressed director Steven Soderbergh he built an entire film around her talents. The result was 2011's Haywire, a fast-paced spy yarn that saw Carano share the screen with Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender. Gina went on to play a malevolent mutant in 2016's Deadpool, in which she was memorably seen making a ""superhero landing,external"". ""Of course, what I want to do is a romantic comedy,""she revealed last year,external. ""But I'm over here in action land where every actress in Hollywood seems like they want to be."" Cena in the ring in 2009 and before the cameras in 2017 Given wrestling requires rather more acting than most sports, it's hardly surprising so many wrestlers have embarked on screen careers. John Cena, though, has had more success than most, having scored in both action films like 12 Rounds and comedies like Trainwreck. ""I really love my job, so it's not like I'm trying to quit wrestling to do movies,"" Cenatold Rolling Stone last year,external. ""They just all seemed like cool things to do."" John's next role is playing a bull in the animated filmFerdinand,external. Tony Danza with Muhammad Ali in 2004 For many people Tony Danza will always be Tony Banta, the good-natured if slow-witted cabbie from US sitcom Taxi. Yet Danza, pictured above with the late Muhammad Ali in 2004, started out as a boxer who once had hopes of being a world champion middleweight. ""I had 15 pro fights [and] I won 12,""he revealed in 2015,external. ""I won all my fights by knockout. Unfortunately, I lost all my fights by knockout."" Luckily acting provided a steadier option for the Brooklyn native, who spent five years on Taxi and another eight on Who's the Boss? Lewis Hamilton with a helmet once worn by Ayrton Senna Aged just 32, the three-time Formula One world champion isn't quite ready to give up the driving seat just yet. But he's already paving the way for a post-racing career by landing a role in Pixar's Cars franchise... as a racing car called Lewis. ""I came from a small town called Stevenage,""Hamilton remarked,externalwhen Cars 2 was released. ""It's not normal I'm in a Hollywood movie."" Here's what his character - soon to be seen again in the upcoming Cars 3 - looked like in that 2011 title. This video can not be played Lewis Hamilton to appear in Disney's Cars 2 Johnson may have dropped ""The Rock"" but he's kept all his poses Like John Cena, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson began his career in the ring. Yet that's been more than eclipsed now by his post-wrestling career as a Hollywood leading man. Early roles in The Mummy Returns and spin-off movie The Scorpion King made a virtue of his brawn. The key to Johnson's success, though, may be his willingness to poke fun and undercut his macho image. ""I always believed that I needed to do all kinds of movies including comedies and family films - and not just action movies - if I wanted to grow as an actor,"" he explainedearlier this year,external. He's certainly prolific. Already seen this year in Fast & Furious 8 and Baywatch, he'll next be found rebooting the Jumanji franchise with Central Intelligence co-star Kevin Hart. Jones playing for Wimbledon in 1988 and as ""Big Chris"" in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels David Beckham may have King Arthur: Legend of the Sword under his belt, but he's got a long way to go before he challenges football's best-known cinematic export. Vinnie and Becks don't just have the beautiful game in common though - they were both been given their shot at stardom by the aforementioned Guy Ritchie. Having been an infamous hard man on the pitch, Jones had no trouble projecting menace as ""Big Chris"" in 1998 crime caper Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The joke has admittedly worn thin in the 19 years since, though that hasn't stopped Vinnie getting regular work in films and TV shows of wildly varying quality. Rousey gave up judo after the 2008 Olympics to focus on mixed martial arts Having won a bronze medal for judo at the Beijing Olympics, ""Rowdy"" Ronda Rousey turned to MMA and quickly became one of the sport's most skilled and dominant practitioners. That helped land her a role in the third Expendables film alongside such seasoned Hollywood heavyweights as Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford. Like fellow fighter Gina Carano, she's also been seen in the Fast and Furious franchise. Rousey also had a role, as herself, in the 2015 Entourage spin-off. She's had mixed fortunes inside the ring though, having lost her last two title bouts - against Holly Holm and Amanda Nunes. Statham at the 1990 Commonwealth Games and at a 2015 film premiere Another former sportsman who has Guy Ritchie to thank for his career is ""The Stath"", who got his big break alongside Vinnie Jones in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Before that though he dived for England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, finishing eighth, 10th and 11th in the three competitions he took part in. ""I never really achieved what I wanted to achieve,"" he said in 2008. ""But I think what I didn't achieve has probably helped me focus more and take my acting career more seriously."" Now a fixture of the Expendables, Fast & Furious and Transporter franchises, Statham is currently expecting his first child with his model fiancee Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Carl Weathers with Sylvester Stallone in 2016 Before he was Apollo Creed in the Rocky films, Carl Weathers was a professional American Football player who briefly played as a linebacker for the Oakland Raiders. He went on to play in the Canadian Football League before hanging up his helmet in 1973, three years before landing what would become his signature role. Weathers went on to appear with Arnold Schwarzenegger in Predator and Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore. He also played the title role in 1988 film Action Jackson. ""I majored in theatre at San Diego State,""he once revealed,external. ""My one eye was on football, and my other eye was on Hollywood.""

UK defeated in UN vote on Chagos Islands,"A dispute between the UK and Mauritius over disputed island territory in the Indian Ocean is to be referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The UN General Assembly voted by 94 countries to 15 that The Hague should examine the legal status of the Chagos Islands. The former British colony used to be part of Mauritius but was detached in 1965 and is now home to a US airbase. The Foreign Office said it would be an ""inappropriate"" use of the ICJ. ""This is a disappointing outcome,"" a Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory is clearly a matter for the UK and Mauritius to resolve ourselves. ""Taking this dispute to the International Court of Justice is an inappropriate use of the ICJ mechanism."" Mauritius, which gained independence from Britain in 1968, argues that the UK broke international law when it separated off the islands before granting Mauritius its independence. Diego Garcia, the largest of the group of islands, was leased to the US in 1966. Families were forced to leave the Chagos Islands in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for a US Air Force base on Diego Garcia, which is leased until 2036. The Foreign Office said it did not recognise Mauritius's claim to sovereignty over the islands - but that it would return the islands when they were no longer needed for defence. ""We have committed to cede them to Mauritius when the territory is no longer required for defence purposes,"" the spokesman said. ""At present it plays an important role in regional and global security, helping to keep the UK, US and other allies, including Mauritius, safe."" The government said it would ""robustly defend"" its position ahead of the ICJ's decision, which would not be legally binding. Most EU countries abstained from the vote, which BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale described as an ""embarrassing diplomatic defeat"" for the UK. He said it signalled that Britain's diplomatic clout had waned after the vote for Brexit. In 2015, the UK Supreme Court denied a legal challenge by former islanders to return to Chagos after being removed more than 40 years ago. The courtrejected claims that islanders suffered a ""significant injustice""by being forcibly removed from their homeland.

India policeman lynched in Kashmir,"The incident took place outside the main mosque in Srinagar city Authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir say a policeman has been lynched outside the main mosque in Srinagar, the summer capital . Muhammad Ayub had been deployed in plain clothes outside the  Jamia Masjid mosque during the Friday prayers, police told BBC Urdu's Riyaz Masroor. Locals allege that the officer had fired his gun into a crowd after getting into a brawl with some youths. Police say they have arrested two people in connection with the incident. Kashmir police chief Sheshpal Ved said another suspect would be arrested soon. ""The people involved in this dastardly act will face the law,"" he told reporters. Prominent separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was speaking at the centuries-old mosque in old Srinagar's Nowhatta area when the incident took place. ""The police officer had a brawl with a group of boys and he fired his silencer-fitted pistol, injuring two boys. The crowd pounced on him and lynched him,"" Muneer, a local resident, told BBC Urdu. The stolen childhoods of Kashmir in pencil and crayon Is India losing Kashmir? The teenager blinded by pellets in Kashmir The lynching, perhaps the first of its kind in Kashmir, has caused outrage, says our correspondent. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said, ""Our police force is bravest across the country. They exercise maximum restraint as they know they are dealing with their own people."" Kashmir's 130,000-strong police force has already been under strain after militants stepped up attacks on its men and officers. There has been an armed revolt in the Muslim-majority region against rule by India since 1989. The disputed region is claimed by both India and Pakistan in its entirety. India blames Pakistan for fuelling the unrest, a claim denied by Islamabad.

Glastonbury to open with minute's silence,"The star last visited Glastonbury as a guest of Metallica in 2014 Film star Bradley Cooper made a surprise appearance on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, as he shot a scene for his new film. The Hangover star is currently directing and starring in a remake of A Star Is Born, the Judy Garland-starring musical about an up-and-coming singer. He appeared at Glastonbury ahead of Kris Kristofferson's set, holding a guitar and followed by cameras. Cooper and his co-star Lady Gaga shot similar scenes at Coachella in April. Before leaving the stage, Cooper thanked the audience: ""You guys were awesome, that was great - it's my sheer pleasure to introduce Kris Kristofferson."" The festival opened on Friday morning with a minute's silence, to honour those affected by the recent tragedies in London and Manchester. The moment of reflection was led by New Order's Peter Hook, whose daughter attended the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester last month, where 22 people died. ""Can we please use this as a chance to send our hopes and our prayers for love, life and freedom,"" he said. ""[They're] the things we're all here to celebrate. ""We send our sympathies to everyone affected by the events in London and Manchester, and everyone affected in Grenfell tower. God bless you all."" As the silence ended, Happy Mondays singer Rowetta, appearing alongside Hook in a Manchester T-shirt announced: ""You got the love"".

The Pretenders opened The Other Stage, drawing a huge crowd to hear hits including Brass In Pocket, I'll Stand By You and Back on The Chain Gang. Chrissie Hynde, wearing a Motorhead t-shirt, dedicated the song Hymn To Her to organisers Michael and Emily Eavis, and paid tribute to the late Clash frontman Joe Strummer. ""If he's still anywhere near this planet, he's here today,"" she said, as novelist John Niven watched from the side of the stage. He had a recentTwitter spat with JK Rowling,externalover the language he used to describe Prime Minister Theresa May. Dua Lipa said she danced on stage ""like I'd never danced before"" In the afternoon, pop star Dua Lipa drew one of the biggest crowds so far to the John Peel stage. Thousands of people packed out the tent, with the audience stretching beyond the perimeter, as she played hits including Hotter Than Hell, Be The One and Blow Your Mind (Mwah). Speaking to the BBC as she came off stage, the 20-year-old was clearly overwhelmed. ""It's been my favourite, favourite performance on stage I've ever done,"" she beamed. ""I've never seen so many people. ""It was just the most magical day in my life. Maybe even the best day of my life, apart from the day my brother and sister were born."" However, Dua threw herself into the performance so heavily she caused herself an injury. ""I've mashed my tailbone,"" she said. ""It was already bruised, then I went on stage and danced like I'd never danced before. Now I can barely walk."" Organisers Michael Eavis posed for selfies with fans, and sang Elvis in a karaoke bar, on Thursday Later on Friday, Radiohead top the bill, exactly 20 years after their first headline appearance. Guitarist Ed O'Brien said they would ""leave their ego at the gate"" and embrace the spirit of the festival. Footballer David Beckham is also due to visit Worthy Farm on Friday, after organiser Michael Eavis invited him to open a local social housing project. Although Friday marks the start of festivities, revellers have been arriving since gates opened on Wednesday. Those in the know were treated to ""secret"" sets by indie band Circa Waves and alt-pop experimentalists Everything Everything on Thursday night at the small Williams' Green stage. For Everything Everything, the short, 40-minute performance gave them the opportunity to revisit the scene of ""the best gig we've ever had in our lives"". This video can not be played Everything Everything on their not-so-secret show Two years ago, the band played the stage in the same week they released third album, Get To Heaven, ""and in the time that elapsed, the listeners had learnt all the words and were singing them back"", singer John Higgs told BBC News. ""It was a really amazing, moving moment for us all."" Thursday's show was almost a re-run of that show, as fans joined in with the band's new single, Can't Do. Although their set was not part of the official line-up, several thousand fans got wind of the show, and the audience spilled out of the tent into the surrounding fields. The festival kicked off after two days of build-up ""I keep getting texts from people I haven't seen for years saying, 'Oh, you're playing tonight, aren't you?'"" joked drummer Michael Spearman.

Grenfell Tower blaze started by fridge,"The Grenfell Tower fire in London started in a fridge-freezer, and outside cladding and insulation failed safety tests, police say. The Metropolitan Police say manslaughter, health and safety, and fire safety charges will be considered. A total of 79 people are feared dead after the blaze destroyed 151 homes in the Kensington tower block and nearby. In Salford, cladding is to be removed from nine of its residential tower blocks because of safety concerns. The city's mayor Paul Dennett said: ""Government tests are under way but is already clear the cladding on our blocks must be removed. There will be no waiting around... while there are any questions about the safety of our residents."" Meanwhile, the government has ordered immediate testing of the Hotpoint fridge-freezer that was involved in the Grenfell fire. The model was manufactured between 2006 and 2009. Whirlpool, which acquired the Hotpoint brand in 2014, said: ""We offer our most profound condolences to the victims, those who have lost loved ones, homes, and possessions, and to their friends and families."" Nine of those who died on 14 June have been formally identified so far. Nine people remain in hospital, with three people still in critical care. 'Safety comes first' for tower block dwellers Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire London fire: Who are the victims? Six questions for the investigation Police said the fire had not been started deliberately and the speed with which the fire spread was ""unexpected"". A national operation to identify buildings with cladding similar to that used in Grenfell Tower has seen local authorities send samples for independent tests. The Department for Communities and Local Government said 14 residential high-rise buildings in nine local authority areas have now been found with cladding that raises safety concerns. The buildings identified are: Horatia House and Leamington House in Somerstown, Portsmouth, where the city council is removing cladding after testing found it was a fire risk Three high-rise blocks on theMount Wise Tower estate in Plymouth, where cladding made of similar material to Grenfell Tower was found Five high-rise blocks onCamden Council's Chalcots estatein north London where officials are preparing to remove cladding Braithwaite House, one of eight blocks tested on an Islington Council estate Denning Point tower block in east London where Tower Hamlets Council said the cladding ""did not fully comply"" with requirements TheVillage 135 development in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, where 78 panels were being removed from one area of the site Clements Court tower in Cranford, west London, where Hounslow Council says it will remove the outer cladding from the building Rivers Apartments in Tottenham, north Londonhas cladding incorporated as part of its design but after a safety audit was said to be considered a ""low fire risk"". The Department for Education said all bodies responsible for safety in schools in England are being instructed to carry out checks to identify any buildings that may require further investigation. One building is being checked in Northern Ireland as a precautionary measure. But no buildings giving cause for concern have been found in Wales, while the Scottish Government said no council or housing association high-rise block in Scotland had cladding of the type used in Grenfell Tower. The Metropolitan Police said four more victims - three men and one woman - have been formally identified. But a spokesman said: ""We have not named the victims or issued further details on request of the families. The families of all these victims have been informed."" Photographs released by police showed the charred remains inside a flat Preliminary tests on the samples of insulation showed it burned soon after the test started, and more quickly than the cladding tiles. However, they both failed the police's safety tests - which are similar to those being carried out by the UK government. Some 250 specialist investigators have been deployed to find out what happened. Every company involved in the building and refurbishment of Grenfell Tower will also be looked at as part of the investigation. Football proceeds to be given to victims School pupils go green for Grenfell Det Supt Fiona McCormack said all criminal charges are being considered ""from manslaughter onwards"". This video can not be played Insulation samples collected from Grenfell Tower combusted ""soon after"" safety tests started, police say She said officers had been in the tower ""from top to bottom"", adding that next week a lift would be installed to the outside of the building. She added the forensic search ""may not be complete until the end of the year"". ""There is a terrible reality that we may not find or identify everyone who died due to the intense heat."" Anyone who has a white Hotpoint fridge freezer model number FF175BP or graphite fridge freezer model number FF175BG should register their appliance with the manufacturer to receive any updates. Generally, the model number is found on a bar code on a sticker behind the salad container in the fridge. These models were manufactured between March 2006 and July 2009. About 64,000 were sold but it is not known how many are still in use. Owners should ring 0800 316 3826 or visitthe Hotpoint website.,external Fires connected to fridge freezers and other electrical appliances are relatively common. More general advice on registering an appliance, should there be a recall, and other safety tips are available online oncharity Electrical Safety First's page,external. Det Supt McCormack says the tests carried out on the cladding and insulation were ""small scale"" but added: ""All I can say at the moment is they [the tiles and insulation] don't pass any safety tests."" The cladding, insulation, fixings and installation will be examined, both individually and in terms of how they worked together. ""The investigation will be exhaustive,"" said Det Supt McCormack. ""As we learn more, the scope and scale may well grow. We will look at the refurbishment. We are looking at the panelling and the entire facade of the building."" Samples from the tower block in Camden were found to be a safety concern, and are now removed She said she wanted to hear about anyone who was in the tower, whether or not they were meant to be in the building. She said: ""I do not want there to be any victims of this tragedy that we do not know about. ""Our priority is to understand who was in Grenfell Tower. We are not interested in people's reasons for being in Grenfell Tower."" She said she was concerned they did ""not have the complete picture"" and reassured people not to be nervous about contacting them. This video can not be played Andrew Hosken accompanies two fire experts inspecting a tower block in East London ""There may well be people who no one has contacted us about - who they know were in the building or have close links to Grenfell Tower. ""The Home Office has assured us that they are not interested in people's immigration status and we are not interested in looking at that. ""What we are interested in is making sure that we know who is missing and we take every possible step to establish if they are safe and well.""

EU citizens question Brexit rights offer,"This video can not be played May: I want to give EU residents certainty European leaders have criticised the UK's offer to EU nationals after Brexit - with one senior figure claiming it could ""worsen the situation"" for them. European Council President Donald Tusk said the plan was ""below expectations"" while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there had been ""no breakthrough"". Theresa May conceded there were differences between the two sides. But the prime minister said those who had ""made their lives and homes"" in the UK would have their rights guaranteed. She also suggested that while rights would be enforced by British courts, they could also be enshrined in international law if the agreement was included in the final treaty of withdrawal. Q&A: What is UK offer? May unveils Brexit offer for EU citizens Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? Brexit: All you need to know Both the UK and the rest of the EU say they want to come to an arrangement to secure the status of the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries. This video can not be played EU chief's one word response to May's plan Under plans announced on Thursday by Mrs May, the UK envisages giving all EU citizens the right to stay after the UK's exit - due on 30 March 2019 - and granting those resident for at the least five years the same rights to welfare, pensions and education as UK citizens. However, no cut-off date for the package has been specified by Downing Street and further details of the plans will not be released until Monday. The offer has received a mixed response from EU leaders with some describing it as a ""good start"" but calling for more detail. Speaking at a joint press conference with French president Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was a ""long way to go"". ""That was a good beginning but - and I'm trying to word this very carefully - it was not a breakthrough,"" she said. ""We don't want a wedge to be driven between us. We do want to make our interests very clear and if there is no guarantee for the full freedoms, then this exercise will have to lead to a situation where there are certain effects on the future relationship between the UK and the 27 member states."" Mr Tusk, who represents the other EU 27 nations, said the EU would ""analyse line by line"" the UK's proposals when they were published in full but his ""first impression is that the UK's offer is below our expectations and that it risks worsening the situation of citizens"". And Joseph Muscat, the prime minister of Malta - who currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU - warned of people being ""treated differently"" depending on when they arrived in the UK. By political editor Laura Kuenssberg While complex, this summit was perhaps a brief respite from the brooding turmoil in her own party, where questions about the viability of her leadership lurk. Governing is doing, not fending off enemies - and at least today, Theresa May has done that. There was also a big hint about how the British negotiators hope to get round one of the big obstacles. As we've discussed before one of the big gaps between the two negotiating sides here are who will police the rules on citizen's rights. So, if something goes wrong, who can they appeal to, how will their rights be protected. The EU side is adamant that it can only be the European Court of Justice. Theresa May has been totally insistent that it can't be them. At the press conference this afternoon she repeated that it would be the British courts in charge. So far, so the same. But she then tantalisingly - if you are a nerd like me - said that because the rights would be agreed as part of the withdrawal treaty, they would be therefore subject to international law. Therefore, theoretically, that means they could be enforced by an international court of some variety. Lawyers suggest that is not likely to be the Hague, but could be some kind of new organisation that had British and European lawyers involved.Read more EU nationals in the UK currently have a right to permanent residence, granted after they have lived in the UK, legally and continuously, for five years. The European Union has said EU citizens should continue enjoying the same rights as they do now on a lifetime basis, enforceable by the European Court of Justice. But the UK's view is that British courts should have jurisdiction as they will be enshrined in UK law. This video can not be played ""There are still so many unknowns"" on future of EU citizens says ex-Czech Europe Minister Mrs May said there had been a ""very positive"" discussion with other EU countries. She acknowledged differences over their enforcement but said she ""remained of the view that this is a fair and serious offer"". 'Devil in the detail' of EU citizens deal EU prepares to move agencies from London ""Let's be clear about what we're saying. What we're saying is that those citizens from EU countries who have come to the United Kingdom, those EU citizens who have made their lives and homes in the UK will be able to stay and we will guarantee their rights,"" she said. The PM said the issue would be one of the first to be discussed and she wanted an agreement as soon as possible. In response to claims by the former chancellor George Osborne,in an article for the Evening Standard,external, that she had ""blocked"" calls for the UK to offer a unilateral guarantee of rights in the aftermath of last year's referendum, she said that was ""certainly not my recollection"" of events. Anne-Laure Donskoy, founding member of the 3million - which aims to protect the rights of EU citizens living in the UK - said the UK's offer was ""disappointing"" and ""really falls short of our expectations"". ""It is like a teaser this statement, it gives you general direction of travel potentially, but there are things in the statement that need to be unpicked."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the government to guarantee all UK-based EU citizens full residency rights, saying the current offer ""doesn't go far enough and leaves uncertainty for those who have been here for less than five years"". ""These are people who are working here and have families here - we have to end their uncertainty.""

Raqqa: The desperate fight for IS 'capital',"This video can not be played ""Welcome to Raqqa"": Watch Gabriel Gatehouse's full report As a battle to eject so-called Islamic State from Mosul grinds on, across the border in Syria, an alliance of US-backed fighters is advancing on the IS stronghold of Raqqa. The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse is one of the first reporters to reach the city. This has been a long and brutal road. Driving through the suburbs of Raqqa towards the centre, we pass collapsed buildings, hit by American air strikes, and pockmarked shop fronts, caught between the advance of the Syrian Democratic Forces and the retreating fighters who call themselves Islamic State. As the SDF, a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, pushes forwards, carts emerge, piled high with people and belongings, flying white flags. Some of these families sought refuge in Raqqa from other battles in Syria's long war, only to find themselves now back at the centre of the fighting. Others are emerging from years inside a living nightmare. ""They slaughtered us,"" says one man, a local house painter. ""They told us we were unbelievers, even though we are Muslims from birth, fasting and praying."" There are still tens of thousands ofpeople inside Raqqa, hostages to a regime that has been killing anyone who tries to leave. A Kurdish fighter looks across Raqqa after a coalition air strike ""We pray that God will have revenge against Islamic State,"" a woman says, clutching a small child. ""Everything that's happened to us is because of them."" The SDF made rapid advances through the outskirts of the city earlier this month, their progress eased by US air strikes and artillery. That bombardment continues: every so often the dull thud of a falling shell is followed by a cloud of dust over the centre of the city. A rare glimpse inside Raqqa Life inside 'Islamic State' Has IS's leader been killed? Trump and the battle for eastern Syria But now that SDF forces have reached the edge of the old city, the advance has slowed. IS fighters are hemmed in inside these narrow streets. Bombed from the air and surrounded on three sides, they are fighting back, with all the means at their disposal. We drive closer towards the centre. A sound overhead signals the presence of an IS drone: a small, remote-controlled helicopter that can drop a hand grenade, unseen, from the sky. On the top floor of a building overlooking the old city, a group of SDF fighters suddenly comes under fire. ""Sniper, sniperâ¦"" someone shouts. A woman in camouflage fatigues lies face-down on the ground and loads a heavy-calibre sniper rifle, loosing off rounds in the direction of the IS fire. Among the Kurds, men and women fight alongside one another. The sniper's name is Delilah. She is 22 years old, and was studying to become a nurse. But it is here, on the front lines, that she seems to have found her true calling. ""When I hit my target and I kill the enemy I become very happy,"" she says, laughing in between bursts of heavy gunfire. ""It boosts our morale and our power. We are protecting our friends and our people."" Delilah swapped nursing studies for the front line Returning from the front, exhausted fighters describe intense, all-night battles, as so-called Islamic State uses its network of tunnels to stage sneak attacks behind the SDF lines. ""They surrounded us. They were shooting from every side,"" says an Arab fighter who calls himself Mashuk. ""They caught one of us, they took him hostage. But we managed to get him back."" Drones, tunnels, suicide bombs, snipers: even in war, IS has weaponised fear. It has done this perhaps more successfully than any other group. The battle for Raqqa will be a long, hard fight. If IS loses its capital, it will surely mean the eventual end of the caliphate. But then what? Will the IS ideology die along with it? Probably not. It certainly won't be the end of Syria's long war, or the violence it has spawned around the world. Inside Raqqa: Full report.

Danger map reveals health threat zone,"South America is a hotbed of potential viruses that could be the next major threat to the world's health, according to ""danger maps"". The EcoHealth Alliance in New York looked at mammals, the viruses they harbour and how they come into contact with people. It revealed bats carry more potential threats than other mammals. The researchers hope the knowledge could be used to prevent the next HIV, Ebola or flu. Some of the most worrying infections have made the jump from animals to people - the world's largest Ebola outbreakseemed to start in bats,while HIV came from chimpanzees. Bats were predicted to have the most ""missing"" viruses The researchers' challenge - and it was far from easy - was to predict from where the next could emerge. They looked at all 586 viruses known to infect 754 species of mammal. This included 188 zoonotic infections - those that have infected both humans and other mammals. But they also knew some species had been studied in incredible detail while others had been practically ignored. So the researchers used the information they did know to fill the gaps in their knowledge and estimate which species were harbouring viruses with the potential to infect people. The study, published in the journal Nature, predicts 17 zoonotic infections in every species of bat and 10 in every species of primate and rodent. The team then mapped the ranges of species and the infections they carry to work out where the world's danger zones are. The risk of viruses coming from bats was global, but concentrated in South America The threat from primates was in tropical regions The threat from rodents was again global, but with a concentration in South America. Dr Kevin Olival, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""The missing hotspots are different for different groups of mammals in different parts of the world, but the bat signal overwhelms some of the others. ""But I'm not scared of bats, it's not the bat's fault."" The researchers hope their maps will help the world prepare for the next infection that makes the jump. Dr Olival added: ""Our take-home message is these diseases are emerging because of the human impact on the environment. Our answer is minimise our contact with wildlife, including through hunting and habitat destruction."" James Lloyd-Smith. from the University of California, Los Angeles, said: ""Although most pandemics are zoonoses, most zoonoses do not cause pandemics. ""[The] predictions are best used to prioritise research and viral surveillance efforts, not to drive specific policy decisions."" The researchers' next project will look at birds which are another source of zoonotic infections such as avian flu. Follow Jameson Twitter.,external Bill Gates 'hopeful' of pandemic response.

Hinkley Point deal 'risky and expensive',"Artist's impression of Hinkley Point C building proposals UK government plans for a new Â£18bn nuclear power station have come under fire from public auditors, who call it ""a risky and expensive project"". The National Audit Office (NAO) said the costs and risks for consumers had not been sufficiently considered. Its report comes nine months after the government granted final approval for the project, which is being financed by the French and Chinese governments. The government said building the plant was an ""important strategic decision"". State-controlled French energy firm EDF is funding two-thirds of the project, which will create more than 25,000 jobs, with China investing the remaining Â£6bn. Critics of the deal have warned of escalating costs and the implications of allowing nuclear power plants to be built in the UK by foreign governments. The NAO's report centred on the role of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in finalising the deal in 2016. At the time, said the NAO, the department's own value-for-money tests showed ""the economic case for Hinkley Point C was marginal and subject to significant uncertainty"". ""But the department's capacity to take alternative approaches to the deal were limited after it had agreed terms,"" the NAO added. ""The government has increasingly emphasised Hinkley Point C's unquantified strategic benefits, but it has little control over these and no plan yet in place to realise them."" It added that consumers were ""locked in"" to years of paying for the plant. In response to the report, a BEIS spokesperson said building the plant was ""an important strategic decision to ensure that nuclear is part of a diverse energy mix"". The department said the project would provide ""clean, reliable electricity powering six million homes and creating more than 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships in the process"". EDF Energy said the plant ""remains good value for consumers compared with alternative choices"". The firm added:  ""Consumers won't pay a penny until the power station is operating and it is EDF Energy and [China's] CGN who will take the risk and responsibility of delivering it. ""The project is having a major impact on the UK's industrial capacity, jobs and skills. Relaunching the UK nuclear new build industry at Hinkley Point C will enable costs for future projects, in particular Sizewell C, to be lower."" The Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) said the report showed that the plant was ""competitive with other low-carbon projects"" and that ""alternatives would cost more"". However, NIA chief executive Tom Greatrex added: ""The NAO analysis of the strike price also highlights that using a different financing structure could have resulted in a lower strike price. ""That is something government should reflect on as other new nuclear projects advance."" Speaking to the BBC, Mr Greatrex said: ""With two-thirds of our capacity coming to the end of its life by 2030, we need to replace that, we need to do that in as low-carbon a way as possible, we need to do that in a way where we're not overly exposed to the volatility of fossil fuel prices on international markets. Nuclear, alongside renewables and other technologies, helps us do that."" ""It's really important that we get new capacity built, because we've got so much that is going offline in a relatively short period of time. ""We've left it a long time, and actually saying we should reassess and start again - we haven't got the luxury of time to be able to do that.""

Police cuts 'a risk to mass riot response',"In August 2011, thousands of people rioted in London and elsewhere in England Police in England and Wales would struggle to deal with riots on the scale of 2011 due to budget cuts, an officer who oversees funding has said. Chief Constable Dave Thompson, of West Midlands Police, said the ""strain is showing"" after multiple terror attacks. ""We'd have real challenges in dealing with something like the 2011 riots again,"" he wrote on theNational Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) blog,externalon Friday. The home secretary has admitted that police resources are ""very tight"". Amber Rudd told MPs on Thursdaythat the police response to attacks in Manchester and London required ""additional work"" in law enforcement. She said: ""I recognise the fact that we cannot carry on at that emergency level indefinitely."" Mr Thompson, finance lead at the NPCC, which represents police leaders, called on the government to ""stabilise"" police funding so it can tackle not only terrorism but other threats, such as cyber-crime. This video can not be played The budget in 2020 will be the same as 2015 so ""we'll have to use reserves"" says West Midlands Police Chief He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""policing is not raising a white flag, saying we can't cope"". ""But the last few weeks, and our general resilience, is starting to show some red lights. ""Of course, policing will pull out all the stops to protect the public. ""But that strain on the system now is reaching a stage where we need a serious debate, as we go forward into the Budget in November, as to what the resources are for policing."" He wrote that the police face handling ""a modern terror threat with 6,600 officers - a number that has already fallen by close to 2,000 and is set to fall further"". And he also said more investment was needed ""with a growing cyber threat"", adding: ""Counter-terrorism policing is stretched and is in no place to deliver efficiency savings."" He said mainstream police resources were being diverted to fight terrorism, echoing warnings byAssistant Commissioner Mark Rowleythat ordinary law enforcement faced ""significant"" funding risks after four terror attacks in as many months. The violence that spread around England began at a peaceful protest demanding justice for a man shot by police in London. Mark Duggan was killed in Tottenham on Thursday 4 August after police stopped the car he was a passenger in. A protest march two days later sparked unrest and resulted in cars and shops in Tottenham being set alight, and looting taking place. By the afternoon of Monday 8 August this began to spread to other areas in London,  then to other major cities such as Birmingham, Nottingham, Bristol, Leicester, and several areas in Manchester and Liverpool. More than 1,000 people were eventually jailed for the disturbances. Maps and timeline of England riots Mr Thompson said: ""The firearms commanders, casualty bureau, custody staff, body recovery teams and uniformed officers patrolling crowded spaces that are so central to preventing and responding to a terror attack are paid for by core police funding."" He said that two-thirds of the policing effort after the Westminster Bridge attack was met by core police funding and not counter-terrorism. He said: ""If we are to sustain the protection citizens want and need, police leaders need to continue to reform, look hard at what needs to be done differently, and be bold and innovative in rising to the challenge. ""We need to have a conversation and a partnership with government that enables us to look forward to deal with the threats we face, and there are choices in there for government that we will give them."" This was not simply ""asking for a blank cheque"", he said. Mr Thompson said officers responding to terror attacks were paid for by core police funding Mr Thompson's comments were backed by West Yorkshire Police Chief Constable Dee Collins. ""Our resources will only stretch so far and my concern is just how sustainable this in the long term, without an uplift in funding and resources,"" she said. The Home Office has said it is in""detailed engagement"" with policeover planned funding changes. A spokesman said: ""The government is undertaking a period of detailed engagement with policing partners and independent experts on the police funding formula. ""New proposals will not be implemented without a public consultation."" Meanwhile, chief constables in England and Wales are to consider measures to allow more officers to carry guns. A discussion paper is being prepared for a meeting next month in response to the terror attacks over the past three months. The options include equipping more officers with Tasers, increasing the availability of armed response vehicles and specialist firearms officers - and giving some front-line police small firearms for personal protection. However, there appears to be no appetite among senior officers for a fundamental change to policing practices by routinely arming all police.

Film shines light on London's underworld,"The film depicts a world of brutal crime and crushed hopes and dreams In 2009, a Chinese woman called Anna killed herself near London's Heathrow Airport. Her friends later learned that she had been working as a prostitute in an illegal massage parlour. One of those friends, Jenny Lu, a Taiwanese art school graduate, began a journey to find out about her secret life. It resulted in Lu's first feature film, The Receptionist, which premieres in Taiwan on Friday and at the Edinburgh Film Festival in the UK next week. Some readers may find aspects of this story upsetting. ""I met Anna in Chinatown at a dinner gathering. She looked really normal,"" recalls director Lu. ""She came from a little village in China. She went to London because she wanted a better life. But she ended up living a double life that no-one knew about. ""I felt really sad. How come no-one knew about this and no-one was able to help?"" Through a mutual friend, Lu tracked down women who had worked with Anna at a massage parlour. They were immigrants from mainland China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Other parlours employed women from well-off economies including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea or Japan. Like some of the women, Anna arrived in the UK on a fake marriage. Many women pay a lot of money for fake marriages or fake passports to get to the UK ""She was married to a British guy but he didn't have a job. Anna's family had paid a lot of money to arrange this fake marriage for her. She worked really hard to try to pay back the debt and to support her brother in China,"" Ms Lu explains. Other women came here on fake passports. Some were divorced and wanted to start a new life in the UK. Some wanted to earn money to support their children. Others, including those from Taiwan, were language students enticed by money. After arriving in the UK, many realised it was much harder than they had expected to survive, not to mention achieve their dream, so they resorted to working at the massage parlours, Lu said. The Receptionist is based on the lives of the employees and clients at a massage parlour in London, as seen through the eyes of a Taiwanese graduate employed as a receptionist there. It unabashedly portrays the treatment the women endure, including being subjected to abuse and extreme fetishes. Gangsters demanded ""protection"" money from the women, and would beat, rob and rape them if they didn't pay up, knowing they wouldn't dare call the police. The women are abused, beaten and raped by the criminals 'protecting' them Though the scenes in the film are fictionalised, they are all based on the experiences of Anna and her colleagues. ""The actors initially didn't believe the script. So I arranged for them to meet the women,"" she tells. The women charged the men around Â£120 ($152) for sexual intercourse. The parlour owner would keep 50% to 60% of that. While some women eventually quit, many stayed even though they were not forced to, and even after they had made some money. Not fluent in English, they worried they would have a hard time finding a well-paid job. ""They always say they want to leave after a year or a few monthsâ¦ but they get used to making quick money,"" Ms Lu says. The women live practically in total isolation from the outside world ""They don't want to choose other jobs where they can't earn as much. They think: 'How can I afford to keep living if I don't do this?'"" ""It's a dangerous mindset. It's like a hole they dig for themselves. So many people can't get out."" The women rarely went out because they feared the neighbours would find out. They worked day and night. Their curtains were always drawn. ""What surprised me was that many of the women had never actually seen any London landmarks,"" said Lu. My 25 years as a prostitute What is it like selling sex in London? The mothers secretly working as sex workers Many were the pride of their family when they went abroad.  They were ashamed to go home or tell their family the truth. Some try to forget their past and the normal life they used to have. ""It's like a person with no soul. They don't want to think too much,"" Lu explains. Tina, the receptionist, hides her job from her boyfriend - but he later finds out Anna was 35 years old when she killed herself. She had only been in the UK for two years and had been working in the sex industry for about a year. ""Some of her friends think she got pressured because her family kept asking for money,"" the director says. ""Others thought she couldn't accept the job she was doing, so every day was a struggle."" ""And a friend had borrowed money from her to open a restaurant. When she asked for the money back, that friend threatened to tell her family what she did for a living. She was panicky."" ""She thought about her family a lot; she hadn't really wanted to go abroad."" This was very different from Lu's own life - her family was able to support her studies, enabling her to pursue her goal of becoming a filmmaker. ""It was a shock for me because previously, I had never had the opportunity to meet people like that,"" the director says. Jenny Lu's film has already been nominated for several international awards Despite a low budget - Â£300,000 mostly from two Taiwanese government subsidies and a little raised from Kickstarter - Lu's film has been selected for screening in the Edinburgh International Film Festival, and has been nominated by the Milan International Film Awards and Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards. ""I'm delighted people feel something after watching the film,"" Lu says. ""The message I want to send is even if you've walked far and chased your dream for so long, turn back and look at where you came from, what your initial dream was. Many people forget."" Lu plans to show the women the film when she returns to the UK, so they will see that she has told Anna's story. What is it like selling sex in London?
