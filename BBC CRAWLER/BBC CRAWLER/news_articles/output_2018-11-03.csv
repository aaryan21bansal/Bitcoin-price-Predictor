"Nick Cave: If we love, we grieve","Cave's son died after falling from a cliff in Brighton Musician Nick Cave has shared an emotional open letter about how he still feels the presence of his son, Arthur, who died in 2015 aged 15. The Australian artist was responding to a letter from a fan who said she still felt ""some communication"" with family and friends who had died recently. Cave replied: ""If we love, we grieve... I feel the presence of my son, all around, but he may not be there."" Arthur died in the UK after falling from a cliff in Brighton. Cave is best known as lead singer of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. He has been described as ""one of the most intense and exciting live acts on the planet."" Cave posted the letter on The Red Hand Files,external, a website he uses to communicate with fans, earlier this week. Why grief is not something you have to 'get over' One fan from the US wrote: ""I have experienced the death of my father, my sister, and my first love in the past few years and feel that I have some communication with them, mostly through dreams. They are helping me. ""Are you and Susie feeling that your son Arthur is with you and communicating in some way?"" Cave thanked the fan for the ""beautiful question"", and shared his experience of dealing with grief. This video can not be played Arthur Cave was found at the bottom of the cliff at Ovingdean Gap in July ""Grief and love are forever intertwined. Grief is the terrible reminder of the depths of our love and, like love, grief is non-negotiable. There is a vastness to grief that overwhelms our minuscule selves."" ""Within that whirling gyre all manner of madnesses exist; ghosts and spirits and dream visitations, and everything else that we, in our anguish, will into existence. ""These are precious gifts that are as valid and as real as we need them to be. They are the spirit guides that lead us out of the darkness."" Kylie reunites with Cave for festival duet Nick Cave becomes reluctant film star He added that he felt the presence of Arthur all the time. ""I hear him talk to me, parent me, guide me, though he may not be there. ""Dread grief trails bright phantoms in its wake. These spirits are ideas, essentially. They are our stunned imaginations reawakening after the calamity. ""Like ideas, these spirits speak of possibility. Follow your ideas, because on the other side of the idea is change and growth and redemption. Create your spirits. Call to them. Will them alive. Speak to them. ""It is their impossible and ghostly hands that draw us back to the world from which we were jettisoned; better now and unimaginably changed."" In September,Cave and his colleagues mourned the death of bandmate Conway Savage, who died aged 58.

Business leaders call for new Brexit vote,"Authors of the letter say the original ballot did not reflect the choices now facing the UK More than 70 business leaders have signed a letter to the Sunday Times calling for a public vote on the UK's Brexit deal. The chief executive of Waterstones and former Sainsbury's boss Justin King are among those saying a ""destructive hard Brexit"" will damage the UK economy. A group called Business for a People's Vote will launch on Thursday. A Downing Street source told the BBC the Prime Minister was clear that there would be no new referendum. The letter was coordinated by The People's Vote campaign, which wants a ballot on whether to accept the terms of the UK's departure from the European Union. Richard Reed, co-founder of Innocent Drinks and Martha Lane Fox, the founder of Lastminute.com - who both campaigned for Remain - signed the letter, as did Lord Myners, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer. How will Parliament vote on a final deal? All you need to know about Brexit It reads: ""The business community was promised that, if the country voted to leave, there would continue to be frictionless trade with the EU and the certainty about future relations that we need to invest for the long term. ""Despite the Prime Minister's best efforts, the proposals being discussed by the government and the European Commission fall far short of this. ""The uncertainty over the past two years has already led to a slump in investment."" The letter concludes: ""We are now facing either a blindfold or a destructive hard Brexit. ""Given that neither was on the ballot in 2016, we believe the ultimate choice should be handed back to the public with a People's Vote."" Waterstones chief executive James Daunt told the BBC: ""All the paper we use is imported. We rely on just-in-time methods and now there are multiple uncertainties."" Prime Minister Theresa May has said asking the public to vote again would be a betrayal of the public's trust. The Downing Street source told the BBC: ""The Prime Minister has been clear - no second referendum. ""We had a people's vote, it was in June 2016.""

Brexit 'fraying' UK-Irish relationship,"Leo Varadkar says Ireland is entering into a potentially difficult period, even if there is an agreement The Irish prime minister says Brexit is fraying relations between Ireland and Britain. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it had also ""undermined"" the Good Friday Agreement (GFA). The Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998 after intense negotiations between the UK government, the Irish government and Northern Ireland political parties. The UK government says ""nothing we agree with the EU will risk a return to a hard border"". The Irish border is one of the biggest sticking points in the Brexit negotiations. Good Friday Agreement - 20 years on Brexit: All you need to know Your guide to EU jargon ""Anything that pulls the communities apart in Northern Ireland undermines the Good Friday Agreement, and anything that pulls Britain and Ireland apart undermines that relationship,"" said Mr Varadkar on RTE's Marian Finucane programme. Earlier, the chair of the Republic of Ireland's Senate Brexit Committee said a return to a hard border threatened the peace process. Senator Neale Richmond told pro-Brexit Conservative MP Owen Paterson on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that plans for solving the border dispute using ""existing practical systems"" was ""completely unfeasible"". Brexit talks have reached an impasse over the EU's ""backstop"" plan, which would see Northern Ireland effectively remaining in the customs union and single market unless alternative arrangements were found to prevent a hard border. The taoiseach's comments came two days after Nobel peace prize winner and Conservative Lord Trimble accused Mr Varadkar's government of ""riding roughshod"" over the GFA. Lord Trimble, who helped draw up the landmark agreement, said the Brexit process could result in Northern Ireland ending up as part of an ""effective EU protectorate"". Mr Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, reiterated that claim, saying that any backstop which involved the whole UK staying in a customs union would be a ""total betrayal"" of millions of Leave voters and the 85% of voters at the last general election who backed Tory and Labour manifestos which committed to leaving. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since January 2017 The Irish prime minister said Ireland was entering into a potentially difficult period, even if an agreement was struck. The UK government said any deal would not "" threaten the arrangements under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, and we continue to work very closely with the Irish Government on this"". ""We are also working together to ensure the unique bilateral ties between our countries remain strong into the future,"" a spokesperson added. Mr Varadkar also said he had a good relationship with Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in need to come to an agreement to reinstate the Stormont Assembly, he said. Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017, when the power-sharing parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in -split in a bitter row. If there was some clarity on Brexit in the next couple of weeks or months, there would be an opportunity to get the executive up and running again, Mr Varadkar added. The UK and the EU both want to avoid a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which may include physical checks or infrastructure, but cannot agree how. A key part of the negotiation is the controversial border ""backstop"". The backstop is a position of last resort, to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. In a backstop situation, there could in theory be two types of Irish Sea checks: Customs- to make sure the right EU tariffs have been paid Regulatory- to make sure goods meet EU safety and quality standards The government has been adamant it would never accept Irish Sea customs checks. But it has also been careful not to completely close down the prospect of regulatory checks.

French territory votes on independence,"Supporters of independence remained defiant despite the result Voters in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia have rejected a bid for independence. Final results showed that 56.4% chose to remain part of France while 43.6% voted to leave - a tighter result than some polls had predicted. Turnout was about 81%. The vote was promised in a 1988 deal that put an end to a violent campaign for independence. President Emmanuel Macron said it showed ""confidence in the French republic"". ""I have to tell you how proud I am that we have finally passed this historic step together,"" he added. The referendum passed peacefully but some unrest was reported after polls closed. Cars and a shop were set ablaze in the capital, NoumÃ©a, local media reported, and the high commissioner's office said some roads were closed by protesters. There were some disturbances after the result became clear New Caledonia has large deposits of nickel, a vital component in manufacturing electronics, and is seen by France as a strategic political and economic asset in the region. This video can not be played The New Caledonia referendum is the climax of 20 years of peace It is one of the UN's 17 ""non-self governing territories"",external- where the process of decolonisation has not been completed. About 175,000 people were eligible to vote in Sunday's referendum New Caledonia, east of Australia, where indigenous Kanaks make up 39.1% of the population. French nationalism is strong among the territory's ethnic Europeans - constituting 27.1% of the population - and observers say even some Kanaks back staying part of France. The remaining third of the population of New Caledonia's 268,000 inhabitants are also largely said to oppose independence. New Caledonia profile The remote islands receive about â¬1.3bn (Â£1.1bn; $1.5bn) from the French government every year. Pro-independence groups said they wanted ""a multicultural, peaceful nation"" President Emmanuel Macron, in a televised speech, said the result was ""a sign of confidence in the French republic"" During a visit to NoumÃ©a in May, Mr Macron said that France would be ""less beautiful without New Caledonia"". France first claimed the islands in 1853 and once used them as a penal colony. In the 1980s there were deadly clashes between French forces and Kanaks. The climax of that conflict came when Kanak separatists killed four French gendarmes and took another 23 hostage in a cave. The subsequent French assault cost the lives of 19 Kanaks and two soldiers. About 80% of those eligible voted In 1988 representatives from the both pro- and anti-independence camps agreed to end the violence and eventually hold a self-determination referendum. A No vote may not spell the end of the independence drive. Two further referendums on independence can still be held before 2022. A Yes vote would have made New Caledonia the first French territory to break away since Djibouti (1977) and Vanuatu (1980). New Caledonia is represented in the French parliament by two deputies and two senators. It has a congress which elects an executive with powers over some policy areas - notably policing, education and local laws. New Caledonia profile Independence vote - where parties stand.

Leicester win in emotional game,"This video can not be played Emotional Leicester team observe silence at Cardiff Leicester City played with great will and nerve to beat Cardiff City on an emotional day as the Foxes returned to action for the first time since the death of their owner in a helicopter crash. On an afternoon when football seemed both an irrelevance and a form of release for Leicester's grieving players and fans, the two clubs united to remember Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and the other four people who lost their lives on 27 October. Leicester's players were visibly moved during a minute's silence and, after the laying of wreaths before the match, there were further tributes including the unfurling of banners shared between the two sets of fans, who joined forces to create a stirring atmosphere of rare solidarity. Once the match at Cardiff City Stadium was under way, it was contested as fiercely as any Premier League fixture with chances at both ends in a goalless but competitive first half. Cardiff's Victor Camarasa struck the crossbar with a free-kick and Jamie Vardy felt Leicester should have had a penalty when his shot appeared to hit Sol Bamba's arm. However, the Foxes were not to be denied and, after Demarai Gray scored with a low finish early in the second half, there was a huge outpouring of emotion as the entire team celebrated together before running over to their travelling supporters. After scoring, Gray removed his jersey to reveal an undershirt on which the words 'For Khun Vichai' were emblazoned as a tribute to Srivaddhanaprabha, whose name the Leicester fans continued to sing for the rest of a highly charged and poignant afternoon. After the final whistle, the Leicester players and backroom team stood and applauded with their fans long after the game had ended. The Foxes move up to 10th in the table while Cardiff drop into the relegation zone in 18th after Newcastle beat Watford 1-0. Leicester pay tribute to Srivaddhanaprabha Thailand funeral begins for Leicester owner Relive Leicester's win over Cardiff Reaction from all of Saturday's Premier League action Leicester fans paid tribute to Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha throughout the game Srivaddhanaprabha, who died in the crash outside Leicester's King Power Stadium following their previous league game against West Ham, was an owner revered and loved like few others. The Thai billionaire bought Leicester in 2010 for Â£39m, cleared their debts and oversaw the club's promotion to the top flight four years later. They then beat odds of 5,000-1 to claim the Premier League title in 2015-16 in one of the greatest sporting stories of all time. His death - along with those of Nusara Suknamai, Kaveporn Punpare, pilot Eric Swaffer and his partner Izabela Roza Lechowicz - was described as the darkest day in the club's history. The tragedy cast a shadow over the entire city, evident in the outpouring of grief throughout the week from players, staff and supporters. Having postponed Tuesday's Carabao Cup tie against Southampton, this return to action gave Leicester the opportunity to pay their respects on the pitch. It was a decision to which the club gave deep consideration, consulting the Srivaddhanaprabha family and the players, who Vardy said were determined to honour their owner's name with a display of strength. They were wholeheartedly backed by their travelling supporters, most of whom were wearing t-shirts bearing an image of Srivaddhanaprabha's face and the words 'The Boss'. During the pre-match warm-up, Leicester's players were even given a standing ovation by Cardiff's fans, such was the sense of harmony as the two clubs stood shoulder to shoulder in such extraordinary circumstances. The Foxes rose to the occasion admirably, harnessing the emotion of the occasion and using it to fuel a powerful performance. Next, the players will fly to Thailand to attend Srivaddhanaprabha's funeral as Leicester - the club and city - continues to grieve. The entire Leicester team celebrated Demarai Gray's goal Leicester manager Claude Puel had said beforehand the result was ""not important"", while his Cardiff counterpart Neil Warnock acknowledged football can seem ""irrelevant"" in the aftermath of such a tragedy. However, they fully supported the decision to play and, after the solemnity of the pre-match tributes, Cardiff City Stadium was at full volume as the game started at a ferocious pace. The hosts set the tempo, pressing their opponents and trying to force them into mistakes. That approach almost bore fruit after half an hour, with an unsettled Leicester defence fouling Harry Arter on the edge of the penalty area and Camarasa striking the resultant free-kick against the crossbar. After a tricky period in which England centre-back Harry Maguire left the field injured, Leicester eventually got a foothold in the game and had an excellent chance to score when Wilfred Ndidi headed wide from a corner. The Foxes felt they should have had a penalty just before the interval but, although Vardy's shot on the rebound appeared to hit Bamba's arm, referee Lee Probert ignored the visitors' furious protestations. It did not prove to be a costly decision for Puel's side, who made the decisive breakthrough 10 minutes into the second half. Ben Chilwell sped into the penalty area and clipped a perfectly weighted cross to Gray, who carefully guided his half-volley low into the net to spark emotional celebrations which will live long in the memory. Leicester's players celebrated the victory with travelling fans at full-time while displaying a banner in honour of Vichai Leicester captain Wes Morgan: ""You can see by our reaction at the end of the game, how much we wanted to get the win and do it for the chairman. We felt the pressure before the game. It was a scrappy game, the lads fought to the very end. This video can not be played Cardiff 0-1 Leicester: Today is the first step for Leicester - Claude Puel ""We were very close to the chairman. We know what his wishes were. He used to come down at home games, have a joke and laugh, always say 'want win and three points'. We did that today. It has not been an easy week, we had to try and hold our emotions in today and do the best we can. We have a very emotional connection with the fans, so we stayed till the end and celebrated victory with them."" Leicester manager Claude Puel: ""It was a normal thing for us to have the players and staff for the minute's silence, it is important for solidarity and we want to give our best for our chairman, step by step, to continue his work. ""It is a family and I think Vichai with his warmth, it is a mission to keep this way, and put in place a project that we must try to continue. When we saw the flowers in front of the stadium - it is a family and the feeling that our chairman gave this club."" Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel: ""That was a tough game not just on the pitch but mentally. There are a lot of exhausted people in there now but I am proud of this team and the club, the way everyone has handled themselves has been unbelievable. We were very lucky to know Khun Vichai. ""Today was difficult, coming out for the warm-up was tough, the first 10 minutes I couldn't steady myself, I was shaking a little bit. But it was nice to get a win to take to Thailand now and hopefully we did his family proud."" This video can not be played Fine margins decided game on surreal day - Neil Warnock Cardiff defender Sol Bamba: ""He [Vichai] was a good man. I had the chance to meet him and he was a big loss. It was difficult for us, the whole build-up wasn't easy to handle. But that is not an excuse, the gaffer warned us about this. Obviously we pay respects before and after, but during the game we are professional."" The left-back dealt solidly with his few defensive duties but it was in attack where he excelled, constantly speeding down the left flank and providing a delightful assist for the winning goal Cardiff have just one win in their past 15 Premier League games, drawing three and losing 11. Leicester are the only side to score in all their Premier League games this season (11 games). Cardiff have failed to score in six Premier League games this season, a joint-divisional high along with Huddersfield and Southampton. Leicester have won seven of their past nine Premier League games against promoted sides (drawn one, lost one). Leicester have won three of their past five Premier League away games (lost two), as many victories as they had managed in their previous 12 on the road in the competition (drawn one, lost eight). Leicester's players travel to Bangkok for the funeral of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and arrive back in midweek to prepare for their home match against Burnley on Saturday, 10 November (15:00 GMT) while Cardiff host Brighton on the same day at 12:30.

Blasphemy case lawyer flees Pakistan,"Protesters have been demanding Asia Bibi's death penalty be reinstated The lawyer representing a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy after eight years on death row has fled Pakistan in fear for his life. Saif Mulook told news agency AFP he had to leave so he could continue to represent Asia Bibi, whose conviction was overturned by judges on Wednesday. Officials have since agreed to bar Asia Bibi from leaving Pakistan in order to end violent protests over the ruling. Campaigners blasted the deal as akin to signing her ""death warrant"". Asia Bibi was convicted in 2010 of insulting the Prophet Muhammad during a row with neighbours, and many are calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty following her acquittal. Mr Mulook told the BBC earlier this week she would need to move to a Western country for her own safety. A number of attempts have previously been made on her life. Several countries have offered her asylum. Pakistan's 'historic' Asia Bibi ruling Why Pakistan's Christians are targeted Blasphemy laws around the world Pakistani Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry defended the government against allegations that a deal reached with an Islamist party was capitulating to extremists. He said the government would ""take all steps necessary"" to ensure Asia Bibi's safety. Mr Mulook, however, called the agreement ""painful"". ""They cannot even implement an order of the country's highest court,"" he told AFP before he boarded the plane to Europe. Mr Mulook said he had decided to leave as it was ""not possible"" to continue living in Pakistan, adding: ""I need to stay alive as I still have to fight the legal battle for Asia Bibi."" This video can not be played Asia Bibi's escape from Pakistan death row He told Pakistan's Express Tribune he would return to the country to defend his client - but needed the government to provide security. The protests were led by the Tehreek-i-Labaik (TLP) party. As party of its deal with the TLP, the government said it would not oppose petitions filed against the Supreme Court's verdict. All protesters arrested since Asia Bibi's acquittal will be released, and any violence towards them will be investigated. The government will also start legal proceedings to put her on a list which would ban her from leaving Pakistan. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In return, the TLP is asking its supporters to stop the protests and disperse peacefully. The authorities earlier said that Asia Bibi was scheduled for release later this week. The trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi, whose full name is Asia Noreen, had with a group of women in June 2009. They were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. There is widespread support for severe punishments for blasphemers in Pakistan Prosecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response. She was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation. In Wednesday's ruling, the Supreme Court said that the case was based on flimsy evidence and her confession was delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"". Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong. Hard-line politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base. Christians: Pakistan's 'forgotten minority' The last hours of a Christian sanitary worker in Pakistan But critics say the laws have often been used to get revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence. The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community, but since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population. The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance. Since 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy. Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted? Pakistani Christians fear blasphemy laws.

Leicester players fly to Thai funeral,"This video can not be played Emotional Leicester team observe silence at Cardiff Leicester City players and officials are flying to Thailand to attend the funeral of the club's owner who died in a helicopter crash. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's funeral began at a Bangkok temple on Saturday with Buddhist bathing rituals and will be followed by recitation ceremonies. Players will be attending services on Sunday and Monday afterbeating Cardiff 1-0in the first game since his death. Before the match they wore T-shirts featuring a picture of Mr Vichai. They stood for a minute's silence along with Leicester City staff and fans ahead of the kick-off. Flowers and a photograph of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha were placed next to his urn at the temple in Bangkok Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel wore his shirt during the warm-up Mr Vichai died with two members of his staff, the pilot and a passenger when the helicopter crashed moments after taking off from the King Power Stadium on 27 October. His funeral began with a bathing rite ceremony and will be followed by recitation ceremonies over seven days. The ceremony was held behind closed doors and a special funeral urn and also a five-tiered umbrella, which reflected his high status, was used. Aimon Srivaddhanaprabha (L), the wife of Mr Vichai, during his funeral rite Mourners could be seen through a glass door at Mr Vichai's funeral Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, the manager of Thailand's women's football team, and the president of the Football Association of Thailand were among the guests. Leicester City players and club officials are expected to arrive back in the UK on Tuesday morning. Mr Vichai's bodyarrived in Thailand on Fridayahead of the funeral. By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent, Bangkok The start of this lengthy funeral was in stark contrast to the emotional scenes witnessed at the Leicester City stadium. It began with a stately bathing ceremony for Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's body at a royal temple in Bangkok, attended by his family and a few senior political and business figures. They poured holy water donated by King Maha Vajiralongkorn over flowers adorning the coffin, which was inscribed with the initials VS, and the simple words, ""the possible man"", reflecting his business and sporting success. This Buddhist funeral serves an important religious function for the deceased, with rituals like the nightly chanting by monks accumulating merit for him. But it serves a social function too, affirming the status he achieved, in particular by getting royal sponsorship. Mr Vichai had a quite different image in Thailand than he had in Britain, a private and cunning entrepreneur who cultivated powerful connections to see off challenges to his lucrative duty-free monopoly, through which he became very rich, very quickly. There is little of the public affection and gratitude on display here that has been so visible in Britain. But when the Leicester City team arrives in Thailand to attend the funeral, Thais will be reminded of just how much this improbable hero meant to football fans on the other side of the world. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought Leicester City in 2010 Nusara Suknamai, Kaveporn Punpare, and pilots and partners Eric Swaffer and Izabela Roza Lechowicz also died in the crash last Saturday. Police have said Ms Lechowicz was a passenger at the time of the crash. Who was Leicester's billionaire owner?

"Three-day roof ordeal man, 102, dies","Ron Easton was hidden in a gulley on the flat roof of his home for three days An elderly man who was stuck on the roof of his house for three days has died in hospital. Ron Easton, 102, was found in a gulley on his flat roof at Bigbury-on-Sea, Devon, on 24 October after his neighbour became concerned at a build-up of milk bottles and papers. It is thought the former racing driver - known locally as ""Ton-Up Ron"" - fell while attempting to fix his aerial. He was taken to hospital in Plymouth but died on Friday, his family said. Until his accident, Mr Easton was regularly seen driving in his blue MG Mr Easton was given the nickname because of his love of cars and before his accident could be seen driving around the area in his blue MG. A flag in the village has been lowered to half mast, with a local tribute saying ""Ton-Up Ron RIP"".

Adoptions fall by 62% as IVF success rises,"Heather with her husband and four children Heather Bell persevered with IVF for almost five years before she had children. ""I thought about adopting all the time,"" she told BBC News, but she and her husband decided to pursue IVF. The boss of a body that represents children in care has said the success of IVF has contributed to a drop in the number of children being adopted. In the last 40 years since the first ""test-tube baby"" was born, adoptions in England and Wales have fallen by 62%. Meanwhile, IVF success rates for women under 35 have nearly tripled. Why I chose to go it alone with IVF The 'highs and lows' of adopting children BBC Radio 4 - The Adoption When she decided against adoption, Heather, now 41, said she was shocked, embarrassed, disappointed and frustrated at her feelings around her decision. But despite two miscarriages and two full cycles of IVF, she felt she wanted to try to have her biological children. Eventually she gave birth to two daughters through IVF, and went on to have two more children naturally. Even if she had not given birth, she said, she felt she might not have had the ""emotional energy"" to go through the adoption system. It is that system that Anthony Douglas, head of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass) has spoken aboutin an interview with the Daily Telegraph,external. He says the adoption process in England is ""far too slow"". And it is having to compete with other ways of becoming a parent. Mr Douglas, 69 - who was himself adopted - told the newspaper: ""IVF used to be around 7% successful and now it's around 30%. ""So as a choice, adoption is competing with lots of other ways of having children."" He added: ""Every child deserves a family to live and grow up in but adoption still takes twice as long as it should, which puts people off."" Data from the Office for National Statistics,externalsuggests there were 12,121 children adopted in England and Wales in 1978. In 2017, 4,350 looked after children in England were adopted,government figures show.,externalWhile in Wales,more than 300 children,externalwere placed in their adoptive home. But the falling number of adoptions is despite an increase in the number of children in care in England. There are 72,670 looked after children in England as of March 2017. The adopted children confused by love 'Powerful first moment' with adopted child Earlier this month, the National Adoption Serviceput out a callfor prospective parents in Wales to come forward to help, following an ""unanticipated increase"" in children looking for homes. Meanwhile, Department of Education figures for England suggested the average duration between entry into care and being adopted decreased from 22 months in 2012-13 to 16 months in 2016-17, while the number of children waiting to be matched with a family dropped from 5,500 to 2,500 over the same period. The department said the number of looked after children in England who were adopted was up from 3,100 in 2011, although numbers fell in 2016 and 2017. A spokesperson said: ""Every child deserves to have a loving, stable home that's right for them, and thousands of families have had their lives transformed by adoption. ""We have invested Â£90m in the Adoption Support Fund and we are setting up Regional Adoption Agencies to further improve the time it takes for the child to go to live with their new family."" IVF - or in vitro fertilisation - is when an egg is removed from a woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop. It worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born This video can not be played Louise Brown's 40th birthday has been marked by a new museum exhibition in London On average, IVF fails 70% of the time and it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive using it. The highest success rates are for women under 35 - one-third of treatment cycles are successful. Guidelines say it should be offered to women until the age of 42. Howeverlast week it emergedthat in 12 areas of England, women over 34 are being automatically refused IVF treatment on the NHS.

Army introduces zero-tolerance drugs policy,"The Army is introducing a zero-tolerance drugs policy in an effort to ensure ""high standards"" are maintained, the defence secretary has announced. Gavin Williamson said the use of drugs was ""incompatible"" with military service, as he announced there would be no more readmissions of former users. Previous rules allowed soldiers sacked for taking illegal drugs to be readmitted if they passed a fresh test. Mr Williamson said drug taking had ""no place"" in the UK's armed forces. He added a zero-tolerance approach was the ""only way"" to ensure excellence was ""maintained across our world-class military.""

Leicester beat Cardiff in emotional game,"This video can not be played Emotional Leicester team observe silence at Cardiff Leicester City played with great will and nerve to beat Cardiff City on an emotional day as the Foxes returned to action for the first time since the death of their owner in a helicopter crash. On an afternoon when football seemed both an irrelevance and a form of release for Leicester's grieving players and fans, the two clubs united to remember Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and the other four people who lost their lives on 27 October. Leicester's players were visibly moved during a minute's silence and, after the laying of wreaths before the match, there were further tributes including the unfurling of banners shared between the two sets of fans, who joined forces to create a stirring atmosphere of rare solidarity. Once the match at Cardiff City Stadium was under way, it was contested as fiercely as any Premier League fixture with chances at both ends in a goalless but competitive first half. Cardiff's Victor Camarasa struck the crossbar with a free-kick and Jamie Vardy felt Leicester should have had a penalty when his shot appeared to hit Sol Bamba's arm. However, the Foxes were not to be denied and, after Demarai Gray scored with a low finish early in the second half, there was a huge outpouring of emotion as the entire team celebrated together before running over to their travelling supporters. After scoring, Gray removed his jersey to reveal an undershirt on which the words 'For Khun Vichai' were emblazoned as a tribute to Srivaddhanaprabha, whose name the Leicester fans continued to sing for the rest of a highly charged and poignant afternoon. After the final whistle, the Leicester players and backroom team stood and applauded with their fans long after the game had ended. The Foxes move up to 10th in the table while Cardiff drop into the relegation zone in 18th after Newcastle beat Watford 1-0. Leicester pay tribute to Srivaddhanaprabha Thailand funeral begins for Leicester owner Relive Leicester's win over Cardiff Reaction from all of Saturday's Premier League action Leicester fans paid tribute to Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha throughout the game Srivaddhanaprabha, who died in the crash outside Leicester's King Power Stadium following their previous league game against West Ham, was an owner revered and loved like few others. The Thai billionaire bought Leicester in 2010 for Â£39m, cleared their debts and oversaw the club's promotion to the top flight four years later. They then beat odds of 5,000-1 to claim the Premier League title in 2015-16 in one of the greatest sporting stories of all time. His death - along with those of Nusara Suknamai, Kaveporn Punpare, pilot Eric Swaffer and his partner Izabela Roza Lechowicz - was described as the darkest day in the club's history. The tragedy cast a shadow over the entire city, evident in the outpouring of grief throughout the week from players, staff and supporters. Having postponed Tuesday's Carabao Cup tie against Southampton, this return to action gave Leicester the opportunity to pay their respects on the pitch. It was a decision to which the club gave deep consideration, consulting the Srivaddhanaprabha family and the players, who Vardy said were determined to honour their owner's name with a display of strength. They were wholeheartedly backed by their travelling supporters, most of whom were wearing t-shirts bearing an image of Srivaddhanaprabha's face and the words 'The Boss'. During the pre-match warm-up, Leicester's players were even given a standing ovation by Cardiff's fans, such was the sense of harmony as the two clubs stood shoulder to shoulder in such extraordinary circumstances. The Foxes rose to the occasion admirably, harnessing the emotion of the occasion and using it to fuel a powerful performance. Next, the players will fly to Thailand to attend Srivaddhanaprabha's funeral as Leicester - the club and city - continues to grieve. The entire Leicester team celebrated Demarai Gray's goal Leicester manager Claude Puel had said beforehand the result was ""not important"", while his Cardiff counterpart Neil Warnock acknowledged football can seem ""irrelevant"" in the aftermath of such a tragedy. However, they fully supported the decision to play and, after the solemnity of the pre-match tributes, Cardiff City Stadium was at full volume as the game started at a ferocious pace. The hosts set the tempo, pressing their opponents and trying to force them into mistakes. That approach almost bore fruit after half an hour, with an unsettled Leicester defence fouling Harry Arter on the edge of the penalty area and Camarasa striking the resultant free-kick against the crossbar. After a tricky period in which England centre-back Harry Maguire left the field injured, Leicester eventually got a foothold in the game and had an excellent chance to score when Wilfred Ndidi headed wide from a corner. The Foxes felt they should have had a penalty just before the interval but, although Vardy's shot on the rebound appeared to hit Bamba's arm, referee Lee Probert ignored the visitors' furious protestations. It did not prove to be a costly decision for Puel's side, who made the decisive breakthrough 10 minutes into the second half. Ben Chilwell sped into the penalty area and clipped a perfectly weighted cross to Gray, who carefully guided his half-volley low into the net to spark emotional celebrations which will live long in the memory. Leicester's players celebrated the victory with travelling fans at full-time while displaying a banner in honour of Vichai Leicester captain Wes Morgan: ""You can see by our reaction at the end of the game, how much we wanted to get the win and do it for the chairman. We felt the pressure before the game. It was a scrappy game, the lads fought to the very end. This video can not be played Cardiff 0-1 Leicester: Today is the first step for Leicester - Claude Puel ""We were very close to the chairman. We know what his wishes were. He used to come down at home games, have a joke and laugh, always say 'want win and three points'. We did that today. It has not been an easy week, we had to try and hold our emotions in today and do the best we can. We have a very emotional connection with the fans, so we stayed till the end and celebrated victory with them."" Leicester manager Claude Puel: ""It was a normal thing for us to have the players and staff for the minute's silence, it is important for solidarity and we want to give our best for our chairman, step by step, to continue his work. ""It is a family and I think Vichai with his warmth, it is a mission to keep this way, and put in place a project that we must try to continue. When we saw the flowers in front of the stadium - it is a family and the feeling that our chairman gave this club."" Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel: ""That was a tough game not just on the pitch but mentally. There are a lot of exhausted people in there now but I am proud of this team and the club, the way everyone has handled themselves has been unbelievable. We were very lucky to know Khun Vichai. ""Today was difficult, coming out for the warm-up was tough, the first 10 minutes I couldn't steady myself, I was shaking a little bit. But it was nice to get a win to take to Thailand now and hopefully we did his family proud."" This video can not be played Fine margins decided game on surreal day - Neil Warnock Cardiff defender Sol Bamba: ""He [Vichai] was a good man. I had the chance to meet him and he was a big loss. It was difficult for us, the whole build-up wasn't easy to handle. But that is not an excuse, the gaffer warned us about this. Obviously we pay respects before and after, but during the game we are professional."" The left-back dealt solidly with his few defensive duties but it was in attack where he excelled, constantly speeding down the left flank and providing a delightful assist for the winning goal Cardiff have just one win in their past 15 Premier League games, drawing three and losing 11. Leicester are the only side to score in all their Premier League games this season (11 games). Cardiff have failed to score in six Premier League games this season, a joint-divisional high along with Huddersfield and Southampton. Leicester have won seven of their past nine Premier League games against promoted sides (drawn one, lost one). Leicester have won three of their past five Premier League away games (lost two), as many victories as they had managed in their previous 12 on the road in the competition (drawn one, lost eight). Leicester's players travel to Bangkok for the funeral of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and arrive back in midweek to prepare for their home match against Burnley on Saturday, 10 November (15:00 GMT) while Cardiff host Brighton on the same day at 12:30.

Leicester beat Cardiff in emotional gameLeicester City beat Cardiff City on an emotive day as the Foxes return to action following since the death of their owner in a helicopter crash.,"This video can not be played Emotional Leicester team observe silence at Cardiff Leicester City played with great will and nerve to beat Cardiff City on an emotional day as the Foxes returned to action for the first time since the death of their owner in a helicopter crash. On an afternoon when football seemed both an irrelevance and a form of release for Leicester's grieving players and fans, the two clubs united to remember Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and the other four people who lost their lives on 27 October. Leicester's players were visibly moved during a minute's silence and, after the laying of wreaths before the match, there were further tributes including the unfurling of banners shared between the two sets of fans, who joined forces to create a stirring atmosphere of rare solidarity. Once the match at Cardiff City Stadium was under way, it was contested as fiercely as any Premier League fixture with chances at both ends in a goalless but competitive first half. Cardiff's Victor Camarasa struck the crossbar with a free-kick and Jamie Vardy felt Leicester should have had a penalty when his shot appeared to hit Sol Bamba's arm. However, the Foxes were not to be denied and, after Demarai Gray scored with a low finish early in the second half, there was a huge outpouring of emotion as the entire team celebrated together before running over to their travelling supporters. After scoring, Gray removed his jersey to reveal an undershirt on which the words 'For Khun Vichai' were emblazoned as a tribute to Srivaddhanaprabha, whose name the Leicester fans continued to sing for the rest of a highly charged and poignant afternoon. After the final whistle, the Leicester players and backroom team stood and applauded with their fans long after the game had ended. The Foxes move up to 10th in the table while Cardiff drop into the relegation zone in 18th after Newcastle beat Watford 1-0. Leicester pay tribute to Srivaddhanaprabha Thailand funeral begins for Leicester owner Relive Leicester's win over Cardiff Reaction from all of Saturday's Premier League action Leicester fans paid tribute to Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha throughout the game Srivaddhanaprabha, who died in the crash outside Leicester's King Power Stadium following their previous league game against West Ham, was an owner revered and loved like few others. The Thai billionaire bought Leicester in 2010 for Â£39m, cleared their debts and oversaw the club's promotion to the top flight four years later. They then beat odds of 5,000-1 to claim the Premier League title in 2015-16 in one of the greatest sporting stories of all time. His death - along with those of Nusara Suknamai, Kaveporn Punpare, pilot Eric Swaffer and his partner Izabela Roza Lechowicz - was described as the darkest day in the club's history. The tragedy cast a shadow over the entire city, evident in the outpouring of grief throughout the week from players, staff and supporters. Having postponed Tuesday's Carabao Cup tie against Southampton, this return to action gave Leicester the opportunity to pay their respects on the pitch. It was a decision to which the club gave deep consideration, consulting the Srivaddhanaprabha family and the players, who Vardy said were determined to honour their owner's name with a display of strength. They were wholeheartedly backed by their travelling supporters, most of whom were wearing t-shirts bearing an image of Srivaddhanaprabha's face and the words 'The Boss'. During the pre-match warm-up, Leicester's players were even given a standing ovation by Cardiff's fans, such was the sense of harmony as the two clubs stood shoulder to shoulder in such extraordinary circumstances. The Foxes rose to the occasion admirably, harnessing the emotion of the occasion and using it to fuel a powerful performance. Next, the players will fly to Thailand to attend Srivaddhanaprabha's funeral as Leicester - the club and city - continues to grieve. The entire Leicester team celebrated Demarai Gray's goal Leicester manager Claude Puel had said beforehand the result was ""not important"", while his Cardiff counterpart Neil Warnock acknowledged football can seem ""irrelevant"" in the aftermath of such a tragedy. However, they fully supported the decision to play and, after the solemnity of the pre-match tributes, Cardiff City Stadium was at full volume as the game started at a ferocious pace. The hosts set the tempo, pressing their opponents and trying to force them into mistakes. That approach almost bore fruit after half an hour, with an unsettled Leicester defence fouling Harry Arter on the edge of the penalty area and Camarasa striking the resultant free-kick against the crossbar. After a tricky period in which England centre-back Harry Maguire left the field injured, Leicester eventually got a foothold in the game and had an excellent chance to score when Wilfred Ndidi headed wide from a corner. The Foxes felt they should have had a penalty just before the interval but, although Vardy's shot on the rebound appeared to hit Bamba's arm, referee Lee Probert ignored the visitors' furious protestations. It did not prove to be a costly decision for Puel's side, who made the decisive breakthrough 10 minutes into the second half. Ben Chilwell sped into the penalty area and clipped a perfectly weighted cross to Gray, who carefully guided his half-volley low into the net to spark emotional celebrations which will live long in the memory. Leicester's players celebrated the victory with travelling fans at full-time while displaying a banner in honour of Vichai Leicester captain Wes Morgan: ""You can see by our reaction at the end of the game, how much we wanted to get the win and do it for the chairman. We felt the pressure before the game. It was a scrappy game, the lads fought to the very end. This video can not be played Cardiff 0-1 Leicester: Today is the first step for Leicester - Claude Puel ""We were very close to the chairman. We know what his wishes were. He used to come down at home games, have a joke and laugh, always say 'want win and three points'. We did that today. It has not been an easy week, we had to try and hold our emotions in today and do the best we can. We have a very emotional connection with the fans, so we stayed till the end and celebrated victory with them."" Leicester manager Claude Puel: ""It was a normal thing for us to have the players and staff for the minute's silence, it is important for solidarity and we want to give our best for our chairman, step by step, to continue his work. ""It is a family and I think Vichai with his warmth, it is a mission to keep this way, and put in place a project that we must try to continue. When we saw the flowers in front of the stadium - it is a family and the feeling that our chairman gave this club."" Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel: ""That was a tough game not just on the pitch but mentally. There are a lot of exhausted people in there now but I am proud of this team and the club, the way everyone has handled themselves has been unbelievable. We were very lucky to know Khun Vichai. ""Today was difficult, coming out for the warm-up was tough, the first 10 minutes I couldn't steady myself, I was shaking a little bit. But it was nice to get a win to take to Thailand now and hopefully we did his family proud."" This video can not be played Fine margins decided game on surreal day - Neil Warnock Cardiff defender Sol Bamba: ""He [Vichai] was a good man. I had the chance to meet him and he was a big loss. It was difficult for us, the whole build-up wasn't easy to handle. But that is not an excuse, the gaffer warned us about this. Obviously we pay respects before and after, but during the game we are professional."" The left-back dealt solidly with his few defensive duties but it was in attack where he excelled, constantly speeding down the left flank and providing a delightful assist for the winning goal Cardiff have just one win in their past 15 Premier League games, drawing three and losing 11. Leicester are the only side to score in all their Premier League games this season (11 games). Cardiff have failed to score in six Premier League games this season, a joint-divisional high along with Huddersfield and Southampton. Leicester have won seven of their past nine Premier League games against promoted sides (drawn one, lost one). Leicester have won three of their past five Premier League away games (lost two), as many victories as they had managed in their previous 12 on the road in the competition (drawn one, lost eight). Leicester's players travel to Bangkok for the funeral of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and arrive back in midweek to prepare for their home match against Burnley on Saturday, 10 November (15:00 GMT) while Cardiff host Brighton on the same day at 12:30.

Man-eating tigress killed after huge hunt,"India is home to 60% of the world's tigers A tigress in India which is said to have killed 13 people has been shot dead after a major hunt, officials say. The six-year-old tigress had evaded capture in the jungles of the western state of Maharashtra for two years. Last month wildlife officials deployed perfume in a bid to lure the animal. Activists had campaigned to save the tiger, but India's Supreme Court said it would not interfere if forest rangers were forced to shoot it. A team armed with a tranquiliser gun and a firearm was stationed in a vehicle on a road where the tigress, known as T-1, had been spotted by villagers, a Forestry Department statement said. A patrol team went to an area near Borati village on Friday evening, after receiving reports of the tigress' presence. A tranquilliser dart was fired at the animal.  Once hit, the tigress charged the patrol's vehicle and she was killed by a single shot from a distance of between eight and 10 metres (26-33 ft), the statement said. A post-mortem will now be performed on the beast. Can Calvin Klein scent catch a 'killer' tiger? Why India should not get complacent over its tiger population In August the tigress and her two nine-month-old cubs killed three people in the area around the town of Pandharkawada in Yavatmal district and left more than 5,000 residents fearing for their lives. Farmers and graziers were told to return early from the fields and forest, venture out only in groups, and not defecate in the open fields, a common practice in the villages. There will now be a post-mortem on the tigress Meanwhile the hunt for the tigress included more than 100 camera traps, bait in the form of horses and goats tied to trees, round-the-clock surveillance from treetop platforms and armed patrols.

Man escaping 'aggressive' seals rescuedThe angler scrambled up a cliff face and got stuck as he tried to avoid a colony of seals near Eyemouth.South Scotland,"The man was rescued from the cliffs on Friday evening after getting stuck An angler has been rescued from a cliff face which he scaled in a bid to escape from a colony of ""aggressive"" seals. The man was walking along the beach in Green Stane, near Eyemouth, on Friday evening when he encountered about 50 seals and their young pups. They became agitated and in order to avoid them he scrambled up the cliff but became trapped. Coastguard teams, an RNLI lifeboat and police were sent to the scene after he raised the alarm at about 19:40. Ropes were used to lower a coastguard rescue officer to the man and he was then lifted to the lifeboat waiting below. He was uninjured but had minor cold exposure. The man got into difficulty on cliffs in the Green Stane area Coastguard teams from Dunbar, Berwick, North Berwick and Eyemouth, as well as the RNLI Eyemouth lifeboat, assisted with the rescue. Senior coastguard operations officer Jonathan Mustard said: ""Anyone who encounters a seal or a colony of seals on the beach or coastline is advised to move away at the first sign of agitation. ""Aggressive seals are not a common occurrence and in this case they may have been protecting or defending their natural habitat and their young. ""Remember to take a fully charged mobile when walking on the coast and call 999 and ask for the coastguard if you get into difficulty.""

What is Mike Ashley's plan for the High Street?,"What is Mike Ashley's game plan? The founder of Sports Direct seems intent on taking over the UK's High Streets. This week the businessman, who has a retail empire that spans budget sportswear and luxury fashion, added Evans Cycles to the High Street names in his sprawling and intertwined retail empire. The cycle chain came wrapped for a quick sale in a special arrangement which freed it of its debts. The price tag was justÂ£8m for the cycle chain after it had been placed into administration. It followedthe Â£90m deal by Sports Direct in August to buy House of Fraser, after the department store chain had been placed in administration. Richard Hyman, a strategic adviser to retailers, said: ""I don't really think he's got a strategy as such. He's an opportunist. ""But I need to make clear that I don't mean that in a pejorative sense!"" The deals have been bolted on to a business that traces its roots to 1982 when Mr Ashley started Sports Direct with one store and a Â£10,000 loan from his  parents. In 2007, Sports Direct was floated on the stock market, by which time it had more than 400 stores, owned Lillywhites in London and brands such as Donnay and Slazenger. Not all of his interests are held through Sports Direct, but they now include a substantial property business, clothing chain French Connection, lingerie chain Agent Provocateur, the upmarket clothing outlets Flannels and Cruise and more brands, including Firetrap and Lonsdale, and, of course, Newcastle United football club. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, doesn't think there's a concrete plan. He says Mr Ashley's deals are a ""combination of both strategic and opportunistic"". But the purchase of the Evans Cycles chain - where Mr Ashley admits he will shut half of the 62 shops -  does fit with his plans for dominance in the field of sports. ""There are [acquisitions] that are clearly relevant. Evans is in that camp. In conversation with Mike five years ago [about] areas of sports and leisure he wasn't involved in, he'd put cycling and fishing in that camp. Evans is relevant to the sports retailing business,"" said John Stevenson, analyst at stock brokers Peel Hunt. Goals Soccer Centres, the five-a-side football business in which he also holds an interest, also falls into the category. Others, though, are less obvious. Think Debenhams  - in which Sports Direct has a-near 30% stake -  and Game Group, where it has also amassed shares. The stake in Debenhams - partly amassed through a complex financial trade - is not being used as a prelude to a full takeover. That was set out in September when Simon Bentley, a non-executive director of Sports Direct, clarified remarks he had made that he did not intend to infer a merger between House of Fraser and Debenhams was being discussed. Figuring out what Mr Ashley is planning is not made easy by his less-than-warm relationship with the investment establishment.  Mr Stevenson said they ""don't engage with the City about what their strategy is"". But Mr Ashley has perhaps tried to define his own strategy through eye-catching slogans: The ""Selfridges of Sport"" for Sports Direct and the ""Harrods of the High Street"" for House of Fraser. These, though, have provoked some scepticism. ""There are hundreds of High Streets in Britain but only one has a got Harrods on it. I think there's a message there,"" said Mr Hyman. But Mr Ashley is finding opportunities at a time when analysts talk about a period of unprecedented turmoil on the High Street. So what does he look for in a deal? Mr Lim said he will have ""a stringent set of tests"" as he seeks out well-known brands. Mike Ashley paid Â£8m for Evans Cycles three years after it was sold to private equity firm ECI Partners for Â£75m Buying a company out of administration allows him to ""trim off the fat"", Mr Lim said. Half of Evans Cycles stores are to be closed. And the purchases also come with lots of goods. Richard Hyman points to the stock that the chains are carrying. Evans, Mr Hyman said, carried Â£28m of stock. House of Fraser, Mr Hyman said, was ""largely about buying a pile of stock at a heavily discounted price which he can then sell and make a handsome profit from"". ""This is what I mean by opportunistic. Evans Cycles is not a bad fit. Is he following a strategic plan? I don't think he is. Is he positively opportunistic? Yes.

Blasphemy case lawyer flees PakistanSaif Mulook left for Europe days after getting Christian Asia Bibi acquitted of blasphemy.Asia,"Protesters have been demanding Asia Bibi's death penalty be reinstated The lawyer representing a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy after eight years on death row has fled Pakistan in fear for his life. Saif Mulook told news agency AFP he had to leave so he could continue to represent Asia Bibi, whose conviction was overturned by judges on Wednesday. Officials have since agreed to bar Asia Bibi from leaving Pakistan in order to end violent protests over the ruling. Campaigners blasted the deal as akin to signing her ""death warrant"". Asia Bibi was convicted in 2010 of insulting the Prophet Muhammad during a row with neighbours, and many are calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty following her acquittal. Mr Mulook told the BBC earlier this week she would need to move to a Western country for her own safety. A number of attempts have previously been made on her life. Several countries have offered her asylum. Pakistan's 'historic' Asia Bibi ruling Why Pakistan's Christians are targeted Blasphemy laws around the world Pakistani Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry defended the government against allegations that a deal reached with an Islamist party was capitulating to extremists. He said the government would ""take all steps necessary"" to ensure Asia Bibi's safety. Mr Mulook, however, called the agreement ""painful"". ""They cannot even implement an order of the country's highest court,"" he told AFP before he boarded the plane to Europe. Mr Mulook said he had decided to leave as it was ""not possible"" to continue living in Pakistan, adding: ""I need to stay alive as I still have to fight the legal battle for Asia Bibi."" This video can not be played Asia Bibi's escape from Pakistan death row He told Pakistan's Express Tribune he would return to the country to defend his client - but needed the government to provide security. The protests were led by the Tehreek-i-Labaik (TLP) party. As party of its deal with the TLP, the government said it would not oppose petitions filed against the Supreme Court's verdict. All protesters arrested since Asia Bibi's acquittal will be released, and any violence towards them will be investigated. The government will also start legal proceedings to put her on a list which would ban her from leaving Pakistan. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In return, the TLP is asking its supporters to stop the protests and disperse peacefully. The authorities earlier said that Asia Bibi was scheduled for release later this week. The trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi, whose full name is Asia Noreen, had with a group of women in June 2009. They were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. There is widespread support for severe punishments for blasphemers in Pakistan Prosecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response. She was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation. In Wednesday's ruling, the Supreme Court said that the case was based on flimsy evidence and her confession was delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"". Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong. Hard-line politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base. Christians: Pakistan's 'forgotten minority' The last hours of a Christian sanitary worker in Pakistan But critics say the laws have often been used to get revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence. The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community, but since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population. The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance. Since 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy. Why are Pakistan's Christians targeted? Pakistani Christians fear blasphemy laws.

Gambaccini secures payout over abuse claimsThe radio DJ wins damages from prosecutors after historical sex allegations against him were dropped.,"Paul Gambaccini has previously said he was the victim of a ""witch hunt"" Radio DJ Paul Gambaccini has secured a payout from prosecutors over unfounded allegations of historical sex offences. The presenter, 69, was arrested in 2013 over a claim he sexually assaulted two teenage boys in the early 1980s. Mr Gambaccini always denied the claims, calling the case ""completely fictitious"". He spent a year on bail beforethe case was dropped. The amount paid to Mr Gambaccini by the Crown Prosecution Service has not been disclosed due to confidentiality. But the CPS confirmed: ""We have reached an agreement without admission of liability"". No charges for Paul Gambaccini Gambaccini 'was victim of witch-hunt' Former BBC Radio 1 presenter Mr Gambaccini, who now hosts Radio 2's Pick of the Pops, has given an interview to the Daily Mail in which he describes how his life was turned upside down.

Brexit 'fraying' UK-Irish relationshipThe taoiseach has said that Brexit is 'fraying the relationship between Britain and Ireland'.Europe,"Leo Varadkar says Ireland is entering into a potentially difficult period, even if there is an agreement The Irish prime minister says Brexit is fraying relations between Ireland and Britain. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it had also ""undermined"" the Good Friday Agreement (GFA). The Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998 after intense negotiations between the UK government, the Irish government and Northern Ireland political parties. The UK government says ""nothing we agree with the EU will risk a return to a hard border"". The Irish border is one of the biggest sticking points in the Brexit negotiations. Good Friday Agreement - 20 years on Brexit: All you need to know Your guide to EU jargon ""Anything that pulls the communities apart in Northern Ireland undermines the Good Friday Agreement, and anything that pulls Britain and Ireland apart undermines that relationship,"" said Mr Varadkar on RTE's Marian Finucane programme. Earlier, the chair of the Republic of Ireland's Senate Brexit Committee said a return to a hard border threatened the peace process. Senator Neale Richmond told pro-Brexit Conservative MP Owen Paterson on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that plans for solving the border dispute using ""existing practical systems"" was ""completely unfeasible"". Brexit talks have reached an impasse over the EU's ""backstop"" plan, which would see Northern Ireland effectively remaining in the customs union and single market unless alternative arrangements were found to prevent a hard border. The taoiseach's comments came two days after Nobel peace prize winner and Conservative Lord Trimble accused Mr Varadkar's government of ""riding roughshod"" over the GFA. Lord Trimble, who helped draw up the landmark agreement, said the Brexit process could result in Northern Ireland ending up as part of an ""effective EU protectorate"". Mr Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, reiterated that claim, saying that any backstop which involved the whole UK staying in a customs union would be a ""total betrayal"" of millions of Leave voters and the 85% of voters at the last general election who backed Tory and Labour manifestos which committed to leaving. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since January 2017 The Irish prime minister said Ireland was entering into a potentially difficult period, even if an agreement was struck. The UK government said any deal would not "" threaten the arrangements under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, and we continue to work very closely with the Irish Government on this"". ""We are also working together to ensure the unique bilateral ties between our countries remain strong into the future,"" a spokesperson added. Mr Varadkar also said he had a good relationship with Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in need to come to an agreement to reinstate the Stormont Assembly, he said. Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017, when the power-sharing parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in -split in a bitter row. If there was some clarity on Brexit in the next couple of weeks or months, there would be an opportunity to get the executive up and running again, Mr Varadkar added. The UK and the EU both want to avoid a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which may include physical checks or infrastructure, but cannot agree how. A key part of the negotiation is the controversial border ""backstop"". The backstop is a position of last resort, to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. In a backstop situation, there could in theory be two types of Irish Sea checks: Customs- to make sure the right EU tariffs have been paid Regulatory- to make sure goods meet EU safety and quality standards The government has been adamant it would never accept Irish Sea customs checks. But it has also been careful not to completely close down the prospect of regulatory checks.

What is Mike Ashley's plan for the High Street?The Sports Direct founder this week added Evans Cycles to his collection - can he just not resist a bargain?,"What is Mike Ashley's game plan? The founder of Sports Direct seems intent on taking over the UK's High Streets. This week the businessman, who has a retail empire that spans budget sportswear and luxury fashion, added Evans Cycles to the High Street names in his sprawling and intertwined retail empire. The cycle chain came wrapped for a quick sale in a special arrangement which freed it of its debts. The price tag was justÂ£8m for the cycle chain after it had been placed into administration. It followedthe Â£90m deal by Sports Direct in August to buy House of Fraser, after the department store chain had been placed in administration. Richard Hyman, a strategic adviser to retailers, said: ""I don't really think he's got a strategy as such. He's an opportunist. ""But I need to make clear that I don't mean that in a pejorative sense!"" The deals have been bolted on to a business that traces its roots to 1982 when Mr Ashley started Sports Direct with one store and a Â£10,000 loan from his  parents. In 2007, Sports Direct was floated on the stock market, by which time it had more than 400 stores, owned Lillywhites in London and brands such as Donnay and Slazenger. Not all of his interests are held through Sports Direct, but they now include a substantial property business, clothing chain French Connection, lingerie chain Agent Provocateur, the upmarket clothing outlets Flannels and Cruise and more brands, including Firetrap and Lonsdale, and, of course, Newcastle United football club. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, doesn't think there's a concrete plan. He says Mr Ashley's deals are a ""combination of both strategic and opportunistic"". But the purchase of the Evans Cycles chain - where Mr Ashley admits he will shut half of the 62 shops -  does fit with his plans for dominance in the field of sports. ""There are [acquisitions] that are clearly relevant. Evans is in that camp. In conversation with Mike five years ago [about] areas of sports and leisure he wasn't involved in, he'd put cycling and fishing in that camp. Evans is relevant to the sports retailing business,"" said John Stevenson, analyst at stock brokers Peel Hunt.

"Mystery over 'illegal' women's footballA recently-discovered photo dates from 1935, when women were not allowed to play at most grounds.Beds, Herts & Bucks","A recently rediscovered photo shows an ""illegal"" women's match at Luton Town, believed to be in 1935 A football club has appealed for help to discover more about two ""illegal"" women's football matches held in 1935. Luton Town's historian found a photo, thought to be one of the events, as he looked through archives for a project. Little is known about the games, and the club's Community Trust wants to hear from anyone with information. The Football Associationbanned women from playing matches,externalat affiliated clubs from 1921 until 1971, calling the sport ""quite unsuitable for females"". A newspaper advert shows two women's matches took place at Kenilworth Road in April 1935 The photo is believed to have been taken in 1935, but it is not dated more precisely. The club believes it could be related to a newspaper cutting, also recently rediscovered, advertising two women's games at its Kenilworth Road ground in April 1935 - the Bazaar Cup Final between Woolworth and Marks & Spencer, and a ""Widows v Spinsters"" tie. The club said it wanted ""to uncover the stories behind these illegal ladies football matches"". Community Engagement Officer Natasha Rolt said: ""We're really hoping members of the public can help shed some light on what we think is a remarkable and fascinating story. ""We're hoping to find out the experiences of people who went to the game or played in it, about the circumstances of the match and the reaction from supporters and others in the town."" The Luton Town Community Trust has been looking through archives after a Â£99,300 Heritage Lottery Fund grant to deliver aproject to local schools that explores the history,externalof the football club. It will alsobuild a ""comprehensive website"",externalof match reports, programmes and photographs for every competitive game played by the Hatters, alongside player biographies and supporter memories, the club said.

"Facebook sorry for 'white supremacist ad'The social media site removes a campaign targeted at readers interested in ""white genocide"".Technology","Facebook has said it will add more human reviewers to its advertising system Facebook has apologised after it approved an ad campaign targeted at people interested in a conspiracy theory favoured by white nationalists. News siteThe Intercept was able to launch a promotion aimed at 168,000 users,externalinterested in ""white genocide."" Prosecutors believe the conspiracy theory, which claims ""outside forces"" want to exterminate the white race, may have motivated the man who attacked a Pittsburgh synagogue last week. A senior UK MP has criticised Facebook. In a tweet, Damian Collins, the chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, called Facebook's approval of the ad campaign ""appalling and irresponsible"". Allow Twitter content?

He added that the Intercept's investigative reporting showed ""how easy"" it was for extremist groups to promote their messages of hate on the social network. ""Once again, the site has only taken action when someone else has brought it to their attention,"" Mr Collins told the BBC. ""The Facebook ad check service is currently operating far below the standards we should expect from a company of that size and wealth."" Facebook overhaul after anti-Semitic ads,external Facebook's 'hate speech button' causes confusion The Intercept's findings come more than a year after Facebook pledged to prevent advertisers on its platform from targeting anti-Semitic users, in the aftermath ofa similar revelation by US media outlet ProPublica,external. That report found that ads could be bought to specifically target users who described themselves as âJew hatersâ, as well as other hateful terms. In response, Facebook said it would add more human reviewers to its advertising system, and said it was ""building new guardrails"" to prevent such occurrences in the future. But just a few days after11 Jewish worshippers were killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue, The Intercept says it was able to start an ad campaign entitled ""White Supremacy - Test"" targeted at users who ""expressed an interest or like pages related to 'White genocide conspiracy theory'"". The news site claims its request to start the campaign was manually approved by a member of Facebook's advertising department. It is unclear how Facebook categorises users, but the 168,000 targeted by The Intercept were not necessarily believers in the conspiracy theory. After The Intercept contacted Facebook for comment, the social media giant deleted the targeting category and apologised. But Facebook stressed that this incident was not similar to the one unveiled by ProPublica, as the ""white genocide"" targeting category was created by an algorithm, not by users. The social media giant is not the only tech firm to have apologised for offensive content on its platform. On Friday,Twitter said it was sorry after the term ""Kill all Jews"" briefly featured on the site's ""trending"" section,externalfor users in New York. The phrase was being discussed as it had been scrawled on the walls on a Brooklyn synagogue that was set to host a political talk with Jewish TV star Ilana Glazer.

Lloyds replacing debit cards for someLloyds Bank is reissuing debit cards for customers affected by the BA and Ticketmaster cyber-attacks.Business,"Lloyds Banking Group has confirmed it is reissuing debit cards to customers affected by cyber-attacks on Ticketmaster and British Airways. The bank has reissued debit cards to all customers that have made purchases on Ticketmaster's website. It is also working with BA to establish which customers have had their details compromised duringtwo cyber-attacks. Lloyds said it had a ""range of approaches"" designed to protect customers from fraud. A Lloyds Banking Group representative told the BBC: ""In all cases, we take all possible steps to minimise time without a card."" In the case of debit cards, the bank immediately issues a new card if it detects fraud. But when it comes to credit cards, Lloyds first writes to customers telling them that it intends to reissue their cards, and customers are given the option to opt out. Lloyds said it had already written to customers affected by the Ticketmaster breach, which made up about 1% of all credit card customers. Barclays Bank has confirmed that in the event of a data breach, it would replace the debit cards of customers who may have been affected as a precautionary measure. A representative for HSBC told the BBC: ""Protecting our customers and their money is an absolute priority for us, which is why we have put in place additional monitoring on cards that may have been affected by recent issues, but we are happy to replace a customer's card if that is their preference."" The BBC has contacted RBS for comment, and is waiting for a response. In September and October, BA revealed that two cyber-attacks had been carried out on its website. After the first attack, BA owner IAG revealed in a stock exchange announcement that 185,000 people had had payment card details stolen, with 77,000 customers having their name, address, email address and detailed payment information taken. However, it did not reveal details of how many people had been affected by the second attack. In June, Ticketmaster admitted thatit had suffered a security breachto its website that affected up to 40,000 UK customers who purchased or attempted to purchase tickets between February and 23 June 2018.

Mystery over 'illegal' women's football,"A recently rediscovered photo shows an ""illegal"" women's match at Luton Town, believed to be in 1935 A football club has appealed for help to discover more about two ""illegal"" women's football matches held in 1935. Luton Town's historian found a photo, thought to be one of the events, as he looked through archives for a project. Little is known about the games, and the club's Community Trust wants to hear from anyone with information. The Football Associationbanned women from playing matches,externalat affiliated clubs from 1921 until 1971, calling the sport ""quite unsuitable for females"". A newspaper advert shows two women's matches took place at Kenilworth Road in April 1935 The photo is believed to have been taken in 1935, but it is not dated more precisely. The club believes it could be related to a newspaper cutting, also recently rediscovered, advertising two women's games at its Kenilworth Road ground in April 1935 - the Bazaar Cup Final between Woolworth and Marks & Spencer, and a ""Widows v Spinsters"" tie. The club said it wanted ""to uncover the stories behind these illegal ladies football matches"". Community Engagement Officer Natasha Rolt said: ""We're really hoping members of the public can help shed some light on what we think is a remarkable and fascinating story. ""We're hoping to find out the experiences of people who went to the game or played in it, about the circumstances of the match and the reaction from supporters and others in the town."" The Luton Town Community Trust has been looking through archives after a Â£99,300 Heritage Lottery Fund grant to deliver aproject to local schools that explores the history,externalof the football club. It will alsobuild a ""comprehensive website"",externalof match reports, programmes and photographs for every competitive game played by the Hatters, alongside player biographies and supporter memories, the club said.

Gambaccini wins payout over abuse claims,"Paul Gambaccini has previously said he was the victim of a ""witch hunt"" Radio DJ Paul Gambaccini has secured a payout from prosecutors over unfounded allegations of historical sex offences. The presenter, 69, was arrested in 2013 over a claim he sexually assaulted two teenage boys in the early 1980s. Mr Gambaccini always denied the claims, calling the case ""completely fictitious"". He spent a year on bail beforethe case was dropped. The amount paid to Mr Gambaccini by the Crown Prosecution Service has not been disclosed due to confidentiality. But the CPS confirmed: ""We have reached an agreement without admission of liability"". No charges for Paul Gambaccini Gambaccini 'was victim of witch-hunt' Former BBC Radio 1 presenter Mr Gambaccini, who now hosts Radio 2's Pick of the Pops, has given an interview to the Daily Mail in which he describes how his life was turned upside down. He told the paper: ""I was too angry to cry."" His arrest was part of the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree investigation, which was set up following revelations about paedophile Jimmy Savile. Speaking to the Daily Mail,external, Mr Gambaccini said that, following his arrest, organisations he had supported throughout his life like the Labour Party ""ghosted"" him. He added his arrest also soured his relationship with the BBC. Mr Gambaccini began working for the BBC in the 1970s ""There was no greater defender of the BBC than me,"" he told the paper, ""but they never tried to make it up to me after I was cleared"". Mr Gambaccini said he now had ""no relationship"" with the BBC other than turning up to host his Radio 2 shows. When approached for comment, a BBC spokesman said: ""Paul is valued and appreciated by the BBC, which is why he presents two much-loved shows.""

Leicester City owner's Thai funeral begins,"This video can not be played Emotional Leicester team observe silence at Cardiff Leicester City players and officials are flying to Thailand to attend the funeral of the club's owner who died in a helicopter crash. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's funeral began at a Bangkok temple on Saturday with Buddhist bathing rituals and will be followed by recitation ceremonies. Players will be attending services on Sunday and Monday afterbeating Cardiff 1-0in the first game since his death. Before the match they wore T-shirts featuring a picture of Mr Vichai. They stood for a minute's silence along with Leicester City staff and fans ahead of the kick-off. Flowers and a photograph of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha were placed next to his urn at the temple in Bangkok Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel wore his shirt during the warm-up Mr Vichai died with two members of his staff, the pilot and a passenger when the helicopter crashed moments after taking off from the King Power Stadium on 27 October. His funeral began with a bathing rite ceremony and will be followed by recitation ceremonies over seven days. The ceremony was held behind closed doors and a special funeral urn and also a five-tiered umbrella, which reflected his high status, was used. Aimon Srivaddhanaprabha (L), the wife of Mr Vichai, during his funeral rite Mourners could be seen through a glass door at Mr Vichai's funeral Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, the manager of Thailand's women's football team, and the president of the Football Association of Thailand were among the guests. Leicester City players and club officials are expected to arrive back in the UK on Tuesday morning. Mr Vichai's bodyarrived in Thailand on Fridayahead of the funeral. By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent, Bangkok The start of this lengthy funeral was in stark contrast to the emotional scenes witnessed at the Leicester City stadium. It began with a stately bathing ceremony for Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's body at a royal temple in Bangkok, attended by his family and a few senior political and business figures. They poured holy water donated by King Maha Vajiralongkorn over flowers adorning the coffin, which was inscribed with the initials VS, and the simple words, ""the possible man"", reflecting his business and sporting success. This Buddhist funeral serves an important religious function for the deceased, with rituals like the nightly chanting by monks accumulating merit for him. But it serves a social function too, affirming the status he achieved, in particular by getting royal sponsorship. Mr Vichai had a quite different image in Thailand than he had in Britain, a private and cunning entrepreneur who cultivated powerful connections to see off challenges to his lucrative duty-free monopoly, through which he became very rich, very quickly. There is little of the public affection and gratitude on display here that has been so visible in Britain. But when the Leicester City team arrives in Thailand to attend the funeral, Thais will be reminded of just how much this improbable hero meant to football fans on the other side of the world. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought Leicester City in 2010 Nusara Suknamai, Kaveporn Punpare, and pilots and partners Eric Swaffer and Izabela Roza Lechowicz also died in the crash last Saturday. Police have said Ms Lechowicz was a passenger at the time of the crash. Who was Leicester's billionaire owner?

No charges for Paul Gambaccini,"BBC broadcaster Paul Gambaccini will not face action over alleged historical sex offences, prosecutors say. The 65-year-old was held at a south London address in October last year as part of the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree investigation. The Crown Prosecution Service said the inquiry followed claims of sex offences against two teenage boys in the early 1980s. Mr Gambaccini said he has suffered ""12 months of trauma"". He has always denied the claims. In a statement issued by his lawyers, he said: ""There may be members of the press who will ask me to give interviews or make provocative statements. I will politely decline. To discuss horror in this way is to trivialise it. ""I will never trivialise the 12 months of trauma to which I have been unjustly subjected. ""I would like to thank my friends, my lawyers and the people of this country for their support during the past year. Wherever I have gone, I have been stopped in the street by members of the public offering encouragement. I am very grateful. I'll be back at work soon."" Mr Gambaccini's solicitor, Kate Goold, said: ""We are delighted with the outcome but deeply concerned at the length of time it took to resolve this investigation. ""Paul made his innocence clear at the outset and questions remain as to why this investigation took so long."" The CPS said a 75-year-old man arrested on the same day as Mr Gambaccini will also face no further action. Baljit Ubhey, the Chief Crown Prosecutor of CPS London, said: ""Having carefully reviewed this case, we have decided that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute."" The CPS said the allegations of sexual offences were made by two males believed to be aged between 14 and 15 at the time of the alleged offences. The allegations were said to have taken place over a two-year period. Mr Gambaccini and the 75-year-old were arrested at separate addresses on 29 October 2013. They were the 15th and 17th people detained under Operation Yewtree, which was set up in 2012 following revelations of sexual abuse carried out by DJ Jimmy Savile. Police say the investigation fell under the strand of the Yewtree termed ""others"" - those allegations not connected to Savile. The other two strands concern the actions of Savile himself, and those involving ""Savile and others"". At the time of his arrest New York-born Mr Gambaccini had been presenting a show on BBC Radio 2 on Saturdays.  But the BBC said he had decided to stop appearing on the programme ""in light of... media attention"". The broadcaster, who has a string of TV and radio shows and books to his name, presented music hits and classics from the US on the show. Mr Gambaccini later released a statement to say: ""On Monday night, October 28, I attended an excellent production of the Kander and Ebb musical, The Scottsboro Boys, at the Young Vic theatre. ""It concerned a group of black men in Alabama in the 1930s who were falsely accused of sexual offences. Within hours, I was arrested by Operation Yewtree. Nothing had changed, except this time there was no music."" In total, 17 men have been questioned by police since Operation Yewtree was set up. Comedians Jim Davidson and Freddie Starr are among 10 men who have been told they will face no further action. There have been three convictions - entertainer Rolf Harris, publicist Max Clifford and DJ Dave Lee Travis. Driver David Smith was charged, but died before his case came to court and another man, aged 73, remains on bail following his arrest in April.  Two Crown Court trials are yet to take place.

Gambaccini 'was victim of witch-hunt',"Paul Gambaccini told a committee of MPs extended bails were a ""misuse of power"" Broadcaster Paul Gambaccini has backed a 28-day limit on the use of police bail after telling MPs he was the victim of a ""witch-hunt"". Mr Gambaccini was arrested on suspicion of historical sexual abuse and placed on bail for a year before the case against him was dropped in October. He told a Commons committee that lost earnings and legal fees had cost him more than Â£200,000. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) denied there was a ""witch-hunt"". Home Secretary Theresa May announced in December that she was consulting on a 28-day bail limit in all but exceptional cases. Giving evidence to the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, the former Radio 1 DJ said he believed he was used as human ""fly paper"" to encourage other people to come forward and make allegations against him. Paul Gambaccini has worked across the BBC's radio networks He said he suspected his bail was repeatedly extended until the end of high-profile cases involving other celebrities because police did not want juries to hear a former Radio 1 DJ had been cleared of sexual wrongdoing. Mr Gambaccini, who has since returned to work on BBC Radio 2 and 4, was arrested by detectives from Operation Yewtree - the police investigation into historic sex offences launched in the wake of the revelations about former DJ and TV presenter Jimmy Savile. He said that he and other celebrities falsely accused of historical sex crimes had been the victim of a ""witch-hunt"" to divert attention from the failure of the authorities to deal with Savile while he was still alive. ""Someone whose identity we do not know, who I call the Wizard of Oz, the person sitting behind the curtain, pulling the levers, setting off smoke and light shows, decided 'I've got a great idea, let's have a witch-hunt, let's divert the attention of the public from the police who knew about but failed to stop Jimmy Savile in his lifetime and shine that spotlight instead on his contemporaries and we'll get perverts from show business in the 1970s and 1980s',"" he said. He said that by opening a website and phone line so that people could accuse celebrities of sexual offences ""you are going to get some people who are responding to the offer of money and attention"". Mr Gambaccini was arrested on 29 October 2013 and police handed papers to the Crown Prosecution Service on 10 February 2014. But it was not until 10 October 2014 that he was told no case was being brought against him, he said. Mr Gambaccini told the committee that during that time his bail was extended on seven occasions with only ""vague"" explanations from police. He said he gradually realised the dates often coincided with important developments in the Yewtree investigation. Bail was extended on 2 May, when publicist Max Clifford was sentenced for historic indecent assaults, on 30 June, hours after the conviction of Rolf Harris, and on 12 September when former Stoke Mandeville doctor Michael Salmon appeared in court charged with rape, he said. When his bail was extended to 15 September, he suspected a link to the trial of Dave Lee Travis, which was due to end on that date. Mr Gambaccini said the BBC suspended him without pay immediately after his arrest became public and he was ""shunned"" by other employers. Asked if he would support anonymity for those arrested, but not charged, over sexual allegations, Mr Gambaccini said: ""Absolutely. I do realise that there are people of good faith who say people who have been arrested should be named because then people who have been victimised will come forward. ""These people of good faith don't realise that it isn't only people who have actually committed offences who are arrested and named - there are some innocent people in the mix."" He said he would ""enthusiastically"" support a 28-day bail limit, adding: ""There is no possible excuse for further delay in leaving somebody out to dry. ""The only reason for the delay is to try to get somebody else to accuse you. ""It's not a proper use of the criminal justice system, it's the misuse of a power they happen to have for other reasons."" But DPP Alison Saunders - the most senior prosecutor in England and Wales - said the 28-day limit was ""too short"" because decisions on whether to press charges take substantially longer in a minority of cases, often involving fraud, corruption or historical sex offences. She insisted that the CPS does not release the names of suspects before charge and stressed that a decision not to press charges is not a determination of innocence or guilt, but a judgment on whether there is sufficient evidence to secure a conviction. Ms Saunders made clear she did not believe the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) owed Gambaccini an apology. She also denied claims made by Conservative MP Michael Ellis that the bail the system was ""broken"" and told the committee: ""We are not conducting a witch-hunt against anyone, be it journalists or celebrities.""

Gambaccini wins payout over abuse claimsThe radio DJ wins damages from prosecutors after historical sex allegations against him were dropped.UK,"Paul Gambaccini has previously said he was the victim of a ""witch hunt"" Radio DJ Paul Gambaccini has secured a payout from prosecutors over unfounded allegations of historical sex offences. The presenter, 69, was arrested in 2013 over a claim he sexually assaulted two teenage boys in the early 1980s. Mr Gambaccini always denied the claims, calling the case ""completely fictitious"". He spent a year on bail beforethe case was dropped. The amount paid to Mr Gambaccini by the Crown Prosecution Service has not been disclosed due to confidentiality. But the CPS confirmed: ""We have reached an agreement without admission of liability"". No charges for Paul Gambaccini Gambaccini 'was victim of witch-hunt' Former BBC Radio 1 presenter Mr Gambaccini, who now hosts Radio 2's Pick of the Pops, has given an interview to the Daily Mail in which he describes how his life was turned upside down. He told the paper: ""I was too angry to cry."" His arrest was part of the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree investigation, which was set up following revelations about paedophile Jimmy Savile. Speaking to the Daily Mail,external, Mr Gambaccini said that, following his arrest, organisations he had supported throughout his life like the Labour Party ""ghosted"" him. He added his arrest also soured his relationship with the BBC. Mr Gambaccini began working for the BBC in the 1970s ""There was no greater defender of the BBC than me,"" he told the paper, ""but they never tried to make it up to me after I was cleared"". Mr Gambaccini said he now had ""no relationship"" with the BBC other than turning up to host his Radio 2 shows. When approached for comment, a BBC spokesman said: ""Paul is valued and appreciated by the BBC, which is why he presents two much-loved shows."" The American-born broadcasterpreviously saidhe was the victim of a ""witch hunt"" and that he had endured ""12 months of trauma"". He gave evidence to a committee of MPs about his experience and backed calls for a 28-day limit on police bail. The bail limitwas introduced two years later.

"Review: Stormzy has written a book, but is it any good?","When Stormzy stood on stage at the BRIT Awards in February this year and delivered his stinging rap criticising the government's handling of the Grenfell Tower Fire, the then 24-year-old grime artist from Thornton Heath, south London, achieved something that is almost unheard of for a working-class, young black man from ""a place where success doesn't happen."" Stormzy at this year's Brit Awards asking: ""Yo Theresa May, whereâs the money for Grenfell?"" He had won. And not just the Album of the Year award for Gang Signs & Prayer. He had won something much more elusive. He had won the Establishment's respect (the government quickly issued a statement about the actions it had taken in response to the Grenfell tragedy), the right to speak and be heard: a seat at the table where the national conversation takes place. In that moment Michael Omari, or just plain Mike to his friends and Stormzy to you and me, became a significant player in British culture. It was the latest chapter in his remarkable story, which you can read all about in his lyrics, or in the many interviews he has given. But not, I can report, in his new book, Rise Up: The #Merky Story So far. Rise Up is not an autobiography, or a revelation-filled memoir. There are no stories about outrageous pop star extravagances, or torrid tales from his teenage years. There is the briefest of mentions of being stabbed, of the police kicking in his front door, of a friend's suicide, of mental health issues, ""I was mad depressed for a whileâ¦ I'd just be sitting in my house. No-one would see me for days, or weeks â¦I was so broken-spirited."" Stormzy is close to his mother, Abigail Owuo But these are fleeting asides that are neither explored nor explained. A frank outpouring of the soul it is not. In fact, it's more like a business book charting the rise of #Merky, the lifestyle/entertainment brand Stormzy has created with a close band of brothers and sisters. We hear from many of them in first-person extracts taken from interviews by co-author Jude Yawson, who has structured their reminiscences into chronological order, starting in the late noughties when an ambitious yet unfocussed Mike is about to leave school. Jude Yawson co-wrote the book after speaking to many people in Stormzy's inner circle Given that all involved in the publication are friends or acquaintances it will not surprise you to learn that at times it can come across more like a piece of brand communications than a warts-and-all account into the trials and tribulations of setting-up a company. In many instances such an approach would result in an extremely dull piece of vanity publishing. But that is emphatically not the case here. Rise Up is not only a decent read; it is a very important book. The voices we hear from - young, gifted and largely black - are all too rarely heard. These are people who typically have to listen to a daily diet of media negativity about their communities without the opportunities to respond. Stormzy posing with family members, backstage at the Brits this year Stormzy's success, and the choices he is making (such as the #Merky Books collaboration with Penguin to publish new writers), is providing a much-needed platform for those from working-class, inner-city backgrounds to speak out and give vent to their talents. Rise Up is #Merky Books's first publication, and a fitting one too. It is not simply about great achievements against the odds. More importantly, perhaps, it provides a detailed roadmap, and possibly the confidence, to readers not blessed with resources and contacts, who, like the #Merky founders, want to get on and make a contribution: to fulfil their talents and ambitions. It is truly inspiring to read about the accomplishments of Team Stormzy, realised largely without money or expertise, but with bucket loads of intelligence and hard work. Trust, friendship, instinct, vision, discipline, networks, empathy, resilience, courage, risk, and humility are all ingredients in the making of their business. The uncompromising pursuit of excellence and a relentless desire to ""grow"" professionally is what has driven it forward. Stormzy listening intently in the recording studio, is demanding of himself and others Stormzy is clearly the leader; he is the one setting the standards: ""I demand high standards from myself, and from everyone I'm working withâ¦ If someone is bringing me down, or getting in the way of me doing something the way I need it to be done, I won't have it. Some of them have a name for me, 'Smoky Mike', when I get vexed and I tell them off."" We hear a tiny bit more about 'Smoky Mike' towards the end of the book from his close friend Flipz: ""He's [Stormzy] a good guy, and he's a smart guy, and he knows what he wants. And he puts energy and ambition into all of us. It might not be in a nice way sometimes, but we know what he's trying to do."" And that's it. There is no further talk of what ""might not be nice"" about Stormzy's management style. Why not? We know it can't all be light, there has to be some shade. It would be instructive to understand how he operates when things are not going to plan. I'm guessing there's a bit of Sir Alex Ferguson's infamous ""hairdryer treatment"" going on: a slightly less glowing account would negate the need to speculate. Stormzy's plan is clear. He wants to emulate Jay-Z's success both as a musician and an entrepreneur (""I'm Not A Businessman, I'm A Business, Man""). He also wants to make a difference, using his money and position to help others. This philanthropic agenda was evident in the announcement this summer that he's funding two scholarships for black British students at Cambridge University. Stormzy showing he wants to help others by funding scholarships for black students to go to Cambridge University He is still only 25 years old, there will be plenty of bumps along the road, but if anyone can deliver on Stormzy's ambitions it is the man himself. His confidence is unshakable, his vision is clear, and his pioneering attitude deserves support and respect: ""I am 100 per cent sure that I'm a world-class artist. I've always had a mad point to prove, because getting that respect as a black musician in this country is not easy. Where's our Kanye? Where's our Kendrick? Where's our Prince? It's not to say we need that, but where is the spectrum of talented black British musicians who can really stand up against the rest of the world.""

"EU plans post-Brexit London 'embassy'The new ""delegation"" to the UK will include 29 diplomats and a new EU ambassador.UK Politics","The European Union plans to have a 29-strong team of diplomats in London to represent it after Brexit. It will be called a ""delegation"" - not an embassy - and will be part of the EU's foreign policy arm, the European External Action Service (EEAS). There will also be a mission with five staff in Belfast to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement in Northern Ireland - if there is a Brexit deal. The plans will be discussed next week. They will be presented for approval by ambassadors from the 27 remaining EU countries on Wednesday. The European Commission has offices in all member states. Currently it has a team of 27 staff based at Europe House, in Smith Square, Westminster. Brexit: All you need to know Your guide to Brexit jargon Once the UK leaves the EU in March next year, that office will be replaced by a new London outpost for the EEAS. It will be about a third of the size of its equivalent in Washington DC, which has 90 personnel - although only 30 of them are classed as European diplomats. Whether the delegation will stay in the Smith Square building - the former headquarters of the Conservative Party - is not yet known. The EU moved in to the former Tory HQ in Smith Square in 2010 and renamed it Europe House However, the European Commission's offices in Scotland and Wales are likely to close. The new European Union ambassador to the UK will be appointed at a later date by its foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. Being Brussels' man or woman in London could be a plum job, or the occupant could find themselves sidelined in future negotiations with London. Earlier this year, the European Commission denied that Martin Selmayr - its secretary-general and a former aide to its president Jean-Claude Juncker - was a potential candidate. The EU has 140 delegations to countries and organisations, including the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.

Gunman kills two at Florida yoga studio,"The shooting at the hot yoga studio happened late Friday afternoon Two women have been killed and five others injured after a gunman opened fire in a Florida hot yoga studio. Scott Paul Beierle killed Nancy Van Vessem, 61, and Maura Binkley, 21, after entering the studio in Tallahassee at 17:37 local time (21:37 GMT) on Friday, police say. The 40-year-old then apparently turned the gun on himself, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo told reporters. Beierle's motive for ""this heinous act"" is not known at this time, he added. Guns in the US: The statistics behind the violence Mr DeLeo said his officers responded to reports of the shooting at Tallahassee Hot Yoga within ""three, three-and-a-half minutes"", by which time Beierle was already dead. A number of other victims received gunshot wounds, while one person was pistol-whipped. ""There are indications that several people inside fought back and tried to not only save themselves but other people, which is a testament to their courage,"" Mr DeLeo said. Two of the victims remain in hospital, while three others have been treated and released. Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum - who is currently running as the Democratic candidate for Florida governor - said he would be cutting short a campaign event and returning to the city.

"Adoptions fall by 62% as IVF success risesThe adoption process is also ""far too slow"", the boss of the service representing children in care says.Health","Heather with her husband and four children Heather Bell persevered with IVF for almost five years before she had children. ""I thought about adopting all the time,"" she told BBC News, but she and her husband decided to pursue IVF. The boss of a body that represents children in care has said the success of IVF has contributed to a drop in the number of children being adopted. In the last 40 years since the first ""test-tube baby"" was born, adoptions in England and Wales have fallen by 62%. Meanwhile, IVF success rates for women under 35 have nearly tripled. Why I chose to go it alone with IVF The 'highs and lows' of adopting children BBC Radio 4 - The Adoption When she decided against adoption, Heather, now 41, said she was shocked, embarrassed, disappointed and frustrated at her feelings around her decision. But despite two miscarriages and two full cycles of IVF, she felt she wanted to try to have her biological children. Eventually she gave birth to two daughters through IVF, and went on to have two more children naturally. Even if she had not given birth, she said, she felt she might not have had the ""emotional energy"" to go through the adoption system. It is that system that Anthony Douglas, head of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass) has spoken aboutin an interview with the Daily Telegraph,external. He says the adoption process in England is ""far too slow"". And it is having to compete with other ways of becoming a parent. Mr Douglas, 69 - who was himself adopted - told the newspaper: ""IVF used to be around 7% successful and now it's around 30%. ""So as a choice, adoption is competing with lots of other ways of having children."" He added: ""Every child deserves a family to live and grow up in but adoption still takes twice as long as it should, which puts people off."" Data from the Office for National Statistics,externalsuggests there were 12,121 children adopted in England and Wales in 1978. In 2017, 4,350 looked after children in England were adopted,government figures show.,externalWhile in Wales,more than 300 children,externalwere placed in their adoptive home. But the falling number of adoptions is despite an increase in the number of children in care in England. There are 72,670 looked after children in England as of March 2017. The adopted children confused by love 'Powerful first moment' with adopted child Earlier this month, the National Adoption Serviceput out a callfor prospective parents in Wales to come forward to help, following an ""unanticipated increase"" in children looking for homes. Meanwhile, Department of Education figures for England suggested the average duration between entry into care and being adopted decreased from 22 months in 2012-13 to 16 months in 2016-17, while the number of children waiting to be matched with a family dropped from 5,500 to 2,500 over the same period. The department said the number of looked after children in England who were adopted was up from 3,100 in 2011, although numbers fell in 2016 and 2017. A spokesperson said: ""Every child deserves to have a loving, stable home that's right for them, and thousands of families have had their lives transformed by adoption. ""We have invested Â£90m in the Adoption Support Fund and we are setting up Regional Adoption Agencies to further improve the time it takes for the child to go to live with their new family."" IVF - or in vitro fertilisation - is when an egg is removed from a woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop.

Man kicked off plane over 'sleeping pill'Stephen Bennett says he was sleeping before takeoff and crew thought he could be unfit to fly.US & Canada,"Stephen Bennett and his wife A Canadian man who was removed from a flight after taking a prescription sleeping pill prior to boarding says he feels humiliated by the experience. Stephen Bennett says the trouble began when a crew member tried to wake him before takeoff. He says he was not allowed back on the plane despite airport paramedics saying he was fit to fly and an emailed note from his doctor. The airline says its crew acted appropriately given the circumstances. Mr Bennett, from Burnaby, British Columbia (BC), and his wife and son were on their way to Cuba and had a layover in Toronto on 13 October. WestJet operates a fleet of Boeing 767 and Boeing 737 aircraft He says he did not sleep on the overnight flight from the westernmost province of BC and so took a sleeping pill prescribed by his doctor before the connecting flight. Mr Bennett, who is recovering from a stroke, boarded early and fell asleep immediately. He says he next remembers waking up when his wife nudged him and the flight attendant told him ""he had to go"" because he was a ""medical emergency"". He says there may have been some initial confusion because his wife's first language is not English and she wanted him to rest, but once he was awake he was able to explain he had taken medication. Paramedics were called and removed him from the plane in a wheelchair. He says they checked him once he was off the plane and told WestJet crew his vitals were fine and he was able to fly, but to no avail. He says he was also able to get his doctor to email a note saying he was healthy enough for the flight. ""It was so humiliating,"" he said. ""Basically, the stewardess became judge, jury and executioner."" New Istanbul mega-airport opens Flight abandoned after bird strike The airline says that it cannot comment specifically on Mr Bennett's case due to privacy concerns. But it said that in any instance where its crew believes a passenger is showing signs of not being fit to fly, that passenger will be removed ""out of an abundance of caution"". It noted that those instances include ""significant impairment arising from the consumption or use of alcohol or drugs prior to boarding"". WestJet says that action is in line with federal transport regulations. The low-cost airline changing the way we fly Primera Air: 'I don't know what to do' ""We stand by our crew's decisions and believe that what we have offered to this guest is reasonable under the circumstances,"" the airline said in a statement to BBC. The family, who had booked an all-inclusive vacation in Cuba, were told by WestJet they could take the next flight the following week, putting the rest of their package in jeopardy. Instead, they booked a flight with another airline, paying some C$2,000 ($1,525; Â£1,175) for the new tickets and for a hotel in Toronto. They also lost two days off the family vacation. ""It threw a massive wrench into the happiness [of the trip],"" he told the BBC. Mr Bennett says he wants compensation from the airline and an explanation as to why he was kept off the flight despite medical professionals saying he was able to fly.

EU plans post-Brexit London 'embassy',"The European Union plans to have a 29-strong team of diplomats in London to represent it after Brexit. It will be called a ""delegation"" - not an embassy - and will be part of the EU's foreign policy arm, the European External Action Service (EEAS). There will also be a mission with five staff in Belfast to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement in Northern Ireland - if there is a Brexit deal. The plans will be discussed next week. They will be presented for approval by ambassadors from the 27 remaining EU countries on Wednesday. The European Commission has offices in all member states. Currently it has a team of 27 staff based at Europe House, in Smith Square, Westminster. Brexit: All you need to know Your guide to Brexit jargon Once the UK leaves the EU in March next year, that office will be replaced by a new London outpost for the EEAS. It will be about a third of the size of its equivalent in Washington DC, which has 90 personnel - although only 30 of them are classed as European diplomats. Whether the delegation will stay in the Smith Square building - the former headquarters of the Conservative Party - is not yet known. The EU moved in to the former Tory HQ in Smith Square in 2010 and renamed it Europe House However, the European Commission's offices in Scotland and Wales are likely to close. The new European Union ambassador to the UK will be appointed at a later date by its foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. Being Brussels' man or woman in London could be a plum job, or the occupant could find themselves sidelined in future negotiations with London. Earlier this year, the European Commission denied that Martin Selmayr - its secretary-general and a former aide to its president Jean-Claude Juncker - was a potential candidate. The EU has 140 delegations to countries and organisations, including the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. Its External Action Service was established by the Lisbon Treaty to develop and deliver the EU's common foreign and security policy.

No foul play in Saudi sisters' US deaths,"Tala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 22, were found duct-taped together in the Hudson River New York City police say no foul play is suspected in the deaths of two Saudi Arabian sisters who were found duct-taped together in the Hudson River. Tala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 22, had previously suggested they would rather harm themselves than return to their homeland, police say. Detectives say the girls may have requested political asylum in order to remain in the US. A witness says the siblings prayed near the water before they died. Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea told reporters on Friday: ""At this point in time, everything we've seen thus far is pointing to other than a crime taking place."" He noted the sisters had told family members they would rather ""inflict harm on themselves and commit suicide"" than go back to Saudi Arabia. Chief Shea said there were unsubstantiated claims the sisters had fled an abusive home. A spokesman for the New York Police Department earlier said there was no evidence linking the Saudi government to their deaths. Mystery shrouds Saudi sisters' US deaths Police have been investigating the Farea sisters deaths since 24 October when their bodies were discovered on the banks of the Hudson River in Riverside Park. Detectives originally suspected they had jumped from the George Washington Bridge, but changed their theory due to a lack of physical injuries they would have suffered in such a fall. Instead, they now believe the girls walked into the water alive with their waists and ankles loosely bound with duct-tape, and that no crime was committed against them that caused their deaths. According to the Chief Shea, an eyewitness came forward on Wednesday because of a ""story that is haunting him"". Police released sketches of the girls last week in an effort to identify their bodies The man said that he was exercising in Riverside Park when he saw two people believed to be the sisters sitting about 30ft (9m) apart near the waterfront. ""They were sitting with their hands in their heads,"" Chief Shea said. ""Their heads lowered and they were making noises loudly that he described as praying."" Police say the sisters arrived in New York City on 1 September and ""maxed out"" their credit cards by ordering meals, shopping and staying at upscale hotels. They add that their money was beginning to run out at the time of their deaths. The siblings had moved to Virginia with their mother in 2015, and the older sister had been enrolled in George Mason University until this past spring. They were reported missing and placed in a shelter after they were located due to abuse allegations. But at the end of August, they again vanished before their bodies were found in New York. Police are still appealing for anyone who had met the sisters since August to come forward with further information.

'Euro Super League talks held by clubs',"Gianni Infantino became Fifa president in 2016 Top European clubs have held secret talks to create a European Super League, according toa report by German publication Der Spiegel.,external The newspaper claims leaked documents show the breakaway league could be created in 2021 and see clubs involved leave their national leagues and football associations. Der Spiegel also alleges separate documents show Manchester City and Paris St-Germain avoided financial fair play sanctions with the intervention of Fifa president Gianni Infantino. Premier League champions City said they would not comment ""on out of context materials purportedly hacked or stolen"". Der Spiegel says its source is a whistleblower they call John, who claims that neither he nor his associates are hackers. ""We have very good sources and a strong network that provides us with a lot of information,"" he told Der Spiegel. Der Spiegel claims Real Madrid has joined forces with AC Milan, Arsenal, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Manchester United to form a group of seven sides who went behind the back of Uefa, European football's governing body, to discuss forming a European Super League. As part of their plans, the clubs allegedly discussed ""an option for leaving the national leagues and their football associations behind entirely"". Bayern Munich are supposed to have explored the legal complexities of the breakaway and one of the documents Der Spiegel says it has seen is a ""binding term sheet"" which 16 clubs would sign to form the Super League. The new competition, it is claimed, would involve 11 of Europe's biggest clubs, known as the ""founders"", along with five ""initial guests"". The so-called founders, who would include the seven clubs named above along with Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Paris St-Germain, would not face relegation and would be guaranteed membership for 20 years. Der Spiegel reports that the five ""initial guests,"" according to the document, would be Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, Marseille and Roma. A Bayern Munich statement said they were ""unaware of recent plans for a so-called Super League"" and had not ""taken part in negotiations relating to such plans"". The club's chairman added: ""FC Bayern Munich stands by its membership of the Bundesliga and, as long as I am chairman of the board of FC Bayern, also by the club competitions organised jointly by Uefa and the ECA (European Club Association)."" United declined to comment, while Arsenal, AC Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid have been contacted for their response by BBC Sport. Manchester City are owned by Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan's Abu Dhabi United Group, while PSG are owned by Qatar Sports Investment. According to Der Spiegel's report,,externalthey overvalued sponsorship deals to help meet FFP rules and, when facing sanctions over the matter, the allegations in the documents state Infantino helped arrange more lenient punishments for them in 2014. At the time, Fifa president Infantino was in his previous role as Uefa general secretary andCity and PSG were both finedÂ£49m, Â£32m of which was suspended. Following the latest claims, City's statement added: ""The attempt to damage the club's reputation is organized and clear."" A PSG statement said it ""has always acted in full compliance with the laws and regulations enacted by sports institutions"" and it ""denies the allegations"". The club added: ""Since the introduction of Financial Fair Play, Paris St-Germain have been one of the most audited and scrutinised clubs in history."" Uefa's response detailed the aims of FFP and added that the system ""is a comparatively recent system of regulation"" and with ""the early cases"" took ""Uefa and the clubs into unchartered territory"". It said: ""Uefa is confident that any apparent inconsistencies that may seem evident to some, have been eliminated as the system has developed and become more familiar to all sides."" Infantino became president of Fifa, world football's governing body, in 2016. ""All decisions on Uefa Financial Fair Play cases are made by the Uefa Club Financial Control Body (CFCB),"" said a Fifa statement. ""It is an independent body. ""The Uefa administration, which of course includes the general secretary, can assist the CFCB depending on the specific case. ""This may include discussions, meetings, assistance to help find solutions, and other interactions to assist the CFCB in its work. Nonetheless, the CFCB is entirely responsible for their own decisions."" In an interview last week, Infantino spoke in general terms when he said: ""My job entails having discussions, having conversations, exchanging documents, drafts, ideas, whatever, on many, many, many, many, topics. ""Otherwise you don't go anywhere. I mean, if I just have to stay in my room and not speak to anyone and cannot do anything, how can I do my job properly? ""So if then this is being portrayed as something bad, I think there's not much I can do more than my job in an honest way, in a professional way and trying to defend the interests of football."" Der Spiegel says the source of the documents they have obtained is a whistleblower called John, which is not his real name, who founded Football Leaks. Up to 70 million documents have been provided by Football Leaks and more than 3.4 terabytes of information. Der Spiegel has shared the information with other media outlets in the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) consortium, which includes Reuters news agency, the Sunday Times and Spain's El Mundo. Together, about 80 journalists from 15 media outlets looked at the information provided.

"Review: Stormzy has written a book, but is it any good? âââââ","When Stormzy stood on stage at the BRIT Awards in February this year and delivered his stinging rap criticising the government's handling of the Grenfell Tower Fire, the then 24-year-old grime artist from Thornton Heath, south London, achieved something that is almost unheard of for a working-class, young black man from ""a place where success doesn't happen."" Stormzy at this year's Brit Awards asking: ""Yo Theresa May, whereâs the money for Grenfell?"" He had won. And not just the Album of the Year award for Gang Signs & Prayer. He had won something much more elusive. He had won the Establishment's respect (the government quickly issued a statement about the actions it had taken in response to the Grenfell tragedy), the right to speak and be heard: a seat at the table where the national conversation takes place. In that moment Michael Omari, or just plain Mike to his friends and Stormzy to you and me, became a significant player in British culture. It was the latest chapter in his remarkable story, which you can read all about in his lyrics, or in the many interviews he has given. But not, I can report, in his new book, Rise Up: The #Merky Story So far. Rise Up is not an autobiography, or a revelation-filled memoir. There are no stories about outrageous pop star extravagances, or torrid tales from his teenage years. There is the briefest of mentions of being stabbed, of the police kicking in his front door, of a friend's suicide, of mental health issues, ""I was mad depressed for a whileâ¦ I'd just be sitting in my house. No-one would see me for days, or weeks â¦I was so broken-spirited."" Stormzy is close to his mother, Abigail Owuo But these are fleeting asides that are neither explored nor explained. A frank outpouring of the soul it is not. In fact, it's more like a business book charting the rise of #Merky, the lifestyle/entertainment brand Stormzy has created with a close band of brothers and sisters. We hear from many of them in first-person extracts taken from interviews by co-author Jude Yawson, who has structured their reminiscences into chronological order, starting in the late noughties when an ambitious yet unfocussed Mike is about to leave school. Jude Yawson co-wrote the book after speaking to many people in Stormzy's inner circle Given that all involved in the publication are friends or acquaintances it will not surprise you to learn that at times it can come across more like a piece of brand communications than a warts-and-all account into the trials and tribulations of setting-up a company. In many instances such an approach would result in an extremely dull piece of vanity publishing. But that is emphatically not the case here. Rise Up is not only a decent read; it is a very important book. The voices we hear from - young, gifted and largely black - are all too rarely heard. These are people who typically have to listen to a daily diet of media negativity about their communities without the opportunities to respond. Stormzy posing with family members, backstage at the Brits this year Stormzy's success, and the choices he is making (such as the #Merky Books collaboration with Penguin to publish new writers), is providing a much-needed platform for those from working-class, inner-city backgrounds to speak out and give vent to their talents. Rise Up is #Merky Books's first publication, and a fitting one too. It is not simply about great achievements against the odds. More importantly, perhaps, it provides a detailed roadmap, and possibly the confidence, to readers not blessed with resources and contacts, who, like the #Merky founders, want to get on and make a contribution: to fulfil their talents and ambitions. It is truly inspiring to read about the accomplishments of Team Stormzy, realised largely without money or expertise, but with bucket loads of intelligence and hard work. Trust, friendship, instinct, vision, discipline, networks, empathy, resilience, courage, risk, and humility are all ingredients in the making of their business. The uncompromising pursuit of excellence and a relentless desire to ""grow"" professionally is what has driven it forward. Stormzy listening intently in the recording studio, is demanding of himself and others Stormzy is clearly the leader; he is the one setting the standards: ""I demand high standards from myself, and from everyone I'm working withâ¦ If someone is bringing me down, or getting in the way of me doing something the way I need it to be done, I won't have it. Some of them have a name for me, 'Smoky Mike', when I get vexed and I tell them off."" We hear a tiny bit more about 'Smoky Mike' towards the end of the book from his close friend Flipz: ""He's [Stormzy] a good guy, and he's a smart guy, and he knows what he wants. And he puts energy and ambition into all of us. It might not be in a nice way sometimes, but we know what he's trying to do."" And that's it. There is no further talk of what ""might not be nice"" about Stormzy's management style. Why not? We know it can't all be light, there has to be some shade. It would be instructive to understand how he operates when things are not going to plan. I'm guessing there's a bit of Sir Alex Ferguson's infamous ""hairdryer treatment"" going on: a slightly less glowing account would negate the need to speculate. Stormzy's plan is clear. He wants to emulate Jay-Z's success both as a musician and an entrepreneur (""I'm Not A Businessman, I'm A Business, Man""). He also wants to make a difference, using his money and position to help others. This philanthropic agenda was evident in the announcement this summer that he's funding two scholarships for black British students at Cambridge University. Stormzy showing he wants to help others by funding scholarships for black students to go to Cambridge University He is still only 25 years old, there will be plenty of bumps along the road, but if anyone can deliver on Stormzy's ambitions it is the man himself. His confidence is unshakable, his vision is clear, and his pioneering attitude deserves support and respect: ""I am 100 per cent sure that I'm a world-class artist. I've always had a mad point to prove, because getting that respect as a black musician in this country is not easy. Where's our Kanye? Where's our Kendrick? Where's our Prince? It's not to say we need that, but where is the spectrum of talented black British musicians who can really stand up against the rest of the world.""

Lloyds replacing debit cards for some,"Lloyds Banking Group has confirmed it is reissuing debit cards to customers affected by cyber-attacks on Ticketmaster and British Airways. The bank has reissued debit cards to all customers that have made purchases on Ticketmaster's website. It is also working with BA to establish which customers have had their details compromised duringtwo cyber-attacks. Lloyds said it had a ""range of approaches"" designed to protect customers from fraud. A Lloyds Banking Group representative told the BBC: ""In all cases, we take all possible steps to minimise time without a card."" In the case of debit cards, the bank immediately issues a new card if it detects fraud. But when it comes to credit cards, Lloyds first writes to customers telling them that it intends to reissue their cards, and customers are given the option to opt out. Lloyds said it had already written to customers affected by the Ticketmaster breach, which made up about 1% of all credit card customers. Barclays Bank has confirmed that in the event of a data breach, it would replace the debit cards of customers who may have been affected as a precautionary measure. A representative for HSBC told the BBC: ""Protecting our customers and their money is an absolute priority for us, which is why we have put in place additional monitoring on cards that may have been affected by recent issues, but we are happy to replace a customer's card if that is their preference."" The BBC has contacted RBS for comment, and is waiting for a response. In September and October, BA revealed that two cyber-attacks had been carried out on its website. After the first attack, BA owner IAG revealed in a stock exchange announcement that 185,000 people had had payment card details stolen, with 77,000 customers having their name, address, email address and detailed payment information taken. However, it did not reveal details of how many people had been affected by the second attack. In June, Ticketmaster admitted thatit had suffered a security breachto its website that affected up to 40,000 UK customers who purchased or attempted to purchase tickets between February and 23 June 2018.

'Test tube trees' plan to combat extinction,"This video can not be played Scientists are growing this tiny oak tree in a lab A tiny oak tree emerges from a test tube in the laboratory. The seedling of the mighty oak has had an unusual start in life. Raised using techniques pioneered in fertility labs, it is the product of new efforts to preserve the seeds of wild plants. The world is losing plants at an unprecedented rate, with about one in five thought to be at risk of extinction. ""It's an insurance policy against extinction in the wild,"" says Dr John Dickie of Kew's Millennium Seed Bank at Wakehurst in West Sussex. ""In situconservation, in a reserve, is always the best, because then evolution can happen all the time. This is a very cost-effective back-up in case that system fails."" Oak tree in the countryside As a back-up in the event of doomsday scenarios such as war, seeds of crops and wild plants are being stored in bomb-proof, flood-proof, radiation-proof vaults. The goal is to store at least 75% of threatened plant species by 2020. But new predictions suggest this is unlikely to be achieved, because many seeds cannot be stored using conventional means. According to models published in the journalNature Plants,external, 36% of critically endangered plant species, 33% of all trees and about 10% of medicinal plants fall into this category. ""Not all the plant species can be banked in the way of dried seeds in the freezer like we do in the seed bank,"" says Daniel Ballesteros, who works on cryopreservation at the Millennium Seed Bank. ""For example, we have the oaks and the chestnut that have desiccation-sensitive seeds and if we dry them, we kill them."" Researchers are investigating techniques such as cryopreservation for these hard to store seeds, which include staples such as coffee, chocolate and avocados, as well as heritage trees like the oak. Cryopreservation relies on freezing plant embryos Cryopreservation involves removing the plant embryo from the rest of the seed, then freezing it at very low temperatures in liquid nitrogen. In this way, trees such as the oak can be stored for the future. History of chocolate pushed back in time Project to decode 'all complex life' Rice 'safely conserved' in gene bank But new investment will be needed to perfect the techniques and to build cryopreservation facilities alongside conventional seed banks. The Millennium Seed Bank already houses almost 40,000 wild plant species, which are stored, dried and kept at -20C in the vaults. Others around the world focus on crops, such as rice and their wild relatives. In a laboratory above the vaults, seeds collections manager, Janet Terry, is sorting through a shipment of seeds from Tanzania, which will be added to the collections. They could have value as foods, fuels or medicines. ""We don't know what's in them,"" she says. ""But the really important thing is that with our changing climate - we collect and preserve these things before they've gone - and then we can use them for any purpose we can find for them."" Banked seeds are already proving useful. Meadowland is now rare in the UK In a meadow overlooking the medieval wooded landscape of the High Weald, I meet conservation manager Ian Parkinson. Meadows are now a rare and threatened habitat in the UK. Seeds of local plants kept at the seed bank are being used to restore the natural biodiversity of the landscape. He says the seed bank is like a bank account in that you can make deposits and withdrawals. ""So some seeds are stored there for the future,"" he says. ""But, really a seed is better in the ground growing and that's what we like to do here."" Follow Helen on Twitter,external.

Is Saudi crown prince finished?,"Mohammed bin Salman's rise to power has been meteoric - but can he survive the Khashoggi scandal? ""He's toast"". ""He's toxic"". ""He's my hero"". ""We love him"". Opinions are clearly divided on the man they call MBS - Saudi Arabia's controversial Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Since the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate on 2 October, the MBS brand has become positively toxic in the West. Official Saudi denials that he himself had anything to do with the murder - in a plot hatched from right within his inner circle in the Diwan al-Maliki, the Royal Court - have been met with profound scepticism. Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed? In a part of the world where almost nothing gets done without sign-off from above, the current Saudi version that this was some sort of a rogue operation does sound implausible. One theory being quietly put forward in the Gulf is that while MBS wanted ""something done"" about Khashoggi's outspoken criticism, he never actually sanctioned murder, and that the man who ran his office, Sa'ud al-Qahtani, exceeded his orders while telling those taking part everything had sign-off from the crown prince. There have been a number of protests against the Saudi crown prince The problem is that outside Saudi Arabia hardly anyone believes the Saudi narrative. For days Saudi media indignantly denied any suggestion Khashoggi had met his end inside the consulate, claiming instead he had walked out into the streets of Istanbul. Then we were told he had died in a ""fist fight"". The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who is the journalist that disappeared? Jamal Khashoggi in his own words The latest version, from the Saudi prosecutor, is that his murder was indeed pre-meditated. The Saudi handling of the aftermath of this murder has been every bit as cack-handed as the operation itself. One can only assume that if MBS was listening to good counsel from his well-paid media advisers, he wasn't taking it. All of which leaves MBS in the dock of global public opinion, and someone most Western governments and multinationals do not want to be associated with. This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? For Saudi Arabia, a nation only formally united in 1932, this represents a watershed moment. Do the senior princes temper this all-powerful figure by removing just enough of his powers to appease the US Congress and other Western bodies, some of which are now calling for an arms boycott? Do they ""dethrone"" him altogether, giving him some titular promotion to a meaningless sinecure? Or do they try to weather the storm, as they tried to do, unsuccessfully, after this story broke a month ago? In fact, there are extremely serious discussions going on right now behind closed doors in Saudi royal circles. The gravity of the crisis facing the ruling al-Saud family can be gauged by the sudden return to Riyadh on Tuesday of Prince Ahmed bin Abdelaziz, the last surviving full brother of the 82-year old King Salman. He arrived from London in the dead of night to be greeted with wafts of bukhur incense and embraces from fellow princes, including MBS himself. The quiet and thoughtful Prince Ahmed had become something of a cult hero amongst those who oppose MBS after he spoke out against the war in Yemen and placed the blame squarely on the crown prince and his father. He was said to be afraid to return to Riyadh for fear of house arrest - but now he is back and helping the family circle the wagons around the senior leadership. So what are the factors they are now considering when it comes to MBS's future? First of all, he has no obvious challengers, he saw to that some time ago. At just 33 years old, his rise to power has been meteoric. Since becoming crown prince in June last year, replacing the older, wiser but duller Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, MBS has successfully gathered all the reins of power into his hands. He controls the ministry of interior (which includes the feared Mabahith secret police), the National Guard (a huge and loyal Praetorian Guard that protects the ruling family and their interests), and - as defence minister - he controls the armed forces. He heads the Royal Court, economic policy and - although his ailing father is king - it is MBS who really runs the country. Even before the Khashoggi crisis broke in October, MBS's policies were becoming increasingly controversial, causing several senior Saudis to question whether he was starting to become more of a liability than an asset. This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? Supremely confident and blessed with a green light from his father, MBS dragged Saudi Arabia and its allies into a costly and seemingly unwinnable war in Yemen in 2015. Last year, he locked up dozens of princes, businessmen and senior figures in Riyadh's Ritz Carlton hotel until they agreed to pay back vast sums allegedly earned through corruption. This went down very well with Saudi youth, despite the fact MBS had recently splashed out on a $450m (Â£347m) super-yacht for himself. Then there is the ongoing spat with neighbouring Qatar, a major Western ally. Last weekend in Manama, US Defence Secretary James Mattis made a point of mentioning the vital coalition airbase there, which hosts 17 nations, a reminder that the US would like to see this spat ended. This year has seen a pointless row with Canada over a single tweet by its foreign minister calling for human rights in Saudi Arabia to be respected, as well as a raft of arrests of peaceful reformers. It's been clear for some time that MBS was no democrat - one person who has had dealings with him described him as ""a reckless, out-of-control thug"" - but until now most fellow Saudis have been prepared to overlook his excesses. To millions of young Saudis, MBS is still their hope for the future: a bold, charismatic leader and visionary reformer who has rolled back the powers of the conservative clergy, given women the right to drive and reintroduced entertainment into the kingdom's sterile public life. His plans to reform the oil-based economy, embodied in his Vision 2030 programme, have given Saudis an ambitious glimpse of a hi-tech future with meaningful jobs for everyone. This video can not be played Saudi women's driving activist Manal al-Sharif 'cried' when ban's end was announced To diplomats and policy-makers in Washington, London and Paris removing - or at least restraining - MBS may seem like the obvious thing to do. But for Saudi Arabia's conservative, risk-averse ruling family this is a decision it would far rather not have to take. So is he finished? It is hard to say at this stage. Remember that by mid-2011, a few months into the Arab Spring uprising, almost everyone assumed that Syria's President Bashar al-Assad would be deposed by Christmas. Seven years on he is still in power. Who is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? Khashoggi's fiancee on writer's death.

"Twitter deletes anti-voting botsMost of the 10,000 accounts discouraging mid-term election participation posed as Democrats.Technology","The bots were taken down in September and October Twitter has deleted an estimated 10,000 automated accounts that were posting messages discouraging people from taking part in next week's US mid-term elections. Most of the accounts were posing as Democrats, the social media company said. They were taken down in late September and early October.

Man kicked off plane over 'sleeping pill',"Stephen Bennett and his wife A Canadian man who was removed from a flight after taking a prescription sleeping pill prior to boarding says he feels humiliated by the experience. Stephen Bennett says the trouble began when a crew member tried to wake him before takeoff. He says he was not allowed back on the plane despite airport paramedics saying he was fit to fly and an emailed note from his doctor. The airline says its crew acted appropriately given the circumstances. Mr Bennett, from Burnaby, British Columbia (BC), and his wife and son were on their way to Cuba and had a layover in Toronto on 13 October. WestJet operates a fleet of Boeing 767 and Boeing 737 aircraft He says he did not sleep on the overnight flight from the westernmost province of BC and so took a sleeping pill prescribed by his doctor before the connecting flight. Mr Bennett, who is recovering from a stroke, boarded early and fell asleep immediately. He says he next remembers waking up when his wife nudged him and the flight attendant told him ""he had to go"" because he was a ""medical emergency"". He says there may have been some initial confusion because his wife's first language is not English and she wanted him to rest, but once he was awake he was able to explain he had taken medication. Paramedics were called and removed him from the plane in a wheelchair. He says they checked him once he was off the plane and told WestJet crew his vitals were fine and he was able to fly, but to no avail. He says he was also able to get his doctor to email a note saying he was healthy enough for the flight. ""It was so humiliating,"" he said. ""Basically, the stewardess became judge, jury and executioner."" New Istanbul mega-airport opens Flight abandoned after bird strike The airline says that it cannot comment specifically on Mr Bennett's case due to privacy concerns. But it said that in any instance where its crew believes a passenger is showing signs of not being fit to fly, that passenger will be removed ""out of an abundance of caution"". It noted that those instances include ""significant impairment arising from the consumption or use of alcohol or drugs prior to boarding"". WestJet says that action is in line with federal transport regulations. The low-cost airline changing the way we fly Primera Air: 'I don't know what to do' ""We stand by our crew's decisions and believe that what we have offered to this guest is reasonable under the circumstances,"" the airline said in a statement to BBC. The family, who had booked an all-inclusive vacation in Cuba, were told by WestJet they could take the next flight the following week, putting the rest of their package in jeopardy. Instead, they booked a flight with another airline, paying some C$2,000 ($1,525; Â£1,175) for the new tickets and for a hotel in Toronto. They also lost two days off the family vacation. ""It threw a massive wrench into the happiness [of the trip],"" he told the BBC. Mr Bennett says he wants compensation from the airline and an explanation as to why he was kept off the flight despite medical professionals saying he was able to fly.

Success of IVF 'causes fall in adoptions',"Heather with her husband and four children Heather Bell persevered with IVF for almost five years before she had children. ""I thought about adopting all the time,"" she told BBC News, but she and her husband decided to pursue IVF. The boss of a body that represents children in care has said the success of IVF has contributed to a drop in the number of children being adopted. In the last 40 years since the first ""test-tube baby"" was born, adoptions in England and Wales have fallen by 62%. Meanwhile, IVF success rates for women under 35 have nearly tripled. Why I chose to go it alone with IVF The 'highs and lows' of adopting children BBC Radio 4 - The Adoption When she decided against adoption, Heather, now 41, said she was shocked, embarrassed, disappointed and frustrated at her feelings around her decision. But despite two miscarriages and two full cycles of IVF, she felt she wanted to try to have her biological children. Eventually she gave birth to two daughters through IVF, and went on to have two more children naturally. Even if she had not given birth, she said, she felt she might not have had the ""emotional energy"" to go through the adoption system. It is that system that Anthony Douglas, head of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass) has spoken aboutin an interview with the Daily Telegraph,external. He says the adoption process in England is ""far too slow"". And it is having to compete with other ways of becoming a parent. Mr Douglas, 69 - who was himself adopted - told the newspaper: ""IVF used to be around 7% successful and now it's around 30%. ""So as a choice, adoption is competing with lots of other ways of having children."" He added: ""Every child deserves a family to live and grow up in but adoption still takes twice as long as it should, which puts people off."" Data from the Office for National Statistics,externalsuggests there were 12,121 children adopted in England and Wales in 1978. In 2017, 4,350 looked after children in England were adopted,government figures show.,externalWhile in Wales,more than 300 children,externalwere placed in their adoptive home. But the falling number of adoptions is despite an increase in the number of children in care in England. There are 72,670 looked after children in England as of March 2017. The adopted children confused by love 'Powerful first moment' with adopted child Earlier this month, the National Adoption Serviceput out a callfor prospective parents in Wales to come forward to help, following an ""unanticipated increase"" in children looking for homes. Meanwhile, Department of Education figures for England suggested the average duration between entry into care and being adopted decreased from 22 months in 2012-13 to 16 months in 2016-17, while the number of children waiting to be matched with a family dropped from 5,500 to 2,500 over the same period. The department said the number of looked after children in England who were adopted was up from 3,100 in 2011, although numbers fell in 2016 and 2017. A spokesperson said: ""Every child deserves to have a loving, stable home that's right for them, and thousands of families have had their lives transformed by adoption. ""We have invested Â£90m in the Adoption Support Fund and we are setting up Regional Adoption Agencies to further improve the time it takes for the child to go to live with their new family."" IVF - or in vitro fertilisation - is when an egg is removed from a woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop. It worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born This video can not be played Louise Brown's 40th birthday has been marked by a new museum exhibition in London On average, IVF fails 70% of the time and it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive using it. The highest success rates are for women under 35 - one-third of treatment cycles are successful. Guidelines say it should be offered to women until the age of 42. Howeverlast week it emergedthat in 12 areas of England, women over 34 are being automatically refused IVF treatment on the NHS.

Man-eating tiger killed after huge hunt,"India is home to 60% of the world's tigers A tigress in India which is said to have killed 13 people has been shot dead after a major hunt, officials say. The six-year-old tigress had evaded capture in the jungles of the western state of Maharashtra for two years. Last month wildlife officials deployed perfume in a bid to lure the animal. Activists had campaigned to save the tiger, but India's Supreme Court said it would not interfere if forest rangers were forced to shoot it. A team armed with a tranquiliser gun and a firearm was stationed in a vehicle on a road where the tigress, known as T-1, had been spotted by villagers, a Forestry Department statement said. A patrol team went to an area near Borati village on Friday evening, after receiving reports of the tigress' presence. A tranquilliser dart was fired at the animal.  Once hit, the tigress charged the patrol's vehicle and she was killed by a single shot from a distance of between eight and 10 metres (26-33 ft), the statement said. A post-mortem will now be performed on the beast. Can Calvin Klein scent catch a 'killer' tiger? Why India should not get complacent over its tiger population In August the tigress and her two nine-month-old cubs killed three people in the area around the town of Pandharkawada in Yavatmal district and left more than 5,000 residents fearing for their lives. Farmers and graziers were told to return early from the fields and forest, venture out only in groups, and not defecate in the open fields, a common practice in the villages. There will now be a post-mortem on the tigress Meanwhile the hunt for the tigress included more than 100 camera traps, bait in the form of horses and goats tied to trees, round-the-clock surveillance from treetop platforms and armed patrols. Wildlife officials also brought in bottles of Obsession for Men by Calvin Klein, which contains a pheromone called civetone, after an experiment in the US suggested that it could be used to attract jaguars. What does it take to relocate a 195kg tiger in India? India alarm over rising tiger deaths Nepal busts chimp smugglers after BBC investigation T-1 is believed to have killed 10 people in 20 months since 2016 before killing three more in August. DNA tests on swabs from tiger saliva from the wounds of seven of the 13 victims showed that five of them were inflicted by a female tiger. Many of the bodies were decapitated as she dragged her prey away. She appears to have tasted human flesh as at least one victim was found with his leg torn off. The BBC's Soutik Biswas says T-1 may have been attacking humans after coming across them as they grazed cattle in the forest. The villagers are banned by the government from grazing their cattle in the reserve and have been taking them into the forest because there is little fodder close to their homes, our correspondent says. With more than 2,200 big cats, India is home to 60% of the world's tigers. There are more than 200 in Maharashtra, but only a third of them live in the state's 60 protected areas, including sanctuaries, natural parks and tiger reserves.

HBO unimpressed by Trump's 'Thrones' meme,"Actors Kit Harrington and John Bradley in international TV hit series Game of Thrones The term 'sanctions' will turn off all but the most devoted current affairs nerds. But add a Game Of Thrones meme, and BAM!, it's social-media friendly. The White House did just that on Friday when a picture referencing the hit TV series was posted on President Donald Trump's social media accounts. ""Sanctions are coming,"" it said. It came after the administration announced it is to reinstate all US sanctions on Iran removed under the 2015 nuclear deal. HBO, the US network that produced Game of Thrones, was unimpressed, saying: ""We were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes.""

"Review: Stormzy has written a book, but is it any good? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ","When Stormzy stood on stage at the BRIT Awards in February this year and delivered his stinging rap criticising the government's handling of the Grenfell Tower Fire, the then 24-year-old grime artist from Thornton Heath, south London, achieved something that is almost unheard of for a working-class, young black man from ""a place where success doesn't happen."" Stormzy at this year's Brit Awards asking: ""Yo Theresa May, whereâs the money for Grenfell?"" He had won. And not just the Album of the Year award for Gang Signs & Prayer. He had won something much more elusive. He had won the Establishment's respect (the government quickly issued a statement about the actions it had taken in response to the Grenfell tragedy), the right to speak and be heard: a seat at the table where the national conversation takes place. In that moment Michael Omari, or just plain Mike to his friends and Stormzy to you and me, became a significant player in British culture. It was the latest chapter in his remarkable story, which you can read all about in his lyrics, or in the many interviews he has given. But not, I can report, in his new book, Rise Up: The #Merky Story So far. Rise Up is not an autobiography, or a revelation-filled memoir. There are no stories about outrageous pop star extravagances, or torrid tales from his teenage years. There is the briefest of mentions of being stabbed, of the police kicking in his front door, of a friend's suicide, of mental health issues, ""I was mad depressed for a whileâ¦ I'd just be sitting in my house. No-one would see me for days, or weeks â¦I was so broken-spirited."" Stormzy is close to his mother, Abigail Owuo But these are fleeting asides that are neither explored nor explained. A frank outpouring of the soul it is not. In fact, it's more like a business book charting the rise of #Merky, the lifestyle/entertainment brand Stormzy has created with a close band of brothers and sisters. We hear from many of them in first-person extracts taken from interviews by co-author Jude Yawson, who has structured their reminiscences into chronological order, starting in the late noughties when an ambitious yet unfocussed Mike is about to leave school. Jude Yawson co-wrote the book after speaking to many people in Stormzy's inner circle Given that all involved in the publication are friends or acquaintances it will not surprise you to learn that at times it can come across more like a piece of brand communications than a warts-and-all account into the trials and tribulations of setting-up a company. In many instances such an approach would result in an extremely dull piece of vanity publishing. But that is emphatically not the case here. Rise Up is not only a decent read; it is a very important book. The voices we hear from - young, gifted and largely black - are all too rarely heard. These are people who typically have to listen to a daily diet of media negativity about their communities without the opportunities to respond. Stormzy posing with family members, backstage at the Brits this year Stormzy's success, and the choices he is making (such as the #Merky Books collaboration with Penguin to publish new writers), is providing a much-needed platform for those from working-class, inner-city backgrounds to speak out and give vent to their talents. Rise Up is #Merky Books's first publication, and a fitting one too. It is not simply about great achievements against the odds. More importantly, perhaps, it provides a detailed roadmap, and possibly the confidence, to readers not blessed with resources and contacts, who, like the #Merky founders, want to get on and make a contribution: to fulfil their talents and ambitions. It is truly inspiring to read about the accomplishments of Team Stormzy, realised largely without money or expertise, but with bucket loads of intelligence and hard work. Trust, friendship, instinct, vision, discipline, networks, empathy, resilience, courage, risk, and humility are all ingredients in the making of their business. The uncompromising pursuit of excellence and a relentless desire to ""grow"" professionally is what has driven it forward. Stormzy listening intently in the recording studio, is demanding of himself and others Stormzy is clearly the leader; he is the one setting the standards: ""I demand high standards from myself, and from everyone I'm working withâ¦ If someone is bringing me down, or getting in the way of me doing something the way I need it to be done, I won't have it. Some of them have a name for me, 'Smoky Mike', when I get vexed and I tell them off."" We hear a tiny bit more about 'Smoky Mike' towards the end of the book from his close friend Flipz: ""He's [Stormzy] a good guy, and he's a smart guy, and he knows what he wants. And he puts energy and ambition into all of us. It might not be in a nice way sometimes, but we know what he's trying to do."" And that's it. There is no further talk of what ""might not be nice"" about Stormzy's management style. Why not? We know it can't all be light, there has to be some shade. It would be instructive to understand how he operates when things are not going to plan. I'm guessing there's a bit of Sir Alex Ferguson's infamous ""hairdryer treatment"" going on: a slightly less glowing account would negate the need to speculate. Stormzy's plan is clear. He wants to emulate Jay-Z's success both as a musician and an entrepreneur (""I'm Not A Businessman, I'm A Business, Man""). He also wants to make a difference, using his money and position to help others. This philanthropic agenda was evident in the announcement this summer that he's funding two scholarships for black British students at Cambridge University. Stormzy showing he wants to help others by funding scholarships for black students to go to Cambridge University He is still only 25 years old, there will be plenty of bumps along the road, but if anyone can deliver on Stormzy's ambitions it is the man himself. His confidence is unshakable, his vision is clear, and his pioneering attitude deserves support and respect: ""I am 100 per cent sure that I'm a world-class artist. I've always had a mad point to prove, because getting that respect as a black musician in this country is not easy. Where's our Kanye? Where's our Kendrick? Where's our Prince? It's not to say we need that, but where is the spectrum of talented black British musicians who can really stand up against the rest of the world.""

Nicholas Churton, 67,was killed at his home in March 2017by Jordan Davidson. On Wednesday, the police watchdog said officers may have made errors when dealing with the case. One officer recorded a robbery, which involves the use of threat or force, by Davidson as a theft,which may have put Mr Churton in danger. James Churton said: ""They let him out on bail. He was free to go and commit more crimes and murder my brother and I find that quite extraordinary."" Davidson, who is now serving a life sentence with a minimum of 30 years, had a long list of previous convictions and was out on licence when he killed Mr Churton. North Wales Police had been in contact with Mr Churton several times in the 11 days before he was killed, including responding to his call that a man called Jordan had been in his home. Mr Churton called police two days later to tell them the man's full name was Jordan Davidson. Four days later, he was found dead. Jordan Davidson's 23-year minimum term was later increased to 30 An Independent Office for Police Conduct report said an officer and a sergeant had cases to answer for misconduct about the way the complaint by Mr Churton was handled, advising him to speak to his friends and find out who the intruder was himself. North Wales Police said it had reviewed risk assessment procedures as a result. Mr Churton, who lives in Malpas, Cheshire, said: ""I do feel very bitter about the whole thing.

Nicholas Churton murder: Police 'made errors' before death,"Police have been given more time to question Jordan Davidson (left) over the death of Nicholas Churton (right) Police may have made errors dealing with a disabled man who was murdered just days after his killer broke into his house, a watchdog has found. Nicholas Churton, 67, was killed at his home in 2017 by Jordan Davidson, from Wrexham, with a machete and hammer. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said an officer recorded a robbery by Davidson as a theft, which may have put Mr Churton in danger. North Wales Police said it has reviewed risk assessment procedures as a result. The IOPC report says the officer and a sergeant ""have cases to answer for misconduct"" about the way the complaint by Mr Churton was handled, advising him to speak to his friends and find out who the intruder was himself. ""Performance issues"" were also noted for another sergeant and an acting inspector within the force. North Wales Police were in contract Mr Churton several times in the 11 days before he was killed, including responding to his call that a man called Jordan had been in his home. Mr Churton, who lived alone, was found dead in his living room by a friend Mr Churton called police two days later to tell them the man's full name was Jordan Davidson. Four days later, he was found dead at his home. The IOPC said Mr Churton called the force on 14 March last year to report he had been threatened with a hammer by a man called Jordan who tried to steal his television and had stolen his house keys. Later that day, a police officer called Mr Churton back to take further details, the IOPC said. Second probe into police after Nicholas Churton killing 23 years for murderer Jordan Davidson Victim failed by system, MP claims But the officer recorded the incident as theft rather than a robbery, which involves the use of threat or force, and the IOPC said this may have influenced the way the case was handled. Jordan Davidson was initially sentenced to a minimum term of 23 years, but this was increased to 30 Catrin Evans, IOPC director for Wales, said that while responsibility for the murder ""lies squarely"" with Davidson, its investigation had found several ""areas for improvement"". A second investigation is continuing into North Wales Police's contact with Davidson following his release from prison, Ms Evans added. Responding to the IOPC findings, Det Supt Dan Tipton confirmed formal disciplinary proceedings would be held for the officers involved. ""I recognise that this is a difficult time for Mr Churton's family and I know how important it is for the family to fully understand the circumstances leading up to his tragic death,"" he said.

Express Motors: Bus owner and sons jailed after fraud,"Clockwise from top left: Kevin Wyn Jones, Eric Wyn Jones, Rheinallt Williams, Keith Jones, Ian Wyn Jones The owner of a bus firm and his three sons have been jailed for claiming tens of thousands of pounds for bus pass journeys which were never made. Express Motors owner Eric Wyn Jones and sons Ian Wyn Jones, Keith Jones and Kevin Wyn Jones, claimed more than Â£88,000 from Gwynedd council for fake journeys using over-60s bus passes. Sentencing the men, Judge Timothy Petts told Mold Crown Court the fraud was ""one of breath-taking arrogance"". All fourhad denied charges of fraud. Eric Wyn Jones, 77, from Bontnewydd, was jailed for seven and a half years on Wednesday, with Judge Petts saying he had a ""leading role"" in the the business and the fraud. Ian Wyn Jones, 53, from Penygroes, was also sentenced to seven and a half years in prison; Kevin Wyn Jones, 54, from Bontnewydd, was given seven years and Keith Jones, 51, from Llanddaniel, was given six years. The men were also found guilty of putting more than Â£500,000 in cash through their own bank accounts without paying tax. Ian Wyn Jones admitted an additional charge of possessing Â£840 worth of counterfeit currency. Claims were made to the council for the fake journeys, which paid Gwynedd-based Express Motors, and then claimed the money back from the Welsh Government under the all-Wales concessionary travel scheme. The figures were ""staggering"", the judge said, with cards being swiped more than 88,000 times, adding that ""each swipe was quite literally money in the bank for Express Motors"". Judge Petts said: ""someone at Express Motors discovered a loophole in the system"" and a collection of lost cards was built up. A fifth man, Rheinallt Williams, 44, had already pleaded guilty to swiping cards on behalf of his employers. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison.

Anglesey's RSPB planning ban overturned,"Pay and display parking meters can now be installed at a popular beauty spot after a council's ban was overturned. The RSPB wants to charge for parking at Elin's Tower and at South Stack near Holyhead on Anglesey. County councillors had rejected its application due to concerns over the impact on the area of motorists parking on narrow country lanes to avoid paying the charges. The Planning Inspectorate has sided with the animal charity on an appeal. The cliffs at South Stack are breeding grounds for guillemots, razorbills and puffins during springtime and a busy tourist attraction. The RSPB lodged an appeal against the refusal of planning permission for the meters saying that fees were an ""appropriate way"" to boost its funds. An online petition was signed by 6,000 against the charges, which accused the charity of ""exploiting"" the beauty spot. 'Puffarazzi' pictures may help seabird survive South Stack lighthouse 'set to reopen to public' Anglesey coastline glows bright blue The planning inspector appointed by the Welsh Government, Kay Sheffield, found that Anglesey Council had failed to demonstrate the harm to highway safety that would arise from the proposed installation of parking meters on South Stacks Road,the Local Democracy Reporting Servicesays. Ms Sheffield said: ""I therefore conclude that the Council has behaved unreasonably having regard to the advice contained in the annex and an award of costs is justified."" The fees would cover car parks at Elin's Tower and the South Stack visitor centre Her ruling means the authority could now have to pay significant costs to the RSPB, which has welcomed the decision. A spokesman for the RSPB said: ""We know our decision to introduce charges for vehicle owners who are not RSPB members has caused concern, and during the summer we announced significant changes to our original proposals including a trial concession rate for Anglesey residents."" Anglesey County Council says it will ""carefully consider"" the findings.

Bus bosses jailed after 'arrogant' fraud,"Clockwise from top left: Kevin Wyn Jones, Eric Wyn Jones, Rheinallt Williams, Keith Jones, Ian Wyn Jones The owner of a bus firm and his three sons have been jailed for claiming tens of thousands of pounds for bus pass journeys which were never made. Express Motors owner Eric Wyn Jones and sons Ian Wyn Jones, Keith Jones and Kevin Wyn Jones, claimed more than Â£88,000 from Gwynedd council for fake journeys using over-60s bus passes. Sentencing the men, Judge Timothy Petts told Mold Crown Court the fraud was ""one of breath-taking arrogance"". All fourhad denied charges of fraud. Eric Wyn Jones, 77, from Bontnewydd, was jailed for seven and a half years on Wednesday, with Judge Petts saying he had a ""leading role"" in the the business and the fraud. Ian Wyn Jones, 53, from Penygroes, was also sentenced to seven and a half years in prison; Kevin Wyn Jones, 54, from Bontnewydd, was given seven years and Keith Jones, 51, from Llanddaniel, was given six years. The men were also found guilty of putting more than Â£500,000 in cash through their own bank accounts without paying tax. Ian Wyn Jones admitted an additional charge of possessing Â£840 worth of counterfeit currency. Claims were made to the council for the fake journeys, which paid Gwynedd-based Express Motors, and then claimed the money back from the Welsh Government under the all-Wales concessionary travel scheme. The figures were ""staggering"", the judge said, with cards being swiped more than 88,000 times, adding that ""each swipe was quite literally money in the bank for Express Motors"". Judge Petts said: ""someone at Express Motors discovered a loophole in the system"" and a collection of lost cards was built up. A fifth man, Rheinallt Williams, 44, had already pleaded guilty to swiping cards on behalf of his employers. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison.

Wanted drug dealer model poses on Facebook,"Terrence Murrell told police he was a model A male model involved with a drugs gang that imported raw steroids from China has been posing for holiday snaps while on the run in Indonesia, a court heard. Terrence Murrell, 30, from London, was jailed for 37 months in his absence at Caernarfon Crown Court on Tuesday. He had previously admitted conspiracy to supply a controlled drug and possession with intent to supply. Prosecuting counsel Sarah Badrawy said Murrell had made more than Â£220,000 from the supply of steroids. The court heard Murrell, who told police he was a model, was now leading the life of a tourist on the island of Bali and had been seen in photos on Facebook. Ms Badrawy said drugs worth almost Â£2m had been seized and the gang were thought to have made Â£1.2m profit in two years. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said 15 defendants conspired to import, produce and then sell steroids and hormone tablets around north Wales, London and Leeds and on a number of websites. The drugs ring was broken after customs officials intercepted a number of parcels addressed to the defendants or bogus business addresses they were using to hide the conspiracy, the CPS added. The parcels were found to contain raw steroids and other items used in the manufacture and distribution of the drugs. Judge Huw Rees said the case involved a ""very extensive criminal operation"" with steroids imported from Hong Kong and China.

Welsh? There could be a device for that,"Voice command devices could understand Welsh in the future Welsh language versions of smart speakers and voice-driven devices such as Alexa and Siri could be developed in future. The Welsh Government's Welsh language minister said it is important people can use Welsh with the devices. It follows warnings that gadgets are turning English into the language of choice in some Welsh-speaking homes. The aim is part of the government's Welsh Language Technology Action Plan, which is launched on Tuesday. Announcing the scheme,  minister Eluned Morgan said that one of the key aims would be to develop artificial intelligence so that machines would be able to understand spoken Welsh. Is your smart phone listening to you? The most requested albums for Alexa The battle of the smart speakers Improving computer-assisted translation would also be a key element of the plan, seen as part of the government's wider aim of having a million Welsh speakers by 2050. The announcement also includes a pledge to support existing Welsh language content, including websites, spell-check programmes and interactive maps. ""So many people use technology for so many different things in their lives,"" said Ms Morgan. ""We want to make it as easy as possible for them to do this in Welsh. ""This is why we want Welsh language functionality to be readily available, without having to be requested, when it comes to technology, whether that is working on your computer, using your phone or tablet. ""We want people to be able to use Welsh and English easily in their virtual lives at home, in school, in work or on the move."" Eluned Morgan said it was important for people to use Welsh with voice technology Though the Welsh Government  has not announced how much funding will go towards enacting the new action plan, the minister previously said that they have ""invested a lot more money in the Welsh language"", and that grants have been awarded to ""innovative"" language technology projects. Earlier this year, the head of a specialist unit at Bangor University called for a more ""long term vision"" when it comes to supporting those schemes. Delyth Prys, from the Language Technology Unit at Canolfan Bedwyr, said that organisations were not getting enough long-term spending commitments to ""get our teeth into projects"" and develop new resources. The unit has been responsible for developing projects such as Lleisiwr, which aimed to replicate the voices of patients in danger of losing the ability to speak due to throat cancer or neurological conditions.

ÃÂ£671m 'growth deal' decision awaited,"A planned new nuclear power plant at site of former Trawsfynydd could unlock extra investment A deal aimed at creating almost 5,500 jobs in north Wales could be at an end if it does not get the backing of the UK government in this month's Budget. That is according to the body driving the Â£671m bid, the North Wales Economic Ambition Board (NWEAB). The UK government said ""more work needs to be done"" on the North Wales Growth Deal but it ""remains committed"". The NWEAB and employers' group, North Wales Mersey Dee Business Council, said they were ""confident"" about the Budget. The North Wales Growth Deal would bring Â£671m of investment to the region. Half of it would come jointly from the UK and Welsh governments, with Â£219m from organisations such as universities and colleges. Businesses are being expected to put in Â£109m upfront as part of the agreement. However, it is argued that the private sector would invest Â£3.1bn in the long-term as a direct result of the growth deal. North Wales growth deal: Call to make the right connections 2018: No 'same old, same old' north Wales growth deal, says minister 2017: North Wales' deprived areas 'need support' in growth deal 2016: New 'growth deal' for north Wales is gaining momentum The majority of that would come from the development of a newsmall nuclear plant at Trawsfynyddin Gwynedd, if that energy project was given the go ahead. The growth deal is aimed at improving what the region has to offer in a number of areas, including land and property, energy, skills, transport and adventure tourism as well as digital connectivity and technology. Property shortages across north Wales have led to concerns that businesses are being held back from growing and creating more jobs. Apra Ames Roberts (left): 'We have a lot of people who depend on us to get this right' Crazy Ladies Costumes in Wrexham is owned by Apra Ames Roberts and Diane Hughes and has been trading since 2003. It sells its goods all over the world but its building is about to be demolished and it is struggling to find suitable alternative premises for its 18 staff. ""It's so hard and I am getting so despairing,"" Ms Roberts said. ""We have a very viable business. We have a lot of people who depend on us to get this right."" She added there needed to be more properties built and better business support to allow small companies like hers to continue to grow. A total of Â£124m from the public and private sector would be spent on improving the availability of land and property as part of the Growth Deal. Dyfrig Siencyn, deputy chairman of the North Wales Economic Ambition Board, suggested it would be a huge problem if the deal did not get UK government backing in the Budget. ""They want it to succeed. They've worked with us for the last 12 months and more in challenging the projects we have here. We've had real hard challenges from them,"" he said. ""By this point, we're confident that we have a range of projects that are suitable for north Wales and that they have a strong basis and support from the private sector. ""And from our recent discussions with the ministers there is no indication of any negativity at this time."" Dyfrig Siencyn: 'From our recent discussions with the ministers there is no indication of any negativity' A UK government spokesperson said: ""It is clear that leaders across the region have re-energised their determination to make a strong case for investment in key sectors. ""A proposal underwritten by local expertise and real-world knowledge is exactly what will take the North Wales Growth Deal to the next stage. ""While more work needs to be done, we are continuing to work with the innovators and shapers throughout the region, to support them in making this deal a success and deliver better outcomes for north Wales.""

'County lines' drugs gang jailed,"Shaun Coleman, Marvin Frantzen, Sandra Mathias and Lee Jones (bottom right) Three people who dealt heroin and cocaine in Wrexham have been jailed as part of a crackdown on a ""county lines"" drug ring. Marvin Frantzen, Shaun Coleman, and Sandra Mathias admitted two counts of conspiring to supply Class A drugs. They were caught after police closed in on the network which supplied the drugs from Liverpool. A fourth defendant, Lee Jones, was also sentenced at Mold Crown Court for his involvement. County Lines: Why Wales is hit so hard Drugs spread far with 'County Lines' Police seized drugs and Â£40,000 cash during the operation. Judge Timothy Petts was told how mobile phones were used to alert a list of drug users to the fact that supplies were available to buy. When arrested, a pistol and a round of ammunition was found at the home of 26-year-old Coleman, who was jailed for 11 years. He admitted possession of a firearm and a dangerous driving charge after driving at speeds in excess of 100mph (160km/h) in Cheshire, which saw him crash his Land Rover. Police seized this hand gun when they arrested Shaun Coleman The 31-year-old father of two was jailed for 14 years and 10 months. Mathias, 40, acted as a driver for the drug dealers and was jailed for four and a half years. Jones, 39, was sentenced separately because of threats he faced from his co-defendants, the court heard. He was given a two year-sentence, suspended for 18 months, after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. After the hearing, Det Insp Mark Hughes of North Wales Police, said: ""The gang was prepared to use violence and intimidation, but the operation shows that north Wales is not a soft target for criminals like this who do so much damage to our communities.""

Transgender officer overcame 'vile' abuse,"PCSO Connor Freel was born female but felt he was in the ""wrong body"" Connor Freel said he suffered ""vile"" verbal and physical abuse when he first began transitioning to a boy. He said school days were difficult and he was hit by other children, including being struck in the face by a rock. Now a police community support officer (PCSO) based in Mold, Flintshire, he is backing North Wales Police's campaign duringHate Crimes Awareness Week,external. ""It's great if my experience can help others,"" he said. ""That drives me on."" Conor was born female but, from an early age, he said he felt he had been born in the ""wrong body"". ""I told my parents when I was a small child that I was a boy,"" he said. ""When I was around 15 I changed my name to Connor and felt free. ""I was no longer acting and not trying to fit into some sort of box I didn't belong in."" PCSO Connor Freel is urging victims of hate crime to report abuse to police However, the transition was far from straightforward as Connor said he was a target for discrimination and hate in and out of school. ""Fellow students didn't know whether I was male or female so they basically lashed out,"" he said. ""I'd walk down a corridor and someone would smack the back of my head and call me names.

He switched schools and went on to complete a criminology and criminal justice degree at university before joining the police. He has undergone hormone treatment, as well as chest surgery, and now regularly speaks to schoolchildren about hate crime and the LGBT community. Connor, who is engaged, said life ""could not be better"". ""Everyone has been great and I don't have any issues with the public.

'Wylfa jobs could drain away to England',"Fruit and vegetable supplier Ffrwythau D.J. Fruits in Porthmadog cannot find premises to expand Jobs created by a Â£12bn nuclear power plant could be lost to England because of a lack of business premises, according to a property expert. The Wylfa Newydd plant would employ around 9,000 people, and require a variety of suppliers, such as builders and caterers. Anglesey council said it was working to provide more business properties. But Wylfa Newydd still needs planning permission and marine licences to go ahead. It is hoped that the Wylfa Newydd development could have a similar impact on the growth of local companies and create jobs, like Tata in Port Talbot and Airbus in Broughton. The nuclear plant is negotiating with the UK government on funding and taxpayers are expected to have a significant stake in this development. National Grid accused of not caring over Anglesey pylons plan Â£40m nuclear facility project for Wales announced Wylfa Newydd: what happens next? Chris Sutton, a director of the property agency JLL and a former chair of CBI Wales, said councils and the Welsh Government had to make plans on land and building works to ensure there was a legacy from the Wylfa Newydd investment. He added the legacy should not just be for Anglesey, but across north-west Wales as well. ""If we don't do that, then what we could find is that investment and those jobs actually go down the A55 to the Manchester-Liverpool area,"" Mr Sutton said. Former chair of CBI Wales and property expert Chris Sutton is warning of building shortages on Anglesey He argued there was a shortage of office space, meeting rooms and warehouses in Anglesey and Gwynedd. ""We need to create a package of 'grade A' employment buildings - which are suitable for the supply chain companies coming in there,"" he told BBC Wales. A potential winner from the new nuclear plant would be the food sector. Gethin Dwyfor, managing director of a family business Ffrwythau D.J. Fruits, said he had been trying to expand for a year but could not find a property big enough. He has been running his business in Porthmadog since 1980 and employs 20 people. ""We need more infrastructure in terms of buildings in the area. It's very difficult to find anything, small or large,"" he said. It is understood Wylfa Newydd would not be operating until the mid-2020s, if the developer's timetable runs to plan Councillor Carwyn Jones, who is responsible for major projects and economic development at Anglesey council, says they are working hard to tackle the problem. He said there will be a new Â£12m link road in Llangefni, five new business units opening in the town and plans to build 10 others in Holyhead. ""We're doing a lot of work on this to make sure the people of Anglesey and the [north west of Wales] capitalise on this,"" he added. The Economy Secretary Ken Skates said they had identified a ""shortage of units"" and have entered into a joint venture with Anglesey council on the new Holyhead properties and were supporting the development of industrial premises in Llangefni. ""But we want to set the bar as high as possible when it comes to the development of Wylfa power station and make sure that development leads to long-term employment opportunities for the people of the island and the people of north Wales,"" he said. Horizon Nuclear Power, the company behind Wylfa Newydd, also told BBC Wales it was committed to building a supply chain on the island and across the ""north Wales arc"". UK government spokesman said: ""From the announcement of a nuclear sector deal, to the kick-starting of the negotiations with Hitachi for new nuclear on Anglesey, the actions the UK government is taking are set to support a long-term pipeline for new nuclear projects, and places Wales at the heart of a UK arc of the nuclear industry.

Schools mergers mooted to save money,"One secondary school on Anglesey was less than half full, a report to councillors said Secondary schools on Anglesey might have to merge with primaries or lose their sixth forms to reduce empty places, council officers have advised. About a quarter of school places are unfilled, while Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones in Amlwch is less than half full. Even the arrival of workers to build a nuclear power station at Wylfa would only bring 200 more pupils, they said. Anglesey council's ruling executive has given the go-ahead to a review aimed at saving Â£5m over three years. Council officers previously warned that up to 17 small primary schools might have to close to help balance the council's books. A report to councillors said secondary schools on Anglesey had room for 5,171 pupils, but due to falling numbers of school age children locally they only had 3,717 enrolled, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones posed particular concern, with room for 971 pupils but only 479 pupils on the register -  representing 49% of its capacity. 'Tremendous' impact of school closures School closures could help balance books Revisiting Motorhead frontman's Amlwch schooldays,external Arwyn Williams, the council's head of learning, said possible solutions might include federalisation, multi-site schools, and more ""super schools"" combining secondary and primary education. If sixth forms closed, courses could be offered at Coleg Menai, a further education college in Bangor. The arrival of workers and their families for the building of a new nuclear power station at Wylfa - due to start by 2020 subject to approval - would make little difference to the number of school places needed, the report added. Anglesey's deputy leader Ieuan Williams backed the need for reorganisation. He pointed to the austerity agenda and highlighted the need to make cuts. Councillor Robin Williams added: ""Head teachers are pushing us to modernise the education system with some haste, and it's important that we listen to those on the front line.""

Murdered mum 'let down by police',"This video can not be played 'He's taken her and her children's lives' The family of a mother murdered by her ex say she was let down by the police. Mother-of-twoLaura Stuart was stabbed multiple times and kicked in the head by Jason Cooperas she walked home from a night out - she died two days later. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is examining 18 reports made to North Wales Police involving Laura and/or Cooper before her death. ""They did let Laura down and I do feel that they've let us down,"" Laura's mother Liz Griffiths said. ""They could have done more for her."" Cooper, 29,was jailed for 31 years at Mold Crown Court in Marchafter being found guilty of her murder in Denbigh. North Wales Police say they ""await"" the IOPC findings, which are due in the coming months, and added they ""cannot comment further at this stage."" Jason Cooper once sent Laura 421 text messages in a day They are being investigated for the numerous contacts they had with care worker Laura in the two years before her death in August 2017 - and not all were domestic-related incidents. Laura, who was 33 when she was killed, was with Cooper, from Denbigh, for two years - with the relationship becoming abusive and controlling after they moved in together. ""Laura was fun-loving, hard-working, loved her children, loved all her family, but he'd make her photograph her timesheets at work so he'd know exactly what hours she was working,"" Mrs Griffiths told theBBC's Wales Live programme. ""She'd cook his dinner for him and he'd just walk in and throw the plate of food at her, the whole plate. ""She became more withdrawn from everybody, she wasn't allowed to speak to her friends. She wasn't really allowed to do anything, unless he was with her."" Eventually Laura left Cooper and moved back in with her mother. He was furious. He texted her constantly and would stand outside in the street waiting for her. ""He just wouldn't leave her alone,"" added Mrs Griffiths. ""Her phone, it just pinged all the time, continuously pinged. Jason Cooper is appealing against the length of his 31 year sentence for murder ""On one occasion she had 421 messages in one day. He would text her saying 'If I can't have you, nobody's going to have you. Run, run, run'. ""I think that was one of the last texts he sent, 'You'd better run'."" Three days before she died, Laura went to the police again. She explained Cooper was constantly contacting her, but because there was no signal at Denbigh Police Station they could not see the messages on her phone. The police asked Laura to leave her phone but she said she needed it for work. They asked her to send the messages on, but did not hear from her again. Laura left without making a formal complaint as she said she was worried it would make matters worse. Laura Stuart was walking with a friend when she was attacked in the early hours by Jason Cooper Her mother said she wanted the police to speak to Cooper and warn him off. ""If they'd actually spoken to him, actually physically went and spoken to him, gave him a little bit of a push to say stop messaging her and stop harassing her,"" said Mrs Griffiths. ""I think maybe he would have listened, you'd hope that he would have listened."" Three days after her visit to the police station, Laura went out for a friend's birthday. If the issues raised in this story has affected you, help and support is available viaBBC Action Line. Laura's friend David Roberts was also knifed by Cooper as he tried to stop the attack. Although Mr Roberts recovered, Laura died on 13 August 2017. Cooper was jailed in March for Laura's murder and the attack on Mr Roberts. Laura Stuart and Jason Cooper were together for two years before the relationship deteriorated He is appealing against the length of his sentence, with a hearing due at the Court of Appeal on Thursday. ""On behalf of North Wales Police I would again like to extend our deepest sympathy to Laura's family,"" said Supt Neil Harrison. ""Following Laura's tragic death, the matter was referred to the IOPC who have undertaken an independent investigation relating to police contact prior to her death. ""North Wales Police awaits the IOPC's findings and determinations in relation to this matter and, therefore, cannot comment further at this stage."" The IOPC said it was finalising the report and expected to publish it in the coming months. Watch theBBC's Wales Live programmeafter the 10 o'clock news on BBC One Wales on Wednesday 10 October.

Welsh councils facing real-terms cuts,"This video can not be played Alun Davies: People will find local services diminishing after a very difficult funding settlement All councils in Wales are facing real terms cuts to their funding from the Welsh Government next year. The Isle of Anglesey, Conwy, Flintshire, Powys, Monmouthshire and Gwynedd are the worst hit. Six south Wales councils can expect more cash, but the increases are below theinflationrate of 2.7%. Conservative local government spokesman Mark Isherwood called the settlement a ""kick in the teeth for north, mid and west Wales"". Welsh Government funding forms the bulk of cash used by councils to fund services, including leisure centres, schools, waste and care provision. Alun Davies, Local Government Secretary, announced thatoverall council funding,externalwill be cut in cash terms by 0.3% to Â£4.21bn, equivalent to Â£13m. Local government reacted angrily to the announcement, with the Welsh Local Government Association saying the funding ""simply does not provide enough resources to fund local services"". It contrasts to the increase in health spending expected in next year's budget. More NHS cash but council cuts expected Councils face cash cuts for two years 'Worst yet to come' in English council cuts The Isle of Anglesey, Conwy, Flintshire, Powys and Monmouthshire will see a 1% cash cut to their funding. Cardiff will see the greatest cash increase, at 0.4%, while Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf will see a 0.3% increase. Newport and Neath Port Talbot will see a 0.2% increase, while Swansea's cash settlement will remain stable. By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor How much extra or less cash councils will get next year The thing local government is really tamping about is that the Welsh Government did not pass on more of the extra money it got from the UK Treasury. This came to Wales as a result of the prime minister promising the NHS in England more money. The Welsh Government has the power to spend its share of that money however it wants, but it has directed the bulk of it to health. Welsh councillors think the government is giving the NHS too big slice of the cake, and leaving their social care obligations with the crumbs. One senior local government source said to me earlier: ""They can't say social care is a priority, or prevention [of health problems] is a priority and then come up with a budget like this."" There will be some extra money coming their way - an extra Â£30m for social care and Â£15 million for education - but they are grants and they come with strings attached. Welsh councils want control of how to spend their money. They want it in their core funding, so that they can make local decisions on their big services: social care, housing, transport and schools. Mr Davies said after last year's Welsh Government budget councils were actually facing a 1% reduction, equivalent to Â£43m. He said: ""We have worked hard, across government, to offer local government the best settlement possible in this ninth year of austerity. ""As a result, the Â£43m cut has been reduced to less than Â£13m, including floor funding, which equates to a reduction of 0.3% on a like-for-like basis compared to the current year."" A total of Â£60m capital funding over three years is also being provided for a local authority road refurbishment scheme. ""Austerity comes with real world impacts and people are going to find local services diminishing as a consequence of the austerity that we've seen from London and that is going to have consequences in communities up and down Wales,"" he told BBC Wales. Councils fund schools, care services, waste collections and some local transport Local government sources had hoped for an average of a 1% increase. Anthony Hunt, the WLGA's finance spokesperson and Labour leader of Torfaen council, said he feared ""the wrong decisions have been taken in this budget."" ""As Labour leaders in Wales, we call on the Welsh Government to enter into immediate dialogue with councils to see how we can work together to avert what will otherwise be a deepening crisis in the funding of our children's schools, social care for vulnerable people and the other vital services that people value and rely on."" ""This settlement is a kick in the teeth for north, mid and west Wales,"" said Conservative local government spokesman Mark Isherwood. ""It is cronyism of the highest order and it is council tax payers across the region that will be paying the price.""

Sonar reveals WW1 U-boat wreck on seabed,"A sonar image shows the intact and cigar-shaped U87 German submarine lying on the seabed A German U-boat sunk on Christmas Day 1917 has been pictured for the first time using sonar imaging technology. U-87 went down off the north Wales coast when it was rammed by an escort vessel hours after sinking a steamship. The survey of the U-boat is part of a project examining World War One shipwrecks around the Welsh coast. The technology has also been used to capture a new, more detailed view of a British submarine which sank in Caernarfon Bay, Gwynedd, in March 1918. The colour image shows the broken hull of HMS H5 which was rammed by a British merchant ship that had thought it was an enemy vessel. A survey boat carrying the sonar equipment has also generated an image of the German U-87, which went to the seabed with more than 40 crew on board, after it was hit by HMS Buttercup. Dr Michael James Roberts, from Bangor University's Centre for Applied Marine Sciences, said it was a ""moving and thought-provoking experience"" when the sonar image appeared on the computer screen for the first time. ""Regardless of who these men were, they were only doing their job,"" he said. Technician Ben Powell views sonar images onboard the survey vessel as the images are captured from a device beneath the boat His team have come to know the name of the U-87 as it sank or damaged more than 20 British and Allied vessels between May and November 1917. Its last target was the SS Agberi, a liner which was torpedoed off Bardsey Island while en route to Liverpool. No-one was killed. U-87 also lies in deep water off Bardsey Island and its location was only confirmed about a year ago. Watch: Shipwreck digitally recreated by divers Watch: Underwater drone explores SS Tahoe shipwreck It is one of more than 100 World War One wrecks in Welsh waters and some are being surveyed for the""Forgotten U-boat war"",externalproject looking at associated shipwrecks around the Welsh coast. Thetwo-year programmebegan in 2016. It has been backed with Â£400,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund and it also involves experts from the Nautical Archaeology Society. The view looking down on British submarine, HMS H5, lying beneath the waves at Caernarfon Bay The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales is also involved, helping to share survey findings with maritime museums across Wales and including exhibitions at Porthmadog, Nefyn, Swansea and Pembroke Dock, among others. So far, about a dozen wreck sites have been analysed, including the British submarine, HMS H5, which went down with its 26-man crew on 2 March 1918, off Holy Island in Caernarfon Bay. The merchant ship, the SS Rutherglen, reported that it had hit a German U-boat but, after the HMS H5 was overdue by four days, it became apparent that it had been struck. SS Damao lying on seabed next to four craters which could have been created by depth charges in World War Two Another vessel off Bardsey is the SS Damao which, at time of loss on 28 April 1918, was travelling from New York to London with a cargo which included 472 tons of lead. It was torpedoed by another German submarine, the U-91. The sonar imaging project has revealed four craters on the seabed next to the ship's resting place. One theory is the site was hit by depth charges in World War Two when the wreck was picked up by a passing warship's sonar detectors.

He manages the Seacams 2 sonar project which is being used to find out what happens to undersea structures such as shipwrecks over time, as well as the surrounding environment. The findings will inform the energy generation industry which is looking to harness tidal power by creating devices such asunderwater kites.

Ex-footballer drive ban appeal rejected,"Hurst was ordered to pay Â£620 costs for the appeal A former footballer who told police he was a millionaire Premier League player has had his appeal against a drinking and driving ban rejected. James Hurst, 26, who had played for West Bromwich Albion and Wrexham FC, allegedly danced around when taken to Wrexham Police Station in December. He told Caernarfon Crown Court he had drunk a small bottle of vodka after parking his Ford Focus car. Judge Timothy Petts threw out the case and said Hurst had lied. 'Arrogant' footballer banned from driving Sitting with magistrates, he said if Hurst had drunk vodka there would have been no reason not to mention it to police at the time. Hurst was ordered to pay Â£620 costs for the appeal. He claimed he was unemployed and had no money. In April, magistrates at Llandudno handed him a bill for Â£2,300 and a 20-month ban.

Free school meals 'stigma' worries,"Around a fifth of pupils at this Holyhead school claim free school meals Stigma attached to free school meals stops some parents claiming, which has a knock-on impact on school budgets, it has been claimed. One Anglesey head teacher said parents are being urged to take up free meals - or the school could lose out on extra cash to support more deprived pupils. A Bangor University study suggests ""rural pride"" could also be a barrier in some areas. Schools receive an extra Â£1,150 for each pupil on free school meals. Nearly 65,000 pupils, aged five to 15, were eligible to claim free school meals in Wales in the last year - this is just over 17% of all pupils. Of these eligible pupils, the take-up of free school meals was around 88%. Adam Williams, head of Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi in Holyhead said that 21% of his pupils claim free school meals but he estimates that 43% have been eligible at some point since starting in year seven. Holyhead is ranked in one of the poorest places in Wales Many parts of the town are classified as deprived and are among the lowest ranked under poverty measures in Wales. The take-up of free school meals on Anglesey is slightly less than the Welsh average. ""Some families are afraid or are concerned about the stigma attached to claiming free school meals"", said Mr Williams. ""So we have a lot of very proud parents that potentially would not claim but have two maybe three jobs in order to ensure that there's enough income coming into their household. ""And the impact of that of course as a school is that we're funded directly by the percentage of parents that actually claim so in fact in doing so we lose out in the funding formula."" He said the school and local authority had tried to encourage take-up and family engagement officers helped parents with forms. This video can not be played Jodi Fielding was employed with extra money to support pupils from deprived backgrounds Jodi Fielding is one of three new pastoral support officers employed by Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi. They are paid for by the pupil development grant - to support pupils with any worries or stresses, in or out of the classroom. She is a former Army linguist - not from a teaching background - so this helps her engage with pupils, who bring a wide range of issues to her. ""The ones from the disadvantaged backgrounds are good learners but they sometimes have more of the issues at home - so we try to work with parents too, to try to sort those problems out,"" said Jodi. ""We try to bring them in as a family to discuss what's going on and how it's affecting school life. But we also get pupils not from the deprived backgrounds - here we're talking about anxiety and stress in school, there's a whole range."" Free school meals 'all year round' Why are free school meals changing? Free school meals families 'need benefits top-up' An unreliable poverty measure? Research by Bangor University suggests that head teachers believe parents in rural areas are more likely to be put off taking up free meals. Researcher Gwilym Sion ap Gruffudd said: ""They called it 'rural pride'. ""The 'rural pride' prohibited parents from making applications for free school meals."" He said that could be explained by ""the connections in rural Wales, the closeness in rural Wales, that people tend to know each other, the school staff tend to live among the pupils"". The Welsh Government is currentlyconsidering changes to eligibility for free school meals, due to the roll out of universal credit.

Gypsy and traveller site plan approved,"Hundreds of residents signed a petition opposing the proposed 10-berth camp Plans for Anglesey's first Gypsy and traveller site have been approved, just one month after they were turned down. The 10-berth camp will be developed on farmland between the A5 and A55 at Star near Gaerwen. In September, Anglesey council's planning committee rejected officers' recommendations and opposed the plans. The application was reheard on Wednesday, after a ""cooling off period"" which follows decisions against officers' advice, and approved. The authorityhas been looking for two Gypsy and traveller sites since 2016, andland was earmarkedfor a temporary stopping place in Star and a permanent residential site near Penhesgyn. A former unofficial travellers' camp at Pentraeth on Anglesey helped make the case for new sites on the island There was deadlock in the council chamber, leaving the chair of the committee, councillor Nicola Roberts, to cast the deciding vote, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. However, this was met with outbursts from the public gallery. Councillor Meirion Jones, who opposed the plan, said: ""Local people have said all along that this site isn't fit for anyone to live. Nothing has changed since you turned down the plans last month."" Planning officers argued that ""upon balance"", there were no planning reasons to turn down the plans - a view shared by councillor Ken Hughes. He said: ""Some councillors are thinking of every excuse under the sun to turn this down, be they planning considerations or not. I can't see any planning reason to turn this down."" According to the council, people residing at the site will be expected to pay rates and rent, with Welsh Government funding being sought to help pay for the development.

Bus firm guilty of fake journeys scam,"The four men were also found guilty of laundering more than half a million pounds of cash through their own bank accounts The owner of a bus firm and his three sons have been found guilty of claiming tens of thousands of pounds for bus pass journeys which were never made. Express Motors owner Eric Wyn Jones and sons Ian Wyn Jones, Keith Jones and Kevin Wyn Jones, claimed money back from Gwynedd Council for fake journeys using over-60s bus passes. One card had been used 23,000 times, Caernarfon Crown Court heard. All four denied charges of fraud but were convicted by a jury. Eric Wyn Jones, 77, from Bontnewydd, Ian Wyn Jones, 53, from Penygroes, Keith Jones, 51, from Llanddaniel and Kevin Wyn Jones ,54, from Bontnewydd, were also found guilty of putting more than Â£500,000 in cash through their own bank accounts without paying tax. Claims were made for the fake journeys to the council which paid Gwynedd-based Express Motors and then claimed the money back from the Welsh Government under the all-Wales concessionary travel scheme. The jury was also told how one card was swiped after its owner had died. Eric Wyn Jones had claimed they had ""no need to fiddle"" but the jury rejected this. Judge Timothy Petts said: ""You have been found guilty of serious offences in relation to the fleecing of the local authority by submitting fraudulent claims, and conspiring to launder money from Express Motors. ""It's clear that there can only be one sentence for offending of this nature, and that is a custodial sentence."" The men, and a fifth defendant -  bus driver Rheinallt Williams, 44, who had already pleaded guilty, will be sentenced at a later date.

Fire chiefs' ÃÂ£1.9m 'cash not cuts' plea,"The level of risk is too high for major cuts, senior fire officers have said Fire chiefs in north Wales have asked local councils to plug a Â£1.9m budget hole to safeguard firefighters' jobs. They have dropped proposals to axe one of Wrexham's two fire engines and to downgrade or close other fire stations. North Wales Fire and Rescue Authority said it now felt ""the level of risk"" was too high for any major cuts. The worst-case scenario could have seen up to 52 firefighters and managers lose their jobs, according to the fire authority. Confirmation of the decision to seek more cash rather than make cuts came in a report presented to Anglesey council by chief fire officer Helen MacArthur. Fire cuts 'worst case scenario' scrapped 'Worrying' firefighter cuts proposed Fire cuts would 'force safety breaches' U-turn over plans to axe fire engine The report said the authority had ""not ruled out"" making savings. However, it would ""stop short of, for example, closing fire stations or making firefighters redundant"". Instead, the fire service has asked the region's six councils to provide Â£35.4m between them for 2019/20 - an increase of 5.7% on the 2018/19 figure of Â£33.5m . A protest was held in Wrexham in 2017 against a proposal to axe one of its two fire engines Councillor Ken Hughes said to Ms MacArthur: ""I think you're in a fortunate position compared to other authorities in terms of the savings you've had to make over the years... is there more that you can do?"" In response, Ms MacArthur said: ""We are always looking at our cost base and opportunities to keep it down,"" citing the idea of keeping fire engines in service longer. However, she added: ""We also need to be mindful that when we're called out that we're fit to respond as well, and we protect our firefighters as best we can.""

Bus boss 'had no need to fiddle fares',"A bus company boss has denied fraudulently using his over-60s pass to gain money for journeys which were never made. Cash was claimed from Gwynedd council for non-existent trips, with one card used 23,000 times, prosecutors said. Express Motors' Eric Wyn Jones, 77 and sons Ian Wyn Jones, 53, Kevin Wyn Jones, 54 and Keith Jones, 51, deny two frauds at Caernarfon Crown Court. The jury has retired to consider its verdict. Eric Wyn Jones of Bontnewydd, Caernarfon, denied fraudulently swiping cards, adding: ""We had no need to fiddle."" Express Motors: Firm 'claimed thousands for fake journeys' He said he lost a wallet containing his own concessionary fare card and denied ever using it to perform unexplained swipes or instructing staff to swipes cards. Barrister John Wyn Williams, for Kevin Jones, the firm's transport manager, told the jury the prosecution case was based on ""supposition and speculation"". Tens of thousands of fraudulent swipes were made with more than half a million pounds put through bank accounts without paying tax, the court has heard. The jury was also told how one card was swiped after its owner had died. Claims for the money were lodged with Gwynedd council which was then refunded through the Welsh Government's all-Wales concessionary travel scheme. Express Motors, formed in 1909, operates all over north west Wales and was taken over by Mr Jones in 1977.

Assault by ex 'could have been stopped',"This video can not be played I feel like I was let down by the police, says victim of domestic violence. A woman who was assaulted by her ex-husband has said she feels ""let down"" by officers who she says could have used an order to prevent the attack. She said he turned up at her home and verbally attacked her numerous times for four months before the assault. Since 2014, officers have been able to get a 28-day emergency protection order in cases of suspected abuse. But Welsh forces used them in 3% of 30,000 cases where arrests were made but no-one was charged. The woman, who does not want to be named, said: ""We were having to go our separate ways and yet there was no leaving this person at all. ""We used to joke that the only way out of this was if I was buried under the patio."" 'I felt like it was about being hit' Domestic violence: 'I was told to sleep in the outhouse' She believes because she lived in an affluent area, officers did not take her situation seriously. ""There were a number of interventions they could have actually been put in place before the behaviour ended in an assault and I felt really let down,"" she added. Following the assault, her ex-husband was jailed and a court imposed a restraining order - but she said Gwent Police could have acted a lot quicker. Officers are able to gain the protection order when they arrest someone, regardless of whether they are later charged, but have only used this power 970 times in 30,000 cases since 2014. Forces also reported 362 times when orders were breached. Welsh Women's Aid said the orders give women ""breathing space"", however it added that they are often breached because officers are ""slow to respond"" and may not take them seriously. ""These protection orders are only going to be as good as the support and protection that they give the survivor,"" said the charity's Gwendolyn Sterk. The charity has called for breaches to be made a criminal offence. Friends' calls to abuse hotline rise Domestic violence crimes up 23% in Wales Plan to tackle spike in domestic abuse A spokesman for the Gwent force said protection orders were ""an effective tool when dealing with some incidents"" and that it ""will continue to use this tactic when the circumstances are appropriate"". North Wales Police said it gives officers time to work with the victim, the abuser and support agencies to try to get to the root cause of the abuse. But Amanda Robinson, a professor of Criminology at Cardiff University, said austerity measures have limited their effectiveness. ""The timing of this is somewhat questionable in that there was an investment in powers on paper without so much investment in programmes and training of police officers to implement them,"" she said. ""And there wasn't investment to compliment the introduction of these new powers with the support in the community that victims and survivors need."" A Home Office spokesman said it is strengthening its response to the issue with a new draft bill. ""This included proposals for new domestic abuse protection notices and orders, including compulsory programmes to address a perpetrators' underlying attitudes or addictions, the use of electronic tagging to monitor their compliance with conditions, and a criminal sanction for breach,"" he added.

The black history you might not learn at school,"Black History Month is celebrated in the UK every October. As this year's celebration comes to a end, here are four lesser-known historical figures who helped shape multicultural Britain. Una Marson (centre) worked alongside George Orwell (standing) and TS Eliot (seated), who are pictured looking over her shoulder Poet, dramatist, and broadcaster Una Marson made history by becoming the first black woman to be employed by the BBC. Born in Jamaica, Marson moved to the UK in the early 1930s and took up her first position at the BBC as a programme assistant in March 1941. ""She was a real pioneer in giving voice to black women's experience, as well as generously creating a platform for other contemporary black voices,"" historian Robert Seatter says. At the BBC, Marson worked alongside writers TS Eliot and George Orwell before establishing her own weekly feature within the Calling the West Indies radio programme, called Caribbean Voices. She went on to become the first black producer at the BBC. ""This choice sparked resentment, but Marson was described as an extremely intelligent, loyal and lively person,""Prof James Procter, at Newcastle University, wrote in 2015,external. Robert Seatter says her ability to persevere despite prejudice highlights why ""she was a real trailblazer"" and should be remembered. Olive Morris died at the age of 27 but ""left behind an extraordinary legacy of activism"" Historian Angelina Osborne describes Olive Morris as a ""radical activist and campaigner"". Born in Jamaica in 1952, and having moved to south London at the age of nine, she became heavily involved in community politics at a young age. A picture of her taken in 1969 shows her face swollen, her clothes torn and dirty. On the back is written: ""Taken at Kings College Hospital... after the police had beaten me up."" ""Earlier that day,""Angelina Osborne writes,external, ""a Nigerian diplomat had parked his Mercedes on Atlantic Road in Brixton, leaving his wife and children in the car while he bought some records. ""Police officers, thinking the diplomat had stolen the car began to, according to witnesses, arrest him and beat him. ""Olive came forward and physically tried to stop the police from attacking the diplomat, causing the police to turn on her, arrest her and assault her, kicking her in the chest. ""This young girl, barely 5ft 2in, took on racist police officers, without thinking about her own safety, because she couldn't stand by and allow the injustice of an African man being arrested for driving a nice car. ""This was one early incident of Olive's commitment to challenging oppression."" Morris went on to co-found the Organisation of Women of Asian and African Descent (OWAAD) and the Brixton Black Women's Group, which were among the first in the UK to address issues affecting women from ethnic minorities. ""Olive was committed to the struggle against racial, sexual and class oppression,"" Angelina Osborne says. She died at the age of 27 but ""left behind an extraordinary legacy of activism"". Frank Bailey joined the West Ham Fire Brigade in 1955 When Frank Bailey was told by a Fire Brigades Union (FBU) delegate that ""black people were not employed by the fire service"" because they were ""not educated or strong enough"", he decided to apply. He successfully joined the West Ham Fire Brigade in 1955, becoming one of the first full-time black firefighters in the country. However, Mr Bailey, who had moved to London from Guyana in 1953, left the service 10 years later. His decision, according to Michael Nicholas, former FBU national secretary for black and ethnic minority members, was due to ""inherent prejudice and racism"" as white firefighters had been promoted ahead of him. ""Frank was inspirational, as thoughts of black people at the time were very negative. Every day he had to consistently break down barriers,"" Mr Nicholas says. ""Everything he did was underpinned by his drive for equality."" After leaving the fire service, Mr Bailey went on to become the first black psychiatric social worker in London. His daughter, Alexis, describes her late father as ""inspirational"". ""He went through so much and never stopped fighting for equal rights. He never gave up and that really inspired me,"" she says. The year before he died, Laurie Cunningham helped Wimbledon beat Liverpool in the FA Cup Final Described as ""one of the best players of the era"", Laurie Cunningham was a leading personality on and off the football pitch during the 1970s and 1980s. Born in London, the left winger began his professional career at Leyton Orient in 1974. In 1977, he joined West Bromwich Albion and then became one of the first black players to represent England at any level, scoring on his debut for the under-21s, against Scotland. Cunningham made his full international debut in 1979 and went on to earn six caps for England. In the summer of 1979, at the age of 22, he became the first British player to transfer to Real Madrid, who paid West Bromwich Albion a fee of Â£950,000. ""Laurie was one of the best players around at the time,"" former England striker Les Ferdinand says. ""In the past, black players were not getting opportunities to play for England - but Laurie broke down that barrier. He was so good that he couldn't be ignored."" Ferdinand says Cunningham, who died in a car crash in 1989, helped ""pave the way"" for black footballers. ""He made me believe I could be a footballer. ""He took a lot of stick that black players coming through now don't have to take. ""The black players took the brunt of it - such as bananas being thrown on the pitch and monkey chants."" Cunningham's career was a breakthrough in British football but Ferdinand adds: ""We still need to break down barriers off the playing field, in terms of the boardroom, management, and coaching.""

'Tremendous' impact of school closures,"The council has said it wants schools of the correct size and in the correct locations led by inspiring head teachers The closure of as many as 17 rural schools in Anglesey will have a ""tremendous"" impact on the communities, a campaigner has said. Anglesey council had previouslysuggested that shutting schools with fewer than 120 pupils could help it achieve Â£9m of savingsin three years. But a petition against the move has gathered more than 5,000 signatures and could now be debated in the Senedd. Anglesey council said it was ""no longer possible to safeguard education"". Islwyn Humphreys, who has been fighting to save Talwrn primary school on Anglesey, said the impact would be felt for years to come. ""It is going to have a tremendous effect on general life, and I have no doubt that the Welsh language will suffer,"" he said. Rhun ap Iorwerth has questioned whether councils are adhering to new Welsh Government rules In August, Anglesey AM Rhun ap Iorwerth accepted a petition from Llangefni primary school Bodffordd's parent-teacher association after the council approved plans to shut the village school. The council plans to move the school's pupils to a new 360-place 'super school' which will be shared with the town's Ysgol Corn Hir. But following a meeting of the Welsh assembly's petitions committee in Cardiff Bay on Tuesday, members asked for a full debate on the issue. Campaigners against school closures had hoped scheduled changes to the Welsh Government's school organisation code,which will allow councils to close smaller rural school only as a ""last resort"", would come to their rescue. The issue of school closures was brought to the fore after 5,000 people signed a petition against the closure of Bodffordd primary school Cymdeithas yr Iaith,external, which said it was ""dismayed"" at the council's plans, and other campaigners have consistently argued against rural school closures, citing the impact on the Welsh language and community life. Mr ap Iorwerth questioned whether the Welsh Government's changes are ""anything more than words without the resources to support it"". ""I'm very pleased that the Petitions Committee decided to ask for this petition and this important matter to be discussed at a full meeting of the National Assembly,"" he said. ""There are a number of key issues that need to be explored when it comes to the Assembly floor, not least what the petitioners asked for; whether Welsh Government is ensuring that local authorities the length and breadth of Wales are keeping to the code."" An Anglesey council spokesperson said: ""We are continuing to comply with the current school organisation code. ""However, with significant cuts to local authority budgets, it is unfortunately no longer possible to safeguard education. ""The recent decisions to close a number of Anglesey primary schools were extremely difficult decisions, but we are confident that they were based on robust evidence and will benefit the county's education system as a whole.""

Dozens fined for driving wrong way on M11,"Essex Police is contacting 86 motorists who were caught driving the wrong way on the M11 Dozens of motorists who drove the wrong way on the M11 to escape being held up by an accident are facing fines and points on their driving licence. Eighty-six drivers turned around following a crash involving six vehicles near Harlow on 27 October. Following the incident, phone and dashcam footage was sent to police via Safer Essex Road Partnerships' Extra Eyes campaign. Essex Police said there were ""no excuses"" for driving the wrong way. The M11 was closed for around 25 minutes following the crash, which took place at around 13:10 BST. No one was seriously injured. Adam Pipe, head of roads policing at Essex Police, said all the ""impatient"" drivers will now face fines of Â£100 and three points on their driving licence. ""Turning around on a road and driving in the other direction is clearly dangerous,"" he said. Mr Pipe added: ""You wouldn't do it in a moving traffic and it's no different to turning around following a road closure.

Was Robert the Bruce born in Essex?,"The statue of Robert the Bruce, near the site of the Battle of Bannockburn The man who defeated the English at the Battle of Bannockburn was born in Essex - a new historical account claims. Historian Dr Fiona Watson believes Robert the Bruce was from a village near Chelmsford, called Writtle. As part of her self-published work, she said there was no evidence that he was born at his mother's castle at Turnberry, in Ayrshire. Dr Watson outlines a ruthlessly ambitious man who would stop at nothing to become king of Scotland. In the first of her trilogy, titled ""Traitor, Outlaw, King"", the former Stirling University academic said that Bruce's family owned land in Essex, and quotes a chronicler from the 14th century saying he belonged to ""the English nation"". Dr Watson told BBC Scotland: ""There is no direct evidence he was born in Turnberry. More recently, it was presumed Bruce would have been born at Turnberry, but the evidence points to Writtle."" Robert the Bruce's link to London Robert the Bruce Battle of Bannockburn letter discovered Work begins to restore Bruce statue at Bannockburn She said it was the custom at the time to send young nobleman to be fostered with other noble families, and thinks he could have been sent to Ireland or the west of Scotland, where some of his opinions may have been formed. The St Andrews and Glasgow university graduate added: ""His heart was clearly in Scotland. He wanted to get his family lands back, which had been lost because Bruce and his father had not pledged fealty [loyalty] to the former king John Balliol. ""He would use anything and everything to win."" Dr Watson also said the killing of John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, at the hands of Robert the Bruce in 1306, was a political assassination. ""It's like Game of Thrones,"" she explained. ""He knew John Comyn would stand in his way on the path to the throne of Scotland, and so he took him out."" Netflix has a new film adaptation of the story of Robert the Bruce, starring Chris Pine Robert the Brucewas born in July 1274. He was crowned as King of Scots at Scone Palace in 1306, and died at the Manor of Cardross in Dunbartonshire in 1329. His body is buried at Dunfermline Abbey, but his heart is buried at Melrose Abbey. The battle on which Scotland's national anthem Flower of Scotland is based,Bannockburn, occurred in 1314. An army under Bruce defeated a far larger army, which was led by Edward II.

Police 'big city' homicide figures error,"Police and crime commissioner Arfon Jones said the figures ""cannot possibly be right"" A police force mistakenly reported 22 homicides in its area over three months when there had only been one. The error by North Wales Police was spotted by staff working for police and crime commissioner Arfon Jones, who described them as ""big city figures"". The force said the ""one-off"" error occurred in April 2018 after an IT upgrade and was corrected in May. By then, the figures had already been sent to the Home Office and published by the Office for National Statistics. Crime on the rise, police stats show Reality Check: Are England and Wales experiencing a crime wave? Police funding changes delayed by error Homicide covers murder, manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and infanticide, but not terror attacks. The incorrect listing of 22 homicides for the fourth quarter of 2017 had confused officers scrutinising the work of North Wales Police. Mr Jones told a police and crime panel in Conwy the figures ""cannot possibly be right - these are big city figures"". ""When we saw this, we challenged this and, sure enough, this information is wrong,"" he said. Official figures show that in the year to March 2017 there were eight homicides in north Wales, and in the year to March 2016 just three. Arfon Jones said people needed to have ""confidence in the integrity"" of police statistics The force admitted other mistakes after the change of system - however, these appeared internally and were not published. They included violence and sexual offences being recorded wrongly. The new computer system also wrongly recorded 147 homicides from 2013 to 2018 when there had been 33. A force spokesman said its IT crime systems were upgraded on 7 March, which changed the format of reference numbers. As a result, some legacy crimes - those from previous years - had been mistakenly counted again as new crimes. Police 'failing' on crime recording Hate crime 'drastically under-reported' Supt Sharon McCairn apologised, adding: ""Our figures for the year to March 2018 inadvertently contained legacy crimes, which had previously been excluded, and this happened while we were upgrading our record management systems. ""As soon as the error was noted in May 2018, the correct data was provided to the Home Office."" She said it was a ""one-off mistake"" and internal processes had been re-examined to make sure the error would not happen again. The Home Office will publish the correct homicide figures for the start of 2018 in October. Mr Jones said: ""My staff discovered the problem in the last few weeks as part of my scrutiny of the force. ""It is vitally important that we can have confidence in the integrity of information they produce.""

Carole King pens anti-Trump song,"Carole King has come out of retirement to write an anti-Trump song. The songwriter's first new music in seven years is a reworked version of her 1977 track, One. The song features a new final verse, which King told the Guardian is ""a call to action,external"" ahead of the mid-term elections in the US. The 76-year-old initially rewrote the song to play at a political fundraiser last month, but then recorded the new version to ""empower people"".

The song is slightly shorter than the original, which appeared on her album Simple Things. The new third verse features lyrics speaking to prospective political candidates: ""What will we do?/We're gonna run/reach for the sun/come together as one/show 'em how it's done/at the end of the day, we'll be able to say/love won."" The song also features King's daughters Louise Goffin and Sherry Kondor on backing vocals to enhance the line ""We are one"" with more voices. King said of the song: ""I see it as empowering people who feel hopeless to do whatever they can as one person. If nothing else, they can vote for Democrats and change the climate of our country."" Streisand's new album Walls is inspired by Donald Trump's presidency The songwriter isn't the first to come out of retirement to write an anti-Trump song.

'Halloween is Christmas for us amputees',"April uses Halloween to highlight and celebrate her disability For some with physical disabilities Halloween has become an opportunity to embrace their bodies and celebrate difference. A number of people are sharing photographs of their creative costumes which highlight and incorporate their disability. April, from Chicago, US, shared a photo of herself dressed up with the caption ""Halloween is Christmas for us amputees"", an image that has been up-voted more than 115,000 times on Reddit. April told the BBC that she wanted to ""share some portion of my experience"" to help others with disabilities see their bodies more positively. April dressed in a similar way last year, and says she learned her make up skills from online tutorials And she said she has been delighted that others have shared their own examples. One Reddit user wrote:  ""I'm missing half my right leg. Halloween two years ago I would lay on the floor in front of the front door in a pool of fake blood and my girlfriend would answer trick or treaters with blood on her shirt and a fake meat cleaver. Reactions were priceless."" Another said: ""My mum is a double amputee and when older trick or treaters come she has me pull her prosthetic arm off and run around with it."" April said that she has reached a ""peaceful medium"" where she has accepted her body and wants to ""find every way to take advantage of it"". While many people applauded her creativity and attitude, some pointed out that those with disabilities face real barriers which cannot be overcome with positivity alone. One Reddit user wrote: ""A plucky attitude is not going to make up for a lack of wheelchair ramps. It's true that a defeatist attitude can be your undoing, but there are legitimate limitations and challenges that don't care whether or not you 'let them be'"". Former Paralympian Josh Sundquist describes himself as a ""Halloween enthusiast"" and has created a number of amazing costumes which celebrate his physique.

School closures could help balance books,"Leisure centres and arts centre Oriel Ynys Mon could be handed over to external operators to run Almost 30 schools could be closed and people face a hike in council tax on Anglesey as the local authority tries to balance its books. A meeting on Monday will look at options including closing schools with fewer than 120 pupils. Raising council tax by more than 5% - breaching the Welsh Government's informal cap - is also being discussed. With a budget of Â£130m, the council warned ""difficult and unpopular decisions"" will need to be made. Figures published by the councilshowed there were 29 schools with fewer than 120 pupils,externalin September 2017. Sports park 'vital' against anti-social behaviour Council to sell golf course Holyhead leisure centre and others on the island could be handed over to external operators - a move that saved neighbouring Gwynedd council Â£585,000 a year Leisure centres and arts centre Oriel Ynys Mon could be handed over to external operators, while sixth form provision at secondary schools will come under the microscope. Small schools would also face the threat of having to merge. The authority overspent its budget by Â£1.744m in 2017-18 and it has seen its funding fall by 18% since 2010. There is another cut of 1% expected next year, meaning it has to shave Â£9.34m off its budget over three years. ""Even if the Welsh Government releases additional funds for local government, it is unlikely that any increase will be sufficient to bridge the funding gap,"" the report said. Children's services alone is forecast to finish this year Â£1.28m in the red after an overspend of Â£1.78m last year.

Frustration over murder investigations,"Nicholas Churton had been found dead at his home in Wrexham in March 2017 The murder of a disabled man by a released prisoner should be reviewed by an independent inquiry, an MP said. Jordan Davidson, of Wrexham, is serving 30 years in prison for killing Nicholas Churton, 67, with a machete and hammer. While it happened in March 2017, Wrexham's MP Ian Lucas said he has ""grown frustrated"" with the pace of two separate Independent Office of Police Conduct investigations. An IOPC spokeswoman said it would update Mr Lucas in the coming weeks. The investigations are looking at contact between Mr Churton and police in the days before he died. It is also assessing the police and probation service's contact with Davidson after he was released from prison. ""I want answers from the police and probation service but, so far, I simply haven't received any,"" Mr Lucas said. Second probe into police after Nicholas Churton killing 23 years for murderer Jordan Davidson Victim failed by system, MP claims ""Basic facts are not being made clear to me or the public, and the north Wales police and crime commissioner is doing nothing to hold the police to account on the matter. ""The murder of Mr Churton took place 16 months ago yet I'm still in the dark about how a dangerous criminal such as Jordan Davidson was not sent back to prison, leaving him free to commit this terrible crime."" As well as admitting murder, Davidson, who was on licence, also pleaded guilty to other charges including two burglaries, a robbery, an attempted robbery, attempted grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm on police officers. Jordan Davidson was initially sentenced to a minimum term of 23 years, but this was increased to 30 The court heard most of the crimes were committed in the days around the murder and were attacks on older men. He was out on licence living near Mr Churton when the offences happened. Davidson had a long list of previous convictions but despite this, was bailed after being arrested for possession of a knife days before the murder. Mr Lucas wants to to know why the defendant was not sent immediately back to prison. He has written to prisons minister Rory Stewart calling for an independent review, saying he is frustrated with the IOPC investigations. ""I want to be sure measures have been put in place by the police and probation service to ensure something like this cannot happen again,"" he added. ""Mr Churton's family have a right to known what went wrong, and so do my constituents. ""I feel we need an independent inquiry into this case where the full findings are presented to the public - it is the only way to get the answers I am looking for."" Mr Churton, who lived alone, was found dead in his living room by a friend Mr Lucas secured a Westminster debate on the case in June. Home Officer minister Victoria Atkins told him improvements were being made after ""significant failings"" were identified in a review by the Wales Community Rehabilitation Company. The full findings, however, have not been made public. IOPC Director for Wales Catrin Evans said: ""We are committed to carrying out two thorough investigations into North Wales Police actions in relation to the murder of Nicholas Churton. ""Our first investigation into contact with Mr Churton prior to his death is nearing completion and our second investigation, which began in May, looking at the prior arrests of Jordan Davidson is ongoing. ""It is our role to investigate police actions and decision-making and we do not have any remit over the Probation Service."" Arfon Jones, the North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner, said: ""Mr Lucas knows full well there is an investigation under way by the IOPC and it would be wholly inappropriate to discuss the matter before the investigation is concluded.""

Child abuse image offences 'on rise',"Police forces in Wales recorded almost four child abuse images offences a day in the past two years, new figures show. A Freedom of Information Request shows 2,895 of the sex crimes have been logged in Wales since April 2016. NSPCC Cymru said social media was mostly to blame and an independent regulator was needed. The UK Government said it takes the issue very seriously and is considering new laws. Earlier this year, child protection experts expressed alarm following a15% increase in grooming in Wales. According to the latest figures, released by the NSPCC, South Wales, North Wales and Gwent police forces all saw increases in the number of offences in the past year. The largest rise was recorded by North Wales Police - up 30% from 287 in 2016/2017 to 373 in 2017/2018. And the largest number of offences recorded was by South Wales Police, with 528 and 543 crimes in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 respectively. Dyfed-Powys Police was the only Welsh force to log a drop in the number of offences - down from 363 in 2016/2017 to 275 in 2017/2018. In Wales, the most common offence related to taking, making or distributing indecent images - accounting for nearly two-thirds of all activity. The charity said a single offence recorded by police can involve hundreds of indecent images of children. Des Mannion, head of the NSPCC Cymru, added: ""Every one of these images represents a real child who has been groomed and abused to supply the demand of this appalling trade. ""The lack of adequate protections on social networks has given offenders all too easy access to children to target and abuse. ""We are calling on the UK Government to introduce a tough independent regulator to hold social networks to account and tackle grooming to cut off supply of these images at source."" Child sex offences rise 'concerning' Ministers 'too late' on child online safety UK crime minister Victoria Atkins said the scale of online child sexual exploitation was a ""stain on our world"". ""The home secretary has made five unequivocal demands of web giants to remove child sexual abuse content from their platforms, including stopping grooming and shutting down live-streaming,"" she said. ""He expects immediate action and how far we legislate will be informed by the action and attitude taken by the technology industry.""

Ancient gilded statue stolen from church,"A 252-year-old statue of a pelican has been stolen from a church. The ancient wood carving, which dates from 1766, has hung in St Dyfnog Church in Llanrhaeadr, Denbighshire, for more than a century. However the 2ft (0.6m) gilded statue was stolen at some point between 22 August and 5 September. Vicar of St Dyfnog, the Reverend Val Rowlands, said: ""The church community is saddened to learn the carved wooden pelican is missing."" There has been a church on site since the 6th Century The pelican statue could previously be seen mounted to the right of the Jesse window The gilded pelican was copied from the bird that appears in a panel of the church's famous Jesse window, that was completed in 1533. Mrs Rowlands added: ""In Christian art, the image of a pelican feeding her young from her own blood, symbolises the sacrifice Christ made by dying on the cross. ""We hope the carving will be returned soon so the local community, as well as the many visitors and pilgrims to the church, can once again appreciate its importance, beauty and significance to St Dyfnog's.""

Birth device 'may save thousands of lives',"Babies that need to be resuscitated are being saved by the device Hundreds of thousands of babies' lives could be saved each year in developing countries thanks to a device made in Gwynedd. The BabySaver, developed by Professor Andrew Weeks, is able to resuscitate babies at birth without having to separate them from their mothers. The prototypes have been made by a team at Bryn Y Neuadd Hospital in Gwynedd. ""We believe it will be a game-changer for families in Uganda, and hopefully further afield,"" Mr Weeks said. Welsh workers build new eco-maternity unit in Uganda Stillbirth mum's 'traumatic' five-hour ambulance wait The device contains equipment like a suction device and stethoscope, which can be placed between a mother's legs enabling the umbilical cord to remain intact while doctors treat her baby. Many hospitals across the UK use a similar device, also developed by Mr Weeks, called the LifeStart trolley, but they can cost more than Â£10,000 and require electricity. In comparison, the BabySaver costs Â£40 to produce and does not need electricity to work. The device contains equipment like a suction device and stethoscope Mr Weeks, who works at Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Liverpool, made the device with the help of the rehabilitation engineering team at Bryn Y Neuadd Hospital. ""Each year approximately six million babies across the world require basic neonatal resuscitation and around 900,000 of these will die,"" he said. ""The vast majority of deaths occur in low-income settings where there are few facilities for newborn resuscitation at birth. Five women, five countries, five babies 'We'll never know if our son had a chance' ""Where resuscitation does occur, it often happens away from the mother - or even in another room, which can be very distressing for the mother and baby. ""The BabySaver enables resuscitation to take place at the bedside, with the umbilical cord still attached. ""Allowing the cord to stay intact has huge health benefits for newborn babies but it also allows the midwife to stay with the mother at a high risk time for her."" The team at Bryn Y Neuadd Hospital in Gwynedd worked on a prototype device The prototype was officially launched in Uganda last month, with the full backing of the Uganda's Ministry of Health. Testing of the product will now take place to refine it further.

New chief pledges help to vulnerable,"Protecting vulnerable people, such as victims of domestic abuse, is a key priority for the new North Wales Police chief constable. Carl Foulkes, a deputy at Merseyside Police, takes up the role in November. He said the murder of a woman and her two daughters in the West Midlands in 2003 had focused his efforts on tackling domestic abuse. After serving in the Royal Navy, he worked for the British Transport Police before joining the West Midlands force. His appointment was confirmed on Monday by the North Wales Police and Crime Panel. Mr Foulkes, 47, is originally from Caergwrle, near Wrexham, but his family moved away when he was young. Police boss makes last arrest with son Mr Foulkes was involved in a murder investigation following the death of 25-year-old woman and her young daughters. The man accused of killing them was later found hanged in prison. ""When you see something like that in such a young family that had everything going for them, you realise that we need to do something different for the future,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be having those incidents."" He has also pledged to tackle serious and organised crime, particularly so-called County Lines cases where gangs from cities such as Liverpool and Manchester ""seek new territories for their drug dealing networks"".

"Child arrests fall by nearly 10,000","Efforts have been made to keep children out of the criminal system to reduce future crime Child arrests have reduced by almost 10,000 between 2010 and 2017 in Wales, official figures have shown. The Howard League for Penal Reform research showed while 13,889 children were arrested in 2010, this dropped to 3,948 last year, a fall of 72%. The biggest drop, of 85% from 2,307 to 341, was in the Dyfed-Powys force area, followed by 70% in both Gwent and North Wales and 68% in the South Wales area. The charity said efforts were made to keep children out of the system. Across Wales and England, the total number of child arrests has been reduced by 68% - from almost 250,000 in 2010 to 79,012 last year. The Howard League programme, which began in 2010, involves working with police to avoid criminalisation of children particularly in residential care, those who are exploited by gangs and those from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. It said research has shown the more contact a child has with the system, the more entrenched they are likely to become - which increases offending rates. The number of children in prison in Wales and England was reduced by more than 60% between 2010 and 2017. ""It is a phenomenal achievement by the police and the Howard League,"" said Frances Crook, chief executive of the charity. ""It means that tens of thousands of children will have a brighter future without their life chances being blighted by unnecessary police contact and criminal records. ""We have come a long way, but there is still more work to do."" The charity also praised South Wales Police's ""impressive"" 27 per cent reduction in child arrests between 2016 and 2017.

Divisive nuclear pylon plan a step closer,"This video can not be played Richard Foxhall of Horizon said Anglesey has the experience to deal with nuclear power Controversial plans to build a second line of pylons across Anglesey linking to a new nuclear power station has moved a step closer. The National Grid has applied to the Planning Inspectorate for permission to build them over the island. Anglesey council wants the cables to be underground, with one councillor saying legal action could be considered. Lines would carry power from the proposed Wylfa Newydd reactor to homes and businesses across the UK. It is hoped the Â£12bn plant will be operational by 2020, running for about 60 years and generating enough electricity to power five million houses. However, the move to build a second line of cables has been strongly opposed by councillors who claim it could affect tourism on the island. Wylfa Newydd nuclear power plant negotiations start UK Government 'to finance' Wylfa Newydd nuclear plant Archaeological dig ahead of nuclear station build While the company behind the new facility, Horizon Nuclear Power, is still possibly 18 months away from getting the final go-ahead to build, ithas permission to start clearing the siteready for the work to start. The National Grid said it had made changes to its application based on feedback from locals and it wanted to place a second line of pylons close to the existing line with a tunnel to carry power under the Menai Strait and on to the mainland in Gwynedd. Councillor Carwyn Jones, Anglesey council's portfolio holder for major developments, said: ""The technology is there to go subsea, to go underground, but, no, they will not listen to the people of Anglesey. ""We could well take this to the highest level of legal testing,"" he said, referring to theWell-being of Future Generations Act, a law created to protect the nation's future. ""They have put pylons and profit ahead of local view and opinion and it's extremely disappointing."" Wylfa Newydd would operate for 60 years if a permit is granted for its operation Gareth Williams of the National Grid said: ""We recognise that we have not been able to do everything we have been asked. ""But we believe our proposals offer the best balance of everything we must consider and mean there are no long-term effects for most areas of Anglesey and north Gwynedd. ""Our application is an important step in unlocking many millions of pounds of local investment and around 9,000 construction jobs that the power station will create."" The changes include selecting a route corridor in the centre of Anglesey that avoids building near the coast and avoiding larger towns and villages. During its consultation, it received 5,000 pieces of feedback. The power station would be built on the site of the original Wylfa Nuclear power station which was decommissioned in 2015 After a meeting in December 2016, Anglesey councillors unanimously urged the National Grid to put ""people before pylons"". Councillors argued that scrapping the current plan was the only way to protect tourism - worth Â£280m to the economy - and avoid ""severe social and environmental impacts"" on communities. Council leader Ieuan Williams said the plans for more pylons ""threatens to break the economic backbone of Anglesey - tourism"".

End for 'world's most unique festival'?,"It is the seventh Festival No.6 - but will it be the last? 'Be seeing you' - the catchphrase that will be on the lips of thousands of visitors at a unique festival inspired by the cult 1960s TV show The Prisoner. But when indie rockers Franz Ferdinand take to the stage on Sunday - it will be the end of Festival No. 6 - for now. Despite a hatful of awards, the festival at Portmeirion in Gwynedd has outgrown its surrounding - and sometimes struggled financially. Organisers have said it is no longer sustainable in its current format. Described by the Independent newspaper as ""the most bijou location of any music event"" Festival No. 6 has been attracting about 13,000 visitors since it was first held in 2012. Festival No. 6's home - Portmeirion - was also where The Prisoner was filmed The festival's home was the Italianate village that was the stunning backdrop for Patrick McGoohan's famous role of trapped former spy Number Six in The Prisoner. Over the years it has hosted the likes of New Order, Noel Gallagher, Beck and Mark Ronson - as well as showcasing the latest emerging Welsh talent. The Pet Shop Boys described their appearance as ""undoubtedly a career highlight"". Festival No 6 in pictures Festival No.6 flood plain car park decision defended Festival No.6: Inquiry call after hundreds stranded It led to awards from the festival industry and music magazines such as NME, including title of best new festival in 2012, best small festival in 2013 and 2015 and best line-up for 2014. The festival is held against the backdrop of the gorgeous Dwyrd Estuary near Porthmadog But while the festival won plaudits, it has also gained headlines for the wrong reasons, withhundreds of people left stranded after heavy downpoursflooded a park-and-ride facility in 2016. Organisers later defended the decision to place cars on a known flood plain, with some vehicles stuck there for days. The rain-drenched event in 2016 certainly proved to be costly. Accounts posted at Companies House in March 2017,externalshow that despite a turnover of almost Â£3.75m - the festival lost Â£103,000 that year. The figures also revealed liabilities of Â£1.13m, with the company behind the festival effectively taken over by Global Media and Entertainment - whose parent company runs the radio stations Capital, Heart, Classic FM, Radio X and LBC, as well as a string of other high-profile festivals. Cara were left stranded at a park and ride site in Porthmadog in 2016 Describingthe decision to put it on holdafter 2018, they said it was ""more than just a music and arts festival"". ""In six short years, the profile of the festival has far outgrown its intimate capacity, picking up numerous awards, gaining international recognition and becoming one of the world's most unique festivals,"" organisers said in a statement. ""We always knew we had something special but we never quite expected it to capture people's imagination the way it has. ""Unfortunately, No. 6 is just not sustainable in its current format and so we've made the difficult decision to take a breather - 2018 will be the last Festival No.6 for now."" However, it added: ""Taking a break is the right decision but not all is lost, we're already thinking about the future."" There has been speculation that it could return in 2020, but in a different format. A festival-goer enjoys the view - about 13,000 visitors are expected this year Gwynedd council, which has backed the festival since it was established in 2012, said it ""understood the decision"" not to hold the event in 2019 ""so that they can look at the event structures and hopefully return with an even stronger offer in 2020"". The council's economic development cabinet member, Ioan Thomas added: ""Gwynedd has established a reputation as a fantastic location for cultural events and large scale outdoor activities over recent years with Festival No. 6 being an important part of this success story. ""As a council, we look forward to discussing future opportunities to work with the Festival No. 6 organisers regarding this award-winning festival and hope to be able to continue our partnership and welcome back the event from 2020 onwards."" The festival has always drawn on the links to the cult TV show The Prisoner which was shot at Portmeirion - attracting fans back in the very first event in 2012 For this year's event, park and ride facilities are at Llwyn Mafon Uchaf, Criccieth, which is outside Porthmadog and off the A487. To deal with the the volume of traffic, diversions will be in place on a stretch of the road between Criccieth and Penrhyndeudraeth, with access for residents only. The A497 between Porthmadog and near Minffordd station will also be closed to vehicles from 22:00 BST to 04:00 each night, while there will be a shuttle bus from Bangor station to the site. Park & Ride map for Festival No. 6 Analysis by Huw Thomas, BBC Wales arts and media correspondent For all its chic appeal and near effortless charm, Festival No. 6 fought hard to conquer the inhospitable terrain of the Italianate village and succumbed only occasionally to the worst of the Welsh weather. But maintaining the appeal of a boutique event in a competitive festivals market has proved an annual challenge. The organisers' concerns about its sustainability reflect the pressure to maintain the allure of No. 6, and why a rest is required to assess the next steps. Any decision to return to Portmeirion lies with the festival's owners. But its commitment to supporting Welsh bands will be missed, as will its broader programme of cultural debates and fine dining that accompanied its main stage headline bands. While Wales hosts many festivals, No. 6 was one of very few to achieve UK and international recognition, and it will be missed if its organisers decide to pack up for good.

Aftershave lie police officer sacked,"Senior officers said Mohammed Lachiri had been in the police force for 17 years A police officer who gave false details to a security guard after being accused of stealing of a bottle of aftershave has been sacked. Mohammed Lachiri denied he was an officer when he was confronted by security staff at Debenhams in Llandudno in December 2016. He was found not guilty of theft at Caernarfon Crown Court in July 2017. But a North Wales Police tribunal ruled that allegations of gross misconduct had been proven. Speaking after the ruling on Thursday, Det Supt Dan Tipton said: ""The behaviour of this officer contradicts the high standards and values expected."" The tribunal heard Mr Lachiri was confronted by Debenhams security staff after walking out of the store with a Â£72 bottle of Giorgio Armani aftershave. He signed an exclusion order by the store, giving his name as Mohammed Rachiri. Mr Lachiri also gave a false date of birth and address, as well as denying he was a police officer. The hearing took place at North Wales Police's headquarters in Colwyn Bay The hearing was told that Mr Lachiri said he walked out of the store due to absent-mindedness caused by stress. David Toal, representing Mr Lachiri, urged the disciplinary panel to show ""a degree of compassion and understanding"". But the panel found that he had breached the standards of professional behaviour and would be dismissed without notice. Following the hearing, Det Supt Tipton said losing a colleague in such a way was saddening. He added: ""The majority of our officers and staff uphold the highest standards and provide an exceptional service to local communities who quite rightly have high expectations of the police.""

Â£671m 'growth deal' decision awaited,"A planned new nuclear power plant at site of former Trawsfynydd could unlock extra investment A deal aimed at creating almost 5,500 jobs in north Wales could be at an end if it does not get the backing of the UK government in this month's Budget. That is according to the body driving the Â£671m bid, the North Wales Economic Ambition Board (NWEAB). The UK government said ""more work needs to be done"" on the North Wales Growth Deal but it ""remains committed"". The NWEAB and employers' group, North Wales Mersey Dee Business Council, said they were ""confident"" about the Budget. The North Wales Growth Deal would bring Â£671m of investment to the region. Half of it would come jointly from the UK and Welsh governments, with Â£219m from organisations such as universities and colleges. Businesses are being expected to put in Â£109m upfront as part of the agreement. However, it is argued that the private sector would invest Â£3.1bn in the long-term as a direct result of the growth deal. North Wales growth deal: Call to make the right connections 2018: No 'same old, same old' north Wales growth deal, says minister 2017: North Wales' deprived areas 'need support' in growth deal 2016: New 'growth deal' for north Wales is gaining momentum The majority of that would come from the development of a newsmall nuclear plant at Trawsfynyddin Gwynedd, if that energy project was given the go ahead. The growth deal is aimed at improving what the region has to offer in a number of areas, including land and property, energy, skills, transport and adventure tourism as well as digital connectivity and technology. Property shortages across north Wales have led to concerns that businesses are being held back from growing and creating more jobs. Apra Ames Roberts (left): 'We have a lot of people who depend on us to get this right' Crazy Ladies Costumes in Wrexham is owned by Apra Ames Roberts and Diane Hughes and has been trading since 2003. It sells its goods all over the world but its building is about to be demolished and it is struggling to find suitable alternative premises for its 18 staff. ""It's so hard and I am getting so despairing,"" Ms Roberts said. ""We have a very viable business. We have a lot of people who depend on us to get this right."" She added there needed to be more properties built and better business support to allow small companies like hers to continue to grow. A total of Â£124m from the public and private sector would be spent on improving the availability of land and property as part of the Growth Deal. Dyfrig Siencyn, deputy chairman of the North Wales Economic Ambition Board, suggested it would be a huge problem if the deal did not get UK government backing in the Budget. ""They want it to succeed. They've worked with us for the last 12 months and more in challenging the projects we have here. We've had real hard challenges from them,"" he said. ""By this point, we're confident that we have a range of projects that are suitable for north Wales and that they have a strong basis and support from the private sector. ""And from our recent discussions with the ministers there is no indication of any negativity at this time."" Dyfrig Siencyn: 'From our recent discussions with the ministers there is no indication of any negativity' A UK government spokesperson said: ""It is clear that leaders across the region have re-energised their determination to make a strong case for investment in key sectors. ""A proposal underwritten by local expertise and real-world knowledge is exactly what will take the North Wales Growth Deal to the next stage. ""While more work needs to be done, we are continuing to work with the innovators and shapers throughout the region, to support them in making this deal a success and deliver better outcomes for north Wales."" The North Wales Economic Ambition Board expects 5,408 jobs to be directly created as a result of the growth deal. Growth deal: More than froth and bubbles?

Fire chiefs' Â£1.9m 'cash not cuts' plea,"The level of risk is too high for major cuts, senior fire officers have said Fire chiefs in north Wales have asked local councils to plug a Â£1.9m budget hole to safeguard firefighters' jobs. They have dropped proposals to axe one of Wrexham's two fire engines and to downgrade or close other fire stations. North Wales Fire and Rescue Authority said it now felt ""the level of risk"" was too high for any major cuts. The worst-case scenario could have seen up to 52 firefighters and managers lose their jobs, according to the fire authority. Confirmation of the decision to seek more cash rather than make cuts came in a report presented to Anglesey council by chief fire officer Helen MacArthur. Fire cuts 'worst case scenario' scrapped 'Worrying' firefighter cuts proposed Fire cuts would 'force safety breaches' U-turn over plans to axe fire engine The report said the authority had ""not ruled out"" making savings. However, it would ""stop short of, for example, closing fire stations or making firefighters redundant"". Instead, the fire service has asked the region's six councils to provide Â£35.4m between them for 2019/20 - an increase of 5.7% on the 2018/19 figure of Â£33.5m . A protest was held in Wrexham in 2017 against a proposal to axe one of its two fire engines Councillor Ken Hughes said to Ms MacArthur: ""I think you're in a fortunate position compared to other authorities in terms of the savings you've had to make over the years... is there more that you can do?"" In response, Ms MacArthur said: ""We are always looking at our cost base and opportunities to keep it down,"" citing the idea of keeping fire engines in service longer. However, she added: ""We also need to be mindful that when we're called out that we're fit to respond as well, and we protect our firefighters as best we can.""

China operates a ""one country, two system"" agreement, with freedom of speech and press freedom among the key liberties that set Hong Kong apart from the mainland. In 2014 protests calling for fully democratic elections for Hong Kong's leadership paralysed parts of central Hong Kong for several weeks.

Alec Baldwin charged with assault,"Mr Baldwin leaving the police station in New York US actor Alec Baldwin has been charged with assault in New York City after allegedly punching a man in a fight over a parking spot. He left a police station in the city after being ordered to appear in court on 26 November. This is not 60-year-old Mr Baldwin's first run-in with the law - in 2014, he was arrested for disorderly conduct. The actor starred in the movie Hunt for Red October and more recently in TV shows 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live. This video can not be played Alec Baldwin on playing Trump: 'I'm channelling people's frustration' The alleged altercation occurred in the West Village area of Manhattan on Friday. Police told US media the actor had claimed his family member had been holding a spot for his Cadillac Escalade SUV when a man driving a Saab station wagon swooped in and took it. Police say the two men were arguing and pushing each other before Mr Baldwin swung at the 49-year-old man, who was taken to hospital with jaw pain. After he was charged with misdemeanour assault and harassment, Mr Baldwin denied that he had hit anyone. ""The assertion that I punched anyone over a parking spot is false. I wanted to go on the record stating as much,"" he tweeted. Gaming Baldwin 'kicked off plane' Baldwin apology over phone rant,external US President Donald Trump, whom Mr Baldwin has portrayed on the comedy show Saturday Night Live, said when asked about the arrest: ""I wish him luck."" Mr Baldwin has made headlines before for his anger issues. New York police arrested him in May 2014 after he was caught riding his bicycle the wrong way in traffic and then became belligerent, swearing at the officers. He was given summonses for the bike violation as well as disorderly conduct. Mr Baldwin tweeted angrily about the incident, calling New York City ""a mismanaged carnival of stupidity"" and naming the officer who arrested him. In 2013, he was suspended from his MSNBC talk show Up Late for using an anti-gay slur when arguing with a photographer in New York City. Baldwin and his wife Hilaria attended the US Open together last September The actor later issued an apology,external, saying he ""did not intend to hurt or offend anyone"" with his word choice. Following the incident, his daughter Ireland also defended him on Twitter, saying that ""for someone who has battled with anger management issues, my dad has grown tremendously"". Mr Baldwin and his daughter have had a tense relationship in the past. He apologised publicly in 2007 for calling his then-11-year-old daughter a ""rude, thoughtless little pig"" in a voicemail after the message went viral online. In 2011, Mr Baldwin was kicked off a flight after refusing to turn off his phone. The actor said he was playing Words with Friends. In 1995 he was acquitted of misdemeanour battery charges for punching a photographer in self-defence.

The black history you might not learn at schoolDozens fined for driving wrong way on M11Was Robert the Bruce born in Essex?Carole King pens anti-Trump song'Halloween is Christmas for us amputees',"Black History Month is celebrated in the UK every October. As this year's celebration comes to a end, here are four lesser-known historical figures who helped shape multicultural Britain. Una Marson (centre) worked alongside George Orwell (standing) and TS Eliot (seated), who are pictured looking over her shoulder Poet, dramatist, and broadcaster Una Marson made history by becoming the first black woman to be employed by the BBC. Born in Jamaica, Marson moved to the UK in the early 1930s and took up her first position at the BBC as a programme assistant in March 1941. ""She was a real pioneer in giving voice to black women's experience, as well as generously creating a platform for other contemporary black voices,"" historian Robert Seatter says. At the BBC, Marson worked alongside writers TS Eliot and George Orwell before establishing her own weekly feature within the Calling the West Indies radio programme, called Caribbean Voices. She went on to become the first black producer at the BBC. ""This choice sparked resentment, but Marson was described as an extremely intelligent, loyal and lively person,""Prof James Procter, at Newcastle University, wrote in 2015,external. Robert Seatter says her ability to persevere despite prejudice highlights why ""she was a real trailblazer"" and should be remembered. Olive Morris died at the age of 27 but ""left behind an extraordinary legacy of activism"" Historian Angelina Osborne describes Olive Morris as a ""radical activist and campaigner"". Born in Jamaica in 1952, and having moved to south London at the age of nine, she became heavily involved in community politics at a young age. A picture of her taken in 1969 shows her face swollen, her clothes torn and dirty. On the back is written: ""Taken at Kings College Hospital... after the police had beaten me up."" ""Earlier that day,""Angelina Osborne writes,external, ""a Nigerian diplomat had parked his Mercedes on Atlantic Road in Brixton, leaving his wife and children in the car while he bought some records. ""Police officers, thinking the diplomat had stolen the car began to, according to witnesses, arrest him and beat him. ""Olive came forward and physically tried to stop the police from attacking the diplomat, causing the police to turn on her, arrest her and assault her, kicking her in the chest. ""This young girl, barely 5ft 2in, took on racist police officers, without thinking about her own safety, because she couldn't stand by and allow the injustice of an African man being arrested for driving a nice car. ""This was one early incident of Olive's commitment to challenging oppression."" Morris went on to co-found the Organisation of Women of Asian and African Descent (OWAAD) and the Brixton Black Women's Group, which were among the first in the UK to address issues affecting women from ethnic minorities. ""Olive was committed to the struggle against racial, sexual and class oppression,"" Angelina Osborne says. She died at the age of 27 but ""left behind an extraordinary legacy of activism"". Frank Bailey joined the West Ham Fire Brigade in 1955 When Frank Bailey was told by a Fire Brigades Union (FBU) delegate that ""black people were not employed by the fire service"" because they were ""not educated or strong enough"", he decided to apply. He successfully joined the West Ham Fire Brigade in 1955, becoming one of the first full-time black firefighters in the country. However, Mr Bailey, who had moved to London from Guyana in 1953, left the service 10 years later. His decision, according to Michael Nicholas, former FBU national secretary for black and ethnic minority members, was due to ""inherent prejudice and racism"" as white firefighters had been promoted ahead of him. ""Frank was inspirational, as thoughts of black people at the time were very negative. Every day he had to consistently break down barriers,"" Mr Nicholas says. ""Everything he did was underpinned by his drive for equality."" After leaving the fire service, Mr Bailey went on to become the first black psychiatric social worker in London. His daughter, Alexis, describes her late father as ""inspirational"". ""He went through so much and never stopped fighting for equal rights. He never gave up and that really inspired me,"" she says. The year before he died, Laurie Cunningham helped Wimbledon beat Liverpool in the FA Cup Final Described as ""one of the best players of the era"", Laurie Cunningham was a leading personality on and off the football pitch during the 1970s and 1980s. Born in London, the left winger began his professional career at Leyton Orient in 1974. In 1977, he joined West Bromwich Albion and then became one of the first black players to represent England at any level, scoring on his debut for the under-21s, against Scotland. Cunningham made his full international debut in 1979 and went on to earn six caps for England. In the summer of 1979, at the age of 22, he became the first British player to transfer to Real Madrid, who paid West Bromwich Albion a fee of Â£950,000. ""Laurie was one of the best players around at the time,"" former England striker Les Ferdinand says. ""In the past, black players were not getting opportunities to play for England - but Laurie broke down that barrier. He was so good that he couldn't be ignored."" Ferdinand says Cunningham, who died in a car crash in 1989, helped ""pave the way"" for black footballers. ""He made me believe I could be a footballer. ""He took a lot of stick that black players coming through now don't have to take. ""The black players took the brunt of it - such as bananas being thrown on the pitch and monkey chants."" Cunningham's career was a breakthrough in British football but Ferdinand adds: ""We still need to break down barriers off the playing field, in terms of the boardroom, management, and coaching.""

Dozens fined for driving wrong way on M11Was Robert the Bruce born in Essex?Carole King pens anti-Trump song'Halloween is Christmas for us amputees',"Essex Police is contacting 86 motorists who were caught driving the wrong way on the M11 Dozens of motorists who drove the wrong way on the M11 to escape being held up by an accident are facing fines and points on their driving licence. Eighty-six drivers turned around following a crash involving six vehicles near Harlow on 27 October. Following the incident, phone and dashcam footage was sent to police via Safer Essex Road Partnerships' Extra Eyes campaign. Essex Police said there were ""no excuses"" for driving the wrong way. The M11 was closed for around 25 minutes following the crash, which took place at around 13:10 BST. No one was seriously injured. Adam Pipe, head of roads policing at Essex Police, said all the ""impatient"" drivers will now face fines of Â£100 and three points on their driving licence. ""Turning around on a road and driving in the other direction is clearly dangerous,"" he said. Mr Pipe added: ""You wouldn't do it in a moving traffic and it's no different to turning around following a road closure.

Was Robert the Bruce born in Essex?Carole King pens anti-Trump song'Halloween is Christmas for us amputees',"The statue of Robert the Bruce, near the site of the Battle of Bannockburn The man who defeated the English at the Battle of Bannockburn was born in Essex - a new historical account claims. Historian Dr Fiona Watson believes Robert the Bruce was from a village near Chelmsford, called Writtle. As part of her self-published work, she said there was no evidence that he was born at his mother's castle at Turnberry, in Ayrshire. Dr Watson outlines a ruthlessly ambitious man who would stop at nothing to become king of Scotland. In the first of her trilogy, titled ""Traitor, Outlaw, King"", the former Stirling University academic said that Bruce's family owned land in Essex, and quotes a chronicler from the 14th century saying he belonged to ""the English nation"". Dr Watson told BBC Scotland: ""There is no direct evidence he was born in Turnberry. More recently, it was presumed Bruce would have been born at Turnberry, but the evidence points to Writtle."" Robert the Bruce's link to London Robert the Bruce Battle of Bannockburn letter discovered Work begins to restore Bruce statue at Bannockburn She said it was the custom at the time to send young nobleman to be fostered with other noble families, and thinks he could have been sent to Ireland or the west of Scotland, where some of his opinions may have been formed. The St Andrews and Glasgow university graduate added: ""His heart was clearly in Scotland. He wanted to get his family lands back, which had been lost because Bruce and his father had not pledged fealty [loyalty] to the former king John Balliol. ""He would use anything and everything to win."" Dr Watson also said the killing of John Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, at the hands of Robert the Bruce in 1306, was a political assassination. ""It's like Game of Thrones,"" she explained. ""He knew John Comyn would stand in his way on the path to the throne of Scotland, and so he took him out."" Netflix has a new film adaptation of the story of Robert the Bruce, starring Chris Pine Robert the Brucewas born in July 1274. He was crowned as King of Scots at Scone Palace in 1306, and died at the Manor of Cardross in Dunbartonshire in 1329. His body is buried at Dunfermline Abbey, but his heart is buried at Melrose Abbey. The battle on which Scotland's national anthem Flower of Scotland is based,Bannockburn, occurred in 1314. An army under Bruce defeated a far larger army, which was led by Edward II.

Carole King pens anti-Trump song'Halloween is Christmas for us amputees',"Carole King has come out of retirement to write an anti-Trump song. The songwriter's first new music in seven years is a reworked version of her 1977 track, One. The song features a new final verse, which King told the Guardian is ""a call to action,external"" ahead of the mid-term elections in the US. The 76-year-old initially rewrote the song to play at a political fundraiser last month, but then recorded the new version to ""empower people"". King - a staunch Democrat - is one of the most successful songwriters of all time, but hasn't written any music since her 2011 Grammy-nominated Christmas album. Pharrell orders Trump to stop playing Happy Carole King makes UK stage return Joan Baez hails 'unsurpassable' Dylan The woman behind songs including (You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman and The Loco-Motion toldRolling Stone,external: ""I need a reason to make music and I haven't had one."" The song is slightly shorter than the original, which appeared on her album Simple Things. The new third verse features lyrics speaking to prospective political candidates: ""What will we do?/We're gonna run/reach for the sun/come together as one/show 'em how it's done/at the end of the day, we'll be able to say/love won."" The song also features King's daughters Louise Goffin and Sherry Kondor on backing vocals to enhance the line ""We are one"" with more voices. King said of the song: ""I see it as empowering people who feel hopeless to do whatever they can as one person. If nothing else, they can vote for Democrats and change the climate of our country."" Streisand's new album Walls is inspired by Donald Trump's presidency The songwriter isn't the first to come out of retirement to write an anti-Trump song. Last month, Barbra Streisand recorded her first new music since 2005, Don't Lie to Me, which also takes aim at the US President. Speaking to theAssociated Press,external, the 76-year-old said: ""After the election I became mortified and terrified. And so I had to use my creative energy, I had to put it somewhere. ""Every morning I literally was afraid to turn on the news,"" she added. ""I'm fired up - I have to write about it."" Joan Baez at a rally in front of the US Supreme Court last month In 2017, Joan Baez also confirmed that she was writing her first song in 25 years, Nasty Man, about President Trump. The Farewell, Angelina singer renowned for her resistance music in the 1960s and 1970s toldRolling Stone,external: ""There's not enough [protest music] right now. There needs to be more.
