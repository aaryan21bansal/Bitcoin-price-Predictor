Family devastated at death of 'vibrant soul'Police believe 17-year-old Tara Wright was injured in a car crash before being taken to Belfast City Hospital.Northern Ireland,"Tara Wright's body was near Belfast City Hospital on Sunday The teenage girl whose body was found near Belfast City Hospital on Sunday was Tara Wright. Police believe the 17-year-old's death is connected to a single-vehicle crash on the outskirts of the city on Sunday. A man injured in that crash on the Ballygowan Road is in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Miss Wright's parents said they were ""devastated"" and that Tara was a ""vibrant soul with a zest for life that could bring joy to all around her"". ""Tara was a kind, funny, charismatic, bright young girl with her whole life ahead of her and we can't believe that we now have to say goodbye to her,"" a statement released to the media said. Four men, aged 20, 21, 28 and 30 were arrested on Sunday in connection with the incident. They have been released on bail. Police say they are helping them to establish the circumstances of Miss Wright's death. Miss Wright's body was found in a grey MG car in the hospital grounds shortly before 03:00 GMT by staff from the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service. A silver Mercedes was recovered from undergrowth near a roundabout on the Ballygowan Road About 25 minutes earlier, a silver Mercedes was found on its roof in undergrowth in Castlereagh and a man was taken to hospital. ""Our investigation is at an early stage, however, we do believe that Tara was injured during the one-vehicle road traffic collision on the Ballygowan Road,"" PSNI Insp Nigel Henry said. ""We are appealing to anyone who witnessed either the silver Mercedes or grey MG to contact us to assist us with our enquiries. ""We also believe that a grey coloured MG vehicle conveyed Tara to the area of Belfast City Hospital therefore we are also appealing to anyone who witnessed this vehicle between the Ballygowan Road and the Hospital to contact police. ""I would also urge anyone who may have dashcam footage of either vehicle taken in the early hours of Sunday morning to contact us,"" he added.

Wheelchair user refused entry to 'rowdy' clubA BBC journalist says she was refused entry to a nightclub because the music was not suitable.,"A wheelchair user said she was refused entry to a nightclub by a bouncer who said the music was ""too rowdy"" for her. Lucy Webster, 24, a BBC journalist, tried to get into Aquum - a wheelchair-accessible club in south-west London - on Saturday night. After first being told by door staff that it was not safe, she was then told that the music was not suitable. Aquum said it ""deeply apologises"" for what would seem to be an ""error of judgement"" by third-party contractors. Lucy was in a bar with two friends - one who is her carer - in Clapham when they decided to continue on to a nightclub. She said a quick internet search told her that nearby Aquum was wheelchair-accessible. The club was busy when they arrived at around 01:30 GMT on Sunday morning and there was a small queue. But door staff were letting in a steady stream of people, she said, until her group was stopped and taken aside. ""This is where it starts to get odd,"" she said. ""The bouncer informs me that the physical access is fine, but the club is busy and he just wants to 'keep me safe'. 'I'm used to busy,' I say, 'I live in London. And anyway, I can look after myself'."" She said a doorwoman then came over ""to tell me the music was 'too rowdy' for me - as if, as a disabled woman, I can only listen to girly pop and, presumably, very sad songs."" Lucy, who has cerebral palsy, responded by saying that was discrimination. She was told it wasn't, because wheelchair users were often let into the club. A heated discussion followed, which Lucy says included the door staff suggesting that she could go inside by herself to see that the club was unsuitable - despite earlier being told it was unsafe for her to go in. She said her friends were getting angry but she decided it was better just to walk away. ""I just wanted to get out of there"", she said, and they headed to a takeaway because ""sometimes you just give up and get chicken"". Allow Twitter content?

""You feel like you don't belong in that environment - even though you know that you do. ""It hasn't put me off because I'm stubborn, but it could put off others. ""Finding somewhere accessible on a night out is hard enough to start with - you're very limited where you can go. Even in London, it is genuinely hard to find somewhere to go."" Managing director of Aquum, Terry Georgiou, said: ""I need to investigate this unfortunate incident further to ascertain all the facts, but it would seem that one of our third-party contractors has made an error of judgement on the evening in question for which I deeply apologise. ""I will be calling a meeting with our third-party supplier and appropriate action will be taken."" He added: ""It was not our intention to cause any upset although I can see that it has... We will endeavour to ensure that such an incident never happens again."" He said Aquum was deliberately designed to be an inclusive venue and he had organised for his staff to have further training. Lucy said: ""I'm glad Aquum apologised and that they are retraining their staff. I don't think my friends and I will be going back but I hope other wheelchair users have better experiences in future."" Ceri Smith, campaigns manager at disability equality charity Scope, said businesses needed to work harder to prevent situations like this from happening. ""Disabled people deserve to be seen as more than their impairment or condition and should be able to enjoy a night out clubbing without encountering this type of bizarre and discriminatory behaviour. ""All too often disabled people tell us they face unfair accusations of being too drunk, or that their very presence makes them a fire hazard."" Have you had a similar experience?

Kuenssberg: May loses more control,"Theresa May has lost more ministers to Brexit, and more importantly perhaps, has lost even more control of the process at a time when her government is only just about holding on. Sir Oliver Letwin's plan passed through the Commons tonight by a clearer margin than expected, a big win for the cross-party group of senior MPs who have been pushing plans of different flavours for a while that would allow Parliament to have more say over what's next. Officially, what the proposal that won tonight does is give MPs control of the debates in the Commons for a day on Wednesday. They will use that to have a series of votes on different options. This is exactly what some government ministers wanted and have been arguing for for ages. MPs back votes on Brexit alternatives Live: MPs take control of Brexit process But those ministers were opposed by their colleagues sitting round the same top table, who fought the idea from the start. That's because they fear, as the prime minister does, that allowing the process to go forward cedes what little control they have left and potentially moves Parliament towards choosing a softer Brexit. Now MPs have won the right to carry out this unusual process, there will be a series of votes in the Commons on Wednesday, where MPs will be able to have their say on a whole range of options - a customs union, a closer relationship with the EU than the PM has argued for, another referendum, and others which could emerge. But it's important to note those votes won't at this stage force the government to do anything, they won't be binding, and the prime minister has indicated she could not, and would not ever support a plan that wasn't in the Conservative manifesto. On the other side, MPs involved in the bid tonight say if there is a majority for a plan that's not the prime minister's deal then there would be ""uproar"" if Theresa May tried to ignore it. It is possible, of course, that Brexiteers who have been resisting the prime minister's deal so far, take fright at Parliament having more control of the process, and are more likely to come in line. That's because generally, the make-up of MPs are more likely to back a softer deal than the one on offer. So faced with the choice of Theresa May's compromise this week, or a much longer wrangle to a closer relationship with the EU than the prime minister has negotiated, it is not impossible that the numbers will move in her favour. But with more former Remainers willing to make their voices heard now in Parliament, the prime minister's battle with her party could get even more intense. Tonight could be the official start of a journey to a softer Brexit led by a majority in Parliament, Brexiteers beginning to back down in earnest, or the start of the next stage of a standoff between the government and Parliament that could only end with a 'democratic event' - code in Whitehall for what you and I would normally call an election.

Toddler suffocated by baby monitor cord,"A coroner recorded a narrative verdict and said ""at some point [Jessica's] neck became entangled"" An 18-month-old girl suffocated after getting entangled in a baby monitor cord, an inquest heard. Jessica Duggan's parents left her in her cot for a nap and then went to sleep themselves. When they woke two hours later her mother Danielle found her daughter had the video monitor cord around her neck and she was not breathing. A coroner recorded a narrative verdict and said ""at some point [Jessica's] neck became entangled in the cable"". Mrs Duggan, from Shipdham, Norfolk, called 999 while her husband Jason tried to resuscitate the child. The ambulance and police service arrived within five minutes of being called on 25 October. Jessica was taken immediately to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and attempts to resuscitate her continued in the ambulance. Danielle and Jason Duggan advised parents to have all cables ""boxed in"" and made extra safe Her parents described their daughter as a ""healthy, happy child"" and ""an active little girl"". The inquest heard the video baby monitor had been placed on a shelf above the cot. Her parents said they thought they were doing ""the right thing"" by using the monitor and had tried to keep the power cable and cord as tight to the wall as possible. A police statement read out at the inquest in Norwich said ""the cables from the monitor were accessible through the bars of the cot"". It added there ""was nothing to suggest that this is anything other than a tragic accident"". Jessica was just 18 months old when she died Norfolk coroner Yvonne Blake said ""at some point her neck became entangled in the cable."" Jessica died from compression of the neck from ligature or suffocation, the inquest heard. After the hearing, Mrs Duggan said parents needed to take extra care to ensure children were safe. ""As far as we were aware, she should have been safe,"" she added. ""We don't know how she managed to get the cable.""

Marathon goes off-road due to potholes,"Potholes on the road used for the marathon A road marathon held for more than 15 years has been reclassified as a ""multi-terrain"" event because the course has so many potholes. A stretch of the Cape Wrath Challenge Marathon is held on single track road near Durness, on the north Sutherland coast in the Scottish Highlands. Scottish Athletics has asked organisers to describe it as an off-road event due to the state of the road. Organisers have alerted runners to the change ahead of this year's marathon. The popular race forms part of a festival of running taking place from 12-18 May, and is already full. The stretch of single track public road provides access to Cape Wrath Lighthouse. Maintenance of the road involves an agreement between Highland Council, a local bus operator and the Ministry of Defence (MoD), which owns land at Cape Wrath. Durness Active Health, the charity which organises the challenge, said: ""Runners who have competed on the course will be aware of how poor the road surface is and Scottish Athletics have now advised us that the Cape Wrath Challenge Marathon course no longer qualifies as a marathon course due to its 'rough and broken running surface'. ""IAAF requirements are for races to be held on sealed road surfaces."" The marathon is held at Cape Wrath on the north Sutherland coast The charity went on: ""Whilst we know that this may not be an issue for the majority of runners, we felt it important to highlight this as soon as possible in case entrants were relying upon their completion of the race to qualify them for entry to other marathons later in the season."" It said its 10km and half marathon were unaffected by the change. The charity added: ""We apologise if you have entered the marathon and this is an important issue for you."" Scottish Athletics said: ""The race has now been given a permit as a 'multi-terrain marathon' as it did not quite meet the requirements set by the IAAF as a 'road marathon'. ""We've been working with the organisers and all the events they want to stage are happening."" Highland Council said the single track was among 4,000 miles (6,437km) of road across its area that it was responsible for. A spokeswoman said: ""Agreement was reached a few years back with the local bus operator and the MoD that if the council supplied materials that the bus operator would transport materials to Cape Wrath and the MoD would carry out repairs. ""Materials have been supplied by the council as requested.""

Trump hints at payback for 'evil' enemies,"This video can not be played Trump on Mueller probe: 'We can never let this happen again' President Donald Trump says his enemies who did ""evil"" and ""treasonous things"" will be under scrutiny after he was absolved of colluding with Russia. Speaking in the Oval Office, he said no other president should have to be investigated over ""a false narrative"". He spoke a day after the attorney general released a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's completed report. It clears Mr Trump of conspiring with Russia to steal the US 2016 election. But the long-awaited report stops short of exonerating Mr Trump of obstruction of justice. US Attorney General William Barr ruled there was no evidence requiring prosecution on the obstruction issue. Stormy Daniels lawyer accused of extortion Mueller called it (largely) right on Trump The best day of Trump's presidency Mr Trump was hosting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House on Monday when a reporter asked him about the outcome of the Mueller report. ""There's a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, very bad things,"" Mr Trump said, ""I would say treasonous things, against our country."" ""And hopefully people that have done such harm to our country, we've gone through a period of really bad things happening. ""Those people will certainly be looked at, I've been looking at them for a long time. ""And I'm saying, 'why haven't they been looked at?' They lied to Congress - many of them, you know who they are - they've' done so many evil things."" Mr Trump did not name the alleged culprits. He added: ""It was a false narrative, it was a terrible thing, we can never let this happen to another president again, I can tell you that. I say it very strongly."" Key lines from the summary - and what they really mean All you need to know about Trump and Russia The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words On Monday, Senate Judiciary chairman Lindsey Graham laid out the Republican strategy as he pledged to ""unpack the other side of the story"" of the Russia investigation. The South Carolina senator, who spent the weekend with Mr Trump in Florida, said his panel would investigate the Department of Justice-led inquiry. The FBI's use of a dossier compiled to discredit Mr Trump by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, would be among aspects under scrutiny, said Mr Graham. Meanwhile, Democrats are focusing on a line in the attorney general's summary that says Mr Mueller's report ""does not exonerate"" Mr Trump of obstruction of justice, even though Mr Barr concluded on Sunday there was insufficient evidence that Mr Trump had committed a crime. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said he would summon Mr Barr to testify soon ""in light of the very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the justice department"". On Monday, six Democratic congressional committee chairs senta letter to Mr Barr,externaldemanding the release of the full, ""complete and unredacted"" report by 2 April, saying the summary ""is not sufficient"". Earlier, Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blocked a move by Democrats to urge Mr Barr to release the Mueller report to the public. He said it was too early to release the full report as ""the special counsel and the justice department ought to be allowed to finish their work"". Senator McConnell also posted on Twitter: ""No collusion. No conspiracy. No obstruction."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Crack use up after 'aggressive marketing',"Crack is cocaine that has been processed into a rock or lump form ""Aggressive marketing"" by drug dealers who send out targeted text messages and give free samples could be one of the reasons for a rise in crack cocaine use in England, researchers have said. The drug is reported to have become more commonly used by students, clubbers and professionals. Government research said there may now be ""less stigma"" about the highly-addictive form of cocaine. ""Less capacity"" by police to target dealers was also said to be an issue. Thestudy, published by the Home Office and Public Health England,external, set out to examine the reasons for a ""statistically significant"" estimated increase in crack cocaine users, from 166,640 in 2011 to 180,748 in 2017, a rise of 8.5%. The study drew on knowledge from drug treatment workers, crack users and police officers in six local authority areas where there had been large increases in the number of people starting treatment. The people who are really using cocaine Young warned over buying drugs via apps Fentanyl and cocaine drug deaths rise The findings back up figures which suggest the upward trend began to develop after a surge in the global production of cocaine in 2013. Crack - cocaine processed into a rock or lump form - can be smoked or mixed with liquid to be injected. Encouraging greater dependency on crack was more lucrative for dealers, the study said. Dealers were reported to be sending out messages with ""special offers"" or ""deal of the day"" and containing ""buzzwords"" such as ""magic"" and ""power"" to ""trigger cravings"". Some users reported crack was being made available in smaller quantities, with one referring to ""pocket money prices"", such as Â£5 per rock. The report said organised crime groups took advantage of excess supply to push crack cocaine onto a captive market of entrenched heroin users and groups of new users. Crack use is said to have increased among clubbers and professionals Treatment workers said crack was ""beginning to become more acceptable, even fashionable among groups who would not previously have taken it"". They suggested dealers marketing it as ""smokable cocaine"" might be a factor. The report added: ""In one area with a large university student population, there was a view that dealers were successfully infiltrating these groups."" One person receiving treatment told researchers her 17-year-old daughter and her friends were taking crack at parties, while another commented: ""Kids are using it. They think that crack is not as serious as heroin - it's not a dirty drug."" In three of the areas of the study, there was evidence of ""out of town"" dealers from gangs in London, Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham infiltrating local markets. Police in two of the areas said they had not noticed any changes in crack use and in one area said young people tended to avoid it because it had a ""negative perception"". But some officers told researchers their forces no longer had dedicated drugs squads or said a ""lack of capacity made it difficult to prioritise drug-dealing"". Rosanna O'Connor, director for drugs, alcohol, tobacco and justice at Public Health England said: ""More needs to be done to improve the links from the criminal justice system into treatment services."" Home Office minister for crime Victoria Atkins said: ""The government is committed to tackling the illicit drugs trade, protecting the most vulnerable and helping those with a drug dependency to recover.""

Brexit amendments: What are MPs voting on?,"MPs are set to vote on a series of amendments to a neutral government motion on Brexit. Seven amendments were tabled and Speaker John Bercow selected three to be debated and voted on. MPs are expected to vote on the amendments from 22:00 GMT tonight. Notes the proposed alternatives to the prime minister's Brexit deal Calls on the government to ""provide sufficient parliamentary time this week"" for indicative votes Indicative votes are where MPs vote on a series of options designed to test the will of Parliament to see what, if anything, commands a majority. What are indicative votes? Takes power to control business in the Commons away from the government on Wednesday, to allow MPs to put forward business motions relating to Brexit - most likely indicative votes If more than one business motion is submitted, Bercow will decide which one has ""precedence"" Whatever is happening in the Commons on Wednesday will be interrupted at 14:00 GMT. MPs will have one hour to debate the business motion before moving onto the main business This amendment has cross-party support including from Conservative Dominic Grieve and Labour's Hilary Benn, who is also chair of the Brexit Committee. If the UK is seven days away from leaving without a deal, government must allow MPs to vote on whether to leave without a deal or request an extension ""to give time for Parliament to determine a different approach"" Seeks a two-year extension to provide time for a referendum on accepting the withdrawal agreement or remaining in the EU This amendment is also supported by Independent Group MPs. Who are the Independent Group and what do they want? Recalls the result of the referendum and that 85% of votes were cast for parties to implement Brexit in 2017 which committed to abiding by that result in their manifestos Reaffirms a commitment to honour the result of the referendum Mr Quince's amendment has support from DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds and members of the European Research Group including Jacob Rees-Mogg. If a deal is not passed by Thursday, the government has to set out how it will ensure the UK does not leave without a deal on 12 April, ""including by seeking an extension to Article 50 to take account of any conclusions reached by the House"" This could be seen as complementary to the Letwin amendment, as it gives space to reflect on the results of indicative votes Her amendment has support from Conservatives Oliver Letwin, Caroline Spelman and Nick Boles - as well as from Labour MPs and the Independent Group. ""Make all necessary preparations"" for a referendum between leaving the EU ""on terms to be determined by Parliament"" or remaining in the EU This is different to the Lib Dem amendment which calls for a referendum between the prime minister's deal and remain Their amendment also has support from the Liberal Democrats.

Kuenssberg: Gossip swirling,"Understandably, Westminster is frothy with gossip tonight. Is the government about to lose control completely of the Brexit process? Not quite. Is there an obvious way for Parliament out of this mess if it gets the chance to test it properly? Not quite. How likely is it that a handful of ministers might resign tonight to help that theoretical process? Quite likely. Is the prime minister about to get the DUP on board for her deal? Not quite. But the biggest question is, as it always has been. Is Theresa May about to seal the deal with the Brexiteers whose votes she so desperately needs? Well, not quite. Not enough votes for Brexit deal yet - May Live: MPs debate Brexit next steps This morning, there were some in government who were hopeful that the mood was suddenly turning and there might, in fact, be the numbers emerging for the prime minister to hold another vote on her deal with the EU in the Commons on Tuesday. One Cabinet minister confidently predicted it to their team this morning. Another insider was astonished to find the mood so changed in Number 10 when they got to work this morning. But the gaggle of influential Brexiteers who had their day out at Chequers on Sunday had another meeting in the first half of the day today while rumours were doing the rounds about the third vote. Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson, Steve Baker, Dominic Raab and other key Brexiteers chewed over whether, after yesterday's meeting at the PM's country pad, they could move to back the deal after all. One source present said no conclusion was reached. There are no firm commitments, and no obligations. The group could end up taking a collective decision to back Theresa May, or quite possibly not. For Johnson and Raab, both potential leadership contenders conscious they may face off against each other in a contest someday soon, there is an added calculation - how would the decision they make be viewed by Tory members who will have the decisive power when the time comes to choose the next Tory leader? Do the two men jump together? Or not at all, hoping to please the mainly Brexiteer base of the Conservative Party. The meeting today didn't come to a concrete decision about whether or not the MPs present will ever back the prime minister's deal. But it's understood they discussed not just whether the prime minister should promise to quit in return for votes, but the need for her to make such a promise publicly, because there is ""such a problem of trust"". And with no firm conclusion from this series of conversations, which one senior MP involved described as fluid as a ""set of amoebas"", there is no solid support the prime minister can rely on to put her vote again. Signals tonight from a huge meeting of the European Research Group suggested, as he has before, that the chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg might come on board for the deal if the DUP budge. But that's still far from a certainty. Until that shifts, which is still - if remotely - possible this week, don't expect ministers to be able to put their deal to the test for a third time.

Apple unveils TV streaming platform,"This video can not be played WATCH: Apple announces new services Apple has unveiled its new TV streaming platform, Apple TV+, at a star-studded event in California. Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey were among those who took to the stage at Apple's headquarters to reveal their involvement in TV projects commissioned by the tech giant. The platform will include shows from existing services like Hulu and HBO. Apple also announced that it would be launching a credit card, gaming portal and enhanced news app. The event was held in California and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was clear from the start that the announcements would be about new services, not new devices. It is a change of direction for the 42-year-old company. Steve Carell, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston There had been much anticipation about Apple's predicted foray into the TV streaming market, dominated by the likes of Amazon and Netflix. The Apple TV+ app was unveiled by Steven Spielberg and will launch in the autumn. Spielberg will himself be creating some material for the new platform, he said. Other stars who took to the stage included Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Jason Momoa, Alfre Woodard, comedian Kumail Nanjiani and Big Bird from Sesame Street. The app will be made available on rival devices for the first time, coming to Samsung, LG, Sony and Vizio smart TVs as well as Amazon's Firestick and Roku. Oprah Winfrey spoke of the potential of a book club on Apple TV+. The subscription fee was not announced, and notably absent from the launch line-up was Netflix, which had already ruled itself out of being part of the bundle. ""The test for Apple will be, can new content separate them out from their competitors and can they commission and deliver on fresh new content that can reach audiences in the same way that Stranger Things has for Netflix for example?"" commented Dr Ed Braman, an expert in film and production at the University of York. The physical version of the card is made of titanium and does not have a card number or signature space on it. The Apple Card credit card will launch in the US this summer. There will be both an iPhone and physical version of the card, with a cashback incentive on every purchase. The credit card will have no late fees, annual fees or international fees, said Apple Pay VP Jennifer Bailey. It has been created with the help of Goldman Sachs and MasterCard. The firm also revealed a news service, Apple News+, which will include more than 300 magazine titles including Marie Claire, Vogue, New Yorker, Esquire, National Geographic and Rolling Stone. The LA Times and the Wall Street Journal will also be part of the platform, the firm said. It added that it will not track what users read or allow advertisers to do so. Apple News+ will cost $9.99 (Â£7.50) per month and is available immediately in the US and Canada. It will come to Europe later in the year. Unlike TV+, the news platform will only be available on Apple devices. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Apple Arcade will offer 100 games not available elsewhere. A new games platform, Apple Arcade, will offer over 100 exclusive games from the app store which will all be playable offline, in contrast withGoogle's recently announced streaming platform Stadia. It will be rolled out across 150 countries in the autumn but no subscription prices were given. in 2018 analyst firm IHS Markit valued the global gaming market on iOS, Apple's operating system, at $33.5bn. There is space within that market for a platform like Apple Arcade which is not financed by in-app purchases or advertising, said IHS director of games research Piers Harding-Rolls. ""Apple's decision to move up the games value chain with a new, curated subscription service and to support the development of exclusive games for its Arcade platform is a significant escalation of the company's commitment to the games market,"" he said. ""Apple joins the other technology companies Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon and others in investing directly in games content and services."" Apple is making an aggressive push into several markets in which, thanks to sheer scale alone, it immediately becomes a massive player. Its TV service has been long in the making, and Apple has amassed a roster of big stars, as expected. A bigger test will be how creative those ideas will be - a lot of Netflix's success has been about finding new talent, not throwing money at already famous names. I also have reservations about how many boundaries Apple will be prepared to push with its creative endeavours: if it's as controlling with its television as it is with its brand, it will create a catalogue bereft of risk-taking. But TV is just a small part of what Apple is going for here. It wants (and needs) to turn its devices into the portal through which you do everything else - TV/film, gaming, reading the news... and you'd presume other things in the very near future. The announcement of a credit card shows how far Apple is prepared to go to make sure life is experienced through your iPhone. As Oprah put it on stage: ""They're in a billion pockets, y'all."" Apple blames China for sales forecast cut Is Apple making China a scapegoat? Just how bad is it for Apple?

Israel strikes Gaza after rocket hits house,"This video can not be played Israeli jets carried out several air strikes in Gaza after a rocket hit a home north of Tel Aviv Israel has carried out strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza, after a rocket attack on a house injured seven Israelis. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the office of Hamas's political leader and the group's military intelligence headquarters were among the targets. Gaza's health ministry said seven Palestinians were injured. Militants later launched a barrage of rockets towards southern Israeli towns despite reports of a ceasefire, triggering further Israeli strikes. So far no Palestinian militant group has said it fired the long-range rocket that hit the house in Mishmeret, north of Tel Aviv, on Monday morning. The Israeli military blamed Hamas, but one unnamed official from the group said it had ""no interest"" in doing so. The escalation follows months of tensions at the boundary fence between Gaza and Israel, and two weeks before Israel holds a general election. Israeli media report that the Israeli side of the border has been quiet since 03:15 (01:15 GMT), and that the last Israeli strike on Gaza took place at about 04:30. Overnight, Palestinian militants in Gaza fired more than 60 rockets and mortars towards Israel, according to the IDF. About 30 of the projectiles were launched after Hamas said it had accepted an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire agreement that would start at 22:00. Allow Twitter content?

No injuries were reported in Israel, but a home in the town of Sderot was hit by a rocket that did not explode. The IDF said, in response to the rocket fire, fighter jets and helicopters struck 15 targets in Gaza, including a Hamas military compound in the central town of Deir al-Balah. Gaza's health ministry did not report any casualties as a result of those strikes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would immediately go to the IDF's headquarters when he returned from a curtailed trip to the US on Tuesday. Before launching the strikes, the IDF deployed two additional brigades to southern Israel ""We'll deal with these issues,"" he said. ""We gave a very powerful response. Hamas needs to know that we won't hesitate to go in [to Gaza] and take any required steps."" Meanwhile, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan told Israeli Army Radio that ""rumours of a ceasefire are incorrect"". The BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says Mr Netanyahu may want to avoid an unpredictable escalation before a closely-fought general election, but he is under intense pressure to show he is taking decisive action against Hamas. A rocket launched from the Rafah area in southern Gaza hit a house in Mishmeret, about 120km (75 miles) to the north, damaging the building and setting it on fire. This video can not be played Gaza rocket: Two children and an infant were among the injured The Israeli ambulance service treated two women who were moderately wounded and five other people, including an infant, a three-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl, who had minor wounds. The house belonged to Robert and Susan Wolf, two British-Israeli dual nationals, who had been at home with their son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren. It was the furthest a rocket has reached in Israel since the 2014 conflict in Gaza. An IDF spokeswoman said Hamas - which has fought three wars with Israel since 2008 and is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, EU and UK - had manufactured the rocket and was to blame for its launch. The IDF said it had struck dozens of Hamas targets across Gaza on Monday evening - a response that Mr Netanyahu described as ""very powerful"". The targets included the office of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniya in Gaza City's Rimal district. There was no indication that Mr Haniya was inside at the time. Palestinians in Gaza City surveyed the damage after the overnight Israeli strikes The IDF also said it had bombed a five-storey building in Gaza City housing the offices of Hamas' Internal Security Service, and a three-storey building in the eastern Sabra district that was the ""secret headquarters"" of Hamas's General Security Forces, as well as its General Intelligence and Military Intelligence agencies. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, reported that two Palestinians were injured when jets fired missiles at a commercial building in central Gaza City, and that one other person was hurt in a strike in the eastern Shujaiya district. A Hamas website, The Palestinian Information Center, said blocks of flats, civilian facilities, agricultural land and ""resistance sites"" had been targeted. Gaza rocket destroys Israeli home.

LGBT row school staff 'distraught',"This video can not be played The woman in charge of the trust running Parkfield school defends its LGBT rights teaching The head of a school trust embroiled in a row over classes about LGBT rights says staff have been left ""distraught"". The No Outsiders programme at Parkfield Community School in Birmingham has been paused after protests by parents. Hazel Pulley, chief executive officer of the trust which runs the school, said some staff had lost weight and were not sleeping. She added the situation had been the most ""challenging"" she has seen in 27 years in education. This video can not be played Parents claimed ""hundreds"" of pupils were kept out of school for a day There have been protests outside the school in Alum Rock over No Outsiders, with some parents claiming the lessons were age-inappropriate and incompatible with Islam. Ms Pulley, of Excelsior Multi-Academy Trust, confirmed its lessons have been temporarily stopped to allow for discussions with parents. The Leigh Trust has also said it would behalting lessons at four of its schoolsuntil reaching an agreement with parents. Latest news from the West Midlands ""The impact on staff has been tremendous,"" Ms Pulley said. ""The reason is because of the breakdown in the relation of trust which we have had for so long."" She said the No Outsiders lessons use a book featuring two mothers and their child, and depicts them doing ""normal things"". The idea is to show children how ""all families are different"". ""We are not teaching children about same sex couples in the sense of sexual relationships, what we do teach our children is that there are different families and that there are families with two mummies, two daddies."" This video can not be played Parents have been calling for No Outsiders to be stopped Ms Pulley said: ""During this period where we said we are putting No Outsiders on stop, we have made sure that in our curriculum and in our assemblies we do not mention the LGBT agenda, because that is the only way we felt parents could come into the room and start talking to us. ""We moved what we thought was the issue to one side but we can only do that for so long or otherwise, quite rightly, we will be seen as being discriminatory to one of the protected characteristics."" She said the programme can sit ""harmoniously"" with Islam, adding: ""In school they need to be educated to the laws of the land and at home they can follow their religion and that is fine; the two sit together."" Ofsted hasdeemed the lessons ""age-appropriate"". OnBBC Radio 4, its former chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw called for the classes to be reinstated, but said it is important parents are consulted.

"Woman lost ÃÂ£60,000 in 'romance scam'","This video can not be played Michelle Szombara met Alan Clarkson on a dating website A woman has told how she lost her home and was declared bankrupt after she became the victim of a ""romance scam"". Within weeks of meeting on a dating website, Alan Clarkson was stealing Michelle Szombara's money. Over four years, the fraudster, from West Lothian, stole more than Â£60,000 from Ms Szombara and her parents. The 40-year-old, of Fife, says she feels ""embarrassed and ashamed"" but she is backing a police campaign to raise awareness of the crime. She said: ""He turned up at my house with some spare clothes and stayed for the next four years,"" she said. Police said Clarkson then started to claim he could not access his bank account and was in debt. He sent her emails claiming to be from financial institutions and produced fake paperwork which claimed he had money in another account to pay her back. Ms Szombara said: ""He took over the rent for my house. I ended up over Â£7,000 in rent arrears and my council tax wasn't getting paid. ""It got to the stage we were living off of nothing. I was so stressed. ""I did every hour going at my work to be left with nothing. I had a lovely house and I lost everything."" The fraud extended to parents, who also handed over money to Clarkson. They lost the home they owned as a result of the fraud. ""At the end of the day I was still young enough to work and get all my money back - my mum and dad weren't at the end of the day. ""What he had took was their pension fund that they had put back. They lost their house, they only had a couple of years left on their mortgage."" Ms Szombara and her parents ended up homeless for six weeks. She added: ""I was embarrassed and ashamed that I got my mum and dad involved... They worked all their days."" She said they only contacted the police after Clarkson was convicted of a fraudulent crime, committed before the couple met. He was jailed for 42 months in February after being convicted of stealing Â£60,000 from Ms Szombara and her parents between 2010 and 2014. But Ms Szombara believes the figure was closer to Â£97,000. ""My mum died before he was sentenced for this so she didn't get to see him being sent to prison,"" she said. ""It nearly ripped our family apart. I hate what he's done to my family."" Warning people to be on the alert, Ms Szombara said: ""My advice would be to be really cautious with everybody. ""Check email addresses are related to the company. Throughout the four years we were together I never met his family so always check someone's background."" Det Sup Nicola Shepherd warned people to be vigilant Police say romance fraud is largely unreported due to victims' feelings of embarrassment, lack of evidence or a feeling it might have been their fault. Nevertheless, figures from April to December last year show the number of reported fraud incidents, including romance scams, increased by 21% from 6,106 the previous year to 7,398. Officers are highlighting the type of fraud as part of a national acquisitive crime campaign, which will run for four weeks. Their advice includes never sharing or exchanging personal information which can be used by fraudsters to obtain credit. People are also being urged never to send money or bank details to someone they have met online. Det Supt Nicola Shepherd said: ""Criminals can be extremely convincing and they prey on people who are emotionally vulnerable, particularly online.

Apple debuts credit card and TV shows,"This video can not be played WATCH: Apple announces new services Apple has unveiled its new TV streaming platform, Apple TV+, at a star-studded event in California. Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey were among those who took to the stage at Apple's headquarters to reveal their involvement in TV projects commissioned by the tech giant. The platform will include shows from existing services like Hulu and HBO. Apple also announced that it would be launching a credit card, gaming portal and enhanced news app. The event was held in California and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was clear from the start that the announcements would be about new services, not new devices. It is a change of direction for the 42-year-old company. Steve Carell, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston There had been much anticipation about Apple's predicted foray into the TV streaming market, dominated by the likes of Amazon and Netflix. The Apple TV+ app was unveiled by Steven Spielberg and will launch in the autumn. Spielberg will himself be creating some material for the new platform, he said. Other stars who took to the stage included Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Jason Momoa, Alfre Woodard, comedian Kumail Nanjiani and Big Bird from Sesame Street. The app will be made available on rival devices for the first time, coming to Samsung, LG, Sony and Vizio smart TVs as well as Amazon's Firestick and Roku. Oprah Winfrey spoke of the potential of a book club on Apple TV+. The subscription fee was not announced, and notably absent from the launch line-up was Netflix, which had already ruled itself out of being part of the bundle. ""The test for Apple will be, can new content separate them out from their competitors and can they commission and deliver on fresh new content that can reach audiences in the same way that Stranger Things has for Netflix for example?"" commented Dr Ed Braman, an expert in film and production at the University of York. The physical version of the card is made of titanium and does not have a card number or signature space on it. The Apple Card credit card will launch in the US this summer. There will be both an iPhone and physical version of the card, with a cashback incentive on every purchase. The credit card will have no late fees, annual fees or international fees, said Apple Pay VP Jennifer Bailey. It has been created with the help of Goldman Sachs and MasterCard. The firm also revealed a news service, Apple News+, which will include more than 300 magazine titles including Marie Claire, Vogue, New Yorker, Esquire, National Geographic and Rolling Stone. The LA Times and the Wall Street Journal will also be part of the platform, the firm said. It added that it will not track what users read or allow advertisers to do so. Apple News+ will cost $9.99 (Â£7.50) per month and is available immediately in the US and Canada. It will come to Europe later in the year.

"BA flight lands in Edinburgh by mistakeThe mistake only became apparent when the ""welcome to Edinburgh"" announcement was made.Business","Edinburgh or DÃ¼sseldorf? Spot the difference A British Airways flight destined for DÃ¼sseldorf in Germany has landed in Edinburgh by mistake, after the flight paperwork was submitted incorrectly. The passengers only realised the error when the plane landed and the ""welcome to Edinburgh"" announcement was made. The plane, which started at London's City Airport, was then redirected and landed in DÃ¼sseldorf. WDL Aviation ran the BA flight through a leasing deal. BA said it was working with WDL to find out why it filed the wrong flight plan. ""We have apologised to customers for this interruption to their journey and will be contacting them all individually,"" BA said in a statement. On its final flight on Sunday, the plane flew to Edinburgh and back so it seems that someone at WDL mistakenly repeated the same flight plan for the next day, according to BA. When the crew arrived at London City airport on Monday it is thought that they saw Edinburgh on the flight plan from the day before and followed the old flight route. German firm WDL said it was ""working closely with the authorities to investigate how the obviously unfortunate mix-up of flight schedules could occur"". ""At no time has the safety of passengers been compromised. We flew the passengers on the flight with number BA3271 to DÃ¼sseldorf after the involuntary stopover in Edinburgh,"" it said. BA declined to say how many passengers were affected by the mistake. Sophie Cooke, a 24-year-old management consultant, travels from London to DÃ¼sseldorf each week for work. She said when the pilot first made the announcement that the plane was about to land in Edinburgh everyone assumed it was a joke. She asked the cabin crew if they were serious. The pilot then asked passengers to raise their hands if they wanted to go to DÃ¼sseldorf. Everyone raised their hands. ""The pilot said he had no idea how it had happened. He said it had never happened before and that the crew was trying to work out what we could do."" Sophie said the plane sat on the tarmac at Edinburgh for two-and-a-half hours, before flying onto DÃ¼sseldorf. ""It became very frustrating. The toilets were blocked and they ran out of snacks. It was also really stuffy,"" she said. By Simon Browning, BBC transport producer It is hugely unusual for passengers to board a flight and then arrive at the wrong destination - and it presents lots of uncomfortable questions about procedure and standards. The flight was operated by a German aviation business on behalf of BA. Do they follow the same operational protocols that BA passengers would expect? Why wasn't a passenger announcement made before take-off saying ""the weather in Edinburgh is fine and the flight will last one hour"". If it had, they could have saved a lot of complication. For the passengers involved, will they get compensation for the delay? And ultimately - what does this do for trust in BA that such a mistake can be made? Passengers complained about the error on Twitter, with one person called Son Tran saying it felt ""like an honest mistake"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Woman lost home after romance scam,"This video can not be played Michelle Szombara met Alan Clarkson on a dating website A woman has told how she lost her home and was declared bankrupt after she became the victim of a ""romance scam"". Within weeks of meeting on a dating website, Alan Clarkson was stealing Michelle Szombara's money. Over four years, the fraudster, from West Lothian, stole more than Â£60,000 from Ms Szombara and her parents. The 40-year-old, of Fife, says she feels ""embarrassed and ashamed"" but she is backing a police campaign to raise awareness of the crime. She said: ""He turned up at my house with some spare clothes and stayed for the next four years,"" she said. Police said Clarkson then started to claim he could not access his bank account and was in debt. He sent her emails claiming to be from financial institutions and produced fake paperwork which claimed he had money in another account to pay her back. Ms Szombara said: ""He took over the rent for my house. I ended up over Â£7,000 in rent arrears and my council tax wasn't getting paid. ""It got to the stage we were living off of nothing. I was so stressed. ""I did every hour going at my work to be left with nothing. I had a lovely house and I lost everything."" The fraud extended to parents, who also handed over money to Clarkson. They lost the home they owned as a result of the fraud. ""At the end of the day I was still young enough to work and get all my money back - my mum and dad weren't at the end of the day. ""What he had took was their pension fund that they had put back. They lost their house, they only had a couple of years left on their mortgage."" Ms Szombara and her parents ended up homeless for six weeks. She added: ""I was embarrassed and ashamed that I got my mum and dad involved... They worked all their days."" She said they only contacted the police after Clarkson was convicted of a fraudulent crime, committed before the couple met. He was jailed for 42 months in February after being convicted of stealing Â£60,000 from Ms Szombara and her parents between 2010 and 2014. But Ms Szombara believes the figure was closer to Â£97,000. ""My mum died before he was sentenced for this so she didn't get to see him being sent to prison,"" she said. ""It nearly ripped our family apart. I hate what he's done to my family."" Warning people to be on the alert, Ms Szombara said: ""My advice would be to be really cautious with everybody. ""Check email addresses are related to the company. Throughout the four years we were together I never met his family so always check someone's background."" Det Sup Nicola Shepherd warned people to be vigilant Police say romance fraud is largely unreported due to victims' feelings of embarrassment, lack of evidence or a feeling it might have been their fault. Nevertheless, figures from April to December last year show the number of reported fraud incidents, including romance scams, increased by 21% from 6,106 the previous year to 7,398. Officers are highlighting the type of fraud as part of a national acquisitive crime campaign, which will run for four weeks. Their advice includes never sharing or exchanging personal information which can be used by fraudsters to obtain credit. People are also being urged never to send money or bank details to someone they have met online. Det Supt Nicola Shepherd said: ""Criminals can be extremely convincing and they prey on people who are emotionally vulnerable, particularly online. ""It can be easy to get caught up with the attention you receive but it's important to stop and think if a stranger's actions are genuine.""

"BA flight lands in Edinburgh by mistakeThe mistake only became apparent when the ""welcome to Edinburgh"" announcement was made.","Edinburgh or DÃ¼sseldorf? Spot the difference A British Airways flight destined for DÃ¼sseldorf in Germany has landed in Edinburgh by mistake, after the flight paperwork was submitted incorrectly. The passengers only realised the error when the plane landed and the ""welcome to Edinburgh"" announcement was made. The plane, which started at London's City Airport, was then redirected and landed in DÃ¼sseldorf. WDL Aviation ran the BA flight through a leasing deal. BA said it was working with WDL to find out why it filed the wrong flight plan. ""We have apologised to customers for this interruption to their journey and will be contacting them all individually,"" BA said in a statement. On its final flight on Sunday, the plane flew to Edinburgh and back so it seems that someone at WDL mistakenly repeated the same flight plan for the next day, according to BA. When the crew arrived at London City airport on Monday it is thought that they saw Edinburgh on the flight plan from the day before and followed the old flight route. German firm WDL said it was ""working closely with the authorities to investigate how the obviously unfortunate mix-up of flight schedules could occur"". ""At no time has the safety of passengers been compromised. We flew the passengers on the flight with number BA3271 to DÃ¼sseldorf after the involuntary stopover in Edinburgh,"" it said. BA declined to say how many passengers were affected by the mistake. Sophie Cooke, a 24-year-old management consultant, travels from London to DÃ¼sseldorf each week for work. She said when the pilot first made the announcement that the plane was about to land in Edinburgh everyone assumed it was a joke. She asked the cabin crew if they were serious. The pilot then asked passengers to raise their hands if they wanted to go to DÃ¼sseldorf. Everyone raised their hands. ""The pilot said he had no idea how it had happened. He said it had never happened before and that the crew was trying to work out what we could do."" Sophie said the plane sat on the tarmac at Edinburgh for two-and-a-half hours, before flying onto DÃ¼sseldorf. ""It became very frustrating. The toilets were blocked and they ran out of snacks. It was also really stuffy,"" she said. By Simon Browning, BBC transport producer It is hugely unusual for passengers to board a flight and then arrive at the wrong destination - and it presents lots of uncomfortable questions about procedure and standards. The flight was operated by a German aviation business on behalf of BA. Do they follow the same operational protocols that BA passengers would expect? Why wasn't a passenger announcement made before take-off saying ""the weather in Edinburgh is fine and the flight will last one hour"". If it had, they could have saved a lot of complication. For the passengers involved, will they get compensation for the delay? And ultimately - what does this do for trust in BA that such a mistake can be made? Passengers complained about the error on Twitter, with one person called Son Tran saying it felt ""like an honest mistake"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

New brain cells made throughout life,"People keep making new brain cells throughout their lives (well at least until the age of 97), according to a study on human brains. The idea has been fiercely debated, and it used to be thought we were born with all the brain cells we will ever have. The researchers at the University of Madrid also showed that the number of new brain cells tailed off with age. And it falls dramatically in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease - giving new ideas for treating the dementia. Most of our neurons - brain cells that send electrical signals - are indeed in place by the time we are born. Studies on other mammals have found new brains cells forming later in life, but the extent of ""neurogenesis"" in the human brain is still a source of debate. The study,published in Nature Medicine,,externallooked at the brains of 58 deceased people who were aged between 43 and 97. The focus was on the hippocampus - a part of the brain involved in memory and emotion. It is the part of the brain that you need, to remember where you parked the car. Neurons do not emerge in the brain fully formed, but have to go through a process of growing and maturing. The researchers were able to spot immature or ""new"" neurons in the brains that they examined. Immature (red) and mature (blue) neurons in the hippocampus in a 68 year-old. In healthy brains there was a ""slight decrease"" in the amount of this neurogenesis with age. Researcher Dr Maria Llorens-Martin told BBC News: ""I believe we would be generating new neurons as long as we need to learn new things. ""And that occurs during every single second of our life."" Rules of memory 'beautifully' rewritten Puzzle solving 'won't stop mental decline' But there was a different story in the brains from Alzheimer's patients. The number of new neurons forming fell from 30,000 per millimetre to 20,000 per millimetre in people at the beginning of Alzheimer's. Dr Llorens-Martin said: ""That's a 30% reduction in the very first stage of the disease. ""It's very surprising for us, it's even before the accumulation of amyloid beta [a hallmark of Alzheimer's] and probably before symptoms, it's very early."" Alzheimer's disease remains untreatable, but the main focus of research has been targeting clumps of amyloid beta in the brain. However, even last week more trials using this approach have failed and the latest study suggests there may be something happening even earlier in the course of the disease. Dr Llorens-Martin says understanding why there is a decrease in neurogenesis could lead to new treatments in both Alzheimer's and normal ageing. But she says the next stage of research will probably require looking in the brains of people while they are still alive, to see what is happening over time. Dr Rosa Sancho, the head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""While we start losing nerve cells in early adulthood, this research shows that we can continue to produce new ones even into our 90s. ""Alzheimer's radically accelerates the rate at which we lose nerve cells and this research provides convincing evidence that it also limits the creation of new nerve cells. ""Larger studies will need to confirm these findings and explore whether they could pave the way for an early test to flag those most at risk of the disease.""

Life ban for keeper who punched referee,"Goalkeeper Aaron Wick has attended hypnotherapy classes for anger issues A goalkeeper who knocked out a referee during a game has pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm. Aaron Wick, 36, from Horsford United FC hit Karl Smith during a Sunday league game at Feltwell FC in September. Magistrates were told the referee's cheekbone was broken and repaired with a permanent metal plate. Wick, of Staithe Street, Wells, Norfolk, has been banned from playing for life by the Football Association (FA). The court at King's Lynn heard the attack followed earlier disputes over the referee's decisions. Mr Smith told Norfolk County FA, in an independent report, matters came to a head when he awarded a penalty to Feltwell. The referee was hit with such force he was ""unable to remember all the events of the game"". ""I cannot remember what was said but I was making a note in my notebook to record the score, the next thing I remember is a policeman kneeling next to me asking if I was OK,"" he said. At the time, his notebook had recorded a score of 3-0 against Horsford - who play in Division 3 of the Anglian Combination league - and two lines against Wick's name. ""All this was within the first 35 minutes of the game,"" Mr Smith added. Fans prevented Wick from leaving the pitch and, when police arrived, he immediately admitted what he had done, the court heard. Defending, Ruth Johnson said Wick had tried to make amends, including attending hypnotherapy for his aggression. Wick's disciplinary record included 10 cautions and misconduct for physical contact against a match official in 2015. He will be sentenced at a later date. Referee attack during Sunday league match.

Potholes mean marathon now called 'multi-terrain',"Potholes on the road used for the marathon A road marathon held for more than 15 years has been reclassified as a ""multi-terrain"" event because the course has so many potholes. A stretch of the Cape Wrath Challenge Marathon is held on single track road near Durness, on the north Sutherland coast in the Scottish Highlands. Scottish Athletics has asked organisers to describe it as an off-road event due to the state of the road. Organisers have alerted runners to the change ahead of this year's marathon. The popular race forms part of a festival of running taking place from 12-18 May, and is already full. The stretch of single track public road provides access to Cape Wrath Lighthouse. Maintenance of the road involves an agreement between Highland Council, a local bus operator and the Ministry of Defence (MoD), which owns land at Cape Wrath. Durness Active Health, the charity which organises the challenge, said: ""Runners who have competed on the course will be aware of how poor the road surface is and Scottish Athletics have now advised us that the Cape Wrath Challenge Marathon course no longer qualifies as a marathon course due to its 'rough and broken running surface'. ""IAAF requirements are for races to be held on sealed road surfaces."" The marathon is held at Cape Wrath on the north Sutherland coast The charity went on: ""Whilst we know that this may not be an issue for the majority of runners, we felt it important to highlight this as soon as possible in case entrants were relying upon their completion of the race to qualify them for entry to other marathons later in the season."" It said its 10km and half marathon were unaffected by the change. The charity added: ""We apologise if you have entered the marathon and this is an important issue for you."" Scottish Athletics said: ""The race has now been given a permit as a 'multi-terrain marathon' as it did not quite meet the requirements set by the IAAF as a 'road marathon'. ""We've been working with the organisers and all the events they want to stage are happening."" Highland Council said the single track was among 4,000 miles (6,437km) of road across its area that it was responsible for. A spokeswoman said: ""Agreement was reached a few years back with the local bus operator and the MoD that if the council supplied materials that the bus operator would transport materials to Cape Wrath and the MoD would carry out repairs. ""Materials have been supplied by the council as requested.""

Rock enigma Scott Walker dies aged 76,"Walker was a reclusive and often contradictory figure Scott Walker, one of the most enigmatic and influential figures in rock history, has died at the age of 76. The US star found fame as a teen idol in The Walker Brothers, scoring hits with The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore and Make It Easy On Yourself. But his sonorous baritone hinted at something deeper - and his darker, experimental solo albums tackled the complexities of love, sex and death. Walker's death was confirmed by his current record label, 4AD. In a statement, they called the singer ""one of the most revered innovators at the sharp end of creative music,external"". Tributes paid to 'genius' Scott Walker BBC 6 Music celebrates Scott Walker Radiohead's Thom Yorke was among those paying tribute, describing Walker as ""a huge influence on Radiohead and myself, showing me how I could use my voice and words"". He first found fame as part of the Walker Brothers Born Noel Scott Engel in Ohio, 1943, Walker initially pursued a career as an actor, before hooking up with John Maus and Gary Leeds to form the misleadingly-named Walker Brothers. After a false start in the US, they relocated to England, where they caused a huge sensation, scoring number one hits with Make It Easy On Yourself and The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore. For a while, the band were as big as the Beatles, greeted by screaming fans everywhere they went. ""It was fantastic for the first couple of albums or so but it really wears you down,"" Walker told the BBC's Culture Show in 2006, ""Touring in those days was very primitive. It was really a lot of hard work. And you couldn't find anything good to eat. The hours were unbelievable."" At the height of their fame in 1967, when Walker was still considered a heart-throb and a potential superstar, he called time on the band and ran away to a monastery on the Isle of Wight. Not, as rumour had it, because of a nervous breakdown, but to study Gregorian chant. He remained disillusioned with the industry until his girlfriend introduced him to the music of Jacques Brel, whose literate, passionate torch songs inspired him to embark on a solo career. Walker's first four solo albums, Scott to Scott 4, juxtaposed lush, orchestral pop with dark existentialism; and his lyrics were frequently scattered with characters from society's margins - prostitutes, transvestites, suicidal thinkers and even Joseph Stalin. ""He took music to a place that it hasn't actually ever been since,"" said musician Brian Eno who, like Jarvis Cocker and David Bowie, cites Walker as a key influence. Amid falling sales, Walker staged a brief, largely unsuccessful reunion with the Brothers in the mid-70s; then used a lucrative deal with Virgin Records to pursue some of his most abstract musical ideas on 1984's Climate of Hunter. The record divided fans and critics - it was reputedly Virgin's lowest-selling album of all time - and Walker bowed out of music and the public eye for almost a decade. ""A friend of mine says I'm not a recluse, I'm just low-key,"" said the singer about his extended absence. ""Generally if I've got nothing to say, it's pointless to be around."" This video can not be played Highlights from the Songs of Scott Walker Prom. When Walker returned in the mid-90s, it was with Tilt, a collection of fraught, uncompromising tone poems that marked a new creative chapter. ""Imagine Andy Williams reinventing himself as Stockhausen,"" wrote The Guardian's Simon Hattenstone ina profile of the singer,external. Walker went on to collaborate with Pulp, producing the 2001 album We Love Life, and recently completed the score to Natalie Portman's film Vox Lux. In 2017, the BBC paid tribute to the star with aProms concertat the Royal Albert Hall. Musician Richard Hawley told the BBC in 2017 that Walker was ""one of the greatest singers of all time"". ""You think he's singing something quite simple,"" he said. ""You think you can sing along in the bath. But when you actually sit down and analyse what he's doing, it's unbelievable."" Upon hearing of the star's death, poet Ian McMillan likened Walker's voice to ""a cathedral lit by a sunset."" Midge Ure of Ultravox described him as ""the man with the mahogany voice""; while singerMarc Almond said,externalhe was ""absolutely saddened [and] shocked"" by the news. ""He gave me so much inspiration, so much I owe to him and modelled on him even down to my early hair cut and dark glasses,"" he added.

Apple launches its own credit card,"This video can not be played WATCH: Apple announces new services Apple has unveiled its new TV streaming platform, Apple TV+, at a star-studded event in California. Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey were among those who took to the stage at Apple's headquarters to reveal their involvement in TV projects commissioned by the tech giant. The platform will include shows from existing services like Hulu and HBO. Apple also announced that it would be launching a credit card, gaming portal and enhanced news app. The event was held in California and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook was clear from the start that the announcements would be about new services, not new devices. It is a change of direction for the 42-year-old company. Steve Carell, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston There had been much anticipation about Apple's predicted foray into the TV streaming market, dominated by the likes of Amazon and Netflix. The Apple TV+ app was unveiled by Steven Spielberg and will launch in the autumn. Spielberg will himself be creating some material for the new platform, he said. Other stars who took to the stage included Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Jason Momoa, Alfre Woodard, comedian Kumail Nanjiani and Big Bird from Sesame Street. The app will be made available on rival devices for the first time, coming to Samsung, LG, Sony and Vizio smart TVs as well as Amazon's Firestick and Roku. Oprah Winfrey spoke of the potential of a book club on Apple TV+. The subscription fee was not announced, and notably absent from the launch line-up was Netflix, which had already ruled itself out of being part of the bundle. ""The test for Apple will be, can new content separate them out from their competitors and can they commission and deliver on fresh new content that can reach audiences in the same way that Stranger Things has for Netflix for example?"" commented Dr Ed Braman, an expert in film and production at the University of York. The physical version of the card is made of titanium and does not have a card number or signature space on it. The Apple Card credit card will launch in the US this summer. There will be both an iPhone and physical version of the card, with a cashback incentive on every purchase. The credit card will have no late fees, annual fees or international fees, said Apple Pay VP Jennifer Bailey. It has been created with the help of Goldman Sachs and MasterCard. The firm also revealed a news service, Apple News+, which will include more than 300 magazine titles including Marie Claire, Vogue, New Yorker, Esquire, National Geographic and Rolling Stone. The LA Times and the Wall Street Journal will also be part of the platform, the firm said. It added that it will not track what users read or allow advertisers to do so. Apple News+ will cost $9.99 (Â£7.50) per month and is available immediately in the US and Canada. It will come to Europe later in the year. Unlike TV+, the news platform will only be available on Apple devices. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Apple Arcade will offer 100 games not available elsewhere. A new games platform, Apple Arcade, will offer over 100 exclusive games from the app store which will all be playable offline, in contrast withGoogle's recently announced streaming platform Stadia. It will be rolled out across 150 countries in the autumn but no subscription prices were given. in 2018 analyst firm IHS Markit valued the global gaming market on iOS, Apple's operating system, at $33.5bn. There is space within that market for a platform like Apple Arcade which is not financed by in-app purchases or advertising, said IHS director of games research Piers Harding-Rolls. ""Apple's decision to move up the games value chain with a new, curated subscription service and to support the development of exclusive games for its Arcade platform is a significant escalation of the company's commitment to the games market,"" he said. ""Apple joins the other technology companies Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon and others in investing directly in games content and services."" Apple is making an aggressive push into several markets in which, thanks to sheer scale alone, it immediately becomes a massive player. Its TV service has been long in the making, and Apple has amassed a roster of big stars, as expected. A bigger test will be how creative those ideas will be - a lot of Netflix's success has been about finding new talent, not throwing money at already famous names. I also have reservations about how many boundaries Apple will be prepared to push with its creative endeavours: if it's as controlling with its television as it is with its brand, it will create a catalogue bereft of risk-taking. But TV is just a small part of what Apple is going for here. It wants (and needs) to turn its devices into the portal through which you do everything else - TV/film, gaming, reading the news... and you'd presume other things in the very near future. The announcement of a credit card shows how far Apple is prepared to go to make sure life is experienced through your iPhone. As Oprah put it on stage: ""They're in a billion pockets, y'all."" Apple blames China for sales forecast cut Is Apple making China a scapegoat? Just how bad is it for Apple?

White House roasts critics over Mueller,"Sarah Sanders lashed out at Donald Trump's critics on Monday for trying to take down the Republican president The White House has assailed President Donald Trump's critics after he was cleared of Russian election collusion. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told cable morning shows that Mr Trump is happy for the full report by special counsel Robert Mueller to be released. She said the summary of the findings issued by the attorney general amounted to a full vindication of the president. Mr Mueller's long-awaited report, however, stops short of exonerating Mr Trump of obstruction of justice. It was the culmination of a nearly two-year investigation that saw some of the president's closest former aides prosecuted and, in some cases, imprisoned, though not for collusion with Russia. This video can not be played Mueller report: One summary, two interpretations White House aides took to the airwaves on Monday to depict the president as the victim of an inquiry that should never have been allowed. When asked whether Mr Trump would support the release of the full report, Mrs Sanders told NBC News' Today programme: ""He's more than happy for any of this stuff to come out."" Speaking on CNN later on Monday, Mrs Sanders said it was ""outrageous"" that Democrats and journalists had spent two years portraying the president as an agent of a foreign power. ""That's equivalent to treason,"" said the press secretary. ""That's punishable by death in this country and that is outrageous."" Mrs Sanders said the ""obscene lie"" was used to try ""to overthrow the president of the United States"". Key lines from the summary - and what they really mean All you need to know about Trump and Russia The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words White House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Monday called on Democrat Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, to step down. ""He ought to resign today,"" she told Fox News. ""He has been on every TV show 50 times a day for practically the last two years promising Americans that the president would be impeached or indicted."" Allow Twitter content?

""It was a complete and total exoneration,"" Mr Trump declared on Sunday, even though the report specifically states that he has not been fully exonerated. Speaking at Palm Beach International Airport in Florida, he said: ""It's a shame that our country had to go through this. ""To be honest, it's a shame that your president has had to go through this. Before I even got elected it began and it began illegally."" The Republican president said the inquiry was an ""illegal takedown that failed"". In his four-page summary released on Sunday, Trump-appointed Attorney General William Barr wrote: ""The special counsel did not find that any US person or Trump campaign official conspired or knowingly co-ordinated with Russia."" But on the issue of whether justice was obstructed, Mr Mueller's report says: ""While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" Read Barr's full summary of the report Mueller hopefuls react to report Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Mr Trump still faces about a dozen other investigations. These include a federal inquiry in New York into possible election law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses, and possible misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee. Congress is also continuing its own inquiries, mostly in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham summed up the conservative response on Monday, telling reporters Mr Trump was stronger today than ever. ""This cloud has been removed,"" he said. ""To those wanting an outcome of removing Trump, you're going to be disappointed."" Opposition Democrats are demanding full access to Mr Mueller's report. The Democratic Chair of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee,Jerry Nadler, said he would ask Mr Barr to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee ""in the near future"",externalover ""very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department"". Russia has denied being involved in hacking to influence the 2016 US election result. America's most mysterious public figure How Russia's media saw the Mueller report Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov mocked suggestions there had been collusion, saying: ""I recall the words of the Chinese philosopher who said that it's hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it's not there. Well, centuries pass and unfortunately they still don't understand that across the ocean."" Alexei Pushkov, a member of Russia's upper house, tweeted:""Democrats, Russophobes and leading media created a virtual conspiracy,externalwhich existed only in their heads and in headlines, and nowhere else."" Legally, the House Judiciary Committee will want to get its hands on the full Mueller report. They will want to see why Robert Mueller felt he couldn't exonerate the president on obstruction of justice. And remember, obstruction of justice is one of the ""high crimes and misdemeanours"" that can lead to impeachment. There will be an endless back and forth over that. And I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised if the subpoenas start to fly. Committees have the right to call people and papers. They are bound to flex their muscles as much as they can. They want to play this long. They want to damage the president. To prosecute the president for obstruction of justice there would have needed to be evidence of intent to obstruct. So even though the president fired former FBI chief James Comey and unleashed regular torrents of abuse on Twitter about the investigation, if his only motivation for those acts was to vent his spleen rather than break the law, then he's done nothing wrong legally.

Charles and Camilla make history in Cuba,"This video can not be played Prince Charles and Camilla arrived from Barbados The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have made history by becoming the first members of the royal family to visit Cuba in an official capacity. Prince Charles and Camilla's trip is being seen as an attempt to help form closer ties between the UK and Cuba, which were foes during the Cold War. The couple attended a wreath-laying ceremony for Cuba's national hero, the essayist and poet Jose Marti. They are due to join the country's president for an official dinner. Prince Charles and Camilla were greeted near an image of late revolutionary hero Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara The couple were taken on a tour of Old Havana Later this week they will be joined by Commonwealth minister Lord Ahmad, who is flying to the country to represent the UK government. His presence is an indication of how important Downing Street views the four-day Cuban visit and its potential to develop new avenues with a country that has already begun the process of opening up economically and socially. After the couple stepped on to Cuban soil from the UK ministerial jet RAF Voyager on Sunday, there were brief handshakes from Cuban officials before they were taken to the wreath-laying ceremony. The couple attended a wreath-laying ceremony for Cuba's national hero, poet Jose Marti Prince Charles met boxers training at a gym in Old Havana Duchess of Cornwall greets well-wishers during a guided tour of Old Havana Prince Charles stood in silent contemplation as a large wreath of roses was laid at the open-air monument in Havana's Revolution Square. Monday began with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall going on a tour of Old Havana. The royal couple met locals and tourists during the walkabout among the city's 18th-century colonial Spanish buildings. Prince Charles later met boxers training at a gym, while his wife visited a maternity home. The royal couple arrived from Barbados, one of five Commonwealth realms they have visited. St Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, St Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines have also featured on their tour. The royal couple visited Grenada earlier in their trip Fractious relations between Cuba and the West stem back to before the 1800s. Cuba - a former Spanish colony - was ceded to the US in 1898 and four years later became independent under US protection. But at the height of the Cold War in 1959, a guerrilla army led by Fidel Castro defeated the US-backed Batista government, establishing a communist state. The armed revolution prompted a US trade embargo, known as the blockade or ""el bloqueo"" in Spanish. Coupled with similarities of ideology, the embargo pushed Cuba into the arms of the Soviet Union. The US discovered Soviet nuclear missiles on Cuba in 1962, which almost led to a nuclear war. Cuba country profile Prince Charles won't speak out when he's king A royal visit to a land of princes Prince Charles 'made me pick up litter' In 2014, after 50 years of severed ties,the US and Cuba announced a move to normalise diplomatic relations. But in 2017, US President Donald Trumprolled back some of the restrictions eased by his predecessor. The BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said this week's visit showed the UK was in a ""strikingly different"" position to the US. British diplomats ""clearly feel it's time to send a message of encouragement to the Cuban government to move further along the road to economic and political reform,"" he said. In recent years, private enterprise in Cuba has been encouraged, although it has been scaled back amid fears the reforms were fuelling inequality. The prince and his wife will also be meeting members of the Buena Vista Social Club at a recording studio in Havana. The group became worldwide celebrities when their 1997 album became a surprise global hit and Grammy award winner.

What amendments are MPs voting on?,"MPs are set to vote on a series of amendments to a neutral government motion on Brexit. Seven amendments were tabled and Speaker John Bercow selected three to be debated and voted on. MPs are expected to vote on the amendments from 22:00 GMT tonight. Notes the proposed alternatives to the prime minister's Brexit deal Calls on the government to ""provide sufficient parliamentary time this week"" for indicative votes Indicative votes are where MPs vote on a series of options designed to test the will of Parliament to see what, if anything, commands a majority. What are indicative votes? Takes power to control business in the Commons away from the government on Wednesday, to allow MPs to put forward business motions relating to Brexit - most likely indicative votes If more than one business motion is submitted, Bercow will decide which one has ""precedence"" Whatever is happening in the Commons on Wednesday will be interrupted at 14:00 GMT. MPs will have one hour to debate the business motion before moving onto the main business This amendment has cross-party support including from Conservative Dominic Grieve and Labour's Hilary Benn, who is also chair of the Brexit Committee. If the UK is seven days away from leaving without a deal, government must allow MPs to vote on whether to leave without a deal or request an extension ""to give time for Parliament to determine a different approach"" Seeks a two-year extension to provide time for a referendum on accepting the withdrawal agreement or remaining in the EU This amendment is also supported by Independent Group MPs. Who are the Independent Group and what do they want? Recalls the result of the referendum and that 85% of votes were cast for parties to implement Brexit in 2017 which committed to abiding by that result in their manifestos Reaffirms a commitment to honour the result of the referendum Mr Quince's amendment has support from DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds and members of the European Research Group including Jacob Rees-Mogg. If a deal is not passed by Thursday, the government has to set out how it will ensure the UK does not leave without a deal on 12 April, ""including by seeking an extension to Article 50 to take account of any conclusions reached by the House"" This could be seen as complementary to the Letwin amendment, as it gives space to reflect on the results of indicative votes Her amendment has support from Conservatives Oliver Letwin, Caroline Spelman and Nick Boles - as well as from Labour MPs and the Independent Group. ""Make all necessary preparations"" for a referendum between leaving the EU ""on terms to be determined by Parliament"" or remaining in the EU This is different to the Lib Dem amendment which calls for a referendum between the prime minister's deal and remain Their amendment also has support from the Liberal Democrats.

Station expansion plans to be revealed,"Passenger numbers at Waverley Station are expected to double to more than 49 million by 2048 Network Rail is to begin consultation on a long-term development plan for Waverley Station in Edinburgh. Passenger numbers at the station are expected to double to more than 49 million by 2048. The Waverley Masterplan will be led by a partnership of Network Rail and City of Edinburgh Council. A key element is likely to be a mezzanine floor above existing platforms to create more space for passengers. The plan's backers believe the station in its current form will be unable to cope with projected passenger volumes. Rail passengers and the Edinburgh public will be asked for their views, with the final plan being published in September. Work at Waverley is expected to be phased over 30 years and it is hoped the station will be fully functioning and accessible to all throughout the development. Earlier design suggestions imply a larger footprint for the station and a higher roofline Norrie Courts, director of stations for Network Rail, outlined the key problems with the station's current set up. He identified connectivity, accessibility - especially from the Old Town, Waverley Bridge and Princes Street - and the fact that the station ""doesn't have much presence"". Mr Courts told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme passengers ""want easy access to the station, they want good connectivity, they want good wayfinding, they want clean toilets, they want WiFi."" He said the project would try to minimise disruption to passengers and keep the station operational, safe and secure. Lesley Macinnes, transport committee convener of the council said the station was ""pivotal"" to the city's public transport offering. She added: ""With a rapidly increasing population and ever more visitors coming to the capital, it's necessary that we rethink the way we approach transport. In the face of such pressures we need to facilitate rail travel as a reliable and efficient choice for commuters - as well as residents and visitors.""

'Bad deal' for Brits from broadband giants,"Many Britons were frustrated by the service they received from their ISP, found Which? Britons who get their broadband from the UK's biggest suppliers are the ""most likely"" to be getting a bad deal, reports Which? The consumer group's latest broadband satisfaction survey places the big providers at the bottom of rankings for service. Customers complained about slow speeds, poor value for money, connection dropouts and general service problems. TalkTalk and Sky are the two firms at the bottom of the satisfaction survey. The UK's four big providers, BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin, supply 90% of the UK's net-using homes with broadband. The Which? results put TalkTalk at the bottom of the table for customer satisfaction and say it ""failed to score well in any category"". Which? figures suggest that TalkTalk customers are most likely to experience slow browsing speeds and connection dropouts. In a statement, TalkTalk said the results were ""disappointing"". ""We are already seeing more customers than ever staying with us as we continue rolling-out major service improvements,"" it said. TalkTalk said it had now introduced online tools to help customers resolve queries and questions more quickly. And it pointed out that Which? had also picked its home wi-fi hub as a ""best buy"". BT, meanwhile, pointed out it had received fewer complaints about its broadband, home phone and mobile services than in the 2018 survey. It still had ""more work to do"", BT added, and was continuing to invest money in customer services Sky declined to comment on the survey results. Zen Internet came out top of the satisfaction table, with a score of 87%. By comparison Vodafone and Virgin had 58%, BT 51% and Sky and TalkTalk 50%. The bottom three all managed minor improvements in ratings over their 2018 result. Many people could receive faster speeds, Ofcom has found ""It's outrageous that the biggest providers are still letting their customers down with shoddy broadband, especially when we know that longstanding customers are the most likely to be overpaying,"" said Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which? Previous Which? research, released in December, suggests customers who stick with one supplier and do not push for a better deal could be overpaying. And about 70% of the 8,000 subscribers surveyed by Which? in January, for its 2019 report, said they had been with their current broadband provider for more than three years. Ms Hitchins said customers who were unhappy should haggle for a better deal from their existing supplier or switch to a new one to cut their broadband bill. ""You could get better service and save hundreds of pounds a year,"" she said. Analysis by Ofcom suggestsone in seven UK householdsis paying more than necessary for broadband and could receive faster services for the same or less money.

Majestic Wine to close stores amid rebrand,"Majestic Wine has announced plans to revamp its business by closing some of its 200 stores and concentrating on its online Naked Wines division. The change will also see the company being renamed Naked Wines. More details of the store closures - and any job losses - will be given in June along with its full-year results. Naked Wines was founded by entrepreneur Rowan Gormleyin 2008. It was bought by Majestic in 2015 for Â£70m and Mr Gormley was given the top job. Naked is a subscription business that signs up customers for regular payments, and the plan is to expand the operation by releasing capital from Majestic. In its statement, Majestic said almost 45% of its business came from online with a further 20% from international sales. Mr Gormley said: ""It is clear that Naked Wines has the potential for strong sustainable growth, and we will deliver the best results for our shareholders, customers, people and suppliers by focusing all our energies on delivering that potential. ""We also believe that a transformed Majestic business does have the potential to be a long-term winner, but that we risk not maximising the potential of Naked if we try to do both. ""Where we have no choice but to close stores we will aim to minimise job losses by migration into Naked."" The company added it was on target to hit sales of Â£500m this year, and profits were also on track. It said Naked continued to perform well and regular customer payments were expected to increase by 10-15% this financial year. The new plan includes raising the amount it spends on attracting new customers to Naked from Â£20m currently to Â£26m by next year. As a result of its planned increase in investment, Majestic said it would review its dividend in June this year. Shares in Majestic fell 8% at the start of trading. Analysts at Liberum called the move ""a drastic and unexpected change in strategy"". By Jamie Goode, Wineanorak.com Majestic Wine is an enduring and well-loved brand and it is a real shame to think it is being replaced by Naked. It was a category-buster in its day - they took out-of-town sites, with parking, that weren't too expensive, and you were forced to buy wine in bulk, in multiples of 12, for licensing reasons. Another good thing about the business from a taste point of view was they used to buy wines directly from producers - a winery would make a wine and Majestic would buy it. In the past few years, under Rowan Gormley it has shifted, moving for the first time into selling wines under its own label. That's good for margin but has taken the shine off the brand. Mr Gormley clearly sees the future - and a better margin - with his own creation, Naked Wines. But while Naked does have some some interesting wines, it has some very ordinary ones too.

Automation 'could replace 1.5 million jobs',"Women are at the highest risk of seeing their jobs taken over by robots Some 1.5 million people in England are at high risk of losing their jobs to automation, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It says 70% of the roles at high risk of automation are currently held by women. Part-timers and the young are the next most at risk. The ONS analysed the jobs of 20 million people in 2017 and found 7.4% of these were at high risk of being replaced. It has developed a ""bot"",externalto show the risks for particular occupations. The ONS defines automation as tasks currently carried out by workers being replaced with technology. That could mean computer programs, algorithms, or even robots. The three occupations with the highest probability of automation are waiters and waitresses, shelf fillers and elementary sales occupations, all of which are low-skilled or routine. Those at the lowest risk are medical practitioners, higher education teaching professionals, and senior professionals in education. ""It is not so much that robots are taking over, but that routine and repetitive tasks can be carried out more quickly and efficiently by an algorithm written by a human, or a machine designed for one specific function,"" the ONS said. It added it had looked into the automation of jobs as it could have an impact on the labour market, economy and society. The ONS says there are fewer jobs at risk of automation now than was thought in 2011, from 8.1% to 7.4%, but the proportion of jobs at low and medium risk of automation has risen. It says the exact reasons for the decrease in the proportion of roles at high risk of automation are unclear, but it is possible that automation of some jobs has already happened: ""For instance, self-checkouts at supermarkets are now a common sight, reducing the need to have as many employees working at checkouts."" The statistics body says that while the overall number of jobs has increased, the majority of these are in occupations that are at low or medium risk. That suggests, it says, that the labour market may be changing to jobs that require more complex and less routine skills. Maja Korica, associate professor of organisation at Warwick Business School, said: ""What is most concerning is the speed at which the biggest players are introducing these changes. ""If you take a company like Amazon, it introduced more than 50,000 new robots in 2017, a 100% increase from the previous year. Estimates suggest 20% of its workforce may already be made up of robots. ""Policymakers and business leaders need to be thinking about how they work together to deal with these problems."" By Jonty Bloom, business correspondent Automation is not just about robots or self-driving cars, it can also involve computer programs and algorithms, but the message from this analysis is clear: the better trained and educated you are the lower are the chances of you losing your job. So although all those self check-out terminals at your supermarket are taking a lot of work and jobs from shop staff, the head of marketing at Sainsbury's is probably safe; for now. It is routine and repetitive tasks that are better done by a machine, be it adding up long columns of numbers or filling boxes with baked beans, but it is also true that more and more complicated tasks can and are being broken down into a series of simple tasks, each of which can be done by a machine that needs no training, holidays, tea breaks or sick leave. So increasing numbers of factory workers are at threat of losing their jobs, even if they are highly skilled and that also means that the young are worst affected. After all, experience, qualifications and promotion all take time, the longer your career the more likely it is you are doing a job that is safe from the rise of the machines.

"Reinstate LGBT classes, says ex-Ofsted boss","This video can not be played The woman in charge of the trust running Parkfield school defends its LGBT rights teaching The head of a school trust embroiled in a row over classes about LGBT rights says staff have been left ""distraught"". The No Outsiders programme at Parkfield Community School in Birmingham has been paused after protests by parents. Hazel Pulley, chief executive officer of the trust which runs the school, said some staff had lost weight and were not sleeping. She added the situation had been the most ""challenging"" she has seen in 27 years in education. This video can not be played Parents claimed ""hundreds"" of pupils were kept out of school for a day There have been protests outside the school in Alum Rock over No Outsiders, with some parents claiming the lessons were age-inappropriate and incompatible with Islam. Ms Pulley, of Excelsior Multi-Academy Trust, confirmed its lessons have been temporarily stopped to allow for discussions with parents. The Leigh Trust has also said it would behalting lessons at four of its schoolsuntil reaching an agreement with parents. Latest news from the West Midlands ""The impact on staff has been tremendous,"" Ms Pulley said. ""The reason is because of the breakdown in the relation of trust which we have had for so long."" She said the No Outsiders lessons use a book featuring two mothers and their child, and depicts them doing ""normal things"". The idea is to show children how ""all families are different"". ""We are not teaching children about same sex couples in the sense of sexual relationships, what we do teach our children is that there are different families and that there are families with two mummies, two daddies."" This video can not be played Parents have been calling for No Outsiders to be stopped Ms Pulley said: ""During this period where we said we are putting No Outsiders on stop, we have made sure that in our curriculum and in our assemblies we do not mention the LGBT agenda, because that is the only way we felt parents could come into the room and start talking to us. ""We moved what we thought was the issue to one side but we can only do that for so long or otherwise, quite rightly, we will be seen as being discriminatory to one of the protected characteristics."" She said the programme can sit ""harmoniously"" with Islam, adding: ""In school they need to be educated to the laws of the land and at home they can follow their religion and that is fine; the two sit together."" Ofsted hasdeemed the lessons ""age-appropriate"". OnBBC Radio 4, its former chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw called for the classes to be reinstated, but said it is important parents are consulted.

Brexiteer jailed for egging Corbyn,"Jeremy Corbyn was attacked during a visit to a mosque and Muslim welfare centre in his constituency in north London A Brexit supporter who egged Jeremy Corbyn while yelling ""respect the vote"" has been jailed for 28 days. John Murphy, 31, admitted attacking the Labour leader with an egg following the MP's visit to a mosque in his Islington North constituency on 3 March. Mr Corbyn was ""shocked and surprised"" by the attack, which prompted his team to increase his security, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. Magistrates said Murphy had attacked ""our democratic process"". Murphy, from Barnet, north-west London, admitted the charge of assault by beating. Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot told Murphy, of Totteridge Common, Whetstone, a custodial sentence would send a clear message that ""attacks on MPs must stop"". Sentencing him to 28 days in jail, she said: ""An attack like this is an attack on our democratic process."" Malik Aldeiri, defending, blamed Murphy's actions on ""frustration and anger borne out of the political situation we find ourselves in"". Mr Aldeiri said: ""He felt he was making a statement. ""He believes his civil rights were violated and this was a demonstration by him against what he says is a failure by Parliament to adhere to his democratic vote."" This video can not be played The Labour leader was attacked by Brexit supporter John Murphy Mr Corbyn was with the Labour shadow home secretary Diane Abbott at the Muslim welfare centre at the time of the attack, a week after the party announced it would support a second referendum on the UK leaving the European Union, prosecutor Kevin Christie said. ""Suddenly, he felt a strike to the right side of his forehead and then realised someone had reached over his right shoulder and struck him,"" Mr Christie said. ""As he was struck he heard a male voice shouting 'respect the vote'."" Man charged over Jeremy Corbyn egging Brexit: What happens next? News and updates from across London Mr Corbyn had left the room to wash himself when he realised he had been struck by an egg. Murphy continued to shout ""respect the vote"" while being restrained by staff. Mr Corbyn, who was left with a red mark, noted Murphy's face was ""contorted"" with rage and he appeared ""very aggressive"". John Murphy said he was ""perfectly happy to go to jail"" In a victim impact statement he said: ""I was shocked and surprised when the assault occurred as I have always felt safe and secure at the Muslim Welfare House. ""The assault was completely unprovoked and threatening. ""Whilst I'm determined to make sure I'm able to interact with people as I always have, I now have to be more cautious."" In a statement written before he was sentenced, Murphy likened himself to civil rights protesters and said he was ""perfectly happy to go to jail"". He added: ""I'd rather be a rebel than a slave.""

Kezia Dugdale's homophobia claim 'absurd',"Kezia Dugdale said she was ""shocked and appalled"" by Stuart Campbell's tweet A blogger who has taken former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale to court said it was ""absurd"" to interpret one of his tweets as homophobic. Stuart Campbell, who runs the blog Wings Over Scotland, is suing the MSP for Â£25,000 after she criticised him in a newspaper column. The dispute stems from a piece written by Ms Dugdale in the Daily Record. Mr Campbell appeared as the first witness in the defamation case at Edinburgh Sheriff court on Monday. For live updates on Monday's proceedings follow@BBCPhilipSim,external. His remarks were posted on his Twitter feed on 3 March 2017 as he was live-tweeting about the Scottish Conservative conference. Pro-Scottish independence campaigner Mr Campbell wrote: ""Oliver Mundell is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Mundell's father, Scottish Secretary David Mundell,came out as gay in January 2016. Ms Dugdale wrote in her column in 2017 that she was ""shocked and appalled"" about what she described as ""homophobic tweets"". She added that ""such comments are of course not unique to the man who tweets as Wings Over Scotland"", saying the account ""spouts hatred and homophobia towards others"". Ms Dugdale latercalled on SNP politicians to ""shun"" Mr Campbellduring First Minister's Questions. Stuart Campbell runs the Wings Over Scotland blog Mr Campbell subsequently launched legal action, arguing that while his tweets could be ""rude"" he was ""absolutely not"" prejudiced, and saying Ms Dugdale had defamed him by suggesting he was homophobic. Ms Dugdale's legal team submitted to the court that the article was a ""fair and honest comment"" criticising Mr Campbell for ""giving voice to homophobic sentiments"". The UK Labour Party previously paid for Ms Dugdale's representation in court, but cut this off in September last year. Mr Campbell told the court that his tweet was making a ""commentary"" that Oliver Mundell was ""a very very poor public speaker"". He said: ""I don't think any intelligent person could honestly interpret that tweet as being homophobic."" Mr Campbell likened it to another online comment where the writer wished controversial columnist Katie Hopkins had never been born. The blogger agreed ""very much"" with his QC that it was unacceptable for someone to be mocked on the basis of their sexuality. He added that he was a ""firm advocate of equal rights for gay people"", saying anyone who had read his Twitter feed or website would find it ""ludicrous"" to think he was homophobic. While being questioned by Ms Dugdale's legal team, Mr Campbell said someone would have to be ""dishonest or stupid"" to think his tweet was homophobic. Mr Campbell was then asked if he thought Nicola Sturgeon was being ""dishonest or stupid"" in her response to the tweet during First Minister's Questions. He replied that he did not believe she made any ""specific reference"" to his tweet, but if the first minister believed it was homophobic then she was being stupid. The court examined a series of other tweets Mr Campbell had sent in the past, dealing with issues ranging from video games to gender self-identification. He denied any of them were evidence of homophobia or transphobia. Paul Kavanagh, author of the pro-independence blog Wee Ginger Dug, and director of Stonewall Scotland Colin Macfarlane were also called as witnesses. Mr Kavanagh told the court he personally did not think the 2017 Mundell tweet was homophobic, and had not seen anything on the Wings Over Scotland blog that he considered homophobic. He said that for a blogger, being called a homophobe was like being called a racist or a holocaust denier. He added that it ""destroys your credibility"" and makes it hard for you to ""reach no voters or people who are undecided."" ""It has a very damaging effect,"" he said. Meanwhile, Mr Macfarlane said he was ""disappointed"" by Mr Campbell's 2017 tweet, saying it was ""wholly unnecessary to reference David Mundell's sexuality"" and that it had been made the ""punchline"" of the tweet. Ms Dugdale is expected to give evidence on Tuesday, while the court heard that David Mundell had invoked parliamentary privilege and would not be appearing.

Seven hurt as Gaza rocket hits Israeli home,"This video can not be played Gaza rocket: Two children and an infant were among the injured Seven people have been injured after a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip hit a house belonging to a British-Israeli family in central Israel. The rocket came down at 05:25 (03:25 GMT) in the community of Mishmeret, 20km (12 miles) north of Tel Aviv. This is the furthest a Palestinian rocket has reached in Israel since the 2014 conflict with militants in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a trip to the US over the attack and vowed to respond with force. So far no-one has said they carried out the attack. The Israeli military accused the militant group Hamas, which controls Gaza, but a Hamas official said it had ""no interest"" in doing so. A week and a half ago, two rockets were launched towards Tel Aviv and nobody was hurt. The Israeli military responded with dozens of air strikes across Gaza, which injured four people. Hamas and Israeli officials later said those rockets had been fired ""by mistake"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the rocket that hit the house in Mishmeret was launched from Rafah in southern Gaza, about 120km (75 miles) away. The explosion from the rocket severely damaged the house and set it on fire. Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service said it had treated two women who were moderately wounded and five other people, including an infant, a three-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl, who had minor wounds.

The house belonged to Robert and Susan Wolf, two British-Israeli dual nationals who are originally from London. Mr Wolf told the Daily Telegraph newspaper thathe had been at home with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren when the rocket hit,external. ""If we hadn't got to the bomb shelter in time I would be burying all my family,"" he said. The blast also caused damage to at least one nearby home and several vehicles. Although the rocket triggered sirens in the Sharon and Emek Hefer regions, Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system was not activated. When asked for an explanation,an IDF spokesman told the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper,external: ""Iron Dome protects the areas in which it is stationed, according to operational situation assessments."" Intended to combat missiles launched from ranges of between 40km and 70km, each Iron Dome battery can protect an area of roughly 155 sq km. But the BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus says there is a limited number of batteries available and they need to be deployed correctly to meet the most likely threats. The failure to intercept this missile, he adds, is a reminder of the altogether greater challenge should Israel be engaged in a conflict on its northern borders, where the volume of Iranian and Hezbollah missiles might swamp its defensive systems. IDF spokeswoman Major Mika Lifshitz blamed Hamas, which has fought three wars with Israel since 2008. ""It's a Hamas rocket, itself made by Hamas,"" she said. ""It has an ability to reach more than 120km."" ""We see Hamas as responsible for all that happens in the Gaza Strip,"" she added. Cars parked near the house were damaged by fragments from the rocket Maj Lifshitz said the IDF was deploying two additional brigades to the area surrounding Gaza, and that there was a ""very limited"" calling up of reservists. The Israeli authorities have also closed the Kerem Shalom and Erez border crossings with Gaza, and closed roads and suspended agricultural work near the boundary fence with Gaza. Who are Hamas? Life in the Gaza Strip Prime Minister Netanyahu said in a statement: ""There was a criminal attack on the State of Israel, and we will respond forcefully."" The British ambassador to Israel, David Quarrey, said there could ""be no justification of any kind for this attack"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jason Greenblatt, the US special representative for international negotiations,wrote on Twitter,external: ""We condemn this violence from Gaza and affirm Israel's right to defend itself."" Hamas has not commented on the attack publicly, but an unnamed official told AFP news agency that ""no-one from the resistance movements, including Hamas, has an interest in firing rockets from the Gaza Strip towards the enemy"". The Times of Israel reported that the Hamas-run interior ministry in Gaza had launched an investigation,externalto determine who was behind the rocket launch. Islamic Jihad, another militant group, warned Israel against retaliatory strikes. ""[Its] leaders must know that we will respond forcefully to their aggression,"" he said. The timing of this rocket launch comes at a very sensitive time. The Israeli prime minister is fighting a close election campaign in which he is brandishing his security credentials.  He had just arrived in Washington, where he was due to meet President Trump twice and give a speech. He will now go once to the White House and then says he will return home ""to manage our actions from close at hand"". Already fears of an escalation were high with this week's anniversary of the start of protests at Gaza's boundary fence with Israel. Egyptian security officials - who've been trying to broker a longer-term ceasefire between Israel and Hamas - were due in Gaza this morning. Now, their efforts to bring quiet are in jeopardy.

"Automation 'could replace 1.5 million jobs'In England, the jobs of women, the young and part-time workers are most at risk from automation.","Women are at the highest risk of seeing their jobs taken over by robots Some 1.5 million people in England are at high risk of losing their jobs to automation, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It says 70% of the roles at high risk of automation are currently held by women. Part-timers and the young are the next most at risk. The ONS analysed the jobs of 20 million people in 2017 and found 7.4% of these were at high risk of being replaced. It has developed a ""bot"",externalto show the risks for particular occupations. The ONS defines automation as tasks currently carried out by workers being replaced with technology. That could mean computer programs, algorithms, or even robots. The three occupations with the highest probability of automation are waiters and waitresses, shelf fillers and elementary sales occupations, all of which are low-skilled or routine. Those at the lowest risk are medical practitioners, higher education teaching professionals, and senior professionals in education. ""It is not so much that robots are taking over, but that routine and repetitive tasks can be carried out more quickly and efficiently by an algorithm written by a human, or a machine designed for one specific function,"" the ONS said. It added it had looked into the automation of jobs as it could have an impact on the labour market, economy and society. The ONS says there are fewer jobs at risk of automation now than was thought in 2011, from 8.1% to 7.4%, but the proportion of jobs at low and medium risk of automation has risen. It says the exact reasons for the decrease in the proportion of roles at high risk of automation are unclear, but it is possible that automation of some jobs has already happened: ""For instance, self-checkouts at supermarkets are now a common sight, reducing the need to have as many employees working at checkouts."" The statistics body says that while the overall number of jobs has increased, the majority of these are in occupations that are at low or medium risk. That suggests, it says, that the labour market may be changing to jobs that require more complex and less routine skills. Maja Korica, associate professor of organisation at Warwick Business School, said: ""What is most concerning is the speed at which the biggest players are introducing these changes. ""If you take a company like Amazon, it introduced more than 50,000 new robots in 2017, a 100% increase from the previous year. Estimates suggest 20% of its workforce may already be made up of robots. ""Policymakers and business leaders need to be thinking about how they work together to deal with these problems."" By Jonty Bloom, business correspondent Automation is not just about robots or self-driving cars, it can also involve computer programs and algorithms, but the message from this analysis is clear: the better trained and educated you are the lower are the chances of you losing your job. So although all those self check-out terminals at your supermarket are taking a lot of work and jobs from shop staff, the head of marketing at Sainsbury's is probably safe; for now. It is routine and repetitive tasks that are better done by a machine, be it adding up long columns of numbers or filling boxes with baked beans, but it is also true that more and more complicated tasks can and are being broken down into a series of simple tasks, each of which can be done by a machine that needs no training, holidays, tea breaks or sick leave. So increasing numbers of factory workers are at threat of losing their jobs, even if they are highly skilled and that also means that the young are worst affected. After all, experience, qualifications and promotion all take time, the longer your career the more likely it is you are doing a job that is safe from the rise of the machines.

Israel strikes Gaza after rocket hits houseIsrael blamed the militant group Hamas after seven people were injured in a rocket attack.Middle East,"This video can not be played Israeli jets carried out several air strikes in Gaza after a rocket hit a home north of Tel Aviv Israel has carried out strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza, after a rocket attack on a house injured seven Israelis. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the office of Hamas's political leader and the group's military intelligence headquarters were among the targets. Gaza's health ministry said seven Palestinians were injured. Militants later launched a barrage of rockets towards southern Israeli towns despite reports of a ceasefire, triggering further Israeli strikes. So far no Palestinian militant group has said it fired the long-range rocket that hit the house in Mishmeret, north of Tel Aviv, on Monday morning. The Israeli military blamed Hamas, but one unnamed official from the group said it had ""no interest"" in doing so. The escalation follows months of tensions at the boundary fence between Gaza and Israel, and two weeks before Israel holds a general election. Israeli media report that the Israeli side of the border has been quiet since 03:15 (01:15 GMT), and that the last Israeli strike on Gaza took place at about 04:30. Overnight, Palestinian militants in Gaza fired more than 60 rockets and mortars towards Israel, according to the IDF. About 30 of the projectiles were launched after Hamas said it had accepted an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire agreement that would start at 22:00. Allow Twitter content?

No injuries were reported in Israel, but a home in the town of Sderot was hit by a rocket that did not explode. The IDF said, in response to the rocket fire, fighter jets and helicopters struck 15 targets in Gaza, including a Hamas military compound in the central town of Deir al-Balah. Gaza's health ministry did not report any casualties as a result of those strikes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would immediately go to the IDF's headquarters when he returned from a curtailed trip to the US on Tuesday. Before launching the strikes, the IDF deployed two additional brigades to southern Israel ""We'll deal with these issues,"" he said. ""We gave a very powerful response. Hamas needs to know that we won't hesitate to go in [to Gaza] and take any required steps."" Meanwhile, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan told Israeli Army Radio that ""rumours of a ceasefire are incorrect"". The BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says Mr Netanyahu may want to avoid an unpredictable escalation before a closely-fought general election, but he is under intense pressure to show he is taking decisive action against Hamas. A rocket launched from the Rafah area in southern Gaza hit a house in Mishmeret, about 120km (75 miles) to the north, damaging the building and setting it on fire. This video can not be played Gaza rocket: Two children and an infant were among the injured The Israeli ambulance service treated two women who were moderately wounded and five other people, including an infant, a three-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl, who had minor wounds. The house belonged to Robert and Susan Wolf, two British-Israeli dual nationals, who had been at home with their son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren. It was the furthest a rocket has reached in Israel since the 2014 conflict in Gaza. An IDF spokeswoman said Hamas - which has fought three wars with Israel since 2008 and is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, EU and UK - had manufactured the rocket and was to blame for its launch. The IDF said it had struck dozens of Hamas targets across Gaza on Monday evening - a response that Mr Netanyahu described as ""very powerful"". The targets included the office of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniya in Gaza City's Rimal district. There was no indication that Mr Haniya was inside at the time. Palestinians in Gaza City surveyed the damage after the overnight Israeli strikes The IDF also said it had bombed a five-storey building in Gaza City housing the offices of Hamas' Internal Security Service, and a three-storey building in the eastern Sabra district that was the ""secret headquarters"" of Hamas's General Security Forces, as well as its General Intelligence and Military Intelligence agencies. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, reported that two Palestinians were injured when jets fired missiles at a commercial building in central Gaza City, and that one other person was hurt in a strike in the eastern Shujaiya district. A Hamas website, The Palestinian Information Center, said blocks of flats, civilian facilities, agricultural land and ""resistance sites"" had been targeted. Gaza rocket destroys Israeli home.

BeyoncÃÂ© help boosts Louvre visitors,"BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z's Everything Is Love album was launched with a video shot in the Louvre A BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z music video helped the Louvre in Paris increase its visitors to a record 10.2 million in 2018. The Louvre also credited the large increase in visitors to its Delacroix show - the museum's most popular exhibition on record.

Dr Dre removes university boast post,"Dr Dre (pictured here with daughter Truly) joked ""No jail time!!!!"" in his original post Dr Dre has removed a post about his daughter getting into a US university ""all on her own"" following criticism over his donation to the institution. The Instagram post was an apparent dig at celebrities, including actress Felicity Huffman, who have been charged in analleged US college cheating scam. ""No jail time!!!!"" wrote Dr Dre, whose real name is Andre Young. The rap mogul and his business partner Jimmy Iovine gavethe University of Southern California (USC) $70m,externalin 2013. He posed in the Instagram photo with his daughter Truly Young holding her USC acceptance letter. Dr Dre and Jimmy Iovine first worked together on Dre's album The Chronic He later removed the post,externalfollowing a backlash in the comments section, including one that posted ""all on her own"" followed by a string of laughing emojis and one that asked: ""Is this guy serious? H really believes his money didn't play SOME role?"" USC is one of the universities that was allegedly targeted in the recent scandal, although there is no suggestion that any of the colleges themselves were involved in the alleged cheating scam. There is also no suggestion of any wrongdoing in the case of Dr Dre and his daughter and donations to colleges are obviously not illegal. But the culture of parents making hefty donations to a university to boost their child's prospects is a well-known phenomenon in the US. Dre and Iovine's gift established the USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation. NWA ahead of a Straight Outta Compton tour performance in 1989 ""The vision and generosity of Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young will profoundly influence the way all of us perceive and experience artistic media,"" said former USC President CL Max Nikias at the time of the donation six years ago. Iovine went from sweeping floors to becoming a top music executive that helped launched the careers of the likes of Eminem, 50 Cent and Lady Gaga. His partnership with Dr Dre - one of the founding members of the rap group NWA - saw him sign some of the biggest names to his record label Interscope Records.

Big Sean shares anxiety and depression struggle,"Big Sean has spoken about his struggle with anxiety and depression, which forced him to cancel a tour in 2018. Sean revealed that he went through a difficult period last year around his 30th birthday. He says that around that time, he realised he was facing issues which needed ""special attention"" and had therapy for his problems. ""I wasn't feeling like myself and I couldn't figure out why,"" he said on Instagram. ""I just felt lost - and I don't know how I got there."" He posted three videos on his social media, in which he spoke openly about his experiences. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

He previously scrapped a US tour last year partly because of his mental health,telling Billboard magazine at the time,external:  ""I never really took the time out to nurture myself."" Sean said on Instagram that he has used meditation to cope with anxiety and depression since he was 17 years old, but needed to get professional help. And his words have had an impact on men of colour who have also struggled with their mental health. ""I'm in awe that he's having that conversation,"" Ben Hurst, who works promoting gender equality in young men and boys, tells Newsbeat. ""It just makes it OK. I started therapy recently and I remember when I started, I didn't tell my family, there was a big reluctance inside of me to tell my friends and to have that conversation."" Black men are portrayed as violent in the media which can increase pressure to stay silent, says Ben Ben says he was encouraged not to talk about his feelings when he was younger and that he would be told to ""fix his face"" when he was upset. ""Particularly in POC (people of colour) communities, there's a big push back on talking about emotion, especially for men,"" he adds. ""It's almost like when you're young, you're taught to not air business out in public, to not talk about stuff outside of the house."" Others have praised how openly Big Sean spoke about his mental health, rather than ""skirted around the issue."" ""Sometimes we see statements where artists, musicians or activists talk about 'difficult periods' but they rarely give the name and say they were suffering from anxiety or depression - or, more importantly, say they saw a therapist,"" says charity worker Alex Leon. He says that often in his community, BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) men feel they have to ""uphold the family name"", which can make people even more reluctant to speak up. ""Young men of colour don't have many role models when it comes to mental health"" ""What Big Sean has done is a good step in the right direction for us to be able to tell men of colour in the media that they should be speaking more openly because we need that representation,"" he says. Sean says therapy helped him get ""clarity"" on his situation and was able to focus on relationships which had meaning in his life. ""I had a lot of toxic relationships around me,"" he says. ""Even the relationship with my mum was getting to a point where we weren't talking like that. ""It was just weird because it had never been like that with me and her."" Allow Instagram content?

""I couldn't point the finger at anyone else, I had to point it at myself, nurture those relationships that were important to me but most importantly nurture the relationship with myself."" Sean says that spending time by himself, doing activities he enjoyed alone, helped. He even went skydiving to try and improve his mental health. ""In the midst of that I definitely rediscovered myself and found a whole new energy and me being the source of it - not somebody else,"" he says.

Trump triumphant after Mueller findings,"Sarah Sanders lashed out at Donald Trump's critics on Monday for trying to take down the Republican president The White House has assailed President Donald Trump's critics after he was cleared of Russian election collusion. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told cable morning shows that Mr Trump is happy for the full report by special counsel Robert Mueller to be released. She said the summary of the findings issued by the attorney general amounted to a full vindication of the president. Mr Mueller's long-awaited report, however, stops short of exonerating Mr Trump of obstruction of justice. It was the culmination of a nearly two-year investigation that saw some of the president's closest former aides prosecuted and, in some cases, imprisoned, though not for collusion with Russia. This video can not be played Mueller report: One summary, two interpretations White House aides took to the airwaves on Monday to depict the president as the victim of an inquiry that should never have been allowed. When asked whether Mr Trump would support the release of the full report, Mrs Sanders told NBC News' Today programme: ""He's more than happy for any of this stuff to come out."" Speaking on CNN later on Monday, Mrs Sanders said it was ""outrageous"" that Democrats and journalists had spent two years portraying the president as an agent of a foreign power. ""That's equivalent to treason,"" said the press secretary. ""That's punishable by death in this country and that is outrageous."" Mrs Sanders said the ""obscene lie"" was used to try ""to overthrow the president of the United States"". Key lines from the summary - and what they really mean All you need to know about Trump and Russia The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words White House adviser Kellyanne Conway on Monday called on Democrat Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, to step down. ""He ought to resign today,"" she told Fox News. ""He has been on every TV show 50 times a day for practically the last two years promising Americans that the president would be impeached or indicted."" Allow Twitter content?

""It was a complete and total exoneration,"" Mr Trump declared on Sunday, even though the report specifically states that he has not been fully exonerated. Speaking at Palm Beach International Airport in Florida, he said: ""It's a shame that our country had to go through this. ""To be honest, it's a shame that your president has had to go through this. Before I even got elected it began and it began illegally."" The Republican president said the inquiry was an ""illegal takedown that failed"". In his four-page summary released on Sunday, Trump-appointed Attorney General William Barr wrote: ""The special counsel did not find that any US person or Trump campaign official conspired or knowingly co-ordinated with Russia."" But on the issue of whether justice was obstructed, Mr Mueller's report says: ""While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" Read Barr's full summary of the report Mueller hopefuls react to report Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Mr Trump still faces about a dozen other investigations. These include a federal inquiry in New York into possible election law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses, and possible misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee. Congress is also continuing its own inquiries, mostly in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham summed up the conservative response on Monday, telling reporters Mr Trump was stronger today than ever. ""This cloud has been removed,"" he said. ""To those wanting an outcome of removing Trump, you're going to be disappointed."" Opposition Democrats are demanding full access to Mr Mueller's report. The Democratic Chair of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee,Jerry Nadler, said he would ask Mr Barr to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee ""in the near future"",externalover ""very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department"". Russia has denied being involved in hacking to influence the 2016 US election result. America's most mysterious public figure How Russia's media saw the Mueller report Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov mocked suggestions there had been collusion, saying: ""I recall the words of the Chinese philosopher who said that it's hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it's not there. Well, centuries pass and unfortunately they still don't understand that across the ocean."" Alexei Pushkov, a member of Russia's upper house, tweeted:""Democrats, Russophobes and leading media created a virtual conspiracy,externalwhich existed only in their heads and in headlines, and nowhere else."" Legally, the House Judiciary Committee will want to get its hands on the full Mueller report. They will want to see why Robert Mueller felt he couldn't exonerate the president on obstruction of justice. And remember, obstruction of justice is one of the ""high crimes and misdemeanours"" that can lead to impeachment. There will be an endless back and forth over that. And I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised if the subpoenas start to fly. Committees have the right to call people and papers. They are bound to flex their muscles as much as they can. They want to play this long. They want to damage the president. To prosecute the president for obstruction of justice there would have needed to be evidence of intent to obstruct. So even though the president fired former FBI chief James Comey and unleashed regular torrents of abuse on Twitter about the investigation, if his only motivation for those acts was to vent his spleen rather than break the law, then he's done nothing wrong legally.

Harry Potter superfan bags world record,"This video can not be played Look who managed to ""Slytherin"" to the record books! A Harry Potter superfan has managed to ""Slytherin"" to the record books after collecting thousands of pieces of memorabilia. Victoria Maclean, of Tonna, Neath Port Talbot, has 3,686 individual JK Rowling-related items. This earned her the Wizarding World Collection world record - which includes the Fantastic Beasts series. YouTuber Mrs Maclean, 38, said: ""I screamed a lot - it was so incredible after all these months."" She was presented with her world record certificate by Guinness World Records on Wednesday. The arduous task of counting her entire collectioninvolved packing it all up from her home and taking it to the local rugby club where it could be laid out in full. But the three-day process of packing, unloading, counting and re-packing had to be repeated after Mrs Maclean grouped some items as one when they counted as individuals. Harry Potter beach proposal a success The world's biggest and most bizarre airports The number that would take you 332,064 years to say Ever seen a seven-year-old this fast? Mrs Maclean's collection filled a room in her local rugby club You name it, Victoria's got it, including this miniature sculpture of Hogwarts This new record, incorporating collectibles from the wider JK Rowling universe, means Mexico City'sMenahem Asher Silva Vargas,external, who has a 3,097-strong Harry Potter collection, keeps his world record. Mrs Maclean said: ""Guinness said, 'If you want, you could go for the Harry Potter record', but my husband would divorce me if I did!"" It was while she was pregnant in 2001 that Mrs Maclean's magical love affair began. She was watching a segment on Blue Peter about Harry Potter and - two weeks later - had bought and read the first book. Since then, the mother-of-three has collected every book, DVD, toy, bag, item of clothing and piece of jewellery she can - as well as a host of other collectibles. ""If you see a box, or a trunk, or a drawer, or a cupboard in my house, if you open it, it's just Harry Potter from bottom to top"" Magic moment: Mrs Maclean met Harry Potter star Tom Felton - who played Draco Malfoy - but hopes to meet JK Rowling one day Her YouTube channel means she often gets sent memorabilia to promote, which helps cut some of the cost, but her collection is worth an estimated Â£100,000. Her prized possession is a 24 carat gold-plated Golden Snitch puzzle piece from Japan - one of only 5,000 made - which took six years to track down and buy. Even with this record - there is still the Holy Grail that eludes her - a first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. ""I'll never stop collecting until I really, really have to. I don't smoke, I rarely drink - this is my vice,"" she added. As part of the record assessment, all items were assessed and verified by two independent witnesses - one of whom had to be a specialist in the area - and only official merchandise counted towards Mrs Maclean's total. Some memorabilia items were removed for not having the official labelling.

BA plane lands in Edinburgh by mistake,"Edinburgh or DÃ¼sseldorf? Spot the difference A British Airways flight destined for DÃ¼sseldorf in Germany has landed in Edinburgh by mistake, after the flight paperwork was submitted incorrectly. The passengers only realised the error when the plane landed and the ""welcome to Edinburgh"" announcement was made. The plane, which started at London's City Airport, was then redirected and landed in DÃ¼sseldorf. WDL Aviation ran the BA flight through a leasing deal. BA said it was working with WDL to find out why it filed the wrong flight plan. ""We have apologised to customers for this interruption to their journey and will be contacting them all individually,"" BA said in a statement. On its final flight on Sunday, the plane flew to Edinburgh and back so it seems that someone at WDL mistakenly repeated the same flight plan for the next day, according to BA. When the crew arrived at London City airport on Monday it is thought that they saw Edinburgh on the flight plan from the day before and followed the old flight route. German firm WDL said it was ""working closely with the authorities to investigate how the obviously unfortunate mix-up of flight schedules could occur"". ""At no time has the safety of passengers been compromised. We flew the passengers on the flight with number BA3271 to DÃ¼sseldorf after the involuntary stopover in Edinburgh,"" it said. BA declined to say how many passengers were affected by the mistake. Sophie Cooke, a 24-year-old management consultant, travels from London to DÃ¼sseldorf each week for work. She said when the pilot first made the announcement that the plane was about to land in Edinburgh everyone assumed it was a joke. She asked the cabin crew if they were serious. The pilot then asked passengers to raise their hands if they wanted to go to DÃ¼sseldorf. Everyone raised their hands. ""The pilot said he had no idea how it had happened. He said it had never happened before and that the crew was trying to work out what we could do."" Sophie said the plane sat on the tarmac at Edinburgh for two-and-a-half hours, before flying onto DÃ¼sseldorf. ""It became very frustrating. The toilets were blocked and they ran out of snacks. It was also really stuffy,"" she said. By Simon Browning, BBC transport producer It is hugely unusual for passengers to board a flight and then arrive at the wrong destination - and it presents lots of uncomfortable questions about procedure and standards. The flight was operated by a German aviation business on behalf of BA. Do they follow the same operational protocols that BA passengers would expect? Why wasn't a passenger announcement made before take-off saying ""the weather in Edinburgh is fine and the flight will last one hour"". If it had, they could have saved a lot of complication. For the passengers involved, will they get compensation for the delay? And ultimately - what does this do for trust in BA that such a mistake can be made? Passengers complained about the error on Twitter, with one person called Son Tran saying it felt ""like an honest mistake"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sackler Trust suspends new UK donations,"Funding from the Sackler Trust has been used for the new Tate Modern building in London The Sackler Trust has suspended new charitable donations in the UK amid claims the Sackler family fortune is linked to the opioid crisis in the US. The trust said it rejected the claims, but said the row had become a distraction for the groups it supports. Last week, the National Portrait Gallery become the first major art institution to give up a grant from the Sackler family. Other organisations have also shunned Sackler money, including the Tate. Since 2010 the Sackler Trust has committed Â£60m to a range of causes. The Trust is one of many philanthropic organisations funded by the Sackler family. The negative publicity the family has received, due to its connections with the US company Purdue Pharma and its controversial opioid painkiller OxyContin, has led to mounting pressure on museums and galleries not to accept its money. What are opioids and what are the risks? The Sackler family and their controversial wealth Tate art galleries shun Sackler money National Portrait Gallery drops Â£1m donor In a statement, Dame Theresa Sackler, chair of The Sackler Trust, said: ""I am deeply saddened by the addiction crisis in America and support the actions Purdue Pharma is taking to help tackle the situation, whilst still rejecting the false allegations made against the company and several members of the Sackler family. ""The Trustees of the Sackler Trust have taken the difficult decision to temporarily pause all new philanthropic giving, while still honouring existing commitments."" The Anglo-American billionaire dynasty are prolific philanthropists and some of Britain's best-known art galleries, museums, theatres and universities have benefited from their generosity. But behind the money is a firm called Purdue Pharma, a US company owned by many of the Sacklers, which makes opioids - a class of drugs linked to the deaths of thousands of Americans. In 2016, the Sackler Trust offered the National Portrait Gallery a grant worth Â£1m to go towards the gallery's Â£35.5m redevelopment. The gallery had been mulling over whether to accept it, butlast week accepted the Trust's decisionto withdraw the offer. Also last weekthe Tate said that it would not be accepting further donations from the Sacklers. Many other UK cultural institutions have benefited from donations from the Sackler Trust in the past, including the Serpentine's Sackler Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the National Gallery. In New York, the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, which has received a total of $9m (Â£6.8m) from the family, said it did not plan to accept any more gifts from the family. Analysis by Will Gompertz, BBC Arts Editor The Sackler Trust has gone from being a respected and generous philanthropic donor to the arts to being something of a headache for those it supports. Arts bosses and their trustees have been weighing up if the financial benefit of a Sackler gift is worth the reputational risk (and associated hassle that comes with it). The National Portrait Gallery, and the Tate have both decided it is not. For those institutions who were still unsure what to do, the announcement today by the Sackler Trust that it will ""pause"" all donations forthwith has made the decision for them.

Drugs smuggled into prison in dead rats,"The items were stitched into the rats' insides Drugs, tobacco and mobile phones were smuggled into a prison stuffed inside dead rats. The items were sewn inside the bodies of three rats found by officers in early March in the grounds of HMP Guys Marsh near Shaftesbury, Dorset. It was the first recorded instance of rats being used in that way, the Prison Service said. It said it was investigating with Dorset Police but was unable to say whether anyone had been arrested. Warning: Graphic image below Prison officers cut open the rodents, which had apparently been thrown over the fence, and found a large amount of drugs, including spice and cannabis. They also discovered five mobile phones and chargers, together with three Sim cards. The rats contained mobile phones and a ""large amount"" of drugs The items were intended to be collected from the grounds and sold to inmates, the Prison Service said. Prisons Minister Rory Stewart said: ""This find shows the extraordinary lengths to which criminals will go to smuggle drugs into prison.""

Ministers rally round PM,"This video can not be played Theresa May's de-facto deputy backs her leadership Two ministers touted as a potential caretaker PM in reports of a cabinet coup say they fully back Theresa May. Environment Secretary Michael Gove told reporters it was ""not the time to change the captain of the ship"". And the PM's de facto deputy David Lidington insisted he was ""100% behind"" Mrs May. Meanwhile, the Brexit secretary said an election will become more likely if MPs vote this week for a Brexit option the government does not want. MPs are expected to get the chance to hold a series ofso-called indicative voteson possible alternatives to Mrs May's withdrawal deal, but Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said they would ""not be binding"". He was among the Tory MPs and ministers at talks with Mrs May on Sunday at Chequers, her country retreat. Prominent Brexiteers Mr Gove, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg were also present. They discussed a range of issues, including whether there was sufficient support to hold a third vote on the prime minister's deal this week, a Downing Street spokesman said. Newspapers claim cabinet ministers are plotting a coup against the prime minister, aiming to replace her with a caretaker leader until a proper leadership contest is held later in the year. The suggestion is that Tory MPs might reluctantly back Mrs May's Brexit deal if they know she will not be in charge of the next stage of negotiations with the EU, but there are differing accounts of who the preferred candidate to replace her is. The Sunday Times reports that Mr Lidington,external, who voted Remain, is being lined up, whilethe Mail on Sunday said the Brexiteer Environment Secretary Mr Gove,externalwas the ""consensus choice"". The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg says there is ""serious manoeuvring"" going on. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The prime minister has come under growing pressure to quit following a week in whichshe was forced to ask the EU for an extension to Article 50, andcriticised for blaming the delay to Brexit on MPs. The withdrawal deal she has negotiated with the EU has been overwhelmingly rejected in the Commons twice, and it remains unclear whether she will bring it back a third time next week aftershe wrote to MPssaying she would only do so if there was ""sufficient support"". One senior backbencher told the BBC's Iain Watson that even standing aside would not be enough for her deal to be voted through, and that Mrs May might as well ""dig in"". Varadkar will 'work with whoever is PM' Million joined Brexit protest, organisers say Ministers 'divided' on Brexit votes process Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Mr Gove said he was focused on getting the maximum amount of support for the prime minister and her Brexit deal. And Mr Lidington insisted Mrs May was ""doing a fantastic job"" and he had no desire to take over from her. Chancellor Philip Hammond told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday ""changing prime ministers wouldn't help, changing the party of government wouldn't help."" He denied reports he was hoping to parachute in Mr Lidington as caretaker, adding: ""To be talking about changing the players on the board, frankly, is self-indulgent at this time."" Mr Hammond said he understood MPs were ""very frustrated"", but ""one way or another Parliament is going to have an opportunity this week to decide what it's in favour of"". Former Conservative leader and prominent Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC's Andrew Marr the disloyalty some cabinet ministers were showing to her was ""appalling"". They should be censured, sacked, or at the very least ""they should be apologising and they should shut up,"" he added. MP for Aylesbury since 1992 and now Cabinet Office Minister, David Lidington, below left, is the prime minister's right-hand man and behind-the-scenes fixer. Once private secretary to William Hague when he was Tory leader, Mr Lidington was the longest-serving Minister for Europe under David Cameron and is clearly from the Remain camp. That makes him an unacceptable replacement for Theresa May in the eyes of Brexiteers. Lidington is well-liked among fellow MPs and has an easy way with journalists, but he has attracted criticism from some quarters for his voting record, especially on LGBTQ rights. He voted against same sex marriage and to maintain a ban on the promotion of homosexuality in schools. Former journalist turned MP for Surrey Heath, Michael Gove, above right, is currently environment secretary. He's previously held the justice and education briefs. He and Boris Johnson helped lead Vote Leave to victory in the EU referendum, but Gove later ran against his former Brexit ally for the Tory leadership. He was subsequently sacked as a minister by Theresa May when she eventually won that contest. Now having worked his way back into the senior echelons of government, Mr Gove is seen as someone who could hold the Conservative Party together, and might be a candidate Remainers could stomach because he's hinted he could be open to a softer form of Brexit. Arch Brexiteers feel, though, that for that very reason he'd be an unacceptable choice. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith calls ministerial disloyalty ""appalling"" The leadership row comes ahead of a week where the PM is expected to lose further control over the Brexit process. In the coming days, as many as six other options, in addition to Mrs May's deal, could be put to indicative votes in order to see which are most popular. They are: Revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit Another referendum The PM's deal plus a customs union The PM's deal plus both a customs union and single market access A Canada-style free trade agreement Leaving the EU without a deal Mr Hammond said he would remove revoking Article 50 and a no-deal Brexit from the list, as ""both of those would have very serious and negative consequences for our country"". On the subject of a second referendum, he said: ""It is a coherent proposition and deserves to be considered, along with the other proposals."" But Mr Barclay said there was a ""crisis"" because ""Parliament is trying to take over the government"". He said if MPs vote for a Brexit outcome at odds with the Tory manifesto - for example, in favour of maintaining single market membership - ""the risk of a general election increases, because you potentially have a situation where Parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do"". Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the indicative votes must be a ""serious exercise"". He said Labour would go into the process ""in good faith"" but there needed to be ""assurance that the prime minister isn't going to use it just to frustrate the process"". Labour chairman of the Brexit scrutiny committee Hilary Benn told Sky News MPs were just doing their job by attempting to take control of the process. Monday:MPs will debate the Brexit next steps and a number of amendments - possible alternatives - to the government plan will be put to a vote. One that could well succeed calls for a series of ""indicative votes"" in the Commons, run by Parliament, to see if a majority can be found for a different Brexit model. Tuesday:Theresa May could bring her withdrawal deal back for the so-called third meaningful vote. But the government says it won't do that unless it's sure it has enough to support to win. Wednesday:This is when indicative votes would be held - we don't know yet whether MPs will be free to vote how they want or be directed along party lines. The chances of any genuine cross-party consensus being achieved are not high. Thursday:A second possible opportunity for meaningful vote three. The prime minister may hope that Brexiteers will finally decide to throw their weight behind her deal because indicative votes have shown that otherwise the UK could be heading for the sort of softer Brexit they would hate. Friday:This is written into law as the day the UK leaves the EU, although the PM has said she will pass legislation this week to remove it. The earliest Brexit is likely to happen is now 12 April. Read more on the week ahead in Parliament This video can not be played Marchers called for a ""proper vote"" and said they'd been ""sold down the river"" On Saturday,hundreds of thousands of people marched in central London to call for another EU referendum. Organisers said the initial count showed more than a million people had turned up - putting it on a par with the biggest march of the century, the Stop the War march in 2003. Meanwhile, the woman behind a record-breaking anti-Brexit petition - which has received more than five million signatures -says she has received death threats over the poll. Earlier in the week, European leadersagreed to delay the UK's departure from the EU. If Mrs May's deal is approved by MPs next week, the EU has agreed to extend the Brexit deadline until 22 May. If it is not - and no alternative plan is put forward - the UK is set to leave the EU on 12 April.

Queen chat encouraged MPs' expenses editor,"This video can not be played Former editor of the Daily Telegraph Will Lewis recalls talking to the Queen after publishing MPs' expenses details. The editor who broke the story of the MPs' expenses scandal in 2009 has told BBC Newsnight he was ""even more resolute"" to continue investigating after talking to the Queen. Former editor of the Daily Telegraph Will Lewis said he had a private conversation with Her Majesty at the height of the newspaper's coverage. He was left ""full of resolution"" to continue ""right until the end"". Many MPs stood down as details of their expenses claims were published. Mr Lewis said the conversation with the Queen happened at the Chelsea Flower Show in London. ""No-one was coming to our garden,"" he told Emily Maitlis. ""When a man came scuttling along and whispered in my ear that Her Majesty was on her wayâ¦ and we had a very nice conversation and I was able to afterwards hotfoot back to my office even more resolute and even more robust in my desire to continue with our investigative efforts."" Mr Lewis added that while he ""would never say what Her Majesty said to me... I did go back full of resolution to continue our investigation right until the end"". Commons 'still to recover on expenses' MPs' expenses in detail,external New MPs' code 'risks cover-up claims' The comments form part of a special one-hour Newsnight documentary, 10 years after the scandal. Mr Lewis said he felt ""obliged"" to publish a story that others had turned down, and described what his newspaper uncovered as a ""very serious situation punctuated by things that people found funny but actually frankly were disgusting"". The Queen, pictured at last year's Chelsea Flower Show, was said to bolster the editor's resolution A number of politicians were convicted for false accounting and the scandal prompted the establishment of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) - which monitors MPs' pay and expenses. By Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis I still catch myself, occasionally, thinking of individual parliamentarians by their corresponding household object. The Hobnobs and the trouser press, the duck house and the wisteria. The loo seat - make that two loo seats - and the lamps. The story touched a public nerve at the time. It came in the wake of the financial crash when belts were tightened and the pain was felt across the country. It came in the years following the Iraq war - when many felt they had been sold lies by the government of the day. The expenses scandal exposed a kind of wholesale wrongdoing. It wasn't about individuals - despite their memorable home appliances - it was the sense of a systemic rot that people were only just beginning to understand. Read more from Emily Former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams - who was also interviewed as part of the programme - described the scandal as a ""watershed moment"" with regards to the falling levels of trust voters currently have in the political system. ""Where we are now with people's attitudes to parliament has something to do with that. I'm absolutely sure of that,"" he said.

Trump cleared of conspiring with Russia,"This video can not be played Mueller report: One summary, two interpretations US President Donald Trump's campaign did not conspire with Russia during the 2016 election, a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report says. The allegation clouded the first two years of Mr Trump's presidency and his allies see the report's finding as a boost to his re-election chances. But Attorney General William Barr's summary is inconclusive as to whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. Opposition Democrats are demanding full access to Mr Mueller's report. Having repeatedly described the inquiry as a witch hunt, Mr Trump said it was an ""illegal takedown that failed"". Despite the inconclusiveness of the report regarding allegations he obstructed justice, the president said it constituted ""complete and total exoneration"". Allow Twitter content?

The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Mueller report: Key lines from Barr summary Read Barr's full summary of the report The report was the culmination of two years of investigation by Mr Mueller which saw some of the president's closest former aides prosecuted and, in some cases, imprisoned, although not on charges related to the alleged Russian collusion. ""The special counsel did not find that any US person or Trump campaign official conspired or knowingly co-ordinated with Russia,"" Mr Barr writes. On the issue of whether justice was obstructed, Mr Mueller's report says: ""While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" In his summary, Mr Barr said the report ""ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment"". This video can not be played Mueller report a ""complete exoneration"", says US President Trump There was, he adds, insufficient evidence ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence"". Mueller hopefuls react to report Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? America's most mysterious public figure Mr Barr ends his letter by saying further extracts from the report will be released but notes that some of the material is subject to justice department restrictions. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has been sharply critical of the president in the past, tweeted that it wasa ""great day for President Trump and his team"",external. ""The cloud hanging over President Trump has been removed by this report,"" he said. ""Great job by Mr. Mueller and his team to thoroughly examine all things Russia,"" he added. ""Now it is time to move on, govern the country, and get ready to combat Russia and other foreign actors ahead of 2020."" White House adviser Kellyanne Conway sent the president ""congratulations"" on Twitter,external, saying: ""Today you won the 2016 election all over again. And got a gift for the 2020 election."" Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has taken almost two years ""They'll never get you because they'll never 'get' you."" Mr Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said the report had been better than he had expected while Republican Senator Mitt Romney welcomed the ""good news"", tweeting that it was now ""time for the country to move forward"". Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement thatMr Barr's letter ""raises as many questions as it answers"",externaland called for access to the full report. ""For the president to say he is completely exonerated directly contradicts the words of Mr Mueller and is not to be taken with any degree of credibility,"" the statement said. Congressman Jerry Nadler, the Democratic Chair of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, emphasised that Mr Trump had not been cleared of obstructing justice. ""Barr says that the president may have acted to obstruct justice, but that for an obstruction conviction, 'the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct'."" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate's Judiciary Committee, said that while there was a lack of evidence to support ""a prosecutable criminal conspiracy"", questions remained over whether Mr Trump had been compromised.

Russia has denied being involved in hacking to influence the 2016 US election result. Responding to news that Mr Trump had been cleared of collusion, Alexei Pushkov, a member of Russia's upper house, tweeted:""Democrats, Russophobes and leading media created a virtual conspiracy,externalwhich existed only in their heads and in headlines, and nowhere else."" The release of the report's key findings on Sunday could mark the start of a lengthy battle to see the entire Mueller report made public. Whenever further details are handed to Congress, Democrats may mount legal challenges if it is anything less than the entire report. Jerry Nadler said he would ask Mr Barr to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee ""in the near future"",externalover ""very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department"". About a dozen other investigations are continuing into Mr Trump's activities. These include a federal inquiry in New York into possible election law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses, and possible misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee. Congress is also continuing its own inquiries, mostly in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Attorney General Barr summarises, mostly in his own words, the conclusions of the special counsel's investigation. In one key line, however, he directly quotes the report. ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or co-ordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" There, in Robert Mueller's own words, is the end result of nearly two years of work, 2,800 subpoenas, hundreds of search warrants and countless hours of interviews. There were ""multiple offers"" of help from ""Russian-affiliated individuals"" to the Trump campaign, but they never took the bait. There was, as Donald Trump might say, ""no collusion"". At least, no evidence of it was unearthed. The obstruction of justice component is a murkier matter. The decision of whether to charge Mr Trump with interference with the various investigations wasn't Mr Mueller's. Saying it involved ""difficult issues"", the former FBI director punted. Instead, Mr Barr - in consultation with Department of Justice staff - decided not to prosecute, in part because there was no apparent underlying crime to obstruct. Make no mistake, today was a very good day for Mr Trump. While a bevy of inquiries into his presidency will grind on, the shadow of Mr Mueller's investigation - hovering over the White House since May 2017 - has been lifted.

NZ PM orders Christchurch attack inquiry,"This video can not be played Watch: Jacinda Ardern orders inquiry into Christchurch terror attacks New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ordered a top-level inquiry into the Christchurch mosque attacks that left 50 people dead. She said a royal commission would examine whether police and intelligence services could have done more to prevent the 15 March shootings. A royal commission is the highest level of independent inquiry available under New Zealand law. Ms Ardern said it would produce a ""comprehensive"" report. ""It is important that no stone is left unturned to get to how this act of terrorism occurred and how we could have stopped it,"" she told reporters in Wellington on Monday. ""One question we need to answer is whether or not we could or should have known more,"" she added. The child, the father, the aspiring footballer Video: 'The attacker killed my whole family' The lives lost and the world they revealed Ms Ardern said the formal inquiry would also look at questions surrounding the accessibility of semi-automatic weapons and the role social media played in the attacks. Australian Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old self-proclaimed white supremacist, has been charged with one murder in connection with the shootings and he is expected to face further charges. Ms Ardern has ruled out re-introducing the death penalty for the trial. This video can not be played The victims have been remembered at events throughout the week At the press conference announcing the inquiry, she also said she would travel to China at the end of the week to meet with President Xi Jinping.

'Systemic problems' with police service,"Police Scotland is the second largest force in the UK, with 17,000 officers Improvements are needed to address ""systemic problems"" created when Scotland's police and fire services became national bodies, according to MSPs. Holyrood's Justice Committee has completed a review of the reorganisation of the services. Poor money management and personnel issues were identified as issues. The Scottish government said the changes had brought about a more consistent and improved service. Prior to the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012, the police and fire services in Scotland had each consisted of eight regional organisations. When the act came into effect in 2013, it was one of the biggest transformations of public services since devolution. The separate organisations were merged to create two national bodies - Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. In April last year, the justice committee began an inquiry into the centralisation of the two services in order to examine how effective the change has been. There were some positives from the mergers, including allowing for more equal access to specialist capabilities and support The committee concluded that although reform had led to greater consistency of service across Scotland, as well as allowing for more equal access to specialist capabilities and support, a number of issues, particularly within Police Scotland, should be further addressed. The committee's report on policing indicated that poor financial management, unclear lines of responsibility and a failure to focus on the views of officers and staff in the early stages of reform lie at the root of many of the problems faced by Police Scotland. Among the issues highlighted were forecast savings not being realised, IT problems hampering police effectiveness and a string of well-publicised personnel problems resulting in senior management ""instability and concerns over a lack of clear leadership"" in the initial years of the reform process. 'Weaknesses' in new police call-handling system 'Lost' Â£200m in savings after police IT scheme collapses Police chief admits mistakes made in setting up national force A need for an exemption for police and fire services from the payment of VAT was also highlighted in the committee's considerations. The creation of national organisations meant that for several years they were liable for VAT, unlike other services throughout the UK which qualified for rebate because they were still funded through local councils. In November 2017, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced he would address the anomaly, and extend the exemption to the Scottish fire and police services. The report set out a range of recommendations for improving Police Scotland, including; an overhaul of police complaints processes to create a more ""equitable, clear and fair system"", a more proactive role by the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) in its oversight and scrutiny of new Police Scotland policies and to provide more robust financial projections. The committee also suggested that the option of including the Scottish Parliament in the appointment process of the SPA chair should be explored, as well as stating that SPA and Police Scotland should demonstrate that recent improvements in leadership and governance would mean that previous ""shortcomings caused by personality issues"" could not reoccur. Justice committee convener Margaret Mitchell MSP said: ""Our police and fire services do a vital job keeping people in Scotland safe. It is imperative that the structures and regulations underpinning these organisations work well. Recommendations included an overhaul of police complaints processes ""The Justice committee has found that some of the problems it has seen can be traced back to the frameworks and relationships created by the Act itself. ""These are not simply 'teething problems' of a new service bedding in, but systemic problems that must be addressed. ""The committee has identified a raft of necessary improvements to regulations, structures and practices. Members look forward to working closely with the Scottish government and the organisations created by the Police and Fire Reform Act to implement changes. Fire service facing Â£389m vehicle and property repairs bill ""Reform of these frontline public services is one of the biggest challenges undertaken since the start of devolution in Scotland. It is in everyone's interest that they succeed."" Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone claimed Scotland is safer following the creation of a single national service. He said: ""The report makes clear Police Scotland has delivered significant benefits and it is encouraging to hear the committee describe the equity of access to national capacity as a 'success story for policing'. ""I agree with the committee that the single service has transformed the way it investigates rape and other sexual crimes, improved its approach to investigating murders and unexplained deaths, and its response to dealing with national threats. ""The report also recognised the single service has allowed the consolidation of support services, rather than cutting local, frontline officers."" Mr Livingstone highlighted the financial pressures facing the force but said technology, such as mobile devices, will allow officers to spend more time in local communities. He also admitted the force was ""not as engaged as we could have been"" in the early years but vowed he will give local commanders and officers greater autonomy to police their areas within a national framework. Calum Steele, general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme the single force was operating with ""one hand tied behind its back"" when it comes to finances. He said: ""I'm quite disappointed with the report. ""You can't have a report which says there was no sound basis on which to make financial estimates but then concludes by saying there needs to be more sound financial management of those flimsy estimates. ""One thing that is missing from all of this is that despite delivering all these savings, and more, the service continues to face financial cuts and is in a position of a structural deficit and doesn't have the technologies which were expected to deliver even more savings."" Cabinet Secretary for Justice Humza Yousaf highlighted some of the positive conclusions of the report. He said: ""It has rightly recognised some significant achievements, including the creation of national capabilities in policing, described as 'a success story for Scotland' and improvements in how Police Scotland deals with sexual offences. ""This has been delivered alongside the Scottish government's commitment to protect Police Scotland's revenue budget during this parliament to deliver a total boost of Â£100m by 2021 and the announcement of a 6.5% pay deal for officers. ""The report also makes a number of recommendations which ministers plan to consider in full, alongside Police Scotland, SPA and SFRS over the coming months. ""The report recognises that Dame Elish Angiolini is leading a review into complaints and conduct in policing. It is right and proper that the review be allowed to conclude and its findings be published before considering the next steps.""

"Harry Potter superfan bags world recordA YouTuber amasses a collection of more than 3,600 items to ""Slytherin"" to the record books.","This video can not be played Look who managed to ""Slytherin"" to the record books! A Harry Potter superfan has managed to ""Slytherin"" to the record books after collecting thousands of pieces of memorabilia. Victoria Maclean, of Tonna, Neath Port Talbot, has 3,686 individual JK Rowling-related items. This earned her the Wizarding World Collection world record - which includes the Fantastic Beasts series. YouTuber Mrs Maclean, 38, said: ""I screamed a lot - it was so incredible after all these months."" She was presented with her world record certificate by Guinness World Records on Wednesday. The arduous task of counting her entire collectioninvolved packing it all up from her home and taking it to the local rugby club where it could be laid out in full. But the three-day process of packing, unloading, counting and re-packing had to be repeated after Mrs Maclean grouped some items as one when they counted as individuals. Harry Potter beach proposal a success The world's biggest and most bizarre airports The number that would take you 332,064 years to say Ever seen a seven-year-old this fast? Mrs Maclean's collection filled a room in her local rugby club You name it, Victoria's got it, including this miniature sculpture of Hogwarts This new record, incorporating collectibles from the wider JK Rowling universe, means Mexico City'sMenahem Asher Silva Vargas,external, who has a 3,097-strong Harry Potter collection, keeps his world record. Mrs Maclean said: ""Guinness said, 'If you want, you could go for the Harry Potter record', but my husband would divorce me if I did!"" It was while she was pregnant in 2001 that Mrs Maclean's magical love affair began. She was watching a segment on Blue Peter about Harry Potter and - two weeks later - had bought and read the first book. Since then, the mother-of-three has collected every book, DVD, toy, bag, item of clothing and piece of jewellery she can - as well as a host of other collectibles. ""If you see a box, or a trunk, or a drawer, or a cupboard in my house, if you open it, it's just Harry Potter from bottom to top"" Magic moment: Mrs Maclean met Harry Potter star Tom Felton - who played Draco Malfoy - but hopes to meet JK Rowling one day Her YouTube channel means she often gets sent memorabilia to promote, which helps cut some of the cost, but her collection is worth an estimated Â£100,000. Her prized possession is a 24 carat gold-plated Golden Snitch puzzle piece from Japan - one of only 5,000 made - which took six years to track down and buy. Even with this record - there is still the Holy Grail that eludes her - a first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. ""I'll never stop collecting until I really, really have to. I don't smoke, I rarely drink - this is my vice,"" she added. As part of the record assessment, all items were assessed and verified by two independent witnesses - one of whom had to be a specialist in the area - and only official merchandise counted towards Mrs Maclean's total. Some memorabilia items were removed for not having the official labelling.

Second cyclone in days lashes Australia,"Satellite imagery shows Cyclone Veronica just off the north-west coast of Australia A second cyclone within 48 hours has brought destructive winds and torrential rains to coastal regions of Australia. Cyclone Veronica lingered about 95km (60 miles) off the nation's north-west coast on Monday, officials said. Despite no longer being expected to make landfall, the category two system is moving slowly and has prompted warnings for locals to remain indoors. Cyclone Trevor, a category four, hit the Northern Territory on Saturday. Heavy rain and large waves whipped up by Cyclone Veronica threaten to cause widespread flooding in Western Australia, according to authorities. An area stretching from Karratha to Port Hedland was enduring gale-force winds of more than 125km/h, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Similar conditions affected the Northern Territory on Saturday when Cyclone Trevor made landfall between the remote communities of Numbulwar and Borroloola. Cyclone Veronica is near Port Hedland in Western Australia, after Cyclone Trevor made landfall in the Northern Territory on Saturday In Western Australia, the strong winds snapped trees and caused minor power outages but there were no immediate reports of injuries. Many locals had reinforced their homes with sandbags and stocked up on food and water supplies. One woman who gave birth at a local hospital during the storm,externalnamed the child Veronica, local network Nine reported. Cyclone Veronica was a category four before it was downgraded at the weekend. ""It really is quite unusual for two cyclones to happen at the same time, particularly two very strong systems,"" meteorologist Steph Bond told the BBC, adding it had happened only twice in Australia's history. Cyclone Trevor: A 'guttural howling roar' Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? She attributed the timing to a climate phenomenon known asthe Madden-Julian Oscillation,externalcreating ""favourable"" conditions for summer storms. Cyclone Trevor also brought down trees and power linesafter making landfall as a category four system. Thousands of people were evacuated ahead of Cyclone Trevor Authorities said it had caused no major injuries or significant damage to infrastructure, following the region's biggest evacuation effort in nearly 50 years. Thousands of people in remote communities relocated to regional centres ahead of the storm. Some began to return home on Monday.

Surprise lead for army party in Thai polls,"More than 50 million people were eligible to vote in Sunday's poll Two rival camps contesting Thailand's first election since the military coup in 2014 have both said they are trying to form a coalition government. Early results give the pro-military Palang Pracha Rath Party (PPRP) a larger share of the popular vote. At the same time, the main opposition Pheu Thai party currently has the biggest number of seats in parliament. But there are growing complaints about irregularities during Sunday's poll and a vote count marred by confusion. The Electoral Commission (EC) is also facing strong criticism for its decision to delay publishing the full results without providing any explanation. A guide to Thailand's post-coup election Voting in Thailand's hybrid democracy Thailand's complicated electoral system allocates some parliamentary seats according to the number of votes received. Critics say electoral law changes introduced by the military in 2017 are primarily designed to keep pro-military forces in power. On Monday, the EC announced that Pheu Thai, the party linked to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, had won 137 seats in the 500-strong lower chamber of parliament. The PPRP, which supports Thailand's current leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha, was in the second place with 97 seats. Several other parties were getting between 30 and 39 seats each. But the winners of 150 seats were still unclear, the EC said. At the same time, the commission earlier said that with more than 90% of ballots counted, the PPRP had gained 7.6m of the popular vote. That is half a million more than Pheu Thai. Amid confusion over a vote count, the EC was expected to clarify the preliminary results at a news conference on Monday. But the EC instead again delayed announcing the preliminary figures. It also said there would be no official results until 9 May. General Prayuth Chan-ocha voted in Bangkok on Sunday More than 50 million people were eligible to vote in a much-delayed election, the first since Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha led the coup that ousted Mr Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, five years ago. But the reported turnout was unexpectedly low, at just 64%. Many questioned this figure as well as discrepancies in the vote count numbers. ""It's right that we should call it a rigged election,"" Mr Thaksin told AFP news agency. ""Everyone know(s) in Thailand, everyone internationally that observed the election in Thailand, knows that there is irregularity."" Speaking to journalists, the EC's secretary-general, Charungvith Phumma, blamed ""human error"", saying the people who put the numbers of votes in were just regular people. The EC later said that media had misreported the data it was giving them, and that its servers had suffered from unspecified hacking attacks. Analysis by BBC's Nick Beake in Bangkok What's your definition of an election winner? Answers on a polling card, please. Is it the party with the most votes across the whole country or the party with the most seats in parliament? In Thailand, where power can be seized at gunpoint, this is not so much a constitutional technicality but a matter of manoeuvring and momentum. After repeatedly promising - and then delaying - a national vote, the military junta finally granted a ballot only once it had successfully manipulated the electoral system in its favour. Many foresaw a General Prayuth victory as being hollow and illegitimate - achieved through the backing of a handpicked, new senate. But the coup leader can now point to the way the pro-military Palang Pracha Rath Party apparently hoovered up the majority of votes cast as a clear democratic mandate. The opposition Pheu Thai does not see it that way. It feels its own achievement - gaining the biggest share of parliamentary seats - should be rewarded fairly by being allowed to form a coalition of anti-military parties. The military introduced a new constitution in 2017which opponents say is designed to keep pro-military forces in power. Thailand's electorate only votes for the 500-seat lower house of parliament. The members of the 250-seat upper house are appointed by the military. But it's the combined votes from both houses that will select the future prime minister. The vote has been seen primarily as a contest between pro-military parties and allies of Mr Thaksin. He was ousted in a coup in 2006 and lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a conviction for abuse of power. But he still has a significant following, largely among rural and less affluent voters. At the time of the 2014 coup, the military said it wanted to restore order and stability and put a stop to the street protests which have broken out repeatedly over the years. But the junta has been accused of taking an authoritarian approach to power, strictly controlling the media and arbitrarily using laws like lese majeste - which prohibits any criticism of the monarchy - to silence opponents.

UK's first Newton Room created,"The new facility will be used for encouraging young people in Stem subjects The UK's first Scandinavian-style learning centre, known as a Newton Room, has been opened in Caithness. In Norway and Denmark the centres are used to encourage young people to take an interest in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem). The UK's first ""room"" has been created at North Highland College in Thurso. The Inverness and Highland City Region Deal has provided Â£3m towards the project. The Caithness facility has been made available to schools, and there are plans for a network of Newton Rooms in the Highland region. The first Newton Room was opened in Norway more than 10 years ago. The country now has 38 of these learning centres, and the first to be opened outside of Norway was in Denmark in 2015. Newton, the organisation behind the facilities, offers recommendations on how the rooms should be laid out. Typically there is a main room with separate work stations and separate areas for a laboratory and a classroom. It suggests making use of bright colours, sound and lighting to help create ""dynamic and inspiring"" learning sessions. The modules taught are designed to help pupils prepare for a job in science or industry. Modules taught at the Caithness Newton Room will be targeted at sectors such as renewable energy Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which has been involved in the Thurso room, said modules would be targeted at locally important industries. Regional development director Carroll Buxton said these included renewable energy, aquaculture and potentially the launch of small commercial satellites into space. She said: ""There are a number of sectors in the Highlands and Islands that have an increasing demand for skills in Stem subjects."" Further Education Minister Richard Lochhead said: ""The Newton Rooms project offers pupils and the community a wonderful opportunity to discover and become enthused by Stem.

"Harry Potter superfan bags world recordA YouTuber amasses a collection of more than 3,600 items to ""Slytherin"" to the record books.Wales","This video can not be played Look who managed to ""Slytherin"" to the record books! A Harry Potter superfan has managed to ""Slytherin"" to the record books after collecting thousands of pieces of memorabilia. Victoria Maclean, of Tonna, Neath Port Talbot, has 3,686 individual JK Rowling-related items. This earned her the Wizarding World Collection world record - which includes the Fantastic Beasts series. YouTuber Mrs Maclean, 38, said: ""I screamed a lot - it was so incredible after all these months."" She was presented with her world record certificate by Guinness World Records on Wednesday. The arduous task of counting her entire collectioninvolved packing it all up from her home and taking it to the local rugby club where it could be laid out in full. But the three-day process of packing, unloading, counting and re-packing had to be repeated after Mrs Maclean grouped some items as one when they counted as individuals. Harry Potter beach proposal a success The world's biggest and most bizarre airports The number that would take you 332,064 years to say Ever seen a seven-year-old this fast? Mrs Maclean's collection filled a room in her local rugby club You name it, Victoria's got it, including this miniature sculpture of Hogwarts This new record, incorporating collectibles from the wider JK Rowling universe, means Mexico City'sMenahem Asher Silva Vargas,external, who has a 3,097-strong Harry Potter collection, keeps his world record. Mrs Maclean said: ""Guinness said, 'If you want, you could go for the Harry Potter record', but my husband would divorce me if I did!"" It was while she was pregnant in 2001 that Mrs Maclean's magical love affair began. She was watching a segment on Blue Peter about Harry Potter and - two weeks later - had bought and read the first book. Since then, the mother-of-three has collected every book, DVD, toy, bag, item of clothing and piece of jewellery she can - as well as a host of other collectibles. ""If you see a box, or a trunk, or a drawer, or a cupboard in my house, if you open it, it's just Harry Potter from bottom to top"" Magic moment: Mrs Maclean met Harry Potter star Tom Felton - who played Draco Malfoy - but hopes to meet JK Rowling one day Her YouTube channel means she often gets sent memorabilia to promote, which helps cut some of the cost, but her collection is worth an estimated Â£100,000. Her prized possession is a 24 carat gold-plated Golden Snitch puzzle piece from Japan - one of only 5,000 made - which took six years to track down and buy. Even with this record - there is still the Holy Grail that eludes her - a first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. ""I'll never stop collecting until I really, really have to. I don't smoke, I rarely drink - this is my vice,"" she added. As part of the record assessment, all items were assessed and verified by two independent witnesses - one of whom had to be a specialist in the area - and only official merchandise counted towards Mrs Maclean's total.

"Girl, 11, injured in pellet gun shooting","The woman, child and two teenagers were injured in Figges Marsh park in Mitcham An 11-year-old girl and a 30-year-old woman were injured in a pellet gun shooting in a London park. Two men in their late teens were also hurt in the shooting at Figges Marsh, Mitcham, south-west London, on Sunday. The child was wounded in the leg and the woman was struck in the back. They are known to each other but are not related, police said. Both were taken to hospital with minor injuries and have since been discharged. The teenagers went to a hospital in south London with ""non-serious"" injuries, the Met Police said. Detectives are trying to trace a large group of men seen in the area before the shooting. All the injuries are thought to have been caused by shotgun pellets fired from a pellet gun. No arrests have been made. The Met Police activated a Section 60 order in the borough of Merton. It allowed officers to detain anyone for searches until 06:55 GMT on Monday.

Sackler Trust suspends new UK donationsThe Sackler family halts new charitable donations and denies claims it helped fuel the US opioid crisis.Business,"Funding from the Sackler Trust has been used for the new Tate Modern building in London The Sackler Trust has suspended new charitable donations in the UK amid claims the Sackler family fortune is linked to the opioid crisis in the US. The trust said it rejected the claims, but said the row had become a distraction for the groups it supports. Last week, the National Portrait Gallery become the first major art institution to give up a grant from the Sackler family. Other organisations have also shunned Sackler money, including the Tate. Since 2010 the Sackler Trust has committed Â£60m to a range of causes. The Trust is one of many philanthropic organisations funded by the Sackler family. The negative publicity the family has received, due to its connections with the US company Purdue Pharma and its controversial opioid painkiller OxyContin, has led to mounting pressure on museums and galleries not to accept its money. What are opioids and what are the risks? The Sackler family and their controversial wealth Tate art galleries shun Sackler money National Portrait Gallery drops Â£1m donor In a statement, Dame Theresa Sackler, chair of The Sackler Trust, said: ""I am deeply saddened by the addiction crisis in America and support the actions Purdue Pharma is taking to help tackle the situation, whilst still rejecting the false allegations made against the company and several members of the Sackler family. ""The Trustees of the Sackler Trust have taken the difficult decision to temporarily pause all new philanthropic giving, while still honouring existing commitments."" The Anglo-American billionaire dynasty are prolific philanthropists and some of Britain's best-known art galleries, museums, theatres and universities have benefited from their generosity. But behind the money is a firm called Purdue Pharma, a US company owned by many of the Sacklers, which makes opioids - a class of drugs linked to the deaths of thousands of Americans. In 2016, the Sackler Trust offered the National Portrait Gallery a grant worth Â£1m to go towards the gallery's Â£35.5m redevelopment. The gallery had been mulling over whether to accept it, butlast week accepted the Trust's decisionto withdraw the offer. Also last weekthe Tate said that it would not be accepting further donations from the Sacklers. Many other UK cultural institutions have benefited from donations from the Sackler Trust in the past, including the Serpentine's Sackler Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the National Gallery. In New York, the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, which has received a total of $9m (Â£6.8m) from the family, said it did not plan to accept any more gifts from the family. Analysis by Will Gompertz, BBC Arts Editor The Sackler Trust has gone from being a respected and generous philanthropic donor to the arts to being something of a headache for those it supports. Arts bosses and their trustees have been weighing up if the financial benefit of a Sackler gift is worth the reputational risk (and associated hassle that comes with it). The National Portrait Gallery, and the Tate have both decided it is not. For those institutions who were still unsure what to do, the announcement today by the Sackler Trust that it will ""pause"" all donations forthwith has made the decision for them.

"Blair says police losing knife crime fightThe former prime minister says ""the emergency"" means he is more worried about his own children.UK","Mr Blair said there was an ""emergency on our streets"" Police are currently ""losing the battle"" against knife crime, former prime minister Tony Blair has told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. He urged current prime minister Theresa May to hold a Cobra emergency committee meeting and act with a determination ""to do whatever it takes"". The number of crimes related to knives and other offensive weapons reached a nine-year high in 2018, figures show. The government has promised police forces an extra Â£100m for knife crime. Mr Blair, who was Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said the fight against knife crime could be won. ""If you're going to defeat something like this, right from the very top of government, you've got to have an absolute focus, total determination and do whatever it takes to get the problem solved,"" he said. Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims Ten charts on the rise of knife crime 'I carry a saw and wear a stab-proof vest' There has been a spate of fatal teenage stabbings this month, including two 17-year-olds who were killed in separate knife attacks in London and Greater Manchester within days of each other. Mr Blair said there was ""an emergency on our streets, because it's creating a climate of fear,"" adding, ""I know I'm more worried about my own children"". He said: ""What it means in some of our key cities is people are not feeling safe, people are reacting to their fear of what might happen to them, and this has a cascade effect. "" Mr Blair said he has always believed the police have got to have stop and search powers. ""Of course you've got to be culturally-sensitive,"" he said, ""but remember the communities that are most affected by these crimes are the communities that will be sensitive to these questions. Whatever it takes, you do it."" In 2007, he said people had to drop their political correctnessand recognise violent crime was predominantly affecting the black community - a comment he stands by.,external ""If that's the case, you've got to engage with the community in order to make sure that problem is dealt with,"" he said. ""You're not going to deal with it better by pretending it's something other than it is. ""Telling it like it is isn't discriminatory. Failing to deal with it because it's located for example in the black community, that's discriminatory."" When there was a street crime epidemic in 2002, he called a meeting of the government's emergency committee to ensure it was handled from the top level. It would include key figures such as secretaries of state and the Metropolitan Police commissioner, but also front-line officers, whose experience was key to identifying solutions. ""Out of that you'll get an itemised series of things that need to be done,"" he explained. ""That will be about police powers, police action, it will be about local communities and how you engage them, it will probably be about the court system, it will be a series of different things which you put together.""

"Invoice scams hit 40% of firms, says report","More than four in 10 businesses in the UK are unaware of the risks posed by invoice fraud, according to a survey by banking trade body UK Finance. That is despite such scams costing firms almost Â£93m in 2018, it says. Scams take place when fraudsters trick firms into transferring money by posing as legitimate payees. There were 3,280 invoice and bank mandate scam cases involving businesses over the year, with an average loss per case of more than Â£28,000. Some Â£29.6m of the money lost to this type of fraud was fortunately returned to business customers, the trade body says. UK Finance surveyed 1,500 firms across the UK and found that 55% of sole traders were aware of the threat of invoice fraud, compared with 68% of small businesses and 84% of large businesses. Large businesses were more likely to have taken steps to protect themselves against such scams. But they were also more likely to have experienced invoice fraud than smaller firms. ""Invoice fraud could happen to businesses of all sizes,"" said Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance. ""The gangs behind this type of fraud are increasingly sophisticated and will often get hold of details that allow them to pose convincingly as regular suppliers. ""If someone contacts you asking for a supplier's bank account details to be changed, always verify with that supplier separately on the phone or in person, using the contact details you have on file."" Invoice fraud involves criminals targeting businesses by posing as a regular supplier and making a request for their bank account details to be changed, often by email. Businesses are then tricked into sending money to an account controlled by the fraudster rather than the genuine supplier. Often the criminals will try to acquire details from businesses, such as the date when regular payments are due, to make their approach more convincing. UK Finance says if you are making a payment to an account for the first time, transfer a small sum first. Then check with the company - using known contact details - to check that the payment has been received and that the account details are correct. ""Contact your bank straight away if you think you may have fallen victim to an invoice or mandate scam,"" the trade body adds.

First and second class stamp prices rise,"A 3p rise on the cost of first and second class stamps has now taken effect, following a Royal Mail apology. The change takes the cost of a first-class stamp to 70p and a second-class stamp to 61p. The price increases are the highest for the two stamps together since 2012, but card and letter writing has fallen in popularity. Royal Mail earlierapologised for breaking a price capset by Ofcom on the cost of second-class stamps. The regulator's cap of 60p, designed to make the postal service ""affordable"" for all consumers, was supposed to be in place until 1 April. Royal Mail has already said it will donate the extra revenue, expected to be Â£60,000, to charity Action for Children. Ofcom set the current price cap in 2012, following a large price rise at a time when concerns were raised that the universal service was at ""severe risk"". It said it would increase the cap to 65p from 1 April, and then will rise in line with the annual CPI rate of inflation until April 2024. No equivalent cap is in place for first-class stamps, owing to the cheaper option of sending via second-class. Calls to ban low-level letterboxes and adopt EU standard Royal Mail criticised for D-Day stamp mix-up Royal Mail said the squeeze on consumer finances was considered when setting the new price of stamps, and said the costs were still competitive. ""[Our] stamp prices are among the best value in Europe when compared to other postal operators,"" it said when the rise was first announced in February. The price rise comes shortly after the fall in the popularity of letters was reflected in the way thecost of living is officially recorded. The move towards electronic communication via social media, text and apps, rather than letter-writing, means envelopes have been removed from the virtual basket of goods and services used by the Office for National Statistics to calculate inflation. Some 180,000 prices are measured in 20,000 UK outlets to work out inflation, which itself is used as a benchmark for our finances.

"Second cyclone in days lashes AustraliaCyclone Veronica has brought destructive winds and torrential rains, prompting safety warnings.Australia","Satellite imagery shows Cyclone Veronica just off the north-west coast of Australia A second cyclone within 48 hours has brought destructive winds and torrential rains to coastal regions of Australia. Cyclone Veronica lingered about 95km (60 miles) off the nation's north-west coast on Monday, officials said. Despite no longer being expected to make landfall, the category two system is moving slowly and has prompted warnings for locals to remain indoors. Cyclone Trevor, a category four, hit the Northern Territory on Saturday. Heavy rain and large waves whipped up by Cyclone Veronica threaten to cause widespread flooding in Western Australia, according to authorities. An area stretching from Karratha to Port Hedland was enduring gale-force winds of more than 125km/h, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Similar conditions affected the Northern Territory on Saturday when Cyclone Trevor made landfall between the remote communities of Numbulwar and Borroloola. Cyclone Veronica is near Port Hedland in Western Australia, after Cyclone Trevor made landfall in the Northern Territory on Saturday In Western Australia, the strong winds snapped trees and caused minor power outages but there were no immediate reports of injuries. Many locals had reinforced their homes with sandbags and stocked up on food and water supplies. One woman who gave birth at a local hospital during the storm,externalnamed the child Veronica, local network Nine reported. Cyclone Veronica was a category four before it was downgraded at the weekend. ""It really is quite unusual for two cyclones to happen at the same time, particularly two very strong systems,"" meteorologist Steph Bond told the BBC, adding it had happened only twice in Australia's history. Cyclone Trevor: A 'guttural howling roar' Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? She attributed the timing to a climate phenomenon known asthe Madden-Julian Oscillation,externalcreating ""favourable"" conditions for summer storms. Cyclone Trevor also brought down trees and power linesafter making landfall as a category four system. Thousands of people were evacuated ahead of Cyclone Trevor Authorities said it had caused no major injuries or significant damage to infrastructure, following the region's biggest evacuation effort in nearly 50 years. Thousands of people in remote communities relocated to regional centres ahead of the storm. Some began to return home on Monday.

"Girl, 11, injured in park 'shooting'","The woman, child and two teenagers were injured in Figges Marsh park in Mitcham An 11-year-old girl and a 30-year-old woman were injured in a pellet gun shooting in a London park. Two men in their late teens were also hurt in the shooting at Figges Marsh, Mitcham, south-west London, on Sunday. The child was wounded in the leg and the woman was struck in the back. They are known to each other but are not related, police said. Both were taken to hospital with minor injuries and have since been discharged. The teenagers went to a hospital in south London with ""non-serious"" injuries, the Met Police said. Detectives are trying to trace a large group of men seen in the area before the shooting. All the injuries are thought to have been caused by shotgun pellets fired from a pellet gun. No arrests have been made. The Met Police activated a Section 60 order in the borough of Merton. It allowed officers to detain anyone for searches until 06:55 GMT on Monday.

Stricken Norway cruise ship enters port,"This video can not be played Footage from on board showed furniture crashing and sliding as the vessel tilted A cruise ship that got into trouble off the Norwegian coast has arrived safely at the port of Molde after the dramatic rescue of hundreds of people. The Viking Sky lost power on Saturday and sent out a distress signal after it began drifting towards land. Almost 500 of the 1,373 people on board were airlifted off in bad weather. Three of the ship's four engines were later restarted for its trip to port. Footage from inside the vessel showed it heaving violently in rough seas. Evacuations were halted as the Viking Sky made its way to Molde on Sunday, accompanied by several tugboats. Rescuers said they were ready to resume operations if the captain deemed it necessary. The Viking sky arriving at Molde port in Norway on Sunday afternoon The vessel was able to dock safely, with ambulance staff on hand to help with any injuries The Viking Sky suffered engine failure on Saturday afternoon while en route to Stavanger from Tromso in a notoriously treacherous stretch of waters. Britons tell of 'frightening' rescue Fisherman Jan Erik Fiskerstrand, whose boat was one of the first to come to help Viking Sky, told Aftenposten newspaper, ""it was just minutes before this could have gone really wrong"". The ship could have hit the rocks ""if they had not started the engine and fastened the anchor"" he added. Five helicopters and several rescue ships were called in but poor weather meant the lifeboats were forced to turn back. The authorities decided to launch airlifts rather than leave people on board and hundreds were hoisted to safety. Among those rescued, 20 people suffered injuries. Most of the passengers are said to be British or US citizens, many of them elderly. The cruise's operator said436 guests and 458 crew remained on board.,external Derek Browne, from southern England, who was travelling with his wife Esther told the BBC the ship had been ""rolling and rolling"" all night on Friday before losing engine power on Saturday. He said being airlifted to safety was ""quite a frightening experience"". George Davis, from Manchester, said he and his wife Barbara waited 10 hours to be rescued. ""It was a very scary event"", he said, adding: ""Locals tell us they were amazed that we sailed into the teeth of a storm they knew was coming"". This video can not be played British passenger Derek Browne: 'We were told Mayday Mayday!' In footage from the ship, passengers wearing life jackets are seen waiting to be rescued. The former South African cricketer Graeme Smith said his parents had been among those airlifted to safety. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One of those still on board, Lara from Birmingham in the UK, said ""the crew were magnificent and have kept the remaining passengers safe, warm and fed"". The Viking Sky is a Viking Ocean Cruises ship, which had its maiden voyage in 2017. The company said ""throughout all of this, our first priority was for the safety and wellbeing of our passengers and our crew"". Trevor English, an engineer and technical author based in Texas who has written about the workings of cruise ships, told the BBC that thousands of cruises take place each year and this type of failure - or combination of failures - is rare. ""It's important we understand that the engineering of these ships are held to high standards,"" he says, adding that while vessels such as the Viking Sky have four engines, ""it's possible for components to break that could cause the entire power system to fail"". He continues: ""What makes this event unique is the storms. In many cases, if engines are lost, they can be restored quickly with no issue. ""While one engine on the Viking Sky was soon restored, the storms made the lack of propulsion especially dire,"" Mr English says. He adds that cruises on large vessels are generally very safe, but: ""Like everything we choose to do in life, it's an evaluation of risk."" Are you in the area?

Cabinet to meet amid pressure on May,"This video can not be played Theresa May says there will be no Tuesday vote on her Brexit deal as there is  ""not sufficient support"" for it to be approved. MPs are voting on whether to take control of the Brexit process in Parliament in an attempt to break the current deadlock. They will decide shortly whether to backindicative voteson alternatives to Theresa May's twice-rejected deal. Ministers have urged MPs to ""accept assurances"" they will be given votes on alternatives anyway. But business minister Richard Harrington quit shortly before the vote to back the cross-party plan. The outcome of the vote on the plan, backed by Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP as well as some Tories, is expected to be close. LIVE: PM makes statement to MPs Brexit amendments: What are MPs voting on? NI unable to prepare for no-deal - May Brexit: What could happen next? Labour withdrew its amendment calling for the government to ""provide sufficient parliamentary time this week"" for indicative votes. But MPs could still vote on an amendment from Labour's Dame Margaret Beckett, calling for MPs to be given a vote on requesting another extension Brexit if a deal has not been approved by 5 April. Earlier, Theresa May told MPs she did not have enough support to win a vote on her EU withdrawal deal ""as things stand"". But she insisted she would continue trying to get MPs to back it before putting it to the Commons for a third time this week. The PM is ordering Tory MPs to vote against the bid by a cross-party group of MPs, headed by Tory Sir Oliver Letwin, to hold votes on alternatives to her plan. If passed, the amendment would give MPs the opportunity to vote on a series of options designed to test the will of Parliament to see what, if anything, commands a majority. Ministers saw off a similar attempt earlier this month by MPs to take control of Commons business to consider alternatives to Mrs May's deal by just two votes. The government has said it would give MPs time to hold such votes anyway, but Mrs May said she was ""sceptical"" about the process and would not commit to delivering the outcome of the votes. Earlier on Monday, DUP leader Arlene Foster told the prime minister that her party had not changed its position and would not be backing her deal. The prime minister said the ""default outcome"" remained leaving the EU without a deal. ""The alternative is to pursue a different form of Brexit or a second referendum,"" she said. The Speaker selected three amendments to be voted on ""But the bottom line remains: if the House does not approve the withdrawal agreement this week and is not prepared to countenance leaving without a deal, we would have to seek a longer extension."" That would mean holding European elections, she added, and would mean ""we will not have been able to guarantee Brexit"". She also confirmed that on Wednesday, the government will seek to change the UK's 29 March departure date througha piece of secondary legislation,external, which will make 11pm on 12 April the earliest Brexit date. But she warned MPs that even if they voted against the change, it would still happen because it was contained in a piece of international law. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn criticises the ""dangerous and irresponsible"" comments from Theresa May about the delay to Brexit. She said the government would provide time for MPs to debate Brexit alternatives but added: ""When we have tried this kind of thing in the past, it has produced contradictory outcomes or no outcome at all."" ""The votes could lead to an outcome that is un-negotiable with the EU,"" she told MPs. ""No government could give a blank cheque to commit to an outcome without knowing what it is."" Mrs May's second-in-command David Lidington told MPs the government would arrange indicative votes on Wednesday, if Mr Letwin's amendment is voted down. If it is passed then the timing of any votes would be up to MPs, he added. Asked by Sir Oliver why the government would not simply back his amendment, as it was proposing essentially the same thing, Mr Lidington repeated what the prime minister had said earlier, telling MPs it would ""would overturn the balance of power between Parliament and government"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn confirmed that his party will back Sir Oliver's attempt to secure ""indicative votes"" on Brexit, telling MPs: ""It is time for Parliament to take control."" Sir Oliver said he was not proposing a ""constitutional revolution"". He said he would vote for the PM's deal but he did not believe there was ""a majority in favour of the first preference"" of any MP, and it was time to ""seek compromise"". Understandably, Westminster is frothy with gossip tonight. Is the government about to lose control completely of the Brexit process? Not quite. Is there an obvious way for Parliament out of this mess if it gets the chance to test it properly? Not quite. How likely is it that a handful of ministers might resign tonight to help that theoretical process? Quite likely. Is the prime minister about to get the DUP on board for her deal? Not quite. But the biggest question is, as it always has been - is Theresa May about to seal the deal with the Brexiteers whose votes she so desperately needs? Well, not quite. Read Laura's blog Mrs May's EU deal has been overwhelmingly rejected in the Commons twice. Brexit amendments: What are MPs voting on? What are indicative votes? EU and Ireland 'intensify' no deal talks British no more: Why some UK citizens face Brexit dilemma Million joined Brexit protest, organisers say She has said she would only bring it back for a third Commons vote if there was ""sufficient support"" for it - and she spent the weekend trying to persuade Brexiteer Tories to get behind it. But many are thought likely to take their lead from the DUP, which has led objections to the Irish backstop clause. Meanwhile, the EU has said all itspreparation for an ""increasingly likely"" no-deal scenario on 12 April has been completed,external. This video can not be played Theresa May says she had expressed her ""frustration with our collective failure to take a decision"" over Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn met the prime minister for over an hour earlier, and had what Labour described as a ""frank and comprehensive exchange of views"" on Brexit. Mr Corbyn told the PM there was no basis for holding a third vote on her deal. Last week Mrs May was forced toask the EU for an extension to Article 50andhundreds of thousands of people marchedin central London calling for another EU referendum. Monday:MPs will debate the Brexit next steps and a number of amendments - possible alternatives - to the government plan will be put to a vote. The most important of these is the indicative votes plan. Wednesday:This is when indicative votes would be held - we don't know yet whether MPs will be free to vote how they want or be directed along party lines. The chances of any genuine cross-party consensus being achieved are not high. MPs will also debate and vote on removing 29 March from UK law as the day Britain leaves the EU. Thursday:A possible opportunity for meaningful vote three. The prime minister may hope that Brexiteers will finally decide to throw their weight behind her deal because indicative votes have shown that otherwise the UK could be heading for the sort of softer Brexit they would hate. Friday:This is still written into law as the day the UK leaves the EU. The PM is attempting to change that througha piece of secondary legislation,external. If she succeeds, the earliest Brexit will happen is 11pm on 12 April. Read more on the week ahead in Parliament In normal times, the government runs the country and Parliament - comprising all the MPs and Lords who are not members of the government - is there to monitor and scrutinise the way they are running things. The government cannot make new laws or raise taxes without Parliament's agreement. And Parliament can challenge or block many of the decisions made by government ministers. But ultimately it is the elected government that calls the shots - partly because it controls what gets debated in the Commons. A group of MPs is now bidding to take over the Commons timetable on one day this week, so it can hold votes on alternatives to the government's Brexit plans. The government does not have to abide by the outcome of these votes - and the prime minister has ordered Tory MPs to vote against the move, arguing it would set a dangerous precedent. She says the government will give MPs Parliamentary time to debate and vote on alternatives, in an effort to retain control. Brexit amendments: What are MPs voting on?

'Best day of the Trump presidency',"What was that film called? As Good As It Gets? That's how Donald Trump must feel now that the attorney general has published his four-page summary of the Mueller report. It is impossible to over-emphasise the significance of what has been said. If the Democrats want to remove this president from the White House, it's going to have to be via the ballot box in November 2020, and not before. The cloud that has been over the president for 22 months has gone, the weight that has sat on his shoulders has been lifted. This is without doubt the best day that Donald Trump has had since his inauguration in January 2017. So let's go through it. The Mueller investigation came in two parts - firstly, the question of whether there had been collusion between his campaign and the Russians. On that there is 100% exoneration. Special Counsel Robert Mueller found that his campaign did not conspire or coordinate with Russia. That issue is put to bed. On the question of obstruction of justice there is a bit of ambiguity. Mr Mueller has a very interesting sentence: ""While the report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" But that has been looked at by the attorney general and William Barr reaches this conclusion: ""Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offence."" This video can not be played Mueller report a ""complete exoneration"", says US President Trump So in the eyes of the AG, Trump is in the clear there too. That area of ambiguity is what the Democrats are going to focus upon. And here again, I am going to try to break this down into two parts. The first legal, the second political. Legally, the House Judiciary Committee will want to get its hands on the full Mueller report. They will want to see why Robert Mueller felt he couldn't exonerate the president on obstruction of justice. And remember, obstruction of justice is one of the so-called ""high crimes and misdemeanours"" that can lead to impeachment. There will be an endless back and forth over that. And I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised if the subpoenas start to fly. Committees have the right to call people and papers. They are bound to flex their muscles as much as they can. They want to play this long. They want to damage the president. To prosecute the president for obstruction of justice there would have needed to be evidence of intent to obstruct. So even though the president fired former FBI chief James Comey and unleashed regular torrents of abuse on Twitter about the investigation, if his only motivation for those acts was to vent his spleen rather than break the law, then he's done nothing wrong legally. Key lines from Barr summary Trump 'did not conspire with Russia' There is, of course, separately, a series of other criminal investigations going on into different aspects of the Trump Organization - the foundation, the inauguration committee, even the way the Trump Organization might have inflated or deflated insurance values on how much properties are worth. They will run their course. But make no mistake the greatest single piece of jeopardy came from the verdict of the Mueller report, and the interpretation that it amounts to a ""not guilty"" is an enormous fillip to Donald Trump. Now let's consider the political. This video can not be played Jon Sopel: 'The headline is the president is in the clear' It seems to me that while it is totally understandable that the Democrats are going to plug away - and in some ways it would be an abdication for an opposition party not to, and they may well do the president further damage - the risk associated with this course of action is bigger than any opportunity it presents. Public opinion is going to watch the network news bulletins tonight, look at the news websites after this exhausting 22 month process, and think ""OK, that's it. Move on."" How many ordinary people (a phrase I hate, but forgive me) would read the entire Mueller report with its endless appendices, even if it was released in total? I suspect not that many. And we all have busy lives and limited attention spans. The most successful politicians acknowledge that. A significant part of the voting population is just going to think ""Thank goodness that's over."" The danger for Democrats is exactly the same as Republicans faced over the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Despite his perjury and lies, President Clinton left office in 2000 with incredibly high approval ratings. Follow reaction as it comes in The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Why? Well, partly the economy was soaring. But also Democrats were repulsed by what they saw as political game playing by Republicans who were perceived to be putting their own political interests ahead of the country. And the feeling was - to use a word that Donald Trump is fond of - that the Republican Party was conducting a witch-hunt. Senior Democrats in Congress have always been aware of going down the impeachment route. But now they need to consider the risks of giving the appearance of being more interested and focused on bringing down the president than in the issues of ordinary people - health, work, salaries, college fees, schooling, the opioid epidemic etc. Donald Trump is, as I write this, aboard Air Force One on his way back to Washington. If he wasn't teetotal, I feel sure he would be uncorking the champagne. Maybe he'll have a celebratory Diet Coke with an extra cube of ice. He always said it was a hoax and a witch-hunt. And not surprisingly he says he has been totally vindicated. Shifting that narrative, much as the Democrats will try, is going to be immensely difficult.

Decoding what Barr really meant,"Attorney general William Barr was tasked with summarising the Mueller report for Congress Two days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller filed the report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to the attorney general, William Barr provided a four-page summary to Congress and the public. Mr Barr writes that the special counsel's 22-month inquiry involved 40 government investigators issuing more than 2,800 subpoenas and 500 search warrants questioning around 500 witnesses. What was the end result? Here are some key lines from the attorney general's letter and what they mean. ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities"" Most of Mr Barr's letter to Congress summarising the special counsel's investigation was in the attorney general's own words. In this instance, however, he chose to directly quote Mr Mueller's report. He clearly didn't want any misunderstanding about the investigation's conclusions. When Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mr Mueller as special counsel, he instructed the former FBI director to look for ""any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump"". On Sunday, in those 23 words, the special counsel provided his answer. Some will point to the words ""did not establish"" in that sentence and note that it doesn't mean the investigation found no evidence at all or that ""collusion"" didn't actually take place. Perhaps it isn't the ""complete and total exoneration"" that Mr Trump is claiming. When it comes to the language used in these type of investigations, however, it's as close as it going to get. ""As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign."" After outlining the special counsel's conclusions that the Russian government attempted to interfere with the 2016 election through social media disinformation and hacking the computers and emails of Democratic Party officials, Mr Barr again says there was no evidence of conspiracy or coordination - with a twist. There were ""multiple offers"" of Russian help to the Trump campaign This is probably a reference to the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr, senior campaign officials and Russians with ties to the Kremlin. It also might include Russian contacts by more tangential campaign aides such as George Papadopoulos and Carter Page or, perhaps, former Trump adviser Roger Stone's attempts to contact Wikileaks to find out about hacked Democratic emails. The details aren't provided, but the gist of what Mr Barr is saying is that while there was Russian outreach, there is no evidence that anyone from the Trump campaign took the bait. ""The Special Counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was only one component of Mr Mueller's special counsel work. He also looked into whether the president violated the law by obstructing the investigation. And instead of making a prosecutorial judgement, the former FBI director punted. ""While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime,""it also does not exonerate him,"" wrote Mr Barr, quoting the report. Noting ""difficult issues"" involved in the determination of the president's conduct, Mr Mueller presents both sides of the argument for charging the president with the crime of obstruction of justices. He then leaves it up to the attorney general to make the call. ""In cataloguing the President's actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent ..."" With the ball firmly in his court, Mr Barr - nominated to the job of attorney general by Mr Trump in December - decided Mr Trump would not be charged with obstruction of justice. Central to the attorney general's conclusion was the fact that the special counsel found no ""underlying crime"" of conspiracy with the Russians to interfere with the 2016 election. There has been an ongoing debate in legal circles on whether obstruction of justice can take place without evidence of a crime to investigate, and Mr Barr comes down solidly, if not entirely, on the ""no"" side. While Mr Trump made plenty of public statements that could be construed as an attempt to influence the investigation, it appears Mr Barr concluded that they were not done with ""corrupt intent"". The attorney general made sure to note that this decision was made in consultation with Mr Rosenstein, who had appointed Mr Mueller back in 2017, as well as other Justice Department lawyers. This was a judgement call - and Mr Barr will take heat for it from the president's critics. He clearly wanted to make sure he wasn't alone in the spotlight. ""My goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel's report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations and Departmental policies."" Now the waiting resumes. Mr Barr insists he will release as much of the report as he can, given rules that limit the disclosure of grand jury activities and information that could impact upon ongoing criminal proceedings. Democrats will be interested in learning of any more details unearthed in the Russia investigation, even if Mr Mueller did not conclude that there was sufficient evidence to prove conspiracy or coordination. In addition, they will want to see the pro-and-con arguments the special counsel made as it weighed charging Mr Trump with obstruction of justice. That's when the second-guessing of Mr Barr's decision will begin in earnest. All this, however, is going to take time. Meanwhile, Republicans - from the president down - will use Mr Barr's summary to argue that all the investigations into the president's conduct are baseless and should be abandoned. ""This should be a lesson to my Democrat colleagues that chasing imagined scandals and following a partisan investigatory agenda will not result in any meaningful change for the country,""writes Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy,external. There are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. Those inquiries will continue unabated. On Sunday, however, Mr Trump's side landed a powerful talking point to use in the political warfare to come.

Ministers tipped to replace PM rally round,"This video can not be played Theresa May's de-facto deputy backs her leadership Two ministers touted as a potential caretaker PM in reports of a cabinet coup say they fully back Theresa May. Environment Secretary Michael Gove told reporters it was ""not the time to change the captain of the ship"". And the PM's de facto deputy David Lidington insisted he was ""100% behind"" Mrs May. Meanwhile, the Brexit secretary said an election will become more likely if MPs vote this week for a Brexit option the government does not want. MPs are expected to get the chance to hold a series ofso-called indicative voteson possible alternatives to Mrs May's withdrawal deal, but Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said they would ""not be binding"". He was among the Tory MPs and ministers at talks with Mrs May on Sunday at Chequers, her country retreat. Prominent Brexiteers Mr Gove, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg were also present. They discussed a range of issues, including whether there was sufficient support to hold a third vote on the prime minister's deal this week, a Downing Street spokesman said. Newspapers claim cabinet ministers are plotting a coup against the prime minister, aiming to replace her with a caretaker leader until a proper leadership contest is held later in the year. The suggestion is that Tory MPs might reluctantly back Mrs May's Brexit deal if they know she will not be in charge of the next stage of negotiations with the EU, but there are differing accounts of who the preferred candidate to replace her is. The Sunday Times reports that Mr Lidington,external, who voted Remain, is being lined up, whilethe Mail on Sunday said the Brexiteer Environment Secretary Mr Gove,externalwas the ""consensus choice"". The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg says there is ""serious manoeuvring"" going on. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The prime minister has come under growing pressure to quit following a week in whichshe was forced to ask the EU for an extension to Article 50, andcriticised for blaming the delay to Brexit on MPs. The withdrawal deal she has negotiated with the EU has been overwhelmingly rejected in the Commons twice, and it remains unclear whether she will bring it back a third time next week aftershe wrote to MPssaying she would only do so if there was ""sufficient support"". One senior backbencher told the BBC's Iain Watson that even standing aside would not be enough for her deal to be voted through, and that Mrs May might as well ""dig in"". Varadkar will 'work with whoever is PM' Million joined Brexit protest, organisers say Ministers 'divided' on Brexit votes process Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Mr Gove said he was focused on getting the maximum amount of support for the prime minister and her Brexit deal. And Mr Lidington insisted Mrs May was ""doing a fantastic job"" and he had no desire to take over from her. Chancellor Philip Hammond told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday ""changing prime ministers wouldn't help, changing the party of government wouldn't help."" He denied reports he was hoping to parachute in Mr Lidington as caretaker, adding: ""To be talking about changing the players on the board, frankly, is self-indulgent at this time."" Mr Hammond said he understood MPs were ""very frustrated"", but ""one way or another Parliament is going to have an opportunity this week to decide what it's in favour of"". Former Conservative leader and prominent Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC's Andrew Marr the disloyalty some cabinet ministers were showing to her was ""appalling"". They should be censured, sacked, or at the very least ""they should be apologising and they should shut up,"" he added. MP for Aylesbury since 1992 and now Cabinet Office Minister, David Lidington, below left, is the prime minister's right-hand man and behind-the-scenes fixer. Once private secretary to William Hague when he was Tory leader, Mr Lidington was the longest-serving Minister for Europe under David Cameron and is clearly from the Remain camp. That makes him an unacceptable replacement for Theresa May in the eyes of Brexiteers. Lidington is well-liked among fellow MPs and has an easy way with journalists, but he has attracted criticism from some quarters for his voting record, especially on LGBTQ rights. He voted against same sex marriage and to maintain a ban on the promotion of homosexuality in schools. Former journalist turned MP for Surrey Heath, Michael Gove, above right, is currently environment secretary. He's previously held the justice and education briefs. He and Boris Johnson helped lead Vote Leave to victory in the EU referendum, but Gove later ran against his former Brexit ally for the Tory leadership. He was subsequently sacked as a minister by Theresa May when she eventually won that contest. Now having worked his way back into the senior echelons of government, Mr Gove is seen as someone who could hold the Conservative Party together, and might be a candidate Remainers could stomach because he's hinted he could be open to a softer form of Brexit. Arch Brexiteers feel, though, that for that very reason he'd be an unacceptable choice. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith calls ministerial disloyalty ""appalling"" The leadership row comes ahead of a week where the PM is expected to lose further control over the Brexit process. In the coming days, as many as six other options, in addition to Mrs May's deal, could be put to indicative votes in order to see which are most popular. They are: Revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit Another referendum The PM's deal plus a customs union The PM's deal plus both a customs union and single market access A Canada-style free trade agreement Leaving the EU without a deal Mr Hammond said he would remove revoking Article 50 and a no-deal Brexit from the list, as ""both of those would have very serious and negative consequences for our country"". On the subject of a second referendum, he said: ""It is a coherent proposition and deserves to be considered, along with the other proposals."" But Mr Barclay said there was a ""crisis"" because ""Parliament is trying to take over the government"". He said if MPs vote for a Brexit outcome at odds with the Tory manifesto - for example, in favour of maintaining single market membership - ""the risk of a general election increases, because you potentially have a situation where Parliament is instructing the executive to do something that is counter to what it was elected to do"". Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the indicative votes must be a ""serious exercise"". He said Labour would go into the process ""in good faith"" but there needed to be ""assurance that the prime minister isn't going to use it just to frustrate the process"". Labour chairman of the Brexit scrutiny committee Hilary Benn told Sky News MPs were just doing their job by attempting to take control of the process. Monday:MPs will debate the Brexit next steps and a number of amendments - possible alternatives - to the government plan will be put to a vote. One that could well succeed calls for a series of ""indicative votes"" in the Commons, run by Parliament, to see if a majority can be found for a different Brexit model. Tuesday:Theresa May could bring her withdrawal deal back for the so-called third meaningful vote. But the government says it won't do that unless it's sure it has enough to support to win. Wednesday:This is when indicative votes would be held - we don't know yet whether MPs will be free to vote how they want or be directed along party lines. The chances of any genuine cross-party consensus being achieved are not high. Thursday:A second possible opportunity for meaningful vote three. The prime minister may hope that Brexiteers will finally decide to throw their weight behind her deal because indicative votes have shown that otherwise the UK could be heading for the sort of softer Brexit they would hate. Friday:This is written into law as the day the UK leaves the EU, although the PM has said she will pass legislation this week to remove it. The earliest Brexit is likely to happen is now 12 April. Read more on the week ahead in Parliament This video can not be played Marchers called for a ""proper vote"" and said they'd been ""sold down the river"" On Saturday,hundreds of thousands of people marched in central London to call for another EU referendum. Organisers said the initial count showed more than a million people had turned up - putting it on a par with the biggest march of the century, the Stop the War march in 2003. Meanwhile, the woman behind a record-breaking anti-Brexit petition - which has received more than five million signatures -says she has received death threats over the poll. Earlier in the week, European leadersagreed to delay the UK's departure from the EU. If Mrs May's deal is approved by MPs next week, the EU has agreed to extend the Brexit deadline until 22 May. If it is not - and no alternative plan is put forward - the UK is set to leave the EU on 12 April.

Kenyan science teacher wins global prize,"Brother Peter Tabichi has been praised as an ""exceptional teacher"" who gives away most of his salary A science teacher from rural Kenya, who gives away most of his salary to support poorer pupils, has won a $1m prize (Â£760,000) for the world's best teacher. Peter Tabichi, a member of the Franciscan religious order, won the 2019 Global Teacher Prize. Brother Peter has been praised for his achievements in a deprived school with crowded classes and few text books. He wants pupils to see ""science is the way to go"" for their futures. The award, announced in a ceremony in Dubai, recognises the ""exceptional"" teacher's commitment to pupils in a remote part of Kenya's Rift Valley. He gives away 80% of his pay to support pupils, at the Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School in Pwani Village, Nakuru, who otherwise could not afford uniforms or books. ""It's not all about money,"" says Brother Peter, whose pupils are almost all from very disadvantaged families. Many are orphaned or have lost a parent. The 36-year-old teacher wants to raise aspirations and to promote the cause of science, not just in Kenya but across Africa. On winning the prize, Brother Peter hailed the potential of Africa's young population. ""As a teacher working on the front line I have seen the promise of its young people - their curiosity, talent, their intelligence, their belief. ""Africa's young people will no longer be held back by low expectations. Africa will produce scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs whose names will be one day famous in every corner of the world. And girls will be a huge part of this story."" Many pupils walk more than four miles to reach the school, in Kenya's Rift Valley The award, in a competition run by the Varkey Foundation, has seen him beating 10,000 other nominations from 179 countries. He is a Franciscan friar, a member of the Catholic religious order founded by St Francis of Assisi in the 13th Century. Brother Peter says there are ""challenges with a lack of facilities"" at his school, including not enough books or teachers. Classes meant to have 35 to 40 pupils are taught in groups of 70 or 80, which, he says, means overcrowded classrooms and problems for teachers. The lack of a reliable internet connection means he has to travel to a cyber-cafe to download resources for his science lessons. And many of the pupils walk more than four miles (6km) on bad roads to reach the school. But Brother Peter says he is determined to give them a chance to learn about science and to raise their horizons. His pupils have been successful in national and international science competitions, including an award from the Royal Society of Chemistry in the UK. The judges said that his work at the school had ""dramatically improved his pupils' achievement"", with many more now going on to college or university, despite resources at the schools being ""severely constrained"". Brother Peter says part of the challenge has been to persuade the local community to recognise the value of education, visiting families whose children are at risk of dropping out of school. He tries to change the minds of families who expect their daughters to get married at an early age - encouraging them to keep their girls in school. ""This is Africa's time,"" said the prize-winning teacher, Brother Peter Tabichi Brother Peter said the award was an optimistic sign. ""It's morning in Africa. The skies are clear. The day is young and there is a blank page waiting to be written. This is Africa's time,"" he said. Brother Peter was congratulated by Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta. ""Peter - your story is the story of Africa, a young continent bursting with talent. Your students have shown that they can compete amongst the best in the world in science, technology and all fields of human endeavour,"" said the Kenyan president. The competition is intended to raise the status of the teaching profession. Last year's winner was anart teacher from north London, Andria Zafirakou, and among this year'stop 10 finalists has been Andrew Moffat, a Birmingham head teacher at the centre of a row with parents about lessons on LGBT rights. The founder of the prize, Sunny Varkey, says he hopes Brother Peter's story ""will inspire those looking to enter the teaching profession and shine a powerful spotlight on the incredible work teachers do all over Kenya and throughout the world every day"". ""The thousands of nominations and applications we received from every corner of the planet is testimony to the achievements of teachers and the enormous impact they have on all of our lives,"" he says.

Shop worker stabbed to death in robbery,"The shop worker was stabbed at a newsagents in Pinner A shop worker has been stabbed to death in a robbery at a newsagents in north-west London. It is believed the 54-year-old was attacked while opening Marsh Food and Wine in Pinner at about 06:00 GMT, the Met Police said. Detectives said the shop's till had been stolen and may have been dumped somewhere by the robber. The murder has been described as a ""tragedy"" by locals. No arrests have been made.

Huge fossil discovery made in ChinaThe fossils found on a river bed in eastern China are estimated to be about 518 million years old.ChinaHorsebox driver stranded at high tideThe man attempted to drive across in an empty horsebox an hour after the safe crossing time ended.Tyne & Wear,"Scientists say the fossils have been ""exquisitely"" preserved Scientists say they have discovered a ""stunning"" trove of thousands of fossils on a river bank in China. The fossils are estimated to be about 518 million years old, and are particularly unusual because the soft body tissue of many creatures, including their skin, eyes, and internal organs, have been ""exquisitely"" well preserved. Palaeontologists have called the findings ""mind-blowing"" - especially because more than half the fossils are previously undiscovered species. The fossils, known as the Qingjiang biota, were collected near Danshui river in Hubei province. Fossils of soft-bodied creatures like jellyfish are extremely rare More than 20,000 specimens were collected, and a total of 4,351 have been analysed so far, including worms, jellyfish, sea anemones and algae. They will become a ""very important source in the study of the early origins of creatures"", one of the fieldwork leaders, Prof Xingliang Zhang from China's Northwest University, told the BBC. Details of the findings were published in the journal Science,externalon Friday. The creatures were rapidly buried by mudflows and sediment The discovery is particularly remarkable because ""the majority of creatures are soft-bodied organisms like jellyfish and worms that normally stand no chance of becoming fossilised"", Prof Robert Gaines, a geologist who also took part in the study, said in an email to the BBC. The majority of fossils tend to be of hard-bodied animals, as harder substances, like bones, are less likely to rot and decompose. The Qingjiang biota must have been ""rapidly buried in sediment"" due to a storm, in order for soft tissues to be so well preserved, Prof Zhang says. China fossil tells new supercontinent story Sea reptile one of the largest animals ever Naraoiids, a type of soft-shelled arthropod, were found at the site Scientists are especially excited by the jellyfish and sea anemone fossils, which Prof Gaines describes as ""unlike anything I have ever seen. Their sheer abundance and their diversity of forms is stunning"". Meanwhile, Prof Allison Daley, a palaeontologist who was not part of the study but wrote an accompanying analysis in Science,told BBC's Science in Action programme the find was one of the most significant in the last 100 years. ""It blew my mind - as a palaeontologist I never thought I'd get to witness the discovery of such an incredible site. ""For the first time we're seeing preservation of jellyfish - [when] you think of jellyfish today, they're so soft-bodied, so delicate, but they're preserved unbelievably well at this site."" An artist's impression of some of the species The research team are now documenting the remaining specimens, and conducting more drilling in the region to find out more about the ancient local ecosystem, and the fossilisation process. Prof Zhang says he looks forward to studying ""all these new species - I'm always excited when we get something new"". The research team says this is just the beginning of their work The fossils are from the Cambrian period, which began 541 million years ago and saw a rapid increase in animal diversity on Earth. Prof Gaines hopes his work will also strike a chord with modern readers. ""Biotic diversity today is something that we take for granted, even though there are indications that extinction rates are sharply increasing. ""Yet most of the major animal lineages were established in a singular event in the history of life, the Cambrian explosion,  the likes of which have never been seen before or after. It also reminds us of our deep kinship to all living animals."" China fossil tells new supercontinent story Does Jurassic Park make scientific sense?

Horsebox driver stranded at high tideThe man attempted to drive across in an empty horsebox an hour after the safe crossing time ended.Tyne & Wear,"The driver had tried to cross an hour after the safe crossing time had ended A horsebox driver became stranded when he attempted to cross a causeway at high tide. The man had to be rescued when the van became submerged on the Holy Island road, which is under water twice a day. He managed to escape and reach a refuge box. It is thought he did not realise it was unsafe to cross because he spoke little English. Ian Clayton, from Seahouses RNLI, said: ""We suspect that language problems may have contributed to this incident."" He added that despite the language difficulty they were able to establish no animals were inside the horsebox at the time. The man managed to make his way to a refuge box, seen here during low tide The rescue happened just after 15:00 GMT on Saturday. Safe crossing times to the island - also known as Lindisfarne - on Saturday were 08:20 until 13:50 and it was unsafe to cross until 20:50. Northumberland County Council installed warning signs at either end of the mile-long causeway in 2012 in a bid to cut the number of strandings. They display a message to check the tide tables followed by the safe crossing times.

Trump 'did not conspire with Russia'Robert Mueller's report finds no evidence of collusion; but does not exonerate Trump of obstruction.,"This video can not be played Mueller report: One summary, two interpretations US President Donald Trump's campaign did not conspire with Russia during the 2016 election, a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report says. The allegation clouded the first two years of Mr Trump's presidency and his allies see the report's finding as a boost to his re-election chances. But Attorney General William Barr's summary is inconclusive as to whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. Opposition Democrats are demanding full access to Mr Mueller's report. Having repeatedly described the inquiry as a witch hunt, Mr Trump said it was an ""illegal takedown that failed"". Despite the inconclusiveness of the report regarding allegations he obstructed justice, the president said it constituted ""complete and total exoneration"". Allow Twitter content?

The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Mueller report: Key lines from Barr summary Read Barr's full summary of the report The report was the culmination of two years of investigation by Mr Mueller which saw some of the president's closest former aides prosecuted and, in some cases, imprisoned, although not on charges related to the alleged Russian collusion. ""The special counsel did not find that any US person or Trump campaign official conspired or knowingly co-ordinated with Russia,"" Mr Barr writes. On the issue of whether justice was obstructed, Mr Mueller's report says: ""While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" In his summary, Mr Barr said the report ""ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment"". This video can not be played Mueller report a ""complete exoneration"", says US President Trump There was, he adds, insufficient evidence ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence"". Mueller hopefuls react to report Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? America's most mysterious public figure Mr Barr ends his letter by saying further extracts from the report will be released but notes that some of the material is subject to justice department restrictions. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has been sharply critical of the president in the past, tweeted that it wasa ""great day for President Trump and his team"",external. ""The cloud hanging over President Trump has been removed by this report,"" he said. ""Great job by Mr. Mueller and his team to thoroughly examine all things Russia,"" he added. ""Now it is time to move on, govern the country, and get ready to combat Russia and other foreign actors ahead of 2020."" White House adviser Kellyanne Conway sent the president ""congratulations"" on Twitter,external, saying: ""Today you won the 2016 election all over again. And got a gift for the 2020 election."" Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has taken almost two years ""They'll never get you because they'll never 'get' you."" Mr Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said the report had been better than he had expected while Republican Senator Mitt Romney welcomed the ""good news"", tweeting that it was now ""time for the country to move forward"". Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement thatMr Barr's letter ""raises as many questions as it answers"",externaland called for access to the full report. ""For the president to say he is completely exonerated directly contradicts the words of Mr Mueller and is not to be taken with any degree of credibility,"" the statement said. Congressman Jerry Nadler, the Democratic Chair of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, emphasised that Mr Trump had not been cleared of obstructing justice. ""Barr says that the president may have acted to obstruct justice, but that for an obstruction conviction, 'the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct'."" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate's Judiciary Committee, said that while there was a lack of evidence to support ""a prosecutable criminal conspiracy"", questions remained over whether Mr Trump had been compromised.

Russia has denied being involved in hacking to influence the 2016 US election result. Responding to news that Mr Trump had been cleared of collusion, Alexei Pushkov, a member of Russia's upper house, tweeted:""Democrats, Russophobes and leading media created a virtual conspiracy,externalwhich existed only in their heads and in headlines, and nowhere else."" The release of the report's key findings on Sunday could mark the start of a lengthy battle to see the entire Mueller report made public. Whenever further details are handed to Congress, Democrats may mount legal challenges if it is anything less than the entire report. Jerry Nadler said he would ask Mr Barr to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee ""in the near future"",externalover ""very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department"". About a dozen other investigations are continuing into Mr Trump's activities. These include a federal inquiry in New York into possible election law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses, and possible misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee. Congress is also continuing its own inquiries, mostly in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Attorney General Barr summarises, mostly in his own words, the conclusions of the special counsel's investigation. In one key line, however, he directly quotes the report. ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or co-ordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" There, in Robert Mueller's own words, is the end result of nearly two years of work, 2,800 subpoenas, hundreds of search warrants and countless hours of interviews. There were ""multiple offers"" of help from ""Russian-affiliated individuals"" to the Trump campaign, but they never took the bait. There was, as Donald Trump might say, ""no collusion"". At least, no evidence of it was unearthed. The obstruction of justice component is a murkier matter. The decision of whether to charge Mr Trump with interference with the various investigations wasn't Mr Mueller's. Saying it involved ""difficult issues"", the former FBI director punted. Instead, Mr Barr - in consultation with Department of Justice staff - decided not to prosecute, in part because there was no apparent underlying crime to obstruct. Make no mistake, today was a very good day for Mr Trump. While a bevy of inquiries into his presidency will grind on, the shadow of Mr Mueller's investigation - hovering over the White House since May 2017 - has been lifted.
