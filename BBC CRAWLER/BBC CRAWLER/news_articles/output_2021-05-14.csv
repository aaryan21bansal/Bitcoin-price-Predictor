Glasgow and Moray to stay under level 3 Covid rules,"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow and Moray 'need more time in level 3' Glasgow and Moray will remain under level three Covid restrictions for at least another week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. She said the ""difficult"" decision in Glasgow followed a rise in cases. Ms Sturgeon said the situation in the city was causing even more concern than Moray, which had already been warned it was likely to stay in level three. The decision means nearly 730,000 people in Glasgow and Moray will not move down to level two. Ms Sturgeon said initial research suggested that the outbreak centred in the south side of Glasgow was being driven by the Indian variant of the virus. Moray outbreak 'showing signs of improvement' Fans at Scottish Cup final 'at risk' What Covid rules are changing, and when? What level will you be in from 17 May? The first minister added that people were being asked not to travel in or out of Glasgow and Moray for the coming week, unless the journey was for permitted purposes. The rest of mainland Scotland will drop down to level two from Monday, and most islands will be placed in level one. Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is inevitable that as we continue to navigate our way through this pandemic, we will hit bumps in the road. ""However, if we exercise suitable caution as we're seeking to do today, then even though that is difficult, we are much more likely to stay on the right track overall."" The seven-day rate of cases per 100,000 population in Glasgow is 80.4, while in Moray it has fallen to 68.9. The rates are above 50 cases per 100,000, a key benchmark for deciding the appropriate tier of restrictions. The latest Public Health Scotland data shows that on 11 May, the rates per 100,000 population were also above that level in East Renfrewshire (52.3), Midlothian (50.8) and Clackmannanshire (50.4). The Glasgow cases are concentrated mainly in the south of the city, with one district, Pollokshields West, seeing 47 positive cases over the previous seven days, giving a local case rate of 1,008 per 100,000 population. The move to level two Covid restrictions on Monday in the rest of mainland Scotland will allow people to hug and visit other households indoors. Pubs and restaurants can also sell alcohol indoors. Ms Sturgeon said the Indian variant of the virus had been detected in Glasgow, which caused increased concern among public health advisers and the government. ""We do not yet have a full understanding of the impact of this variant, including on the protection afforded by the vaccines,"" she said. ""I do want to stress that nothing at this stage suggests it is causing more severe illness. ""However, it is thought that this variant could be significantly more transmissible than even the Kent variant that was identified before Christmas - and that alone calls for an appropriate degree of caution."" She added that public health teams were ""optimistic that enhanced testing and vaccination will be capable of getting this situation under control"". Ms Sturgeon also said there were ""grounds for cautious optimism that the situation is improving"" in Moray. However, the number of cases is still more than double the Scottish average. The first minister said it was ""prudent"" to keep the area in level three for another week ""so we can be more confident that the situation is firmly under control"". The deputy director of public health at NHS Grampian, Chris Littlejohn, said: ""The current restrictions and interventions appear to be working. ""This is not the moment to lower our guard - but we hope we can see the end of the current outbreak not too far ahead if we stick with it."" NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is encouraging all people in the hotspot areas to visit a Covid testing centre. It said it was ""actively pursuing"" ways to ensure vaccination uptake was as high as possible. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce's chief executive, Stuart Patrick, said the decision was ""deeply disappointing"" and that many businesses would have been ""caught up in developments outside their control"". Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Scotland, said local businesses and customers in Glasgow and Moray would be ""crushed"". ""The damage of this change, especially in Glasgow, is exacerbated by the lateness of this announcement,"" he said. ""It means wasted stock, disappointed customers and increased debt."" Stephen Montgomery of the Scottish Hospitality Group said: ""We're in exactly the situation we wanted to avoid. Staff are getting ready for their shifts or have been working flat out to prepare for opening. ""You can't just turn this stuff on and off like flicking a light switch."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: ""This decision will come as a disappointment to many, but I fully understand and appreciate the need for this action. ""If the right action is taken now, we can get Glasgow and Moray back on track and into level two as soon as safely possible."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Delay child vaccinations and share jabs, WHO urges","The WHO's Dr Tedros has warned that the second year of the pandemic is likely to be deadlier than the first Wealthier nations should postpone plans to give children and teenagers Covid vaccines and instead donate supplies to low-income countries, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday urged countries to supply more vaccines to the global fair-access scheme Covax. The international distribution of Covid vaccines remains vastly uneven. Since the first vaccines were approved in December, wealthier countries have bought up most of the supply. Many are racing to vaccinate as much of their population as possible. How will Covid vaccines be shared globally? How fast is vaccination progressing around the world? Speaking at a virtual conference in Geneva on Friday, the WHO's Dr Tedros said he understood why some countries wanted to vaccinate children and adolescents, but said ""right now, I urge them to reconsider"". ""In low and lower-middle income countries, Covid-19 vaccine supply has not been enough to even immunise healthcare workers, and hospitals are being inundated with people that need lifesaving care urgently,"" he said. Last week, US President Joe Biden laid out plans to begin coronavirus vaccine shots for 12- to 15-year-olds as soon as possible. He also said he hoped that 70% of US adults would receive at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by 4 July, when American families are expected to come together to mark Independence Day. Meanwhile,Canada has authorised the use of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for children aged between 12 and 15. The province of Alberta, which has the highest rate of the virus in the country, has already started offering the jabs to citizens over the age of 12. In Switzerland, some places began offering Covid vaccination appointments to 16-year-olds last week. So far, the US and China have administered the highest number of vaccine doses overall, with India in third place. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns, a few countries in Africa are still to get started. The Covax scheme was developed with the aim of first vaccinating 20% of the population in the 92 poorer countries that signed up, starting with health workers. The scheme is co-led by the WHO, the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), with the UN children's fund, Unicef, as key implementation partner. During Friday's conference, Dr Tedros also warned that the second year of the pandemic was likely to be deadlier than the first, and that the situation in India was of grave concern. In India, many health workers on the frontline dealing with coronavirus patients have not been vaccinated, and some are dying. The severe shortage of doses comes amid a deadly second Covid wave and warnings of an impending third wave. How India's vaccine drive went horribly wrong The WHO says this is a moral catastrophe, which could greatly impact more low-income countries.

Portugal to allow UK tourists from Monday,"British tourists will be allowed to enter Portugal from next Monday, the Portuguese authorities have announced. Portugal is on the UK's ""green"" list for unrestricted travel from then, but there had been confusion over whether the Portuguese would reciprocate. Coronavirus is still causing concern in Portugal and the country has extended its state of calamity to 30 May. The government in Lisbon said anyone arriving would need to take a negative PCR test before departure. The announcement was made by the Portuguese foreign ministry, which said tourism authorities had been ensuring that testing capacity in Portugal will meet the demand from tourists. ""With an air capacity from (at least) 21 airports in the United Kingdom into Portugal, reinforced due to the high demand from this market, the options are wide for the British tourists to visit Portugal from any point,"" the ministry said. ""People from the United Kingdom have visited Portugal and celebrated our culture, traditions, landmarks, history, and enjoyed our warm hospitality for decades. We look forward to welcome all travellers coming from the UK."" The rules for holidays in green list countries like Portugal The Portuguese announcement followed days of uncertainty and confusion over whether thousands of holidays booked by UK travellers from Monday would in fact go ahead. On Thursday, it looked as though many holidaymakers' hopes would be dashed when Portugal extended its Covid emergency measures. But to widespread relief, the Lisbon government has now given its approval to UK tourists. Authorities in the UK had already announced that travellers from England and Scotland  would not have to quarantine on their return from Portugal and other ""green list"" countries from 17 May. However, those countries have their own restrictions on who can visit. As an NHS worker, 32-year-old Rebecca Morgan, of Bow in east London, has gone beyond the call of duty during the pandemic. Instead of taking her annual leave over the past year, she has been doing extra shifts on Covid wards. But now she feels it really is time for a break - which is why she plans to fly to Faro in Portugal on 31 May for a week's holiday. ""I'm super-desperate to go away,"" she told the BBC. ""I've not had a proper week off for a year and a half. I'm really looking forward to having a good lie down on the beach."" Rebecca is expecting to pay Â£400 for the three required PCR tests and would have preferred the option to isolate at home. ""The cost of the tests will probably cost more than the holiday,"" she says. ""I'm tested twice a week for work, had Covid back in January and I've had both vaccines now, so I'm not expecting to get Covid at this stage."" At present, Portugal allows flights to and from the UK, but only for essential travel, such as for business, study, family reasons, health or humanitarian reasons. Those travel restrictions will be lifted only from 17 May. Tui has 44 flights due to depart for Portugal between 17 and 30 May. These include 28 to the Algarve, a popular destination for UK summer holidays. Other firms, including EasyJet, have been offering holidays and flights to green list countries, but online travel firm On The Beachhas stopped selling all holidays for this summerbecause of Covid uncertainty. EasyJet said: ""We welcome the decision from the Portuguese government meaning that those travelling from the UK will be allowed to travel safely to Portugal from Monday. ""We look forward to reuniting friends and family and taking customers on a long-awaited holiday this summer."" The Abta travel association said it was ""fantastic"" that tourists could return to Portugal. ""UK tourism is a really important part of the Portuguese economy, contributing half a billion pounds a year in normal times,"" an Abta spokesperson said. At the same time,Greece has launched its tourist season, lifting most remaining restrictions on movement and declaring ""we are putting the lockdown behind us"". Although an average of 2,000 daily Covid cases are still being reported, vaccinations are being rolled out with the Greek islands as a priority. How are travel rules being relaxed?

SNP holds Airdrie and Shotts seat in by-election,"This video can not be played Anum Qaisar-Javed pays tribute to her pupils and says she hopes her win can inspire others The SNP has held one of its Westminster seats in a by-election after seeing off a challenge from Labour. Anum Qaisar-Javed won the Airdrie and Shotts seat for the SNP with a reduced majority of 1,757 over her Labour opponent. Her victory brings the total number of SNP MPs in the Commons back to 45. The by-election was held after sitting MP Neil Gray resigned in order to stand in last week's Scottish Parliament election. Ms Qaisar-Javed is a 28-year-old modern studies teacher who was a Labour activist until the independence referendum in 2014. She becomes Scotland's second-ever female Muslim MP. Her win follows the SNP's landslide victory in last week's Scottish Parliament election - which saw the SNP's Kaukab Stewart and Pam Gosal of the Scottish Conservatives become the country'sfirst women of colourto be elected to Holyrood. The by-election saw Ms Qaisar-Javed receive 10,129 votes, with Labour second on 8,372 - a majority of 1,757. The SNP's share of the vote was 46.4% - 1.4 percentage points higher than in the 2019 election - with Labour's share increasing by 6.5 percentage points to 38.4%. The Conservatives finished third with 2,812 votes, with the Liberal Democrats fourth on 220. Turnout was 34.3% - lower than the average of 46.5% for a by-election in the last parliament - with counting being done overnight. Mr Gray won the seat for the SNP with a majority of 5,201 in the last general election in 2019. He was elected as the MSP for the Airdrie and Shotts seat in the Scottish Parliament last week - with SNP rules meaning he had to quit as an MP in order to stand for Holyrood. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Qaisar-Javed said she hoped to be a role model for other people from minority backgrounds - and also pledged to ""fight for independence"" after being elected. She said she taught her students about why there are fewer people from minority communities in politics, adding: ""We talk about reasons such as a lack of role models, and it has taken until 2021, but now we have two women of colour in the Scottish Parliament. ""But I don't just want women of colour to look at me, or people of colour, I want anyone from any minority group to be able to look at me and say 'if she can do it, so can I'."" Counting was done overnight at the Ravenscraig Regional Sports Facility In a speech made after votes were counted at the Ravenscraig Regional Sports Facility in Motherwell, she added that the ""initial priority has to be the Covid recovery"". But she said: ""As we move through the pandemic and when the time is right, then yes of course we will be looking to campaign for another independence referendum, as is the right of people of Scotland. ""Whatever the result is of that referendum, so be it, but that choice is of paramount importance."" The contest was the first Westminster by-election to be held in Scotland since 2011. This was the SNP's first ever Westminster by-election defence, and one they have handled fairly comfortably - albeit with a reduced majority. In theory this could have been a closer contest, with Labour coming within 195 votes of regaining the seat in 2017, but it increasingly seemed like the forgotten election as polling day approached. It was perhaps understandable that it would fly under the radar in terms of the political debate in Scotland, coming as it did one week after a crucial set of Scottish Parliament elections. But the same was true from a Westminster angle, with the contest in Hartlepool a week earlier seeming to take on far greater significance in the eyes of Labour, particularly in the wake of their defeat. Airdrie and Shotts was once a Labour stronghold, and a textbook example of Scotland's importance to the party's position in government. It was the base first of the Scottish Secretary, Helen Liddell, and then the Home Secretary, John Reid. Tonight, it has once again been held by the SNP, the new dominant political force in this part of the world - while UK Labour's focus appears to be on bickering over the results of elections elsewhere.

People in Wales asked not to travel abroad,"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford gives his first Covid update since the election People in Wales will be able to travel to a small list of countries from Monday without going into quarantine when they get back. But despite adopting thetraffic-light systemused in England, ministers are advising people not to go abroad. The first minister warned it was ""best avoided"" because of concerns travellers could bring Covid with them. Meanwhile, he revealed he had planned to go further in easing Covid rules but paused because ofthe Indian variant. Plans to allow pubs to trade indoors, and for cinemas and museums to reopen, will go ahead from Monday. Ministers had considered relaxing lockdown restrictions further on the same, but Mark Drakeford said officials had ""decided to hold back"" for more advice. He told the BBC he had been considering allowing ""some small events"" and ""greater mixing between people not in a household"". Both are now on hold. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? No new deaths with Covid-19 reported in Wales Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Experts are concerned the variant has mutationsthat may make it more transmissible, but it is not yet known if it causes more severe disease or if it might make current vaccines less effective. A total of 26 cases of two variants first identified in India had been found in Wales as of last Thursday - including 11 of a type identified by officials as a ""variant of concern"". A total of 1,313 cases of the variant of concern have been identified in the UK. Why is the India variant causing concern in the UK? Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcedon Friday eveningthe wait between jabs will be cut from 12 weeks to eight for the over-50s and clinically vulnerable because of concern over the Indian variant. The change does not apply in Wales and the Welsh government said it will continue with the rollout as planned. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We have considered the latest evidence and advice from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation]. ""Given the low numbers of the Indian variant and the high numbers of people in Wales already vaccinated, we are confident that our vaccination programme already has the flexibility it needs to respond swiftly and effectively and are not making any changes at this stage."" Most people who travel from Wales will be doing it from airports like Bristol, the first minister said People in England and Scotland can take holidays abroad ina small number of so-called ""green"" countries,external- including Portugal, Israel and Singapore - without having to quarantine when they return. Wales will be adopting the same ""traffic light"" system, with countries classified as green, amber and red. It means people will be able to travel to a small number of foreign destinations in the green list without the need to quarantine on their return. Mandatory quarantine for countries not on the green list remains in place, and visitors to red list countries will need to book hotels on their return. Everyone who travels will need to book at least one test on their return. How will the rules work? Portugal to allow UK tourists from Monday However, the Welsh government said it would continue to advise people to only travel for essential purposes. Mr Drakeford said: ""This is the year to take your holiday in Wales and foreign travel is best avoided."" He admitted his travel advice was not a rule because it would be ""unenforceable"". He urged caution against ""importing"" coronavirus from other parts of the world. ""We know most people who travel from Wales will be doing it from Bristol, Manchester, London, so once those airports are open and travel across the UK is allowed, then people from Wales will be able to travel,"" he said. Mr Drakeford told a press conference on Friday he did not want to ""make people feel guilty"" about going abroad, but urged people to ""think of their own safety and the safety of others"", adding there were ""fantastic opportunities"" to take a holiday in Wales instead. NHS app ready to become vaccine passport next week From 24 May, a ""paper-based vaccination status"" will be available for people in Wales who have had two doses of vaccination and need to urgently travel to a country that requires Covid vaccination proof. A UK government app that will act as a vaccine passport is due to be available in England on Monday, but the first minister said there was likely to be a four-week gap before it could be used in Wales due to technical reasons. Pubs will open indoors for the first time since last December Mr Drakeford told the press conference Wales would move to Covidalert level two,externalfrom Monday, meaning: Pubs and restaurants can reopen indoors for groups of six people from up to six different households Holiday accommodation can fully reopen Cinemas, theatres bingo halls, bowling alleys, indoor play centres and areas, casinos and amusement arcade can reopen Up to 30 people can take part in indoor activities, and up to 50 in organised outdoor activities From 24 May, restrictions on numbers of visitors to care homes will be eased. Mr Drakeford said that, if the situation remained positive at the start of June, he would look at whether Wales could move toalert level one,external. But he warned he may need to delay that because of the Indian variant. This move would include ""looking at relaxing the rules further around people meeting in their own homes, increasing the number of people able to attend wedding receptions and restarting larger events"". Pub owner Ellen Morris says it will be hard for the hospitality trade to police the new rules Ellen Morris, the owner of two pubs in Bala, Gwynedd, welcomed the relaxation of the rules but said it would be difficult to police rules which dictate only six people from six different household can meet. ""They are grown adults - they should be able to decide, it shouldn't be me telling them you can do this,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. ""They call it hospitality - I don't feel I'm being very hospitable these days. We are talking about people's mental health here. It's been a long enough year without being left out of groups."" Mr Drakeford said social distancing rules in hospitality venues could be lifted if transmissions continued to fall.

She said she had been ""extremely cautious"" and followed the rules very closely, but was frustrated by stricter rules in Wales than in England. ""My bugbear is we can't even do things like background noise, so those opportunities are gone, but DJs in England are able to do that."" Wedding planner Gail Windley says weddings of 30 people are still too small for most people The relaxation will also mean indoor play centres can open, and indoor wedding ceremonies of up to 30 people can take place. Gail Windley, a wedding planner from Swansea, welcomed the news but said it would still mean weddings would be too small for most couples, and criticised a lack of clarity about further easing. Charmaine Heydenrych, who owns a soft play centre in Cardiff, said she was ""ready"" to open but said being limited to 30 people was ""not sustainable"". Mark Drakeford said foreign travel was best avoided Welsh Conservative Russell George welcomed the move to level two but said the Welsh government ""should have outlined a roadmap to give hope to businesses and communities"". ""It is concerning that the Welsh Government has indicated that social distancing and mask wearing will be required into the Autumn. ""What people really want is for the Welsh and UK governments to work together, to end the confusion over different restrictions in the two countries, especially as the virus does not recognise borders."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the first minister's call for people to holiday in Wales rather than go aboard. ""It's a positive message - we need it for the economy as well. It's not just about greater health protection but also supporting tourism and hospitality businesses which have had a torrid time"". Mr Price said the sector still needed further financial support: ""What is the plan for the months ahead for hospitality?"". The 26 cases of two variants first fouind in India are ""almost entirely the result of international travel"", the first minister said. Mr Drakeford said those infected were ""people coming back to Wales from overseas"" and all cases were being carefully monitored by local public health teams. ""All the information I have had is that the individuals involved are following all the advice that they are required to follow, self-isolating and so on,"" he said. ""And the advice I have is not that we need to be overly concerned about the position in Wales at the moment."" Dr Gill Richardson, deputy chief medical officer for vaccines in Wales, told BBC Wales ""we're not led to believe that it will evade the vaccine at this point"". Public Health Wales told BBC Wales it was not identifying where the 11 variant of concern cases were ""due to the risk of small number identification"". Dr Robin Howe, incident director for Public Health Wales, said the majority of cases were associated with travel or with known contact, with the remainder still under investigation.

What is the Indian Covid variant?,"A coronavirus variant identified in India is being investigated by scientists across the world. However, it is not yet known how far it has spread or whether it is drivingthe deadly second wave of Covid in India itself. Viruses mutate all the time, producing different versions or variants of themselves. Most of these mutations are insignificant - and some may even make the virus less dangerous - but others can make it more contagious and harder to vaccinate against. This variant - officially known as B.1.617 - was first detected in India in October. Sample testing is not widespread enough across India to determine how far or quickly the variant is spreading. It was detected in 220 out of 361 Covid samples collected between January and Marchin the western Indian state of Maharashtra,external. Meanwhile, it has been spotted in at least 21 countries, according tothe GISAID global database.,external International travel appears to have brought the variant to the UK, where 103 cases have been identified since 22 February. Most travellers from India havenow been banned from coming to the UK. Public Health England has listed the India variant as one of several ""variants under investigation"". The BBC has beentold by expertsthat it could soon be added to the ""variant of concern"" list. What are the Brazil, South Africa and UK variants? People queue for Covid testing in Jammu, Kashmir Scientists do not yet know whether this variant is more infectious or resistant to vaccines. Dr Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University, says one of its mutations is similar to those seen in variants identified in South Africa and Brazil. And this mutation may help the virus evade antibodies in the immune system that can fight coronavirus based on experience from prior infection or a vaccine. But what appears to be more worrying at the moment is a variant identified in the UK, which is dominant in Britain and has spread to more than 50 countries. ""I doubt whether the Indian variant is more infectious than the UK variant - and we must not panic,"" Dr Kamil says. Much of the data around the India variant is incomplete, scientists say, with very few samples being shared - 298 in India and 656 worldwide, compared with more than 384,000 sequences of the UK variant. And after the first recorded cases in India, fewer than 400 cases of the variant have been detected worldwide, Dr Kamil says. India has been reporting about 200,000 Covid cases daily since 15 April - well beyond its peak of 93,000 cases a day last year. Deaths too have been rising. ""India's high population and density is a perfect incubator for this virus to experiment with mutations,"" says Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge. However, the wave of cases in India could have been caused by large gatherings, and lack of preventive measures such as mask-wearing or social distancing. Why second Covid wave is devastating India Dr Jeffrey Barrett, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, says it is possible there could also be a cause-and-effect relationship with the new variant, but there is still a lack of evidence. He points out that the India variant has been around since late last year: ""If it is driving the wave in India it has taken several months to get to this point which would suggest it's probably less transmissible than the Kent B117 variant."" Scientists believe existing vaccines will help control the variant when it comes to preventing severe disease. Some variants will inevitably escape the current vaccines, according toa paper published in Nature by Prof Gupta and his fellow researchers.,externalAs a result, changes to vaccine design will be needed to make them more effective. However, the vaccinations now available are still likely to slow down the spread of the disease. ""For most people, these vaccines can mean the difference between little to no disease and ending up in the hospital with a risk of dying,"" says Dr Kamil. ""Please take the first vaccine you are offered. Do not make the mistake of hesitating and waiting for an ideal vaccine."" This video can not be played What went wrong for India?

Young people 'coming in droves' for first jab,"Greta Sion from Cardiff was thrilled to get her first vaccine before going back to university for a postgraduate degree Almost half of young adults have received a first coronavirus vaccine in some Welsh health board areas. In north Wales, 44% of people aged 18-29 have been given a first dose, while in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan 46% have been vaccinated. An average of 36.6% of people under 30 in Wales have had the jab as the roll-out moves at different speeds across Welsh health boards. One vaccine centre manager said young people were ""coming in their droves"". The Welsh government has committed to offering every adult a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine by the end of July, after succeeding in offering all people in priority groups one to nine a first dose by the middle of April. People under 30 have been offered the Pfizer jab as an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine,after a link with rare blood clots was identified. Thatwas extended to people under 40 last week. How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Young people to be reinfected with Covid for study Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? While vaccine centres have dealt with a greater number of people failing to attend appointments compared with the initial roll-out to more vulnerable groups, one vaccine manager said the data showed a ""promising"" commitment to being vaccinated among younger age groups. ""We have seen a really good uptake,"" said Tom Halpin, who manages the Deeside Rainbow Vaccination Centre at a leisure centre in Queensferry, Flintshire. ""It is really promising to see all the young people coming through the doors. We run seven days a week, so the fact that lots of them are taking time out of working days to come and receive their vaccine is really promising."" The Deeside centre is in the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board area which covers the whole of north Wales. Their latest update this week showed that 44% of people aged 18-29 had received a first dose of the Covid vaccine. Other health board areas are also nearing half their young adult population, including the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area where 46% of 18 to 29-year-olds have had the vaccine. Mr Halpin said the vaccine uptake was part of a desire to ""get back to normal"" among younger age groups. ""There was definitely a huge sense of relief in the early days when we were on the higher priority groups, everybody was really relieved to receive their vaccine,"" he said. ""Now, I think people want to get back to normal, and the younger group are coming in their droves to help enable that to happen."" Greta Sion had her first vaccine last week. She was called for a jab after signing up to a reserve list in case of spare doses. ""I queued for a while but it was such an easy process. Within half an hour, I was done. I was vaccinated,"" said the 23-year-old currently working in Cardiff. While she had seen stories about possible side effects, Ms Sion, who plans to study a postgraduate degree at Oxford University, said the benefits of getting the vaccine outweighed any risks. ""I didn't really question it,"" she said. ""I just thought, up until now, it has been such a success. I think that this is the way out of it, or at least the way towards a little bit more normality."" ""I am hoping to do a postgraduate degree in September so it means I will be able to meet my fellow students, we will be able to socialise,"" said Ms Sion. ""It is what we have wanted for a year so hopefully this will just open so many doors, and we can see the restrictions being eased a bit more now."" Her friends are sharing selfies from vaccine centres and they are ""excited"" to get it. ""From my experience, I know all my friends have been quite excited to get it. ""We are asking each other 'Have you been vaccinated?' - we have all been very willing, and we want it. ""To know that this means that we and those around us are going to be safer - there is no doubt, we have been very willing and excited to get it.""

Edwin Poots is elected DUP leaderThe NI agriculture minister will succeed Arlene Foster as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.,"This video can not be played DUP: Edwin Poots elected new party leader Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots has been elected leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. He succeeds Arlene Foster, who steps down as party leaderon 28 May and will then leave her role as NI first minister at the end of June. Mr Poots beat MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to take the top post in the party. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. Mr Poots received 19 votes and Sir Jeffrey 17 votes. He has said that he would like to remain as agriculture minister andwould not take on the role of Northern Ireland first ministerif elected party leader. Edwin Poots: Who is the new leader of the DUP? From firebrands to government - who are the DUP? North Belfast MLA Paula Bradley has been elected as the party's new deputy leader, after incumbent Lord Dodds announcedhe would not bid for re-election. She beat MP Gregory Campbell by 18 votes to 16, and is the first woman elected to the post. Only three people have held the role of DUP leader since the party was established in 1971 - its founder the late Ian Paisley, followed by Peter Robinson and its current leader, Arlene Foster. Edwin Poots and his new party deputy, Paula Bradley A secret party ballot of party MPs and NI Assembly members was held on Friday. Mr Poots said it was an immense honour to be selected for the top post and he was looking forward to a ""positive relationship right across Northern Ireland with my party colleagues and indeed with people from other parties"". He said Northern Ireland people had shown ""remarkable resilience"". ""I stand here very proud to be taking up the mantle as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and that brings with it a responsibility to all of unionism,"" he said. ""I will be a leader in unionism who will be reaching out to other leaders in unionism. I want to see unionism working together."" He said the Northern Ireland Protocol, which places a border down the Irish Sea, has proven to be a ""massive challenge for us"". He said he wants to ensure that there is not the ""unionist bickering that we have had in the past"" and ""I will encourage all unionists to work with me"". Later, speaking to reporters outside Stormont, Mr Poots said he would speak to Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis on Friday night and meet him next week. The DUP leader-designate cancelled media interviews and did not take any questions. Paula Bradley MLA is the first woman elected to the DUP deputy leader post Mr Lewis, and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, separately tweeted their congratulations to Mr Poots and said they looked forward to working with him. Ahead of the party vote, in a message to MPs and Northern Ireland Assembly members, Mr Poots said that leading the DUP ""would be my greatest honour"". He said he had been ""tried and tested over many years in political office"" and had a plan to ""reinvigorate unionism"". Ms Bradley said she would serve the party to the best of her ability and give it ""her all"". She said she would support the leader, but would at times be a ""critical friend"". ""It's a great honour. I would never have thought just over a week ago that I would be standing in this position today,"" she said. There has been concern in the past that it looked like the DUP's Westminster grouping seemed to have too much power and too much sway. Clearly this is a signal that they want the power base shifted back to Stormont and that is what is going to happen from the end of the month. For Edwin Poots, this has been a lifelong ambition for him. He is steeped in the DUP. His father is a DUP founding member. He is also Free Presbyterian. He has talked about reform being one of his key policies and clearly that has won some of those undecided DUP politicians over, in terms of getting behind him. There has been a concern in recent years that some of the establishment and key central figures within DUP HQ held too much power. He obviously wants to oversee all of that and that has been what he's promised them. Clearly the pitch has paid off. The result of this also shows that there is still a split in the party. Some of those within Sir Jeffrey's camp are incredibly disappointed and very shocked by the result. They were quietly confident that they were going to edge it. Mr Poots became an MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) for the Lagan Valley constituency in 1998 and has also served on Lisburn City Council. He has served as Northern Ireland minister for the environment, minister for arts, culture and leisure and as health minister over the course of his political career. After the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in agreed to share power together and formed a government in 2007, Mr Poots was appointed as culture and arts minister in the executive. It would be the first of a number of ministerial briefs he has held during his political career. Edwin Poots smiles as he leaves DUP headquarters on Friday The DUP is a socially conservative party and Mr Poots's religiously-influenced views - including his belief that the earth is 6,000 years old - have also generated headlines in the past.

North Belfast MLA Paula Bradley is the party's new deputy leader She currently chairs Stormont's Communities Committee. Prior to being elected to Stormont, she had been a councillor on Newtownabbey council. Ms Bradley is one of the more socially liberal members of the party. Defeated leadership contender Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he has has no regrets about putting his name forward. ""They [party members] have made their choice and I respect that,"" he said. ""The party must now consider what that means for our way forward, what it means for the union that we cherish, and what it means for Northern Ireland."" MP Ian Paisley, who backed Mr Poots for leader, said he was ""personally delighted"" for him. ""We have been boyhood friends, and are very, very close, and I am personally delighted for him,"" Mr Paisley said. ""I am also delighted for Paula. She is an absolutely excellent candidate for deputy leadership, she made one of the best speeches I have ever heard in a selection meeting today."" He said the differences between the leadership candidates were ""subtle"". Defeated leadership and deputy leadership contenders Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gregory Campbell earlier on Friday ""It is important that people recognise that because the power base is at Stormont, and because most of the votes in the electoral college are based at Stormont, then clearly that is where the influence is going to be,"" he added. East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson declined to say which candidate he had voted for, but congratulated Mr Poots and Mrs Bradley. He described his election as ""very significant"" and said dealing with the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland and the Irish Sea border would be a ""massive issue"". ""Not only for unionists, but for people across the political spectrum.

Sunday's live coverage was brought to you by a team of journalists in London - Rebecca Seales, Paul Kirby and David Walker. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned anti-Semitism targeting British Jews, after a video emerged of a convoy of cars brandishing Palestinian flags in North London, with anti-Semitic abuse apparently being shouted through a megaphone. London's Metropolitan Police said they were aware of the video, which appeared to be filmed in the St John's Wood area, which is home to a Jewish community. Allow Twitter content?

Opposition Labour leaderKeir Starmer said the incident was ""utterly disgusting"",external, tweeting that there had to be consequences: ""Antisemitism, misogyny and hate have no place on our streets or in our society."" The Jewish community's Community Security Trust said it was fully aware of ""appalling anti-Semitic intimidation and incitement from [a] âpro-Palestinianâ car convoy from Bradford"". The Mayor of LondonSadiq Khan has said he is deeply concerned,externalby reports of ""hateful, intimidating and racist language used on marches and social media"". ""Behaviour that incites anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim hatred has no place in our city,"" he said. We have more details on this story here. Nine police officers were hurt during big pro-Palestinian protests in central London yesterday. Protesters called for the UK government to ""stop allowing Israel's brutal violence"" against the Palestinians. Police said the demonstrations had been largely peaceful but projectiles had been thrown in ""small pockets of disorder"". Air raids have reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza Israel's military says the destruction of homes in Gaza City which killed 42 Palestinians was caused by an attack on a Hamas tunnel system. Several homes were reduced to rubble following an air strike early on Sunday. Israel said it had attacked a militant tunnel system which collapsed, bringing residential buildings down with it. It said the deaths were unintentional. Ten children were among the victims. Rescue workers combed through the debris of the buildings on Sunday recovering bodies. ""These are moments of horror that no-one can describe. Like
an earthquake hit the area,"" said Mahmoud Hmaid, who was helping the efforts. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent in Jerusalem Is Israelâs military
operation in Gaza, dubbed âGuardian of the Wallsâ, nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Benjamin
Netanyahu says attacks are continuing with âfull forceâ and will âtake timeâ. In a news conference this
afternoon, Israelâs prime minister admitted there were âpressuresâ but thanked
US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Netanyahu has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire with Hamas Mr Bidenâs envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Unusually, at the end of a week that has also seen an alarming spate of inter-communal violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities, he also met Israeli-Arab leaders. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, like Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israelâs estimation, we have not yet reached that point. Former Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett has said it will be Israel, and not Hamas, that decides when the military operation is complete. Mr Bennett, who heads the right-wing party Yamina, told the BBC that all the casualties in the current conflict were down to Hamas's decision to start it. This video can not be played Naftali Bennett spoke to the BBC earlier on Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that destroying the Jala high-rise block in Gaza yesterday was justified. He's given an interview with US network CBS in which he maintained there was ""an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation housed in that building that plots and organises terror attacks against Israeli civilians, so it's a perfectly legitimate target"". The building housed crews from the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, who were given an hour to leave before it was destroyed in an air strike. Mr Netanyahu confirmed Israeli reports that US officials had been given information about the attack. The building's landlord has denied it has any connection with Hamas. The Associated Press has asked Israel to present evidence. News agency Agence France Presse said earlier that its media colleagues would be moving into its offices in Gaza. This is the moment the tower block was brought down in yesterday's air strike. This video can not be played Gaza tower containing media offices collapses after Israeli strike The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of war crimes In a statement to the UN Security Council, Palestinian Foreign Minister
Riyad Al-Maliki denounced Israeli âaggressionâ, detailing attacks that had
destroyed families in the Gaza Strip. ""Israel keeps telling you 'put yourself
in our shoes', but Israel is not wearing shoes, it is wearing military boots,"" he
said. He asked how many victims were enough for the Security Council to
condemn what was going on. âWhat is the threshold for outrage?â Israelâs UN ambassador Gilad Erdan also appealed to the Security Council to
understand the Israeli response: ""This is not the first time that Hamas has
fired at Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. But this time
it was different."" He said Hamas was seeking to seize power from the
Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas. ""There is never a justification for
terror,"" he said, accusing Hamas of inciting violence in Jerusalem. He was adamant that Israel was taking ""unparalleled steps"" to avoid civilian casualties. Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. If you are just joining us, here are today's key developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict: In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military operation against Hamas is ""continuing at full strength"", appearing to reject international attempts to arrange a ceasefire. ""Our campaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force. We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore
calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens. It will take time,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel wanted to exact a price from the ""aggressor"" and to restore deterrence. He was speaking after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet which went on for several hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More from the UN Security Council meeting currently taking place online. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the violence was a threat to the whole region. ""It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole,"" he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres In his opening remarks to the UN Security Council meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN was ""actively engaging all sides towards an immediate ceasefire"". He described the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Mr Guterres also called on all parties ""to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed"". UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, told the online meeting that casualties on both sides were mounting and that the situation in Gaza was ""more dire by the day"". The UN was working tirelessly with all sides to restore calm, he said. Mr Wennesland said Gaza militants should stop firing rockets from civilians areas and Israeli authorities had to abide by international law, maintaining maximum restraint to spare civilians. The Israeli cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beersheba have been hit by rocket fire from Gaza in the past hour. So far there have been no reports of major injuries but Israel's fire and rescue authority reports substantial damage to homes and cars, and to a synagogue in Ashkelon.  This is the scene of the synagogue, in a picture posted by Israel's fire and rescue services Earlier, Israel's military said more than 3,000 rockets had been fired from the Gaza Strip since the latest conflict began. Cars were hit in Ashdod and reports say a residential building under construction was also struck. This video was posted from the scene in Ashdod.  Allow Twitter content?

The UN Security Council is due to convene shortly to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The US - a long-time ally of Israel - blocked a meeting scheduled for Friday and has faced criticism for not doing enough to halt the violence. US President Joe Biden held phone calls on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. In his talks with Netanyahu he underscored Israel's right to defend itself. The US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, held talks earlier with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and was due to meet Palestinian officials too. Hundreds of people have been attending funerals in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel for victims of the latest violence. In Gaza City, funerals were held for members of the al-Kulak family who died in an Israeli air strike earlier today. Funeral prayers are performed for a member of the al-Kulak family In the West Bank village of Saida, near the city of Tulkarem, mourners carried the body of Yaseen Hamad who was killed during clashes with Israeli troops near his village. The streets of Saida were filled with mourners for Yaseen Hamad's funeral Crowds gathered in the West Bank city of Hebron for the funeral of teenager Muhammad Yunus Freijat, who was also killed during clashes with Israel security forces. Muhammad Yunus Freijat was killed during a protest in Hebron Meanwhile in Israel, the funeral took place for Gershon Franco, 55, who died on Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The rocket attack in Ramat Gan caused widespread damage Hamas and other Islamist militant groups in Gaza have a variety of weapons to deploy Israel says the past week has seen the highest ever rate of rocket attacks on its territory from Gaza. So just how much firepower does Hamas have there? Foreign affairs analyst Jonathan Marcus says estimating the militant group's stockpile of rockets is impossible, but it will include many thousands of projectiles of varying ranges. Some of the weaponry will have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula but the bulk of it is believed to be manufactured inside the Gaza Strip itself. You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago. In Israel, officials say 10 people, including two children, have been killed by militant attacks. Several more rocket attacks have taken place on southern towns and cities today, but there are no details of casualties. This video can not be played The fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza is taking a brutal toll on people's everyday lives. Here families on both sides of the border tell of their fear amid the daily bombardment. Israel has seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza, the military says. Major General Ori Gordin told reporters that since Monday, Hamas had fired about 3,000 rockets towards Israel. He said the rate of rocket launches surpassed previous attacks from Gaza and also from the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Â© 2025 BBC.

Second jabs to be given sooner amid variant concerns,"If the Indian Covid variant is significantly more transmissible, we could face hard choices about restrictions, Boris Johnson says Remaining second doses to over-50s and those who are vulnerable will be accelerated, the PM tells a Downing St briefing The variant will not affect the easing of restrictions due on Monday but could impact on changes planned in June, he adds The PM says there will be better information on the variant in a couple of weeks and we ""could still be on the right track"" England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty says there is no doubt UK cases of the Indian variant are up Glasgow and Moray will remain under current restrictions for at least another week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says The rest of mainland Scotland will see an easing of lockdown next week Wales will move to alert level two of restrictions on Monday, meaning more indoor hospitality can reopen British tourists will be allowed to enter Portugal from Monday, the Portuguese government confirms The UK records another 17 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Hazel Shearing Thanks for tuning into today's live updates, which were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans and Justin Parkinson. They were edited by James Clarke, Vanessa Barford and Hazel Shearing. It's been a busy day, with briefings from the prime minister and the first ministers of Scotland and Wales. All three addressed
measures to tackle rising cases of the Indian variant. Here's the latest from the UK:  And from the rest of the world: Missed this evening's briefing? Here's what you need to know:  You can readour full story here. Before Christmas, Graeme Carling didn't know anyone who had caught Covid. But within the space of less than an hour one evening in January, the virus changed his and his family's lives forever. The CEO of investment company United Capital hastold the BBChow he lost his mother and father to Covid within an hour. At the start of the year, his mother, Margaret, died three weeks after contracting coronavirus. As he left the hospice where she'd slipped away, he got a phone call about his father, Graeme senior. ""They said he was doing okay, the oxygen was working, he did need it but they would have liked to have seen more progress,"" he said. Margaret was 65 and her husband Graeme was 66. They were married for 47 years. By the time Graeme was driving home with his wife Leanne, he got another call. ""The doctor was in a distressed state because I had just spoken to her 15 minutes before and by the time she had gone back to the ward, my dad had passed also,"" he said. ""It was so surreal. I was in complete shock."" You can read Graeme's storyhere. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE) says is highly likely the variant that emerged in India is more transmissible than the Kent variant and that it is a ""realistic possibility that it is as much as 50% more transmissible"". It adds there are ""plausible biological reasons"" as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible. Boris Johnson is asked whether easing restrictions in England from next Monday might one day be seen as a ""big mistake"". The PM replies that the position is ""different"" because of better knowledge than before about Covid, and better testing. He adds that ""on balance"" it's right to proceed, given ""low numbers"" of infections but the government remains ""very alive"" to changes in the data. On foreign travel, people going abroad will be subject to appropriate tests, he says. He adds that he doubts the government's list of permitted destinations will be added to ""very rapidly"". Ministers ""take nothing off the table"" in doing what is necessary to keep people safe, Johnson says. That ends today's Downing Street press conference. Sam Coates from Sky says the fourth test for the next step of the lockdown to go ahead is that there can't be variants of concern changing the assessment. But he asks given cases of the Indian variant have almost tripled in the last week how can you say you've passed that test? Johnson says: ""We are concerned about this variant...and we do think it certainly may cause disruption to our attempts to continue down the roadmap but it doesn't change the assessment to step three."" ""If you look at the numbers, even in Bolton you're not seeing a significant increase in hospitalisations and the overall numbers across the country remain low so they're not changing the assessment at present."" Prof Whitty says we are broadly in the same territory with regards to the four tests. The thing that has changed is the ""very clear view"" that the Indian variant is more transmissible. ""We expect over time this variant will overtake and come to dominate in the UK in the way that the Kent variant did,"" he says. We need some time to gather the data but if it is a lot more transmissible that would imply we could have a really significant surge, Whitty says. We also do not know what impact the vaccines will have in practice, he says. Asked by Hugo Gye from the i newspaper about the impact of prioritising second doses in England, Prof Whitty says the move will not lead to a delay in younger people getting their first jabs. He says that is because the JCVI's recommendation is that most people under the age of 40 will be vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, ""whereas the revaccination programme is largely at this point"" with AstraZeneca vaccines. ""This should not lead to significant delays, we don't have that trade off,"" he says. He adds that there is still a desire to ""maintain a slightly longer gap"" of eight weeks between doses because there are ""some advantages to that"". The PM is asked how long any delay beyond 21 June restrictions could last. He replies that he can't speculate and there will be better information on the new variant in a couple of weeks. Boris Johnson also says it's possible we ""could still be on the right track"". Reality Check Boris Johnson has been asked about whether it was a mistake
not to close the border with India sooner. The government announced India would be added to the
travel ban red list on 19 April, but the restrictions did not come into force
until 23 April. Neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the red list
two weeks earlier. Figures
published yesterday showed that the number of cases of the new variant of
Covid-19 first identified in India, which has now been designated as a variant
of concern,had risen from 520 to 1,313 in the past week,external. TheWorld Health Organization said,externalthe India variant appeared to have a higher rate of
transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines
may be less effective against it. You can read more about why Indiawasnât added to the redlist sooner here. The PM is asked whether people planning to travel to visit family in areas where there have been spikes of the Indian variant should still go - and whether they should they stay overnight. ""I do think it's important that in respect to the areas where we are seeing these spikes... given the caution that I think we have to exercise with this new variant, the risk of extra transmissibility, I would urge people just to think twice about that,"" he says. He says he wants people in those areas to recognise that there is an extra risk and a ""threat of disruption to progress"" and asks them to ""exercise their discretion"". Josh from Corby asks when under 30s can expect to receive the Covid vaccine? Prof Chris Whitty says the vaccine is making a rapid and steady progression through the age ranges starting with the oldest people. This is because risk is very strongly correlated with age, he says. ""We've actually got to the point where 38 and 39s are having their jabs and this will steadily move down over the next weeks,"" he says. He says the goal is for everybody to have their first vaccine by the end of July. There is now an aim to accelerate to the point where people have their second vaccination after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks. This is because people who have a second vaccine will not only have greater protection against the original variant but also the new variant. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With overall cases and hospitalisations low, the
Conservative MPs in the Covid Recovery Group â who are concerned about the
economic effects of the lockdowns â will be hugely concerned that the prime minister is not committing himself to ""freedom day"" on 21 June in England. This
is when the roadmap envisaged social distancing measures being lifted. But if
the Indian variant is very much more transmissible, Boris Johnson has warned of
difficult choices ahead. Prof Chris Whitty says that, if vaccines lose some ""efficacy"", this tends to happen first with those who show mild symptoms rather than those likely to suffer most from the virus. That's why those in more vulnerable groups are being prioritised, he adds. There are ""very strong aims"" to increase jabs in areas affected by the new variant, Prof Whitty says. The PM says Colonel Russell Miller, commander army HQ north west, is being deployed to support local leaders in managing the response to the Indian variant on the ground. The response will include surge testing, mobile tesing units and the army will be on the streets handing out tests. There will be ""targeted new activity"" in Bolton and Blackburn to accelerate the vaccine take-up, including longer opening hours at vaccination sites. ""We are going to have to live with this new variant of the virus for some time,"" Johnson says. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson was under huge political pressure in
particular from his own side of the Commons not delay the further lifting of
restrictions on Monday. And the Conservative leader of Bolton council said imposing
local restrictions could be counter productive â creating an incentive to move
around and potentially spread the new variant further. But his policy now contrasts with the Scottish government
which isnât easing restrictions in Glasgow and Moray due to case rates, so opposition voices may soon urge greater caution in England too. The prime minister is also likely to be asked whether he
added India swiftly enough to the âred listâ which would have meant hotel
quarantine for all arrivals from there. On to media questions now. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh asks how likely it is that the final unlocking of restrictions in England will happen on 21 June. Boris Johnson says he can't say ""for certain"". Numbers of infections remain ""low"" across the country, he adds, and the situation is different from last year because of vaccines. People will have to ""wait and see"" whether the new variant is more transmissible and wait for more evidence that vaccines have cut risks of hospitalisations and deaths. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Mr Johnson says the government would ""implement further restrictions immediately"" as soon as it saw ""there was a risk of really serious increase of hospitalisations"" that could overwhelm the NHS. Chris Whitty says there is no doubt UK cases of the Indian variant are up, and that there's ""confidence"" it's ""more transmissible"" than existing strains. He adds that scientists are working to find out how much more transmissible it is. It's ""quite widely seeded"" in places other than Bolton, but there's not a greater increase in rates among over-60s than other age groups, Prof Whitty adds.  Professor Chris Whitty, England's Chief Medical Officer, says the number of people testing positive for Covid in the UK is going ""steadily"" downwards, as is the number of people in hospital. Deaths of people following a positive Covid test are also down, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Sunday's live coverage was brought to you by a team of journalists in London - Rebecca Seales, Paul Kirby and David Walker. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned anti-Semitism targeting British Jews, after a video emerged of a convoy of cars brandishing Palestinian flags in North London, with anti-Semitic abuse apparently being shouted through a megaphone. London's Metropolitan Police said they were aware of the video, which appeared to be filmed in the St John's Wood area, which is home to a Jewish community. Allow Twitter content?

Opposition Labour leaderKeir Starmer said the incident was ""utterly disgusting"",external, tweeting that there had to be consequences: ""Antisemitism, misogyny and hate have no place on our streets or in our society."" The Jewish community's Community Security Trust said it was fully aware of ""appalling anti-Semitic intimidation and incitement from [a] âpro-Palestinianâ car convoy from Bradford"". The Mayor of LondonSadiq Khan has said he is deeply concerned,externalby reports of ""hateful, intimidating and racist language used on marches and social media"". ""Behaviour that incites anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim hatred has no place in our city,"" he said. We have more details on this story here. Nine police officers were hurt during big pro-Palestinian protests in central London yesterday. Protesters called for the UK government to ""stop allowing Israel's brutal violence"" against the Palestinians. Police said the demonstrations had been largely peaceful but projectiles had been thrown in ""small pockets of disorder"". Air raids have reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza Israel's military says the destruction of homes in Gaza City which killed 42 Palestinians was caused by an attack on a Hamas tunnel system. Several homes were reduced to rubble following an air strike early on Sunday. Israel said it had attacked a militant tunnel system which collapsed, bringing residential buildings down with it. It said the deaths were unintentional. Ten children were among the victims. Rescue workers combed through the debris of the buildings on Sunday recovering bodies. ""These are moments of horror that no-one can describe. Like
an earthquake hit the area,"" said Mahmoud Hmaid, who was helping the efforts. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent in Jerusalem Is Israelâs military
operation in Gaza, dubbed âGuardian of the Wallsâ, nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Benjamin
Netanyahu says attacks are continuing with âfull forceâ and will âtake timeâ. In a news conference this
afternoon, Israelâs prime minister admitted there were âpressuresâ but thanked
US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Netanyahu has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire with Hamas Mr Bidenâs envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Unusually, at the end of a week that has also seen an alarming spate of inter-communal violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities, he also met Israeli-Arab leaders. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, like Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israelâs estimation, we have not yet reached that point. Former Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett has said it will be Israel, and not Hamas, that decides when the military operation is complete. Mr Bennett, who heads the right-wing party Yamina, told the BBC that all the casualties in the current conflict were down to Hamas's decision to start it. This video can not be played Naftali Bennett spoke to the BBC earlier on Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that destroying the Jala high-rise block in Gaza yesterday was justified. He's given an interview with US network CBS in which he maintained there was ""an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation housed in that building that plots and organises terror attacks against Israeli civilians, so it's a perfectly legitimate target"". The building housed crews from the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, who were given an hour to leave before it was destroyed in an air strike. Mr Netanyahu confirmed Israeli reports that US officials had been given information about the attack. The building's landlord has denied it has any connection with Hamas. The Associated Press has asked Israel to present evidence. News agency Agence France Presse said earlier that its media colleagues would be moving into its offices in Gaza. This is the moment the tower block was brought down in yesterday's air strike. This video can not be played Gaza tower containing media offices collapses after Israeli strike The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of war crimes In a statement to the UN Security Council, Palestinian Foreign Minister
Riyad Al-Maliki denounced Israeli âaggressionâ, detailing attacks that had
destroyed families in the Gaza Strip. ""Israel keeps telling you 'put yourself
in our shoes', but Israel is not wearing shoes, it is wearing military boots,"" he
said. He asked how many victims were enough for the Security Council to
condemn what was going on. âWhat is the threshold for outrage?â Israelâs UN ambassador Gilad Erdan also appealed to the Security Council to
understand the Israeli response: ""This is not the first time that Hamas has
fired at Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. But this time
it was different."" He said Hamas was seeking to seize power from the
Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas. ""There is never a justification for
terror,"" he said, accusing Hamas of inciting violence in Jerusalem. He was adamant that Israel was taking ""unparalleled steps"" to avoid civilian casualties. Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. If you are just joining us, here are today's key developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict: In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military operation against Hamas is ""continuing at full strength"", appearing to reject international attempts to arrange a ceasefire. ""Our campaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force. We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore
calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens. It will take time,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel wanted to exact a price from the ""aggressor"" and to restore deterrence. He was speaking after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet which went on for several hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More from the UN Security Council meeting currently taking place online. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the violence was a threat to the whole region. ""It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole,"" he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres In his opening remarks to the UN Security Council meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN was ""actively engaging all sides towards an immediate ceasefire"". He described the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Mr Guterres also called on all parties ""to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed"". UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, told the online meeting that casualties on both sides were mounting and that the situation in Gaza was ""more dire by the day"". The UN was working tirelessly with all sides to restore calm, he said. Mr Wennesland said Gaza militants should stop firing rockets from civilians areas and Israeli authorities had to abide by international law, maintaining maximum restraint to spare civilians. The Israeli cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beersheba have been hit by rocket fire from Gaza in the past hour. So far there have been no reports of major injuries but Israel's fire and rescue authority reports substantial damage to homes and cars, and to a synagogue in Ashkelon.  This is the scene of the synagogue, in a picture posted by Israel's fire and rescue services Earlier, Israel's military said more than 3,000 rockets had been fired from the Gaza Strip since the latest conflict began. Cars were hit in Ashdod and reports say a residential building under construction was also struck. This video was posted from the scene in Ashdod.  Allow Twitter content?

The UN Security Council is due to convene shortly to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The US - a long-time ally of Israel - blocked a meeting scheduled for Friday and has faced criticism for not doing enough to halt the violence. US President Joe Biden held phone calls on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. In his talks with Netanyahu he underscored Israel's right to defend itself. The US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, held talks earlier with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and was due to meet Palestinian officials too. Hundreds of people have been attending funerals in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel for victims of the latest violence. In Gaza City, funerals were held for members of the al-Kulak family who died in an Israeli air strike earlier today. Funeral prayers are performed for a member of the al-Kulak family In the West Bank village of Saida, near the city of Tulkarem, mourners carried the body of Yaseen Hamad who was killed during clashes with Israeli troops near his village. The streets of Saida were filled with mourners for Yaseen Hamad's funeral Crowds gathered in the West Bank city of Hebron for the funeral of teenager Muhammad Yunus Freijat, who was also killed during clashes with Israel security forces. Muhammad Yunus Freijat was killed during a protest in Hebron Meanwhile in Israel, the funeral took place for Gershon Franco, 55, who died on Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The rocket attack in Ramat Gan caused widespread damage Hamas and other Islamist militant groups in Gaza have a variety of weapons to deploy Israel says the past week has seen the highest ever rate of rocket attacks on its territory from Gaza. So just how much firepower does Hamas have there? Foreign affairs analyst Jonathan Marcus says estimating the militant group's stockpile of rockets is impossible, but it will include many thousands of projectiles of varying ranges. Some of the weaponry will have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula but the bulk of it is believed to be manufactured inside the Gaza Strip itself. You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago. In Israel, officials say 10 people, including two children, have been killed by militant attacks. Several more rocket attacks have taken place on southern towns and cities today, but there are no details of casualties. This video can not be played The fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza is taking a brutal toll on people's everyday lives. Here families on both sides of the border tell of their fear amid the daily bombardment. Israel has seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza, the military says. Major General Ori Gordin told reporters that since Monday, Hamas had fired about 3,000 rockets towards Israel. He said the rate of rocket launches surpassed previous attacks from Gaza and also from the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Â© 2025 BBC.

You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago. In Israel, officials say 10 people, including two children, have been killed by militant attacks. Several more rocket attacks have taken place on southern towns and cities today, but there are no details of casualties.

Here families on both sides of the border tell of their fear amid the daily bombardment. Israel has seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza, the military says. Major General Ori Gordin told reporters that since Monday, Hamas had fired about 3,000 rockets towards Israel. He said the rate of rocket launches surpassed previous attacks from Gaza and also from the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Â© 2025 BBC.

Edwin Poots is elected DUP leaderThe NI agriculture minister will succeed Arlene Foster as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played DUP: Edwin Poots elected new party leader Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots has been elected leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. He succeeds Arlene Foster, who steps down as party leaderon 28 May and will then leave her role as NI first minister at the end of June. Mr Poots beat MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to take the top post in the party. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. Mr Poots received 19 votes and Sir Jeffrey 17 votes. He has said that he would like to remain as agriculture minister andwould not take on the role of Northern Ireland first ministerif elected party leader. Edwin Poots: Who is the new leader of the DUP? From firebrands to government - who are the DUP? North Belfast MLA Paula Bradley has been elected as the party's new deputy leader, after incumbent Lord Dodds announcedhe would not bid for re-election. She beat MP Gregory Campbell by 18 votes to 16, and is the first woman elected to the post. Only three people have held the role of DUP leader since the party was established in 1971 - its founder the late Ian Paisley, followed by Peter Robinson and its current leader, Arlene Foster. Edwin Poots and his new party deputy, Paula Bradley A secret party ballot of party MPs and NI Assembly members was held on Friday. Mr Poots said it was an immense honour to be selected for the top post and he was looking forward to a ""positive relationship right across Northern Ireland with my party colleagues and indeed with people from other parties"". He said Northern Ireland people had shown ""remarkable resilience"". ""I stand here very proud to be taking up the mantle as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and that brings with it a responsibility to all of unionism,"" he said. ""I will be a leader in unionism who will be reaching out to other leaders in unionism. I want to see unionism working together."" He said the Northern Ireland Protocol, which places a border down the Irish Sea, has proven to be a ""massive challenge for us"". He said he wants to ensure that there is not the ""unionist bickering that we have had in the past"" and ""I will encourage all unionists to work with me"". Later, speaking to reporters outside Stormont, Mr Poots said he would speak to Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis on Friday night and meet him next week. The DUP leader-designate cancelled media interviews and did not take any questions. Paula Bradley MLA is the first woman elected to the DUP deputy leader post Mr Lewis, and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, separately tweeted their congratulations to Mr Poots and said they looked forward to working with him. Ahead of the party vote, in a message to MPs and Northern Ireland Assembly members, Mr Poots said that leading the DUP ""would be my greatest honour"". He said he had been ""tried and tested over many years in political office"" and had a plan to ""reinvigorate unionism"". Ms Bradley said she would serve the party to the best of her ability and give it ""her all"". She said she would support the leader, but would at times be a ""critical friend"". ""It's a great honour. I would never have thought just over a week ago that I would be standing in this position today,"" she said. There has been concern in the past that it looked like the DUP's Westminster grouping seemed to have too much power and too much sway. Clearly this is a signal that they want the power base shifted back to Stormont and that is what is going to happen from the end of the month. For Edwin Poots, this has been a lifelong ambition for him. He is steeped in the DUP. His father is a DUP founding member. He is also Free Presbyterian. He has talked about reform being one of his key policies and clearly that has won some of those undecided DUP politicians over, in terms of getting behind him. There has been a concern in recent years that some of the establishment and key central figures within DUP HQ held too much power. He obviously wants to oversee all of that and that has been what he's promised them. Clearly the pitch has paid off. The result of this also shows that there is still a split in the party. Some of those within Sir Jeffrey's camp are incredibly disappointed and very shocked by the result. They were quietly confident that they were going to edge it. Mr Poots became an MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) for the Lagan Valley constituency in 1998 and has also served on Lisburn City Council. He has served as Northern Ireland minister for the environment, minister for arts, culture and leisure and as health minister over the course of his political career. After the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in agreed to share power together and formed a government in 2007, Mr Poots was appointed as culture and arts minister in the executive. It would be the first of a number of ministerial briefs he has held during his political career. Edwin Poots smiles as he leaves DUP headquarters on Friday The DUP is a socially conservative party and Mr Poots's religiously-influenced views - including his belief that the earth is 6,000 years old - have also generated headlines in the past. Read morehere. A former police officer, canteen kitchen worker and social worker, Ms Bradley is arguably less known among the public than MP Gregory Campbell, who was also a contender for the deputy leader post. North Belfast MLA Paula Bradley is the party's new deputy leader She currently chairs Stormont's Communities Committee. Prior to being elected to Stormont, she had been a councillor on Newtownabbey council. Ms Bradley is one of the more socially liberal members of the party. Defeated leadership contender Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he has has no regrets about putting his name forward. ""They [party members] have made their choice and I respect that,"" he said. ""The party must now consider what that means for our way forward, what it means for the union that we cherish, and what it means for Northern Ireland."" MP Ian Paisley, who backed Mr Poots for leader, said he was ""personally delighted"" for him. ""We have been boyhood friends, and are very, very close, and I am personally delighted for him,"" Mr Paisley said. ""I am also delighted for Paula. She is an absolutely excellent candidate for deputy leadership, she made one of the best speeches I have ever heard in a selection meeting today."" He said the differences between the leadership candidates were ""subtle"". Defeated leadership and deputy leadership contenders Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gregory Campbell earlier on Friday ""It is important that people recognise that because the power base is at Stormont, and because most of the votes in the electoral college are based at Stormont, then clearly that is where the influence is going to be,"" he added. East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson declined to say which candidate he had voted for, but congratulated Mr Poots and Mrs Bradley. He described his election as ""very significant"" and said dealing with the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland and the Irish Sea border would be a ""massive issue"". ""Not only for unionists, but for people across the political spectrum. One of the big jobs Edwin has to do is to persuade the government that what they've done in signing the protocol is wrong and they've got to get it changed."" Arlene Foster will step down as DUP leader on 28 May Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month. BBC News NI understands that she will sever her ties with the DUP when she stands down as first minister. Sources close to her said she thinks it is no longer the party she joined.

Why was India not on red list sooner?,"Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs Parliament's Home Affairs Committee, has criticised the delay in putting India on the government's travel-ban ""red list"". ""They should have put India on the red list at the same time as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Since then, we've had this three-week period in which thousands of people have returned from India and that probably includes hundreds of the new variant Covid cases,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. India was added to the red list on 23 April, but neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh had been on it since 9 April. One of the variants of coronavirus first identified in India has spread to the UK. Just under half of these cases involve international travel and the strain has now been designated a ""variant of concern"". What is the India Covid variant? The red list is the government'slist of 43 countries,externalfrom which there are strict restrictions on travel to England. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all have similar rules in place with the same list of countries. The restrictions are designed to protect the UK from new variants, against which vaccines may be less effective and which may spread more easily. Which countries are on the red list? What are the Indian, Brazil, South Africa and UK variants? India red list add 'may be too late', Prof Mark Walport says Travel to England is banned for anyone who has been in one of the countries in the past 10 days, except for UK citizens and residents, who have to isolate on arrival at government-approved hotels. Direct flights are banned from most red list countries, but not Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya and India. The government says this is to allow critical freight and make it easier for British nationals to return home. The decision is based on Joint Biosecurity Centre risk assessments, which include: how good a country's testing structures are, including checking for variants how many cases those systems have identified whether people in that country have been catching new variants at home or the cases have come from overseas evidence of whether that country has exported cases of new variants to other countries, including to the UK how good the country's travel links with the UK are The first point is important, because the genome sequencing needed to identify new variants is very sophisticated and relatively rare. But just because a country has found variants of concern, or has many cases of coronavirus, it will not necessarily be on the red list. On 18 May,external, the World Health Organization identified: 106 countries where the variant identified in South Africa had been found, of which 28 are on the red list 61 countries with the variant identified in Brazil, of which 19 are on the red list 48 countries with the variant identified in India, of which 6 are on the red list. Bangladesh had the South Africa but not the Brazil variant and Pakistan had neither when they were added to the red list on 9 April. India had both, as well as a new variant, but was not added for another two weeks. On 9 April: Pakistan had a seven-day average of 21 cases per million people Bangladesh had twice as many India had four times as many Health Secretary Matt Hancock said these figures depended on how much testing was being done and said ""far more"" was carried out in India. He said the decision to add Pakistan and Bangladesh earlier was based on a higher proportion of people arriving in the UK from these countries, testing positive for coronavirus. ""When we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India,"" Mr Hancock told Parliament on 17 May. Figures from NHS Test and Trace,externaldo not support that claim. For the period 25 March to 7 April, the positivity rate from Bangladesh was 3.7%, from India was 5.1% and from Pakistan was 6.2%. Mr Hancock was asked about this in Parliament on 19 May and said: ""The positivity rate in India, on which the decision to put Pakistan but not India on the red list was 1.6% in India and 4.6% in Pakistan, which is three times higher, as I said."" But those are not published figures. He didn't give the date for them and didn't mention Bangladesh this time. Checking Matt Hancock's claim about Covid cases from India ""Nobody knows the full criteria - but there may be a political element because the UK wants a trade deal with India,"" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology, at the University of Reading, said. Boris Johnson had planned a trade visit to India but cancelled iton 19 April- days before the country was added to the red list. One of the variants first identified in India was designated as a variant of concern on 7 May. By 17 May, 2,323 cases of this variant had been found in the UK, of which 483 had been in Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen. The WHO said,externalit appeared to have a higher rate of transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines may be less effective against it. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cited fears of the India variant on 14 May as one of the reasons why Glasgow and Moray willnot have restrictions eased as planned. In the four weeks before India was added to the red list, 6,560 people were tested on arrival in England from India. Of those, 425 tested positive for coronavirus, which is about 6%. The Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. Just under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling, according toa 13 May briefing from Public Health England,external. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England. Almost 60% of positive Covid19 tests are now sent for genome sequencing to identify new variants, which means the government has a good idea of where the cases are. Asked about the delays in adding India to the red list, the UK's former chief scientific adviser Prof Mark Walport told the BBC: ""These decisions are almost inevitably taken a bit too late in truth.""

LiveLiveSecond jabs to be given sooner amid variant concerns3 minutes ago,"If the Indian Covid variant is significantly more transmissible, we could face hard choices about restrictions, Boris Johnson says Remaining second doses to over-50s and those who are vulnerable will be accelerated, the PM tells a Downing St briefing The variant will not affect the easing of restrictions due on Monday but could impact on changes planned in June, he adds The PM says there will be better information on the variant in a couple of weeks and we ""could still be on the right track"" England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty says there is no doubt UK cases of the Indian variant are up Glasgow and Moray will remain under current restrictions for at least another week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says The rest of mainland Scotland will see an easing of lockdown next week Wales will move to alert level two of restrictions on Monday, meaning more indoor hospitality can reopen British tourists will be allowed to enter Portugal from Monday, the Portuguese government confirms The UK records another 17 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Hazel Shearing Thanks for tuning into today's live updates, which were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans and Justin Parkinson. They were edited by James Clarke, Vanessa Barford and Hazel Shearing. It's been a busy day, with briefings from the prime minister and the first ministers of Scotland and Wales. All three addressed
measures to tackle rising cases of the Indian variant. Here's the latest from the UK:  And from the rest of the world: Missed this evening's briefing? Here's what you need to know:  You can readour full story here. Before Christmas, Graeme Carling didn't know anyone who had caught Covid. But within the space of less than an hour one evening in January, the virus changed his and his family's lives forever. The CEO of investment company United Capital hastold the BBChow he lost his mother and father to Covid within an hour. At the start of the year, his mother, Margaret, died three weeks after contracting coronavirus. As he left the hospice where she'd slipped away, he got a phone call about his father, Graeme senior. ""They said he was doing okay, the oxygen was working, he did need it but they would have liked to have seen more progress,"" he said. Margaret was 65 and her husband Graeme was 66. They were married for 47 years. By the time Graeme was driving home with his wife Leanne, he got another call. ""The doctor was in a distressed state because I had just spoken to her 15 minutes before and by the time she had gone back to the ward, my dad had passed also,"" he said. ""It was so surreal. I was in complete shock."" You can read Graeme's storyhere. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE) says is highly likely the variant that emerged in India is more transmissible than the Kent variant and that it is a ""realistic possibility that it is as much as 50% more transmissible"". It adds there are ""plausible biological reasons"" as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible. Boris Johnson is asked whether easing restrictions in England from next Monday might one day be seen as a ""big mistake"". The PM replies that the position is ""different"" because of better knowledge than before about Covid, and better testing. He adds that ""on balance"" it's right to proceed, given ""low numbers"" of infections but the government remains ""very alive"" to changes in the data. On foreign travel, people going abroad will be subject to appropriate tests, he says. He adds that he doubts the government's list of permitted destinations will be added to ""very rapidly"". Ministers ""take nothing off the table"" in doing what is necessary to keep people safe, Johnson says. That ends today's Downing Street press conference. Sam Coates from Sky says the fourth test for the next step of the lockdown to go ahead is that there can't be variants of concern changing the assessment. But he asks given cases of the Indian variant have almost tripled in the last week how can you say you've passed that test? Johnson says: ""We are concerned about this variant...and we do think it certainly may cause disruption to our attempts to continue down the roadmap but it doesn't change the assessment to step three."" ""If you look at the numbers, even in Bolton you're not seeing a significant increase in hospitalisations and the overall numbers across the country remain low so they're not changing the assessment at present."" Prof Whitty says we are broadly in the same territory with regards to the four tests. The thing that has changed is the ""very clear view"" that the Indian variant is more transmissible. ""We expect over time this variant will overtake and come to dominate in the UK in the way that the Kent variant did,"" he says. We need some time to gather the data but if it is a lot more transmissible that would imply we could have a really significant surge, Whitty says. We also do not know what impact the vaccines will have in practice, he says. Asked by Hugo Gye from the i newspaper about the impact of prioritising second doses in England, Prof Whitty says the move will not lead to a delay in younger people getting their first jabs. He says that is because the JCVI's recommendation is that most people under the age of 40 will be vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, ""whereas the revaccination programme is largely at this point"" with AstraZeneca vaccines. ""This should not lead to significant delays, we don't have that trade off,"" he says. He adds that there is still a desire to ""maintain a slightly longer gap"" of eight weeks between doses because there are ""some advantages to that"". The PM is asked how long any delay beyond 21 June restrictions could last. He replies that he can't speculate and there will be better information on the new variant in a couple of weeks. Boris Johnson also says it's possible we ""could still be on the right track"". Reality Check Boris Johnson has been asked about whether it was a mistake
not to close the border with India sooner. The government announced India would be added to the
travel ban red list on 19 April, but the restrictions did not come into force
until 23 April. Neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the red list
two weeks earlier. Figures
published yesterday showed that the number of cases of the new variant of
Covid-19 first identified in India, which has now been designated as a variant
of concern,had risen from 520 to 1,313 in the past week,external. TheWorld Health Organization said,externalthe India variant appeared to have a higher rate of
transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines
may be less effective against it. You can read more about why Indiawasnât added to the redlist sooner here. The PM is asked whether people planning to travel to visit family in areas where there have been spikes of the Indian variant should still go - and whether they should they stay overnight. ""I do think it's important that in respect to the areas where we are seeing these spikes... given the caution that I think we have to exercise with this new variant, the risk of extra transmissibility, I would urge people just to think twice about that,"" he says. He says he wants people in those areas to recognise that there is an extra risk and a ""threat of disruption to progress"" and asks them to ""exercise their discretion"". Josh from Corby asks when under 30s can expect to receive the Covid vaccine? Prof Chris Whitty says the vaccine is making a rapid and steady progression through the age ranges starting with the oldest people. This is because risk is very strongly correlated with age, he says. ""We've actually got to the point where 38 and 39s are having their jabs and this will steadily move down over the next weeks,"" he says. He says the goal is for everybody to have their first vaccine by the end of July. There is now an aim to accelerate to the point where people have their second vaccination after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks. This is because people who have a second vaccine will not only have greater protection against the original variant but also the new variant. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With overall cases and hospitalisations low, the
Conservative MPs in the Covid Recovery Group â who are concerned about the
economic effects of the lockdowns â will be hugely concerned that the prime minister is not committing himself to ""freedom day"" on 21 June in England. This
is when the roadmap envisaged social distancing measures being lifted. But if
the Indian variant is very much more transmissible, Boris Johnson has warned of
difficult choices ahead. Prof Chris Whitty says that, if vaccines lose some ""efficacy"", this tends to happen first with those who show mild symptoms rather than those likely to suffer most from the virus. That's why those in more vulnerable groups are being prioritised, he adds. There are ""very strong aims"" to increase jabs in areas affected by the new variant, Prof Whitty says. The PM says Colonel Russell Miller, commander army HQ north west, is being deployed to support local leaders in managing the response to the Indian variant on the ground. The response will include surge testing, mobile tesing units and the army will be on the streets handing out tests. There will be ""targeted new activity"" in Bolton and Blackburn to accelerate the vaccine take-up, including longer opening hours at vaccination sites. ""We are going to have to live with this new variant of the virus for some time,"" Johnson says. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson was under huge political pressure in
particular from his own side of the Commons not delay the further lifting of
restrictions on Monday. And the Conservative leader of Bolton council said imposing
local restrictions could be counter productive â creating an incentive to move
around and potentially spread the new variant further. But his policy now contrasts with the Scottish government
which isnât easing restrictions in Glasgow and Moray due to case rates, so opposition voices may soon urge greater caution in England too. The prime minister is also likely to be asked whether he
added India swiftly enough to the âred listâ which would have meant hotel
quarantine for all arrivals from there. On to media questions now. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh asks how likely it is that the final unlocking of restrictions in England will happen on 21 June. Boris Johnson says he can't say ""for certain"". Numbers of infections remain ""low"" across the country, he adds, and the situation is different from last year because of vaccines. People will have to ""wait and see"" whether the new variant is more transmissible and wait for more evidence that vaccines have cut risks of hospitalisations and deaths. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Mr Johnson says the government would ""implement further restrictions immediately"" as soon as it saw ""there was a risk of really serious increase of hospitalisations"" that could overwhelm the NHS. Chris Whitty says there is no doubt UK cases of the Indian variant are up, and that there's ""confidence"" it's ""more transmissible"" than existing strains. He adds that scientists are working to find out how much more transmissible it is. It's ""quite widely seeded"" in places other than Bolton, but there's not a greater increase in rates among over-60s than other age groups, Prof Whitty adds.  Professor Chris Whitty, England's Chief Medical Officer, says the number of people testing positive for Covid in the UK is going ""steadily"" downwards, as is the number of people in hospital. Deaths of people following a positive Covid test are also down, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Harry: I want to break cycle of pain for my family,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons The Duke of Sussex has said he wants to ""break the cycle"" of the ""pain and suffering"" of his upbringing with his own children. Prince Harry, who is expecting a daughter with wife Meghan and is already father to their son Archie, said he did not want to pass on pain from his own experience. But he said he did not think ""we should be pointing the finger"" at anybody. Buckingham Palace and Clarence House declined to comment on his remarks. During an appearance on the Armchair Expert podcast,external, Prince Harry compared his life to a mixture of the film The Truman Show, in which the main character unwittingly lives his life on a TV show, and being in a zoo. He said in being born into the Royal Family ""you inherit every element of it without choice"", including that the UK media ""feel an ownership over you"". Inside the media's 'invisible contract' with the royals Prince Harry told American actor and podcast co-host Dax Shepard: ""I don't think we should be pointing the finger or blaming anybody, but certainly when it comes to parenting, if I've experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I'm going to make sure I break that cycle so that I don't pass it on, basically. ""It's a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on,"" he said, adding that parents should be trying to stop that happening. He said: ""I started to piece it together and go 'okay, so this is where he went to school, this is what happened, I know this about his life, I also know that is connected to his parents so that means he's treated me the way he was treated, so how can I change that for my own kids?'"" The Prince of Wales ignored questions from a BBC reporter about his son's remarks, which were put to him as he arrived at a royal engagement in Cardiff earlier. The duke and duchess stepped down as senior royals in January 2020 The 36-year-old duke said he was in his early twenties when he thought: ""I don't want this job, I don't want to be here. I don't want to be doing this. Look what it did to my mum, how am I ever going to settle down and have a wife and family when I know that it's going to happen again? ""I've seen behind the curtain, I've seen the business model. I know how this operation runs and how it works, I don't want to be part of this."" In the wide-ranging 90-minute interview, the prince said his family's move to the US had not been part of the plan but he had to put his family and their mental health first. On his and Meghan's life in Los Angeles, California, he said: ""Living here now I can actually lift my head and I feel different, my shoulders have dropped, so have hers, you can walk around feeling a little bit more free, I can take Archie on the back of my bicycle, I would never have had the chance to do that."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said, for the palaces, Prince Harry's comments come ""firmly on the private side of the curtain"". ""That's not to say that they don't talk about it behind the curtain. It's been put to me by various people in different quarters that this is largely as a result of Meghan, that Harry is - or was - happier in his role before Meghan,"" he said. ""But Harry himself says in this podcast... that Meghan was part of the process of him understanding that there was a different way, and a different place for him to be. So he's pretty open about that."" During the episode, Prince Harry says he decided to go to therapy after a conversation with Meghan. ""Suddenly it was like the bubble was burst,"" he said. ""I plucked my head out of the sand, gave it a good shake off and I was like, 'Okay, you're in this position of privilege, stop complaining or stop thinking as though you want something different.

Portugal to allow UK tourists from MondayThe government in Lisbon says anyone arriving will need to take a negative PCR test before departure.Business,"British tourists will be allowed to enter Portugal from next Monday, the Portuguese authorities have announced. Portugal is on the UK's ""green"" list for unrestricted travel from then, but there had been confusion over whether the Portuguese would reciprocate. Coronavirus is still causing concern in Portugal and the country has extended its state of calamity to 30 May. The government in Lisbon said anyone arriving would need to take a negative PCR test before departure. The announcement was made by the Portuguese foreign ministry, which said tourism authorities had been ensuring that testing capacity in Portugal will meet the demand from tourists. ""With an air capacity from (at least) 21 airports in the United Kingdom into Portugal, reinforced due to the high demand from this market, the options are wide for the British tourists to visit Portugal from any point,"" the ministry said. ""People from the United Kingdom have visited Portugal and celebrated our culture, traditions, landmarks, history, and enjoyed our warm hospitality for decades. We look forward to welcome all travellers coming from the UK."" The rules for holidays in green list countries like Portugal The Portuguese announcement followed days of uncertainty and confusion over whether thousands of holidays booked by UK travellers from Monday would in fact go ahead. On Thursday, it looked as though many holidaymakers' hopes would be dashed when Portugal extended its Covid emergency measures. But to widespread relief, the Lisbon government has now given its approval to UK tourists. Authorities in the UK had already announced that travellers from England and Scotland  would not have to quarantine on their return from Portugal and other ""green list"" countries from 17 May. However, those countries have their own restrictions on who can visit. As an NHS worker, 32-year-old Rebecca Morgan, of Bow in east London, has gone beyond the call of duty during the pandemic. Instead of taking her annual leave over the past year, she has been doing extra shifts on Covid wards. But now she feels it really is time for a break - which is why she plans to fly to Faro in Portugal on 31 May for a week's holiday. ""I'm super-desperate to go away,"" she told the BBC. ""I've not had a proper week off for a year and a half. I'm really looking forward to having a good lie down on the beach."" Rebecca is expecting to pay Â£400 for the three required PCR tests and would have preferred the option to isolate at home. ""The cost of the tests will probably cost more than the holiday,"" she says. ""I'm tested twice a week for work, had Covid back in January and I've had both vaccines now, so I'm not expecting to get Covid at this stage."" At present, Portugal allows flights to and from the UK, but only for essential travel, such as for business, study, family reasons, health or humanitarian reasons. Those travel restrictions will be lifted only from 17 May. Tui has 44 flights due to depart for Portugal between 17 and 30 May. These include 28 to the Algarve, a popular destination for UK summer holidays. Other firms, including EasyJet, have been offering holidays and flights to green list countries, but online travel firm On The Beachhas stopped selling all holidays for this summerbecause of Covid uncertainty. EasyJet said: ""We welcome the decision from the Portuguese government meaning that those travelling from the UK will be allowed to travel safely to Portugal from Monday. ""We look forward to reuniting friends and family and taking customers on a long-awaited holiday this summer."" The Abta travel association said it was ""fantastic"" that tourists could return to Portugal. ""UK tourism is a really important part of the Portuguese economy, contributing half a billion pounds a year in normal times,"" an Abta spokesperson said. At the same time,Greece has launched its tourist season, lifting most remaining restrictions on movement and declaring ""we are putting the lockdown behind us"". Although an average of 2,000 daily Covid cases are still being reported, vaccinations are being rolled out with the Greek islands as a priority. How are travel rules being relaxed?

Counting of votes begins in DUP leadership contestNI Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson are bidding to succeed Arlene Foster.Northern Ireland,"In the running for party leader - Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots Counting of votes has now started to elect the next leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Northern Ireland's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson are bidding to succeed Arlene Foster. She steps down as DUP leaderon 28 May and will then leave her role as NI first minister at the end of June. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. Only three people have held the role of DUP leader since the party was established in 1971 - its founder the late Ian Paisley, followed by Peter Robinson and its current leader, Arlene Foster. A secret party ballot of party MPs and NI Assembly members was held on Friday. The announcement on the next leader is expected at about 17:00 BST, the party has said. Who are the DUP leadership contenders? From firebrands to government - who are the DUP? The city at the centre of the unionist universe A new deputy leader will also be elected after incumbent Lord Dodds announcedhe would not bid for re-election. Mr Poots became an MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) for the Lagan Valley constituency in 1998 and has also served on Lisburn City Council. Edwin Poots talks to MP Ian Paisley outside DUP headquarters on Friday He has served as Northern Ireland minister for the environment, minister for arts, culture and leisure and as health minister over the course of his political career. He has said he would like to remain as agriculture minister andwould not take on the role of Northern Ireland first ministerif elected party leader. In a message to MPs and Northern Ireland Assembly members, Mr Poots said that leading the DUP ""would be my greatest honour"". He said he had been ""tried and tested over many years in political office"" and had a plan to ""reinvigorate unionism"". Leaving DUP headquarters on Friday afternoon, he said it was a ""good day for democracy"". MP Ian Paisley, who is backing Mr Poots, said it was a ""really good day"" for the DUP. ""This is a democratic decision. At last, the elected members are deciding who their leader is,"" he said. ""That's a very, very important decision."" Mr Poots is facing stiff competition for the leadership from Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has been the MP for Lagan Valley since 1997. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gregory Campbell leaving DUP headquarters on Friday At that time he was an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) member but was one of several politicians who defected to the DUP in 2004 after a dispute over the 1998 Good Friday Agreement peace deal. On Thursday, Sir Jeffrey told DUP assembly members and MPs that he will contest the next assembly election and serve as first minister if elected. ""If elected leader, I will not be leading remotely from Westminster. I will be on the ground and intend to fight the next assembly election so that I can be based here,"" he said. ""I would take on the role of first minister as I believe that our people not only want a leader of unionism, they want a leader for Northern Ireland."" On Friday outside DUP headquarters, Sir Jeffrey said he was ""feeling good"", when questioned by waiting reporters. MP Jim Shannon, who is backing Sir Jeffrey, said the latter had ""statesman-like qualities"". ""I feel that Jeffrey has the qualities that take him beyond Northern Ireland and across the mainland and maybe further afield,"" he said. ""I think those are statesman-like qualities which the party needs."" Both Mr Poots and Sir Jeffrey not only represent the constituency of Lagan Valley, but also work out of the same office building. There werethree candidates in the running to be deputy leader- East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell and MLAs Paul Frew, of North Antrim, and Paula Bradley, of North Belfast. However, it is understood Mr Frew, who is also Mr Poots' campaign manager, pulled out of the race on Friday. It is not clear who he is supporting. After casting her vote, outgoing leader Mrs Foster said she voted for the person who ""would bring the Democratic Unionist Party forward"". ""And I think that's very obvious,"" she added. MP Gregory Campbell (left) and MLA Paula Bradley (right) are running for the DUP deputy leader post. MLA Paul Frew (centre) pulled out of the race on Friday Only DUP members elected to the House of Commons and the Northern Ireland Assembly get to vote in a leadership election, according to party rules. There are 28 MLAs - including Mrs Foster - and eight MPs, who make up the electoral college. In order to become party leader, the winning candidate must secure the support of at least 19 of the party's MLAs and MPs. Each leadership candidate spoke to party members with a vote for 10 minutes on Friday morning, and each deputy leader contender spoke for five minutes. All you need to know about the DUP contest The city at the centre of the unionist universe From firebrands to government - who are the DUP? The DUP headquarters is an unassuming building, bar the trail of MPs and MLAs making their way inside. It looks to most, like a meeting hall. Edwin Poots smiles as he leaves DUP headquarters on Friday The leadership contenders arrive early to avoid the media, ahead of making their final pitch to the electoral college, virtually due to Covid guidelines. Media stationed outside are unsure which door the politicians are going to enter at, with several entrances it's become a bit of a guessing game. People passing by the building, though, seem unfazed by the unprecedented election taking place within its walls. MPs and MLAs began arriving in a staggered fashion to cast their ballot - crucially in secret, with only 36 eligible voters. Gavin Robinson - in Team Sir Jeffrey - was the first to leave after voting, but when asked about it, he merely gave a thumbs up. Both men have been campaigning right up to the last minute with videos and messages being sent to all party members who are eligible to vote in the leadership election. Sir Jeffrey wrote to DUP MLAs and MPs on Thursday night, presenting them with the results of a poll conducted on behalf of his campaign, which appeared to suggest he would have a broader electoral appeal than his competitor. The results were released internally within the DUP, but BBC News NI political correspondent Stephen Walker obtained a copy and reported the results onThe Viewon Thursday night. When asked who was the best choice for DUP leader, 75% of respondents who indicated a preference favoured Sir Jeffrey for the role. Mr Poots' team highlighted the size of the survey sample - 500 people -  and pointed out that there was no clarity on who took part in the poll or the political background of the respondents. They also said that in their view, the real poll on Sir Jeffrey's electoral appeal was theMP's performance in the last general election, when the DUP's overall majority in Lagan Valley fell from 19,000 to 6,000 and the party lost 16% of the vote share. Mr Poots meanwhile, also sent party members an eve of poll letter, highlighting his ministerial experience at Stormont. He also sent a video to the DUP's electoral college, in which he talked about joining the party when he was 16 and said his greatest passion was working for the people of Northern Ireland Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month.

Glasgow and Moray to stay under level 3 Covid rulesFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon made the announcement as cases continued to increase in Glasgow.ScotlandBreaking|Breaking newsEdwin Poots elected DUP leaderNorthern Ireland Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots elected leader of the Democratic Unionist PartyNorthern Ireland,"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow and Moray 'need more time in level 3' Glasgow and Moray will remain under level three Covid restrictions for at least another week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. She said the ""difficult"" decision in Glasgow followed a rise in cases. Ms Sturgeon said the situation in the city was causing even more concern than Moray, which had already been warned it was likely to stay in level three. The decision means nearly 730,000 people in Glasgow and Moray will not move down to level two. Ms Sturgeon said initial research suggested that the outbreak centred in the south side of Glasgow was being driven by the Indian variant of the virus. Moray outbreak 'showing signs of improvement' Fans at Scottish Cup final 'at risk' What Covid rules are changing, and when? What level will you be in from 17 May? The first minister added that people were being asked not to travel in or out of Glasgow and Moray for the coming week, unless the journey was for permitted purposes. The rest of mainland Scotland will drop down to level two from Monday, and most islands will be placed in level one. Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is inevitable that as we continue to navigate our way through this pandemic, we will hit bumps in the road. ""However, if we exercise suitable caution as we're seeking to do today, then even though that is difficult, we are much more likely to stay on the right track overall."" The seven-day rate of cases per 100,000 population in Glasgow is 80.4, while in Moray it has fallen to 68.9. The rates are above 50 cases per 100,000, a key benchmark for deciding the appropriate tier of restrictions. The latest Public Health Scotland data shows that on 11 May, the rates per 100,000 population were also above that level in East Renfrewshire (52.3), Midlothian (50.8) and Clackmannanshire (50.4). The Glasgow cases are concentrated mainly in the south of the city, with one district, Pollokshields West, seeing 47 positive cases over the previous seven days, giving a local case rate of 1,008 per 100,000 population. The move to level two Covid restrictions on Monday in the rest of mainland Scotland will allow people to hug and visit other households indoors. Pubs and restaurants can also sell alcohol indoors. Ms Sturgeon said the Indian variant of the virus had been detected in Glasgow, which caused increased concern among public health advisers and the government. ""We do not yet have a full understanding of the impact of this variant, including on the protection afforded by the vaccines,"" she said. ""I do want to stress that nothing at this stage suggests it is causing more severe illness. ""However, it is thought that this variant could be significantly more transmissible than even the Kent variant that was identified before Christmas - and that alone calls for an appropriate degree of caution."" She added that public health teams were ""optimistic that enhanced testing and vaccination will be capable of getting this situation under control"". Ms Sturgeon also said there were ""grounds for cautious optimism that the situation is improving"" in Moray. However, the number of cases is still more than double the Scottish average. The first minister said it was ""prudent"" to keep the area in level three for another week ""so we can be more confident that the situation is firmly under control"". The deputy director of public health at NHS Grampian, Chris Littlejohn, said: ""The current restrictions and interventions appear to be working. ""This is not the moment to lower our guard - but we hope we can see the end of the current outbreak not too far ahead if we stick with it."" NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is encouraging all people in the hotspot areas to visit a Covid testing centre. It said it was ""actively pursuing"" ways to ensure vaccination uptake was as high as possible. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce's chief executive, Stuart Patrick, said the decision was ""deeply disappointing"" and that many businesses would have been ""caught up in developments outside their control"". Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Scotland, said local businesses and customers in Glasgow and Moray would be ""crushed"". ""The damage of this change, especially in Glasgow, is exacerbated by the lateness of this announcement,"" he said. ""It means wasted stock, disappointed customers and increased debt."" Stephen Montgomery of the Scottish Hospitality Group said: ""We're in exactly the situation we wanted to avoid. Staff are getting ready for their shifts or have been working flat out to prepare for opening. ""You can't just turn this stuff on and off like flicking a light switch."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: ""This decision will come as a disappointment to many, but I fully understand and appreciate the need for this action. ""If the right action is taken now, we can get Glasgow and Moray back on track and into level two as soon as safely possible."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Breaking|Breaking newsEdwin Poots elected DUP leaderNorthern Ireland Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots elected leader of the Democratic Unionist PartyNorthern Ireland,"This video can not be played DUP: Edwin Poots elected new party leader Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots has been elected leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. He succeeds Arlene Foster, who steps down as party leaderon 28 May and will then leave her role as NI first minister at the end of June. Mr Poots beat MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to take the top post in the party. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. Mr Poots received 19 votes and Sir Jeffrey 17 votes. He has said that he would like to remain as agriculture minister andwould not take on the role of Northern Ireland first ministerif elected party leader. Edwin Poots: Who is the new leader of the DUP? From firebrands to government - who are the DUP? North Belfast MLA Paula Bradley has been elected as the party's new deputy leader, after incumbent Lord Dodds announcedhe would not bid for re-election. She beat MP Gregory Campbell by 18 votes to 16, and is the first woman elected to the post. Only three people have held the role of DUP leader since the party was established in 1971 - its founder the late Ian Paisley, followed by Peter Robinson and its current leader, Arlene Foster. Edwin Poots and his new party deputy, Paula Bradley A secret party ballot of party MPs and NI Assembly members was held on Friday. Mr Poots said it was an immense honour to be selected for the top post and he was looking forward to a ""positive relationship right across Northern Ireland with my party colleagues and indeed with people from other parties"". He said Northern Ireland people had shown ""remarkable resilience"". ""I stand here very proud to be taking up the mantle as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and that brings with it a responsibility to all of unionism,"" he said. ""I will be a leader in unionism who will be reaching out to other leaders in unionism. I want to see unionism working together."" He said the Northern Ireland Protocol, which places a border down the Irish Sea, has proven to be a ""massive challenge for us"". He said he wants to ensure that there is not the ""unionist bickering that we have had in the past"" and ""I will encourage all unionists to work with me"". Later, speaking to reporters outside Stormont, Mr Poots said he would speak to Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis on Friday night and meet him next week. The DUP leader-designate cancelled media interviews and did not take any questions. Paula Bradley MLA is the first woman elected to the DUP deputy leader post Mr Lewis, and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, separately tweeted their congratulations to Mr Poots and said they looked forward to working with him. Ahead of the party vote, in a message to MPs and Northern Ireland Assembly members, Mr Poots said that leading the DUP ""would be my greatest honour"". He said he had been ""tried and tested over many years in political office"" and had a plan to ""reinvigorate unionism"". Ms Bradley said she would serve the party to the best of her ability and give it ""her all"". She said she would support the leader, but would at times be a ""critical friend"". ""It's a great honour. I would never have thought just over a week ago that I would be standing in this position today,"" she said. There has been concern in the past that it looked like the DUP's Westminster grouping seemed to have too much power and too much sway. Clearly this is a signal that they want the power base shifted back to Stormont and that is what is going to happen from the end of the month. For Edwin Poots, this has been a lifelong ambition for him. He is steeped in the DUP. His father is a DUP founding member. He is also Free Presbyterian. He has talked about reform being one of his key policies and clearly that has won some of those undecided DUP politicians over, in terms of getting behind him. There has been a concern in recent years that some of the establishment and key central figures within DUP HQ held too much power. He obviously wants to oversee all of that and that has been what he's promised them. Clearly the pitch has paid off. The result of this also shows that there is still a split in the party. Some of those within Sir Jeffrey's camp are incredibly disappointed and very shocked by the result. They were quietly confident that they were going to edge it. Mr Poots became an MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) for the Lagan Valley constituency in 1998 and has also served on Lisburn City Council. He has served as Northern Ireland minister for the environment, minister for arts, culture and leisure and as health minister over the course of his political career. After the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in agreed to share power together and formed a government in 2007, Mr Poots was appointed as culture and arts minister in the executive. It would be the first of a number of ministerial briefs he has held during his political career. Edwin Poots smiles as he leaves DUP headquarters on Friday The DUP is a socially conservative party and Mr Poots's religiously-influenced views - including his belief that the earth is 6,000 years old - have also generated headlines in the past. Read morehere. A former police officer, canteen kitchen worker and social worker, Ms Bradley is arguably less known among the public than MP Gregory Campbell, who was also a contender for the deputy leader post. North Belfast MLA Paula Bradley is the party's new deputy leader She currently chairs Stormont's Communities Committee. Prior to being elected to Stormont, she had been a councillor on Newtownabbey council. Ms Bradley is one of the more socially liberal members of the party. Defeated leadership contender Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he has has no regrets about putting his name forward. ""They [party members] have made their choice and I respect that,"" he said. ""The party must now consider what that means for our way forward, what it means for the union that we cherish, and what it means for Northern Ireland."" MP Ian Paisley, who backed Mr Poots for leader, said he was ""personally delighted"" for him. ""We have been boyhood friends, and are very, very close, and I am personally delighted for him,"" Mr Paisley said. ""I am also delighted for Paula. She is an absolutely excellent candidate for deputy leadership, she made one of the best speeches I have ever heard in a selection meeting today."" He said the differences between the leadership candidates were ""subtle"". Defeated leadership and deputy leadership contenders Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gregory Campbell earlier on Friday ""It is important that people recognise that because the power base is at Stormont, and because most of the votes in the electoral college are based at Stormont, then clearly that is where the influence is going to be,"" he added. East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson declined to say which candidate he had voted for, but congratulated Mr Poots and Mrs Bradley. He described his election as ""very significant"" and said dealing with the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland and the Irish Sea border would be a ""massive issue"". ""Not only for unionists, but for people across the political spectrum. One of the big jobs Edwin has to do is to persuade the government that what they've done in signing the protocol is wrong and they've got to get it changed."" Arlene Foster will step down as DUP leader on 28 May Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month.

Portugal to allow UK tourists from MondayThe government in Lisbon says anyone arriving will need to take a negative PCR test before departure.,"British tourists will be allowed to enter Portugal from next Monday, the Portuguese authorities have announced.

On Thursday, it looked as though many holidaymakers' hopes would be dashed when Portugal extended its Covid emergency measures. But to widespread relief, the Lisbon government has now given its approval to UK tourists. Authorities in the UK had already announced that travellers from England and Scotland  would not have to quarantine on their return from Portugal and other ""green list"" countries from 17 May. However, those countries have their own restrictions on who can visit. As an NHS worker, 32-year-old Rebecca Morgan, of Bow in east London, has gone beyond the call of duty during the pandemic. Instead of taking her annual leave over the past year, she has been doing extra shifts on Covid wards. But now she feels it really is time for a break - which is why she plans to fly to Faro in Portugal on 31 May for a week's holiday. ""I'm super-desperate to go away,"" she told the BBC. ""I've not had a proper week off for a year and a half. I'm really looking forward to having a good lie down on the beach."" Rebecca is expecting to pay Â£400 for the three required PCR tests and would have preferred the option to isolate at home. ""The cost of the tests will probably cost more than the holiday,"" she says. ""I'm tested twice a week for work, had Covid back in January and I've had both vaccines now, so I'm not expecting to get Covid at this stage."" At present, Portugal allows flights to and from the UK, but only for essential travel, such as for business, study, family reasons, health or humanitarian reasons. Those travel restrictions will be lifted only from 17 May. Tui has 44 flights due to depart for Portugal between 17 and 30 May. These include 28 to the Algarve, a popular destination for UK summer holidays. Other firms, including EasyJet, have been offering holidays and flights to green list countries, but online travel firm On The Beachhas stopped selling all holidays for this summerbecause of Covid uncertainty. EasyJet said: ""We welcome the decision from the Portuguese government meaning that those travelling from the UK will be allowed to travel safely to Portugal from Monday. ""We look forward to reuniting friends and family and taking customers on a long-awaited holiday this summer."" The Abta travel association said it was ""fantastic"" that tourists could return to Portugal. ""UK tourism is a really important part of the Portuguese economy, contributing half a billion pounds a year in normal times,"" an Abta spokesperson said. At the same time,Greece has launched its tourist season, lifting most remaining restrictions on movement and declaring ""we are putting the lockdown behind us"".

LiveLiveIsrael hits Gaza targets in heaviest bombardmentLess than a minute ago,"Israelâs prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says its military operation against Hamas will continue ""with full force"" despite international calls for a ceasefire The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says 188 Palestinians have died since Monday, and Israel has reported 10 dead Sunday marks the seventh day of elevated Israeli-Palestinian violence, the worst since 2014 More rockets have been fired from Gaza towards southern Israel. Israel says the concentration of rocket fire in the past week has been the highest ever The UN Security Council is holding an emergency meeting to discuss the hostilities UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged all parties to end the ""utterly appalling"" violence Israel says air strikes targeted the home of Hamas's leader in Gaza overnight Edited by Rebecca Seales We're now pausing our live coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict - many thanks for staying with us. To recap, here are the key developments from the past 24 hours:  You can still get all the latest updates on this fast-moving storyon the BBC News website. Sunday's live coverage was brought to you by a team of journalists in London - Rebecca Seales, Paul Kirby and David Walker. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned anti-Semitism targeting British Jews, after a video emerged of a convoy of cars brandishing Palestinian flags in North London, with anti-Semitic abuse apparently being shouted through a megaphone. London's Metropolitan Police said they were aware of the video, which appeared to be filmed in the St John's Wood area, which is home to a Jewish community. Allow Twitter content?

Opposition Labour leaderKeir Starmer said the incident was ""utterly disgusting"",external, tweeting that there had to be consequences: ""Antisemitism, misogyny and hate have no place on our streets or in our society."" The Jewish community's Community Security Trust said it was fully aware of ""appalling anti-Semitic intimidation and incitement from [a] âpro-Palestinianâ car convoy from Bradford"". The Mayor of LondonSadiq Khan has said he is deeply concerned,externalby reports of ""hateful, intimidating and racist language used on marches and social media"". ""Behaviour that incites anti-Jewish or anti-Muslim hatred has no place in our city,"" he said. We have more details on this story here. Nine police officers were hurt during big pro-Palestinian protests in central London yesterday. Protesters called for the UK government to ""stop allowing Israel's brutal violence"" against the Palestinians. Police said the demonstrations had been largely peaceful but projectiles had been thrown in ""small pockets of disorder"". Air raids have reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza Israel's military says the destruction of homes in Gaza City which killed 42 Palestinians was caused by an attack on a Hamas tunnel system. Several homes were reduced to rubble following an air strike early on Sunday. Israel said it had attacked a militant tunnel system which collapsed, bringing residential buildings down with it. It said the deaths were unintentional. Ten children were among the victims. Rescue workers combed through the debris of the buildings on Sunday recovering bodies. ""These are moments of horror that no-one can describe. Like
an earthquake hit the area,"" said Mahmoud Hmaid, who was helping the efforts. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent in Jerusalem Is Israelâs military
operation in Gaza, dubbed âGuardian of the Wallsâ, nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Benjamin
Netanyahu says attacks are continuing with âfull forceâ and will âtake timeâ. In a news conference this
afternoon, Israelâs prime minister admitted there were âpressuresâ but thanked
US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Netanyahu has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire with Hamas Mr Bidenâs envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Unusually, at the end of a week that has also seen an alarming spate of inter-communal violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities, he also met Israeli-Arab leaders. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, like Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israelâs estimation, we have not yet reached that point. Former Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett has said it will be Israel, and not Hamas, that decides when the military operation is complete. Mr Bennett, who heads the right-wing party Yamina, told the BBC that all the casualties in the current conflict were down to Hamas's decision to start it. This video can not be played Naftali Bennett spoke to the BBC earlier on Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that destroying the Jala high-rise block in Gaza yesterday was justified. He's given an interview with US network CBS in which he maintained there was ""an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation housed in that building that plots and organises terror attacks against Israeli civilians, so it's a perfectly legitimate target"". The building housed crews from the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, who were given an hour to leave before it was destroyed in an air strike. Mr Netanyahu confirmed Israeli reports that US officials had been given information about the attack. The building's landlord has denied it has any connection with Hamas. The Associated Press has asked Israel to present evidence. News agency Agence France Presse said earlier that its media colleagues would be moving into its offices in Gaza. This is the moment the tower block was brought down in yesterday's air strike. This video can not be played Gaza tower containing media offices collapses after Israeli strike The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of war crimes In a statement to the UN Security Council, Palestinian Foreign Minister
Riyad Al-Maliki denounced Israeli âaggressionâ, detailing attacks that had
destroyed families in the Gaza Strip. ""Israel keeps telling you 'put yourself
in our shoes', but Israel is not wearing shoes, it is wearing military boots,"" he
said. He asked how many victims were enough for the Security Council to
condemn what was going on. âWhat is the threshold for outrage?â Israelâs UN ambassador Gilad Erdan also appealed to the Security Council to
understand the Israeli response: ""This is not the first time that Hamas has
fired at Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. But this time
it was different."" He said Hamas was seeking to seize power from the
Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas. ""There is never a justification for
terror,"" he said, accusing Hamas of inciting violence in Jerusalem. He was adamant that Israel was taking ""unparalleled steps"" to avoid civilian casualties. Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. If you are just joining us, here are today's key developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict: In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military operation against Hamas is ""continuing at full strength"", appearing to reject international attempts to arrange a ceasefire. ""Our campaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force. We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore
calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens. It will take time,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel wanted to exact a price from the ""aggressor"" and to restore deterrence. He was speaking after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet which went on for several hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More from the UN Security Council meeting currently taking place online. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said that the violence was a threat to the whole region. ""It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole,"" he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres In his opening remarks to the UN Security Council meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN was ""actively engaging all sides towards an immediate ceasefire"". He described the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Mr Guterres also called on all parties ""to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed"". UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, told the online meeting that casualties on both sides were mounting and that the situation in Gaza was ""more dire by the day"". The UN was working tirelessly with all sides to restore calm, he said. Mr Wennesland said Gaza militants should stop firing rockets from civilians areas and Israeli authorities had to abide by international law, maintaining maximum restraint to spare civilians. The Israeli cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beersheba have been hit by rocket fire from Gaza in the past hour. So far there have been no reports of major injuries but Israel's fire and rescue authority reports substantial damage to homes and cars, and to a synagogue in Ashkelon.  This is the scene of the synagogue, in a picture posted by Israel's fire and rescue services Earlier, Israel's military said more than 3,000 rockets had been fired from the Gaza Strip since the latest conflict began. Cars were hit in Ashdod and reports say a residential building under construction was also struck. This video was posted from the scene in Ashdod.  Allow Twitter content?

The UN Security Council is due to convene shortly to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The US - a long-time ally of Israel - blocked a meeting scheduled for Friday and has faced criticism for not doing enough to halt the violence. US President Joe Biden held phone calls on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. In his talks with Netanyahu he underscored Israel's right to defend itself. The US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, held talks earlier with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and was due to meet Palestinian officials too. Hundreds of people have been attending funerals in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel for victims of the latest violence. In Gaza City, funerals were held for members of the al-Kulak family who died in an Israeli air strike earlier today. Funeral prayers are performed for a member of the al-Kulak family In the West Bank village of Saida, near the city of Tulkarem, mourners carried the body of Yaseen Hamad who was killed during clashes with Israeli troops near his village. The streets of Saida were filled with mourners for Yaseen Hamad's funeral Crowds gathered in the West Bank city of Hebron for the funeral of teenager Muhammad Yunus Freijat, who was also killed during clashes with Israel security forces. Muhammad Yunus Freijat was killed during a protest in Hebron Meanwhile in Israel, the funeral took place for Gershon Franco, 55, who died on Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The rocket attack in Ramat Gan caused widespread damage Hamas and other Islamist militant groups in Gaza have a variety of weapons to deploy Israel says the past week has seen the highest ever rate of rocket attacks on its territory from Gaza. So just how much firepower does Hamas have there? Foreign affairs analyst Jonathan Marcus says estimating the militant group's stockpile of rockets is impossible, but it will include many thousands of projectiles of varying ranges. Some of the weaponry will have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula but the bulk of it is believed to be manufactured inside the Gaza Strip itself. You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago. In Israel, officials say 10 people, including two children, have been killed by militant attacks. Several more rocket attacks have taken place on southern towns and cities today, but there are no details of casualties. This video can not be played The fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza is taking a brutal toll on people's everyday lives. Here families on both sides of the border tell of their fear amid the daily bombardment. Israel has seen the highest ever concentration of rocket attacks on its territory during the latest conflict with Hamas in Gaza, the military says. Major General Ori Gordin told reporters that since Monday, Hamas had fired about 3,000 rockets towards Israel. He said the rate of rocket launches surpassed previous attacks from Gaza and also from the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Â© 2025 BBC.

Breaking|Breaking newsGlasgow and Moray to stay under level 3 Covid rulesFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon made the announcement as cases continued to increase in the areas.Scotland,"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Glasgow and Moray 'need more time in level 3' Glasgow and Moray will remain under level three Covid restrictions for at least another week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. She said the ""difficult"" decision in Glasgow followed a rise in cases. Ms Sturgeon said the situation in the city was causing even more concern than Moray, which had already been warned it was likely to stay in level three. The decision means nearly 730,000 people in Glasgow and Moray will not move down to level two. Ms Sturgeon said initial research suggested that the outbreak centred in the south side of Glasgow was being driven by the Indian variant of the virus. Moray outbreak 'showing signs of improvement' Fans at Scottish Cup final 'at risk' What Covid rules are changing, and when? What level will you be in from 17 May? The first minister added that people were being asked not to travel in or out of Glasgow and Moray for the coming week, unless the journey was for permitted purposes. The rest of mainland Scotland will drop down to level two from Monday, and most islands will be placed in level one. Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is inevitable that as we continue to navigate our way through this pandemic, we will hit bumps in the road. ""However, if we exercise suitable caution as we're seeking to do today, then even though that is difficult, we are much more likely to stay on the right track overall."" The seven-day rate of cases per 100,000 population in Glasgow is 80.4, while in Moray it has fallen to 68.9. The rates are above 50 cases per 100,000, a key benchmark for deciding the appropriate tier of restrictions. The latest Public Health Scotland data shows that on 11 May, the rates per 100,000 population were also above that level in East Renfrewshire (52.3), Midlothian (50.8) and Clackmannanshire (50.4). The Glasgow cases are concentrated mainly in the south of the city, with one district, Pollokshields West, seeing 47 positive cases over the previous seven days, giving a local case rate of 1,008 per 100,000 population. The move to level two Covid restrictions on Monday in the rest of mainland Scotland will allow people to hug and visit other households indoors. Pubs and restaurants can also sell alcohol indoors. Ms Sturgeon said the Indian variant of the virus had been detected in Glasgow, which caused increased concern among public health advisers and the government. ""We do not yet have a full understanding of the impact of this variant, including on the protection afforded by the vaccines,"" she said. ""I do want to stress that nothing at this stage suggests it is causing more severe illness. ""However, it is thought that this variant could be significantly more transmissible than even the Kent variant that was identified before Christmas - and that alone calls for an appropriate degree of caution."" She added that public health teams were ""optimistic that enhanced testing and vaccination will be capable of getting this situation under control"". Ms Sturgeon also said there were ""grounds for cautious optimism that the situation is improving"" in Moray. However, the number of cases is still more than double the Scottish average. The first minister said it was ""prudent"" to keep the area in level three for another week ""so we can be more confident that the situation is firmly under control"". The deputy director of public health at NHS Grampian, Chris Littlejohn, said: ""The current restrictions and interventions appear to be working. ""This is not the moment to lower our guard - but we hope we can see the end of the current outbreak not too far ahead if we stick with it."" NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is encouraging all people in the hotspot areas to visit a Covid testing centre. It said it was ""actively pursuing"" ways to ensure vaccination uptake was as high as possible. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce's chief executive, Stuart Patrick, said the decision was ""deeply disappointing"" and that many businesses would have been ""caught up in developments outside their control"". Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Scotland, said local businesses and customers in Glasgow and Moray would be ""crushed"". ""The damage of this change, especially in Glasgow, is exacerbated by the lateness of this announcement,"" he said. ""It means wasted stock, disappointed customers and increased debt."" Stephen Montgomery of the Scottish Hospitality Group said: ""We're in exactly the situation we wanted to avoid. Staff are getting ready for their shifts or have been working flat out to prepare for opening. ""You can't just turn this stuff on and off like flicking a light switch."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: ""This decision will come as a disappointment to many, but I fully understand and appreciate the need for this action. ""If the right action is taken now, we can get Glasgow and Moray back on track and into level two as soon as safely possible."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Counting of votes begins in DUP leadership contest,"In the running for party leader - Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots Counting of votes has now started to elect the next leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Northern Ireland's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson are bidding to succeed Arlene Foster. She steps down as DUP leaderon 28 May and will then leave her role as NI first minister at the end of June. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. Only three people have held the role of DUP leader since the party was established in 1971 - its founder the late Ian Paisley, followed by Peter Robinson and its current leader, Arlene Foster. A secret party ballot of party MPs and NI Assembly members was held on Friday. The announcement on the next leader is expected at about 17:00 BST, the party has said. Who are the DUP leadership contenders? From firebrands to government - who are the DUP? The city at the centre of the unionist universe A new deputy leader will also be elected after incumbent Lord Dodds announcedhe would not bid for re-election. Mr Poots became an MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) for the Lagan Valley constituency in 1998 and has also served on Lisburn City Council. Edwin Poots talks to MP Ian Paisley outside DUP headquarters on Friday He has served as Northern Ireland minister for the environment, minister for arts, culture and leisure and as health minister over the course of his political career. He has said he would like to remain as agriculture minister andwould not take on the role of Northern Ireland first ministerif elected party leader. In a message to MPs and Northern Ireland Assembly members, Mr Poots said that leading the DUP ""would be my greatest honour"". He said he had been ""tried and tested over many years in political office"" and had a plan to ""reinvigorate unionism"". Leaving DUP headquarters on Friday afternoon, he said it was a ""good day for democracy"". MP Ian Paisley, who is backing Mr Poots, said it was a ""really good day"" for the DUP. ""This is a democratic decision. At last, the elected members are deciding who their leader is,"" he said. ""That's a very, very important decision."" Mr Poots is facing stiff competition for the leadership from Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has been the MP for Lagan Valley since 1997. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gregory Campbell leaving DUP headquarters on Friday At that time he was an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) member but was one of several politicians who defected to the DUP in 2004 after a dispute over the 1998 Good Friday Agreement peace deal. On Thursday, Sir Jeffrey told DUP assembly members and MPs that he will contest the next assembly election and serve as first minister if elected. ""If elected leader, I will not be leading remotely from Westminster. I will be on the ground and intend to fight the next assembly election so that I can be based here,"" he said. ""I would take on the role of first minister as I believe that our people not only want a leader of unionism, they want a leader for Northern Ireland."" On Friday outside DUP headquarters, Sir Jeffrey said he was ""feeling good"", when questioned by waiting reporters. MP Jim Shannon, who is backing Sir Jeffrey, said the latter had ""statesman-like qualities"". ""I feel that Jeffrey has the qualities that take him beyond Northern Ireland and across the mainland and maybe further afield,"" he said. ""I think those are statesman-like qualities which the party needs."" Both Mr Poots and Sir Jeffrey not only represent the constituency of Lagan Valley, but also work out of the same office building. There werethree candidates in the running to be deputy leader- East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell and MLAs Paul Frew, of North Antrim, and Paula Bradley, of North Belfast. However, it is understood Mr Frew, who is also Mr Poots' campaign manager, pulled out of the race on Friday. It is not clear who he is supporting. After casting her vote, outgoing leader Mrs Foster said she voted for the person who ""would bring the Democratic Unionist Party forward"". ""And I think that's very obvious,"" she added. MP Gregory Campbell (left) and MLA Paula Bradley (right) are running for the DUP deputy leader post. MLA Paul Frew (centre) pulled out of the race on Friday Only DUP members elected to the House of Commons and the Northern Ireland Assembly get to vote in a leadership election, according to party rules. There are 28 MLAs - including Mrs Foster - and eight MPs, who make up the electoral college. In order to become party leader, the winning candidate must secure the support of at least 19 of the party's MLAs and MPs. Each leadership candidate spoke to party members with a vote for 10 minutes on Friday morning, and each deputy leader contender spoke for five minutes. All you need to know about the DUP contest The city at the centre of the unionist universe From firebrands to government - who are the DUP? The DUP headquarters is an unassuming building, bar the trail of MPs and MLAs making their way inside. It looks to most, like a meeting hall. Edwin Poots smiles as he leaves DUP headquarters on Friday The leadership contenders arrive early to avoid the media, ahead of making their final pitch to the electoral college, virtually due to Covid guidelines. Media stationed outside are unsure which door the politicians are going to enter at, with several entrances it's become a bit of a guessing game. People passing by the building, though, seem unfazed by the unprecedented election taking place within its walls. MPs and MLAs began arriving in a staggered fashion to cast their ballot - crucially in secret, with only 36 eligible voters. Gavin Robinson - in Team Sir Jeffrey - was the first to leave after voting, but when asked about it, he merely gave a thumbs up. Both men have been campaigning right up to the last minute with videos and messages being sent to all party members who are eligible to vote in the leadership election. Sir Jeffrey wrote to DUP MLAs and MPs on Thursday night, presenting them with the results of a poll conducted on behalf of his campaign, which appeared to suggest he would have a broader electoral appeal than his competitor. The results were released internally within the DUP, but BBC News NI political correspondent Stephen Walker obtained a copy and reported the results onThe Viewon Thursday night. When asked who was the best choice for DUP leader, 75% of respondents who indicated a preference favoured Sir Jeffrey for the role. Mr Poots' team highlighted the size of the survey sample - 500 people -  and pointed out that there was no clarity on who took part in the poll or the political background of the respondents. They also said that in their view, the real poll on Sir Jeffrey's electoral appeal was theMP's performance in the last general election, when the DUP's overall majority in Lagan Valley fell from 19,000 to 6,000 and the party lost 16% of the vote share. Mr Poots meanwhile, also sent party members an eve of poll letter, highlighting his ministerial experience at Stormont. He also sent a video to the DUP's electoral college, in which he talked about joining the party when he was 16 and said his greatest passion was working for the people of Northern Ireland Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month. Arlene Foster will step down as DUP leader on 28 May BBC News NI understands that she will sever her ties with the DUP when she stands down as first minister. Sources close to her said she thinks it is no longer the party she joined. Who are the DUP leadership contenders?

Gupta empire facing UK fraud probe over Greensill,"Sanjeev Gupta, head of GFG Alliance The business empire of Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The probe is over suspected fraudulent trading and money laundering, including its financing arrangements with failed company Greensill Capital UK. Greensill, a major lender to Mr Gupta's business, collapsed in March. GFG Alliance, Mr Gupta's family conglomerate, said it would co-operate fully with the investigation. ""As these matters are the subject of an SFO investigation we cannot make any further comment,"" a GFG spokesperson added. GFG Alliance employs 35,000 people at companies stretching from Wales to Australia. Its Liberty Steel arm in the UK has about 3,000 staff. The company's reliance on Greensill caused many to worry that it might itself be at risk following the finance firm's demise. GFG is in talks with finance firms about providing emergency loans. A request for a Â£170m from the UK government was rejected. On Thursday, former prime minister David Cameron, who worked for Greensill and lobbied the government on its behalf,appeared before MPs to answer questions about his role. The announcement of a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the workings of Sanjeev Gupta's metals-based empire has serious consequences, before any evidence is even heard. First, the BBC understands that the Department for Business feels vindicated that it did not agree to give the so-called ""saviour of steel"" a requested government bailout of Â£170m. Second, and perhaps more importantly, it sets back Mr Gupta's attempts to raise new finance to replace the money it once received from the now defunct Greensill. The government has promised to save the steel plants - owned by Gupta's GFG alliance that are now in dire financial straits - but this investigation makes the chance of it surviving in its current form an increasingly remote possibility. The news comes a day after former prime minister and former Greensill employee, David Cameron, defended his role in lobbying the government to grant Greensill access to a government-backed Covid loan programme. In its statement, GFG said it ""continues to serve its customers around the world and is making progress in the refinancing of its operations which are benefitting from the operational improvements it has made and the very strong steel, aluminium and iron ore markets"". Greensill's business model - called supply chain finance - worked by placing itself between customers and suppliers. It would immediately pay the invoices that suppliers gave to their customers, meaning those suppliers would not have to wait possibly for months for payment. The Financial Times has claimed that one of Mr Gupta's companies had sent Greensill invoices for business it had supposedly done with four European metal companies. But those European companies told the newspaper they had not dealt with GFG. However, GFG said the invoices were for products it expected to perhaps sell in the future and that the financial arrangement was common for many of Greensill's clients. During Mr Cameron's appearance before the Treasury Committee on Thursday, he acknowledged that GFG had a very close relationship with Greensill, and said it was ""disturbing"" to read the reports about the invoices. Mr Gupta was once hailed as the saviour of British steel when his company bought a struggling steel mill in South Wales, saving it from likely closure. Liberty Steel then went on to snap up several ailing UK plants and turn them around. GFG now operates in 30 countries, and has revenues of about Â£20bn.

Turkish Grand Prix has been cancelledThe Turkish Grand Prix is cancelled just two weeks after it was put on the Formula 1 calendar and replaced by a second race in Austria.,"Austria's Red Bull Ring hosted the first two races of last season The Turkish Grand Prix has been cancelled just two weeks after it was put on the Formula 1 calendar and replaced by a second race in Austria. Turkey was added to the F1 schedule on 11-13 June toreplace the Canadian Grand Prix,which was cancelled because of travel restrictions in Canada. But Turkey has now become unworkable after being put on the UK's travel red list of high-risk countries. Instead, the Styrian Grand Prix will run at the Red Bull Ring on 25-27 June. That date was originally scheduled for the French Grand Prix, which has now been moved a week earlier to 18-20 June. The move means there will now be races on three consecutive weekends - the French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard, followed by the Styrian Grand Prix and then the Austrian Grand Prix, both at the same track. Listen to the Chequered Flag podcast Hamilton wants new Mercedes contract this summer F1 president Stefano Domenicali said: ""We were all looking forward to racing in Turkey but the travel restrictions in place have meant we are not able to be there in June. ""F1 has shown again that it is able to react quickly to developments and find solutions and we are delighted that we will have a double header in Austria, meaning our season remains at 23 races."" F1 has a series of protocols aimed at minimising the risk of spreading Covid-19 and says it has conducted 17,000 tests this year with only 15 positive cases, a rate of 0.1%. It says it will ""continue to operate in a way that protects the safety of our personnel and the communities we visit"". A number of F1 insiders had hoped that the sport's owners, Liberty Media, would not replace Turkey with another event. Teams are already finding the combination of a record 23-race planned schedule and the restrictions on movement imposed on personnel when they return to the UK exhausting. Some senior figures believe that there is no need to keep the number of races so high, when the sport has never had a season this long before. But F1 feels that it makes sense to maintain the number of races that had been planned in the first half of the year because they have concerns about the viability of a number of late-season races. For different reasons, there are uncertainties over the Singapore, Japanese, US, Mexican, Brazilian and Australian Grands Prix. Those races currently comprise the sport's entire schedule for October and November. There are financial implications involving both sponsors and broadcasters that would hit F1's finances - and the prize money paid to teams next year - if the number of races falls too far. Brazil and Mexico are a concern because the scale of the pandemic in those countries means F1 may feel it cannot justify going there. Doubts over Singapore, Japan, the US and Australia are more to do with travel restrictions imposed on foreign visitors by those countries.

They were edited by James Clarke, Vanessa Barford and Hazel Shearing. It's been a busy day, with briefings from the prime minister and the first ministers of Scotland and Wales. All three addressed
measures to tackle rising cases of the Indian variant. Here's the latest from the UK:  And from the rest of the world: Missed this evening's briefing? Here's what you need to know:  You can readour full story here. Before Christmas, Graeme Carling didn't know anyone who had caught Covid. But within the space of less than an hour one evening in January, the virus changed his and his family's lives forever. The CEO of investment company United Capital hastold the BBChow he lost his mother and father to Covid within an hour. At the start of the year, his mother, Margaret, died three weeks after contracting coronavirus. As he left the hospice where she'd slipped away, he got a phone call about his father, Graeme senior. ""They said he was doing okay, the oxygen was working, he did need it but they would have liked to have seen more progress,"" he said. Margaret was 65 and her husband Graeme was 66. They were married for 47 years. By the time Graeme was driving home with his wife Leanne, he got another call. ""The doctor was in a distressed state because I had just spoken to her 15 minutes before and by the time she had gone back to the ward, my dad had passed also,"" he said. ""It was so surreal. I was in complete shock."" You can read Graeme's storyhere. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE) says is highly likely the variant that emerged in India is more transmissible than the Kent variant and that it is a ""realistic possibility that it is as much as 50% more transmissible"". It adds there are ""plausible biological reasons"" as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible. Boris Johnson is asked whether easing restrictions in England from next Monday might one day be seen as a ""big mistake"". The PM replies that the position is ""different"" because of better knowledge than before about Covid, and better testing. He adds that ""on balance"" it's right to proceed, given ""low numbers"" of infections but the government remains ""very alive"" to changes in the data. On foreign travel, people going abroad will be subject to appropriate tests, he says. He adds that he doubts the government's list of permitted destinations will be added to ""very rapidly"". Ministers ""take nothing off the table"" in doing what is necessary to keep people safe, Johnson says. That ends today's Downing Street press conference. Sam Coates from Sky says the fourth test for the next step of the lockdown to go ahead is that there can't be variants of concern changing the assessment. But he asks given cases of the Indian variant have almost tripled in the last week how can you say you've passed that test? Johnson says: ""We are concerned about this variant...and we do think it certainly may cause disruption to our attempts to continue down the roadmap but it doesn't change the assessment to step three."" ""If you look at the numbers, even in Bolton you're not seeing a significant increase in hospitalisations and the overall numbers across the country remain low so they're not changing the assessment at present."" Prof Whitty says we are broadly in the same territory with regards to the four tests. The thing that has changed is the ""very clear view"" that the Indian variant is more transmissible. ""We expect over time this variant will overtake and come to dominate in the UK in the way that the Kent variant did,"" he says. We need some time to gather the data but if it is a lot more transmissible that would imply we could have a really significant surge, Whitty says. We also do not know what impact the vaccines will have in practice, he says. Asked by Hugo Gye from the i newspaper about the impact of prioritising second doses in England, Prof Whitty says the move will not lead to a delay in younger people getting their first jabs. He says that is because the JCVI's recommendation is that most people under the age of 40 will be vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, ""whereas the revaccination programme is largely at this point"" with AstraZeneca vaccines. ""This should not lead to significant delays, we don't have that trade off,"" he says. He adds that there is still a desire to ""maintain a slightly longer gap"" of eight weeks between doses because there are ""some advantages to that"". The PM is asked how long any delay beyond 21 June restrictions could last. He replies that he can't speculate and there will be better information on the new variant in a couple of weeks. Boris Johnson also says it's possible we ""could still be on the right track"". Reality Check Boris Johnson has been asked about whether it was a mistake
not to close the border with India sooner. The government announced India would be added to the
travel ban red list on 19 April, but the restrictions did not come into force
until 23 April. Neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the red list
two weeks earlier. Figures
published yesterday showed that the number of cases of the new variant of
Covid-19 first identified in India, which has now been designated as a variant
of concern,had risen from 520 to 1,313 in the past week,external. TheWorld Health Organization said,externalthe India variant appeared to have a higher rate of
transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines
may be less effective against it. You can read more about why Indiawasnât added to the redlist sooner here. The PM is asked whether people planning to travel to visit family in areas where there have been spikes of the Indian variant should still go - and whether they should they stay overnight. ""I do think it's important that in respect to the areas where we are seeing these spikes... given the caution that I think we have to exercise with this new variant, the risk of extra transmissibility, I would urge people just to think twice about that,"" he says. He says he wants people in those areas to recognise that there is an extra risk and a ""threat of disruption to progress"" and asks them to ""exercise their discretion"". Josh from Corby asks when under 30s can expect to receive the Covid vaccine? Prof Chris Whitty says the vaccine is making a rapid and steady progression through the age ranges starting with the oldest people. This is because risk is very strongly correlated with age, he says. ""We've actually got to the point where 38 and 39s are having their jabs and this will steadily move down over the next weeks,"" he says. He says the goal is for everybody to have their first vaccine by the end of July. There is now an aim to accelerate to the point where people have their second vaccination after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks. This is because people who have a second vaccine will not only have greater protection against the original variant but also the new variant. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With overall cases and hospitalisations low, the
Conservative MPs in the Covid Recovery Group â who are concerned about the
economic effects of the lockdowns â will be hugely concerned that the prime minister is not committing himself to ""freedom day"" on 21 June in England. This
is when the roadmap envisaged social distancing measures being lifted. But if
the Indian variant is very much more transmissible, Boris Johnson has warned of
difficult choices ahead. Prof Chris Whitty says that, if vaccines lose some ""efficacy"", this tends to happen first with those who show mild symptoms rather than those likely to suffer most from the virus. That's why those in more vulnerable groups are being prioritised, he adds. There are ""very strong aims"" to increase jabs in areas affected by the new variant, Prof Whitty says. The PM says Colonel Russell Miller, commander army HQ north west, is being deployed to support local leaders in managing the response to the Indian variant on the ground. The response will include surge testing, mobile tesing units and the army will be on the streets handing out tests. There will be ""targeted new activity"" in Bolton and Blackburn to accelerate the vaccine take-up, including longer opening hours at vaccination sites. ""We are going to have to live with this new variant of the virus for some time,"" Johnson says. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson was under huge political pressure in
particular from his own side of the Commons not delay the further lifting of
restrictions on Monday. And the Conservative leader of Bolton council said imposing
local restrictions could be counter productive â creating an incentive to move
around and potentially spread the new variant further. But his policy now contrasts with the Scottish government
which isnât easing restrictions in Glasgow and Moray due to case rates, so opposition voices may soon urge greater caution in England too. The prime minister is also likely to be asked whether he
added India swiftly enough to the âred listâ which would have meant hotel
quarantine for all arrivals from there. On to media questions now. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh asks how likely it is that the final unlocking of restrictions in England will happen on 21 June. Boris Johnson says he can't say ""for certain"". Numbers of infections remain ""low"" across the country, he adds, and the situation is different from last year because of vaccines. People will have to ""wait and see"" whether the new variant is more transmissible and wait for more evidence that vaccines have cut risks of hospitalisations and deaths. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Mr Johnson says the government would ""implement further restrictions immediately"" as soon as it saw ""there was a risk of really serious increase of hospitalisations"" that could overwhelm the NHS. Chris Whitty says there is no doubt UK cases of the Indian variant are up, and that there's ""confidence"" it's ""more transmissible"" than existing strains. He adds that scientists are working to find out how much more transmissible it is. It's ""quite widely seeded"" in places other than Bolton, but there's not a greater increase in rates among over-60s than other age groups, Prof Whitty adds.  Professor Chris Whitty, England's Chief Medical Officer, says the number of people testing positive for Covid in the UK is going ""steadily"" downwards, as is the number of people in hospital. Deaths of people following a positive Covid test are also down, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Young people 'coming in droves' for first jabMore than a third of people under 30 in Wales have had a Covid-19 jab.WalesComments,"Greta Sion from Cardiff was thrilled to get her first vaccine before going back to university for a postgraduate degree Almost half of young adults have received a first coronavirus vaccine in some Welsh health board areas. In north Wales, 44% of people aged 18-29 have been given a first dose, while in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan 46% have been vaccinated. An average of 36.6% of people under 30 in Wales have had the jab as the roll-out moves at different speeds across Welsh health boards. One vaccine centre manager said young people were ""coming in their droves"". The Welsh government has committed to offering every adult a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine by the end of July, after succeeding in offering all people in priority groups one to nine a first dose by the middle of April. People under 30 have been offered the Pfizer jab as an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine,after a link with rare blood clots was identified. Thatwas extended to people under 40 last week. How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Young people to be reinfected with Covid for study Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? While vaccine centres have dealt with a greater number of people failing to attend appointments compared with the initial roll-out to more vulnerable groups, one vaccine manager said the data showed a ""promising"" commitment to being vaccinated among younger age groups. ""We have seen a really good uptake,"" said Tom Halpin, who manages the Deeside Rainbow Vaccination Centre at a leisure centre in Queensferry, Flintshire. ""It is really promising to see all the young people coming through the doors. We run seven days a week, so the fact that lots of them are taking time out of working days to come and receive their vaccine is really promising."" The Deeside centre is in the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board area which covers the whole of north Wales. Their latest update this week showed that 44% of people aged 18-29 had received a first dose of the Covid vaccine. Other health board areas are also nearing half their young adult population, including the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area where 46% of 18 to 29-year-olds have had the vaccine. Mr Halpin said the vaccine uptake was part of a desire to ""get back to normal"" among younger age groups. ""There was definitely a huge sense of relief in the early days when we were on the higher priority groups, everybody was really relieved to receive their vaccine,"" he said. ""Now, I think people want to get back to normal, and the younger group are coming in their droves to help enable that to happen."" Greta Sion had her first vaccine last week. She was called for a jab after signing up to a reserve list in case of spare doses. ""I queued for a while but it was such an easy process. Within half an hour, I was done. I was vaccinated,"" said the 23-year-old currently working in Cardiff. While she had seen stories about possible side effects, Ms Sion, who plans to study a postgraduate degree at Oxford University, said the benefits of getting the vaccine outweighed any risks. ""I didn't really question it,"" she said. ""I just thought, up until now, it has been such a success. I think that this is the way out of it, or at least the way towards a little bit more normality."" ""I am hoping to do a postgraduate degree in September so it means I will be able to meet my fellow students, we will be able to socialise,"" said Ms Sion. ""It is what we have wanted for a year so hopefully this will just open so many doors, and we can see the restrictions being eased a bit more now."" Her friends are sharing selfies from vaccine centres and they are ""excited"" to get it. ""From my experience, I know all my friends have been quite excited to get it. ""We are asking each other 'Have you been vaccinated?' - we have all been very willing, and we want it. ""To know that this means that we and those around us are going to be safer - there is no doubt, we have been very willing and excited to get it.""

Harry: I want to break cycle of pain for my familyThe Duke of Sussex compares his life to a mixture of the film the Truman Show and being in a zoo.UK,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons The Duke of Sussex has said he wants to ""break the cycle"" of the ""pain and suffering"" of his upbringing with his own children. Prince Harry, who is expecting a daughter with wife Meghan and is already father to their son Archie, said he did not want to pass on pain from his own experience. But he said he did not think ""we should be pointing the finger"" at anybody. Buckingham Palace and Clarence House declined to comment on his remarks. During an appearance on the Armchair Expert podcast,external, Prince Harry compared his life to a mixture of the film The Truman Show, in which the main character unwittingly lives his life on a TV show, and being in a zoo. He said in being born into the Royal Family ""you inherit every element of it without choice"", including that the UK media ""feel an ownership over you"". Inside the media's 'invisible contract' with the royals Prince Harry told American actor and podcast co-host Dax Shepard: ""I don't think we should be pointing the finger or blaming anybody, but certainly when it comes to parenting, if I've experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I'm going to make sure I break that cycle so that I don't pass it on, basically. ""It's a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on,"" he said, adding that parents should be trying to stop that happening. He said: ""I started to piece it together and go 'okay, so this is where he went to school, this is what happened, I know this about his life, I also know that is connected to his parents so that means he's treated me the way he was treated, so how can I change that for my own kids?'"" The Prince of Wales ignored questions from a BBC reporter about his son's remarks, which were put to him as he arrived at a royal engagement in Cardiff earlier. The duke and duchess stepped down as senior royals in January 2020 The 36-year-old duke said he was in his early twenties when he thought: ""I don't want this job, I don't want to be here.

On his and Meghan's life in Los Angeles, California, he said: ""Living here now I can actually lift my head and I feel different, my shoulders have dropped, so have hers, you can walk around feeling a little bit more free, I can take Archie on the back of my bicycle, I would never have had the chance to do that."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said, for the palaces, Prince Harry's comments come ""firmly on the private side of the curtain"". ""That's not to say that they don't talk about it behind the curtain. It's been put to me by various people in different quarters that this is largely as a result of Meghan, that Harry is - or was - happier in his role before Meghan,"" he said. ""But Harry himself says in this podcast... that Meghan was part of the process of him understanding that there was a different way, and a different place for him to be. So he's pretty open about that."" During the episode, Prince Harry says he decided to go to therapy after a conversation with Meghan. ""Suddenly it was like the bubble was burst,"" he said. ""I plucked my head out of the sand, gave it a good shake off and I was like, 'Okay, you're in this position of privilege, stop complaining or stop thinking as though you want something different.

DUP is voting to elect new leader and deputy leader,"In the running for party leader - Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Edwin Poots Counting of votes has now started to elect the next leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Northern Ireland's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson are bidding to succeed Arlene Foster. She steps down as DUP leaderon 28 May and will then leave her role as NI first minister at the end of June. It is the first time in the party's 50-year history that a leadership contest has taken place. Only three people have held the role of DUP leader since the party was established in 1971 - its founder the late Ian Paisley, followed by Peter Robinson and its current leader, Arlene Foster. A secret party ballot of party MPs and NI Assembly members was held on Friday. The announcement on the next leader is expected at about 17:00 BST, the party has said. Who are the DUP leadership contenders? From firebrands to government - who are the DUP? The city at the centre of the unionist universe A new deputy leader will also be elected after incumbent Lord Dodds announcedhe would not bid for re-election. Mr Poots became an MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) for the Lagan Valley constituency in 1998 and has also served on Lisburn City Council. Edwin Poots talks to MP Ian Paisley outside DUP headquarters on Friday He has served as Northern Ireland minister for the environment, minister for arts, culture and leisure and as health minister over the course of his political career. He has said he would like to remain as agriculture minister andwould not take on the role of Northern Ireland first ministerif elected party leader. In a message to MPs and Northern Ireland Assembly members, Mr Poots said that leading the DUP ""would be my greatest honour"". He said he had been ""tried and tested over many years in political office"" and had a plan to ""reinvigorate unionism"". Leaving DUP headquarters on Friday afternoon, he said it was a ""good day for democracy"". MP Ian Paisley, who is backing Mr Poots, said it was a ""really good day"" for the DUP. ""This is a democratic decision. At last, the elected members are deciding who their leader is,"" he said. ""That's a very, very important decision."" Mr Poots is facing stiff competition for the leadership from Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has been the MP for Lagan Valley since 1997. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gregory Campbell leaving DUP headquarters on Friday At that time he was an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) member but was one of several politicians who defected to the DUP in 2004 after a dispute over the 1998 Good Friday Agreement peace deal. On Thursday, Sir Jeffrey told DUP assembly members and MPs that he will contest the next assembly election and serve as first minister if elected. ""If elected leader, I will not be leading remotely from Westminster. I will be on the ground and intend to fight the next assembly election so that I can be based here,"" he said. ""I would take on the role of first minister as I believe that our people not only want a leader of unionism, they want a leader for Northern Ireland."" On Friday outside DUP headquarters, Sir Jeffrey said he was ""feeling good"", when questioned by waiting reporters. MP Jim Shannon, who is backing Sir Jeffrey, said the latter had ""statesman-like qualities"". ""I feel that Jeffrey has the qualities that take him beyond Northern Ireland and across the mainland and maybe further afield,"" he said. ""I think those are statesman-like qualities which the party needs."" Both Mr Poots and Sir Jeffrey not only represent the constituency of Lagan Valley, but also work out of the same office building. There werethree candidates in the running to be deputy leader- East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell and MLAs Paul Frew, of North Antrim, and Paula Bradley, of North Belfast. However, it is understood Mr Frew, who is also Mr Poots' campaign manager, pulled out of the race on Friday. It is not clear who he is supporting. After casting her vote, outgoing leader Mrs Foster said she voted for the person who ""would bring the Democratic Unionist Party forward"". ""And I think that's very obvious,"" she added. MP Gregory Campbell (left) and MLA Paula Bradley (right) are running for the DUP deputy leader post. MLA Paul Frew (centre) pulled out of the race on Friday Only DUP members elected to the House of Commons and the Northern Ireland Assembly get to vote in a leadership election, according to party rules. There are 28 MLAs - including Mrs Foster - and eight MPs, who make up the electoral college. In order to become party leader, the winning candidate must secure the support of at least 19 of the party's MLAs and MPs. Each leadership candidate spoke to party members with a vote for 10 minutes on Friday morning, and each deputy leader contender spoke for five minutes. All you need to know about the DUP contest The city at the centre of the unionist universe From firebrands to government - who are the DUP? The DUP headquarters is an unassuming building, bar the trail of MPs and MLAs making their way inside. It looks to most, like a meeting hall. Edwin Poots smiles as he leaves DUP headquarters on Friday The leadership contenders arrive early to avoid the media, ahead of making their final pitch to the electoral college, virtually due to Covid guidelines. Media stationed outside are unsure which door the politicians are going to enter at, with several entrances it's become a bit of a guessing game. People passing by the building, though, seem unfazed by the unprecedented election taking place within its walls. MPs and MLAs began arriving in a staggered fashion to cast their ballot - crucially in secret, with only 36 eligible voters. Gavin Robinson - in Team Sir Jeffrey - was the first to leave after voting, but when asked about it, he merely gave a thumbs up. Both men have been campaigning right up to the last minute with videos and messages being sent to all party members who are eligible to vote in the leadership election. Sir Jeffrey wrote to DUP MLAs and MPs on Thursday night, presenting them with the results of a poll conducted on behalf of his campaign, which appeared to suggest he would have a broader electoral appeal than his competitor. The results were released internally within the DUP, but BBC News NI political correspondent Stephen Walker obtained a copy and reported the results onThe Viewon Thursday night. When asked who was the best choice for DUP leader, 75% of respondents who indicated a preference favoured Sir Jeffrey for the role. Mr Poots' team highlighted the size of the survey sample - 500 people -  and pointed out that there was no clarity on who took part in the poll or the political background of the respondents. They also said that in their view, the real poll on Sir Jeffrey's electoral appeal was theMP's performance in the last general election, when the DUP's overall majority in Lagan Valley fell from 19,000 to 6,000 and the party lost 16% of the vote share. Mr Poots meanwhile, also sent party members an eve of poll letter, highlighting his ministerial experience at Stormont. He also sent a video to the DUP's electoral college, in which he talked about joining the party when he was 16 and said his greatest passion was working for the people of Northern Ireland Mrs Fosterannounced her decision to resignafter facing a revolt from DUP members. She had led the party since December 2015 and was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland the following month. Arlene Foster will step down as DUP leader on 28 May BBC News NI understands that she will sever her ties with the DUP when she stands down as first minister. Sources close to her said she thinks it is no longer the party she joined. Who are the DUP leadership contenders?

People in Wales asked not to travel abroad in 2021,"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford gives his first Covid update since the election People in Wales will be able to travel to a small list of countries from Monday without going into quarantine when they get back. But despite adopting thetraffic-light systemused in England, ministers are advising people not to go abroad. The first minister warned it was ""best avoided"" because of concerns travellers could bring Covid with them. Meanwhile, he revealed he had planned to go further in easing Covid rules but paused because ofthe Indian variant. Plans to allow pubs to trade indoors, and for cinemas and museums to reopen, will go ahead from Monday. Ministers had considered relaxing lockdown restrictions further on the same, but Mark Drakeford said officials had ""decided to hold back"" for more advice. He told the BBC he had been considering allowing ""some small events"" and ""greater mixing between people not in a household"". Both are now on hold. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? No new deaths with Covid-19 reported in Wales Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Experts are concerned the variant has mutationsthat may make it more transmissible, but it is not yet known if it causes more severe disease or if it might make current vaccines less effective. A total of 26 cases of two variants first identified in India had been found in Wales as of last Thursday - including 11 of a type identified by officials as a ""variant of concern"". A total of 1,313 cases of the variant of concern have been identified in the UK. Why is the India variant causing concern in the UK? Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcedon Friday eveningthe wait between jabs will be cut from 12 weeks to eight for the over-50s and clinically vulnerable because of concern over the Indian variant. The change does not apply in Wales and the Welsh government said it will continue with the rollout as planned. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We have considered the latest evidence and advice from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation]. ""Given the low numbers of the Indian variant and the high numbers of people in Wales already vaccinated, we are confident that our vaccination programme already has the flexibility it needs to respond swiftly and effectively and are not making any changes at this stage."" Most people who travel from Wales will be doing it from airports like Bristol, the first minister said People in England and Scotland can take holidays abroad ina small number of so-called ""green"" countries,external- including Portugal, Israel and Singapore - without having to quarantine when they return. Wales will be adopting the same ""traffic light"" system, with countries classified as green, amber and red. It means people will be able to travel to a small number of foreign destinations in the green list without the need to quarantine on their return. Mandatory quarantine for countries not on the green list remains in place, and visitors to red list countries will need to book hotels on their return. Everyone who travels will need to book at least one test on their return. How will the rules work? Portugal to allow UK tourists from Monday However, the Welsh government said it would continue to advise people to only travel for essential purposes. Mr Drakeford said: ""This is the year to take your holiday in Wales and foreign travel is best avoided."" He admitted his travel advice was not a rule because it would be ""unenforceable"". He urged caution against ""importing"" coronavirus from other parts of the world. ""We know most people who travel from Wales will be doing it from Bristol, Manchester, London, so once those airports are open and travel across the UK is allowed, then people from Wales will be able to travel,"" he said. Mr Drakeford told a press conference on Friday he did not want to ""make people feel guilty"" about going abroad, but urged people to ""think of their own safety and the safety of others"", adding there were ""fantastic opportunities"" to take a holiday in Wales instead. NHS app ready to become vaccine passport next week From 24 May, a ""paper-based vaccination status"" will be available for people in Wales who have had two doses of vaccination and need to urgently travel to a country that requires Covid vaccination proof. A UK government app that will act as a vaccine passport is due to be available in England on Monday, but the first minister said there was likely to be a four-week gap before it could be used in Wales due to technical reasons. Pubs will open indoors for the first time since last December Mr Drakeford told the press conference Wales would move to Covidalert level two,externalfrom Monday, meaning: Pubs and restaurants can reopen indoors for groups of six people from up to six different households Holiday accommodation can fully reopen Cinemas, theatres bingo halls, bowling alleys, indoor play centres and areas, casinos and amusement arcade can reopen Up to 30 people can take part in indoor activities, and up to 50 in organised outdoor activities From 24 May, restrictions on numbers of visitors to care homes will be eased. Mr Drakeford said that, if the situation remained positive at the start of June, he would look at whether Wales could move toalert level one,external. But he warned he may need to delay that because of the Indian variant. This move would include ""looking at relaxing the rules further around people meeting in their own homes, increasing the number of people able to attend wedding receptions and restarting larger events"". Pub owner Ellen Morris says it will be hard for the hospitality trade to police the new rules Ellen Morris, the owner of two pubs in Bala, Gwynedd, welcomed the relaxation of the rules but said it would be difficult to police rules which dictate only six people from six different household can meet. ""They are grown adults - they should be able to decide, it shouldn't be me telling them you can do this,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. ""They call it hospitality - I don't feel I'm being very hospitable these days. We are talking about people's mental health here. It's been a long enough year without being left out of groups."" Mr Drakeford said social distancing rules in hospitality venues could be lifted if transmissions continued to fall. DJ Stacey Alford is frustrated by stricter rules in Wales than in England DJ Stacey Alford, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, has been receiving support from the UK government's freelancers' fund and Universal Credit. She said she had been ""extremely cautious"" and followed the rules very closely, but was frustrated by stricter rules in Wales than in England. ""My bugbear is we can't even do things like background noise, so those opportunities are gone, but DJs in England are able to do that."" Wedding planner Gail Windley says weddings of 30 people are still too small for most people The relaxation will also mean indoor play centres can open, and indoor wedding ceremonies of up to 30 people can take place. Gail Windley, a wedding planner from Swansea, welcomed the news but said it would still mean weddings would be too small for most couples, and criticised a lack of clarity about further easing. Charmaine Heydenrych, who owns a soft play centre in Cardiff, said she was ""ready"" to open but said being limited to 30 people was ""not sustainable"". Mark Drakeford said foreign travel was best avoided Welsh Conservative Russell George welcomed the move to level two but said the Welsh government ""should have outlined a roadmap to give hope to businesses and communities"". ""It is concerning that the Welsh Government has indicated that social distancing and mask wearing will be required into the Autumn. ""What people really want is for the Welsh and UK governments to work together, to end the confusion over different restrictions in the two countries, especially as the virus does not recognise borders."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the first minister's call for people to holiday in Wales rather than go aboard. ""It's a positive message - we need it for the economy as well. It's not just about greater health protection but also supporting tourism and hospitality businesses which have had a torrid time"". Mr Price said the sector still needed further financial support: ""What is the plan for the months ahead for hospitality?"". The 26 cases of two variants first fouind in India are ""almost entirely the result of international travel"", the first minister said. Mr Drakeford said those infected were ""people coming back to Wales from overseas"" and all cases were being carefully monitored by local public health teams. ""All the information I have had is that the individuals involved are following all the advice that they are required to follow, self-isolating and so on,"" he said. ""And the advice I have is not that we need to be overly concerned about the position in Wales at the moment."" Dr Gill Richardson, deputy chief medical officer for vaccines in Wales, told BBC Wales ""we're not led to believe that it will evade the vaccine at this point"". Public Health Wales told BBC Wales it was not identifying where the 11 variant of concern cases were ""due to the risk of small number identification"". Dr Robin Howe, incident director for Public Health Wales, said the majority of cases were associated with travel or with known contact, with the remainder still under investigation.

"Amazon set to hire 10,000 UK workers","US tech giant Amazon is to go on a hiring spree in the UK as online shopping continues to boom in the pandemic. Amazon is to hire 10,000 UK employees as it opens more warehouses in the north and south of England. It is also creating a number of corporate roles in Cambridge, Edinburgh, London and Manchester. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the move was ""a huge vote of confidence in the British economy"". The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated a trend towards online shopping, and tech giants such as Amazon have reaped the benefits. Now the firm, which has come under criticism over working conditions and over the amount of tax it pays, is further entrenching its position in the UK. Amazon 'must let workers join unions without fear' Amazon set to hire 75,000 workers in US and Canada The addition of 10,000 new roles, including thousands in its warehouses, will take its UK workforce to more than 55,000 by the end of the year. Amazon said pay for operations roles was Â£9.70 per hour, or Â£10.80 in London, with other benefits. Its profits tripled in the first three months of the year to $8.1bn (Â£5.76bn), up from $2.5bn a year ago. The online retail giant will open new ""fulfilment"" warehouses in Dartford, Gateshead, Hinckley and Swindon, and a ""parcel receive"" warehouse in Doncaster. It will recruit in its offices for roles in fashion, digital marketing, engineering, video production, software development, cloud computing, AI and machine learning. The company will also be recruiting for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business and its operations network. Amazon continues to face scrutiny over how much tax it pays in the UK, which prompted the government to launch adigital services tax in April 2020,external. The online retail giant has insisted that it pays all taxes required in the UK. On Thursday, it won a court battleoverturning an order for it to pay â¬250m (Â£215m) in back taxes to the EU. In March, the Unite union demanded that Amazon give its British workers a ""new deal"", including allowing them to unionise and have a greater share of the firm's profits. At the same time, it also launched a confidential hotline for Amazon workers to call to whistleblow on working conditions. ""Amazon continues to be plagued by reports of poor working conditions and anti-union tactics,"" said Unite's executive officer Sharon Graham at the time. ""Unite has written to Jeff Bezos to call on him to guarantee workers the freedom to talk with and form a union without fear."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng heralded Amazon's plans as making a ""prime investment in our retail sector"", which will ""open up a wide range of opportunities for even more workers"". Amazon will also invest Â£10m over three years into a scheme to train 5,000 employees in subjects including accountancy, HGV driving and software development, in a bid to give them transferable skills. Amazon will pay 95% of tuition and associated fees for adult education courses, up to Â£8,000 over four years. Local chambers of commerce will work with Amazon to identify regional skills shortages. Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Providing staff with training to plug the skills gaps that exist within the local business community is going to be a key driver to increasing productivity and boosting the economy as the UK recovers from the pandemic."" Amazon's UK Country Manager John Boumphrey said: ""We're proud of the front-line roles we offer across Amazon, and we also know that they will be a stepping stone for some in their career journey.""

He said the systems needed to ""talk to each other"" and it was important to make sure people's data is kept safe.

He said: âItâs a positive message â we need it for the economy as well.

Whist answering journalist's questions, Mark Drakeford said those infected were ""people coming back to Wales from overseas""  and all cases are being carefully monitored by local public health teams. ""All the information I have had is that the individuals involved are following all the advice that they are required to follow, self-isolating and so on,"" he said. ""And the advice I have is not that we need to be overly concerned about the position in Wales at the moment."" Mr Drakeford added that there was more concern about the ""significant spread of that India variant across our border"" in England and that ""it's something that we need to understand better, get better advice about"". ""There is a significant cluster of that there in the north west of England,"" the first minister said. ""We know that the border between the northeast of Wales and the northwest of England is a porous one, so we're keeping a particular watch on developments there."" First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed that international travel for any reason would resume in Wales on Monday, the same as England and Scotland, although he would prefer people to stay within Wales. He said there will be a  traffic-light system introduced for international travel as in other parts of the UK. ""This lets people know what the quarantine and testing requirements are when they come home,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""We want to do everything we can to prevent coronavirus re-entering Wales as a result of international travel."" He added that everyone returning from a green-list country will have to book and pay for a test on their return, and travellers and their households are reminded to use lateral flow tests. Mr Drakeford said there will be ""no English-style test-to-release scheme for Welsh travellers returning from amber list countries... because around a third of people who have developed coronavirus linked to travel have done so five days after arriving in Wales"". Urging people to consider whether to travel or not, he said: ""I know many people have been looking forward to a holiday abroad, but travel will be very different to what it was before the pandemic. ""I believe this is the year to holiday at home and enjoy everything that our wonderful Wales has to offer."" First Minister Mark Drakeford says the next three-week Covid restrictions review in Wales will be held at the start of June. He said: ""If the public health situation remains positive, we will look at whether we can move to alert level one"". Mr Drakeford said this could mean relaxing the rules further around meeting people in their own homes, increasing the number of people able to attend wedding receptions, and restarting larger events ""building on the experience ofour pilot programme, which started yesterday"". Wales' first minister says he is concerned about the Indian variant of Covid. ""This pandemic continues to be full of unpleasant twists and turns,"" Mark Drakeford said. ""We are closely monitoring the so-called India variant, which has caused 26 cases in Wales but more than 1,500 in England. ""This appears to spread easily from person to person â just like the Kent variant, which is now widespread in the UK â but may travel even faster. ""It is really important we do everything we can to keep levels of the virus as low as possible in Wales as we continue to relax restrictions in our careful and cautious way. ""The UK SAGE committee met yesterday to discuss the India variant. We will follow the latest scientific advice â just as we have throughout the pandemic.""

Public Health Wales reported today that 1,990,783 had received their first dose, with 891,569 having had their second. Mr Drakeford said: âThis means two million adults in Wales have said yes to a vaccination. âThis is a truly incredible achievement in the six months since the first Covid vaccine became available. âWe have one of the best vaccination rates in the worldâ. The first minister paid tribute to health staff, volunteers and military personnel for their part in delivering the programme.

Outlining the current situation, he said: âTake-up among care home residents, the over-80s and people in their 70s is higher than 90% for both first and second doses. âMore than half of people in their 30s and a third of people aged 18 to 29 have had their first dose. âOver the next few weeks, we will accelerate still further our programme of first dose vaccinations, as other parts of the UK make progress towards the levels of second doses we have already provided in Wales. âWe remain on target to offer all eligible adults vaccination by mid-July.

If vaccine supply allows us to move faster then we will."" First Minister Mark Drakeford says the coronavirus situation in Wales âcontinues to be positiveâ. Speaking at the first Welsh Government covid press conference since last weekâs Senedd elections, he said: âIt is a privilege to serve as your first minister again and to continue the hard work to guide Wales through the pandemic and into recovery."" Before Mr Drakeford gave details of the latest three-week review of the coronavirus regulations, he outlined the current public health situation. He said rates of coronavirus remained very low in Wales. âThe overall rate in Wales is less than 10 cases per 100,000 people and our positivity rate is below 1%. âThe number of people in hospital with Covid is at its lowest level since the start of the pandemic more than 15 months ago and there are just three people with coronavirus in critical careâ. No new deaths of people with Covid have been reported today by Public Health Wales. There were 54 new cases, with the case rate for Wales overall rising slightly from 8.9 cases per 100,000 people to 9. Since the last daily report another 12,555 people have been tested with two million having been tested overall. Almost two million people have been vaccinated in Wales, with 1,990,783 having had at least one dose. Of that number, 891,569 have had their second jab.

Picasso work sells for $100m - his fifth to do so,"Femme Assise Pres d'Une Fenetre (Marie-Therese) is Picasso's fifth work to sell for more than $100m A painting by Pablo Picasso has sold for more than $100m - marking the fifth work by the Spanish artist to sell for a nine-figure sum. Woman Sitting Near a Window (Marie-Therese) sold for $103.4m (Â£73.5m) on Thursday at Christie's auction house in New York. That figure comprises $90m for the painting itself, with fees and commissions on top, Christie's said. The auction house had estimated the painting would sell for $55m. The work, titled Femme Assise Pres d'Une Fenetre (Marie-Therese) in Spanish, was sold after 19 minutes of bidding. The impressive sales figure is a sign of the art market's vitality, which will be a source of relief for the industry after an uncertain year amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Bonnie Brennan, president of Christie's America, said the success of Thursday's auction ""signals a real return to normal and also a message that the art market is really back on track"". Picasso's Les femmes d'Alger (The Women of Algiers) for $179m in 2015 It also confirms the continuing significance and popularity of works by Picasso, who was born in 1881 and died in 1973. The painting, which depicts Picasso's young mistress and muse, Marie-Therese Walter, was acquired only eight years ago at a London sale for Â£28.6m ($44.8m), less than half the price it sold for on Thursday. Thursday's auction marked the fifth work by Picasso to have sold for more than $100m. He is one of a very small number of artists to have sold multiple works above this threshold, alongside Jackson Pollock, Vincent van Gogh and Francis Bacon. Man jailed for punching Picasso painting Poppy Delevingne on playing Picasso's muse Botticelli painting fetches record $92m at auction The record for a Picasso is $179.4m (Â£127.6m), which was paid for his painting The Women of Algiers in 2015. The last painting to fetch more than $100m was Claude Monet's 1890 work Meules, which reached $110.7m in New York in 2019. This is the first time in two years that a work has broken the $100m mark since an 1890 Claude Monet Meules painting reached $110.7m (Â£78.7m) at Sotheby's, also in New York.

Portugal: No decision on UK travel,"Portugal has yet to decide whether it will allow visits from UK holidaymakers as it extends its ""state of calamity"" until 30 May. From 17 May, travellers from England and Scotland won't have to quarantine upon their return from Portugal and other ""green list"" countries. But those countries have their own restrictions on who can visit. However, some football fans may be able to go to the planned UEFA Champions League final in Porto on 29 May. Portugal's government has announced that it is extending its ""state of public calamity"" on the mainland - the second highest level of alert - for a further 15 days from Monday, until 30 May. Under current plans, people from England and Scotland will be allowed to travel to Portugal for non-essential reasons from Monday. But whether they will be allowed in by Portugal has not been decided yet by the Portuguese government, said cabinet office minister Mariana Vieira da Silva. On The Beach pulls all summer holidays from sale Which countries are on the green list for foreign holidays? Covid: Travel firms reject 'overly cautious' green list ""I have no information to give yet,"" she said at a briefing when asked whether the UK restrictions would soon be lifted. ""Work is going on and as soon as there is a decision it will be announced, but no decision was taken in this cabinet meeting,"" she said. Travellers from the UK are one of the biggest markets for Portugal's tourism sector, along with those from Spain and France. Ms Vieira da Silva did not say when a decision on the matter might be taken. At present, Portugalallows flights to and from the UK,external, but only for essential travel, such as for business, study, family reasons, health or humanitarian reasons. Firms including Tui and Easyjet have been offering holidays and flights to green list countries, but online travel firm On The Beachhas stopped selling all holidays for this summerdue to Covid uncertainty. Tui has 44 flights due to depart for Portugal between 17 and 30 May. These include 28 to the Algarve, a popular destination for UK summer holidays. The UEFA Champions League final in Porto has not yet been officially announced, but is widely expected after Portugal's government agreed to allow a limited number of fans to attend, despite this not yet being the case at domestic games. Ms Vieira da Silva said that a series of restrictions would apply. There will be a 12,000 limit on numbers and tickets will be for named people in designated seats, which will spaced in line with health guidelines. Fans will have to fly in on charters, arriving and leaving ""on the same day"" in what Ms Vieira da Silva described as ""a bubble situation"" - passing through a separate zone at the airport, as well as having to take a coronavirus test before travelling.

Covid vaccine rollout to be flexed as needed - Zahawi,"If the Indian Covid variant is significantly more transmissible, we could face hard choices about restrictions, Boris Johnson says Remaining second doses to over-50s and those who are vulnerable will be accelerated, the PM tells a Downing St briefing The variant will not affect the easing of restrictions due on Monday but could impact on changes planned in June, he adds The PM says there will be better information on the variant in a couple of weeks and we ""could still be on the right track"" England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty says there is no doubt UK cases of the Indian variant are up Glasgow and Moray will remain under current restrictions for at least another week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says The rest of mainland Scotland will see an easing of lockdown next week Wales will move to alert level two of restrictions on Monday, meaning more indoor hospitality can reopen British tourists will be allowed to enter Portugal from Monday, the Portuguese government confirms The UK records another 17 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Hazel Shearing Thanks for tuning into today's live updates, which were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans and Justin Parkinson. They were edited by James Clarke, Vanessa Barford and Hazel Shearing. It's been a busy day, with briefings from the prime minister and the first ministers of Scotland and Wales. All three addressed
measures to tackle rising cases of the Indian variant. Here's the latest from the UK:  And from the rest of the world: Missed this evening's briefing? Here's what you need to know:  You can readour full story here. Before Christmas, Graeme Carling didn't know anyone who had caught Covid. But within the space of less than an hour one evening in January, the virus changed his and his family's lives forever. The CEO of investment company United Capital hastold the BBChow he lost his mother and father to Covid within an hour. At the start of the year, his mother, Margaret, died three weeks after contracting coronavirus. As he left the hospice where she'd slipped away, he got a phone call about his father, Graeme senior. ""They said he was doing okay, the oxygen was working, he did need it but they would have liked to have seen more progress,"" he said. Margaret was 65 and her husband Graeme was 66. They were married for 47 years. By the time Graeme was driving home with his wife Leanne, he got another call. ""The doctor was in a distressed state because I had just spoken to her 15 minutes before and by the time she had gone back to the ward, my dad had passed also,"" he said. ""It was so surreal. I was in complete shock."" You can read Graeme's storyhere. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE) says is highly likely the variant that emerged in India is more transmissible than the Kent variant and that it is a ""realistic possibility that it is as much as 50% more transmissible"". It adds there are ""plausible biological reasons"" as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible. Boris Johnson is asked whether easing restrictions in England from next Monday might one day be seen as a ""big mistake"". The PM replies that the position is ""different"" because of better knowledge than before about Covid, and better testing. He adds that ""on balance"" it's right to proceed, given ""low numbers"" of infections but the government remains ""very alive"" to changes in the data. On foreign travel, people going abroad will be subject to appropriate tests, he says. He adds that he doubts the government's list of permitted destinations will be added to ""very rapidly"". Ministers ""take nothing off the table"" in doing what is necessary to keep people safe, Johnson says. That ends today's Downing Street press conference. Sam Coates from Sky says the fourth test for the next step of the lockdown to go ahead is that there can't be variants of concern changing the assessment. But he asks given cases of the Indian variant have almost tripled in the last week how can you say you've passed that test? Johnson says: ""We are concerned about this variant...and we do think it certainly may cause disruption to our attempts to continue down the roadmap but it doesn't change the assessment to step three."" ""If you look at the numbers, even in Bolton you're not seeing a significant increase in hospitalisations and the overall numbers across the country remain low so they're not changing the assessment at present."" Prof Whitty says we are broadly in the same territory with regards to the four tests. The thing that has changed is the ""very clear view"" that the Indian variant is more transmissible. ""We expect over time this variant will overtake and come to dominate in the UK in the way that the Kent variant did,"" he says. We need some time to gather the data but if it is a lot more transmissible that would imply we could have a really significant surge, Whitty says. We also do not know what impact the vaccines will have in practice, he says. Asked by Hugo Gye from the i newspaper about the impact of prioritising second doses in England, Prof Whitty says the move will not lead to a delay in younger people getting their first jabs. He says that is because the JCVI's recommendation is that most people under the age of 40 will be vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, ""whereas the revaccination programme is largely at this point"" with AstraZeneca vaccines. ""This should not lead to significant delays, we don't have that trade off,"" he says. He adds that there is still a desire to ""maintain a slightly longer gap"" of eight weeks between doses because there are ""some advantages to that"". The PM is asked how long any delay beyond 21 June restrictions could last. He replies that he can't speculate and there will be better information on the new variant in a couple of weeks. Boris Johnson also says it's possible we ""could still be on the right track"". Reality Check Boris Johnson has been asked about whether it was a mistake
not to close the border with India sooner. The government announced India would be added to the
travel ban red list on 19 April, but the restrictions did not come into force
until 23 April. Neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the red list
two weeks earlier. Figures
published yesterday showed that the number of cases of the new variant of
Covid-19 first identified in India, which has now been designated as a variant
of concern,had risen from 520 to 1,313 in the past week,external. TheWorld Health Organization said,externalthe India variant appeared to have a higher rate of
transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines
may be less effective against it. You can read more about why Indiawasnât added to the redlist sooner here. The PM is asked whether people planning to travel to visit family in areas where there have been spikes of the Indian variant should still go - and whether they should they stay overnight. ""I do think it's important that in respect to the areas where we are seeing these spikes... given the caution that I think we have to exercise with this new variant, the risk of extra transmissibility, I would urge people just to think twice about that,"" he says. He says he wants people in those areas to recognise that there is an extra risk and a ""threat of disruption to progress"" and asks them to ""exercise their discretion"". Josh from Corby asks when under 30s can expect to receive the Covid vaccine? Prof Chris Whitty says the vaccine is making a rapid and steady progression through the age ranges starting with the oldest people. This is because risk is very strongly correlated with age, he says. ""We've actually got to the point where 38 and 39s are having their jabs and this will steadily move down over the next weeks,"" he says. He says the goal is for everybody to have their first vaccine by the end of July. There is now an aim to accelerate to the point where people have their second vaccination after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks. This is because people who have a second vaccine will not only have greater protection against the original variant but also the new variant. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With overall cases and hospitalisations low, the
Conservative MPs in the Covid Recovery Group â who are concerned about the
economic effects of the lockdowns â will be hugely concerned that the prime minister is not committing himself to ""freedom day"" on 21 June in England. This
is when the roadmap envisaged social distancing measures being lifted. But if
the Indian variant is very much more transmissible, Boris Johnson has warned of
difficult choices ahead. Prof Chris Whitty says that, if vaccines lose some ""efficacy"", this tends to happen first with those who show mild symptoms rather than those likely to suffer most from the virus. That's why those in more vulnerable groups are being prioritised, he adds. There are ""very strong aims"" to increase jabs in areas affected by the new variant, Prof Whitty says. The PM says Colonel Russell Miller, commander army HQ north west, is being deployed to support local leaders in managing the response to the Indian variant on the ground. The response will include surge testing, mobile tesing units and the army will be on the streets handing out tests. There will be ""targeted new activity"" in Bolton and Blackburn to accelerate the vaccine take-up, including longer opening hours at vaccination sites. ""We are going to have to live with this new variant of the virus for some time,"" Johnson says. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson was under huge political pressure in
particular from his own side of the Commons not delay the further lifting of
restrictions on Monday. And the Conservative leader of Bolton council said imposing
local restrictions could be counter productive â creating an incentive to move
around and potentially spread the new variant further. But his policy now contrasts with the Scottish government
which isnât easing restrictions in Glasgow and Moray due to case rates, so opposition voices may soon urge greater caution in England too. The prime minister is also likely to be asked whether he
added India swiftly enough to the âred listâ which would have meant hotel
quarantine for all arrivals from there. On to media questions now. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh asks how likely it is that the final unlocking of restrictions in England will happen on 21 June. Boris Johnson says he can't say ""for certain"". Numbers of infections remain ""low"" across the country, he adds, and the situation is different from last year because of vaccines. People will have to ""wait and see"" whether the new variant is more transmissible and wait for more evidence that vaccines have cut risks of hospitalisations and deaths. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Mr Johnson says the government would ""implement further restrictions immediately"" as soon as it saw ""there was a risk of really serious increase of hospitalisations"" that could overwhelm the NHS. Chris Whitty says there is no doubt UK cases of the Indian variant are up, and that there's ""confidence"" it's ""more transmissible"" than existing strains. He adds that scientists are working to find out how much more transmissible it is. It's ""quite widely seeded"" in places other than Bolton, but there's not a greater increase in rates among over-60s than other age groups, Prof Whitty adds.  Professor Chris Whitty, England's Chief Medical Officer, says the number of people testing positive for Covid in the UK is going ""steadily"" downwards, as is the number of people in hospital. Deaths of people following a positive Covid test are also down, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Labour suspends union official after Patel tweetHoward Beckett had apologised for posting that Home Secretary Priti Patel ""should be deported"".UK Politics","Howard Beckett is standing to be the next Unite general secretary The home secretary's immigration policies are ""disgusting"", union official Howard Beckett has said following his suspension from Labour. The suspension came after the Unite assistant general secretary tweeted that Priti Patel ""should be deported"". Mr Beckett later apologised to Ms Patel and deleted the post. But he told Sky News his suspension was ""completely inappropriate"" and insisted he would not pull out of the race to lead Unite. He added that he had not received any notice of his suspension from Labour, but had found out about the move on social media. He also said Labour was becoming ""the party of the establishment"" and accused party leader Sir Keir Starmer of failing to ""show leadership"". Unite contest: Who's running and what's at stake? Unite to elect new leader by end of summer While suspended from the party Mr Beckett is not allowed to take up his place on Labour's ruling body. He sits as a union representative on Labour's National Executive Committee - a role that requires membership of the party. Mr Beckett is a candidate in the race to succeed longstanding leader Len McCluskey at Unite, one of Labour's biggest financial backers. His tweet was a response to the Home Officedetaining two Indian immigrantsin Glasgow on Thursday over ""suspected immigration offences"". The Home Office defended its actions, saying: ""The UK government is tackling illegal immigration and the harm it causes, often to the most vulnerable people by removing those with no right to be in the UK."" In his now-deleted twitter message, Mr Beckett wrote: ""Priti Patel should be deported, not refugees. She can go along with anyone else who supports institutional racism. She is disgusting."" In a later apology posted on Twitter, he said: ""My earlier tweet, deleted after half an hour, was never intended to be literal."" ""My intention was to emphasise that racist policies should be rejected and have no place in society,"" he added. ""The wording was wrong, offensive and I apologise unreservedly to Priti Patel. No-one should be deported."" Speaking to Sky News, he said his language had been ""inappropriate"" adding: ""I don't look at Priti Patel and see her migrant background and colour of her skin, I look at Priti Patel and I see a racist agenda, the racist policies that are being carried out, the institutional racism that is now becoming the norm in society."" He added: ""I don't have a racist bone in my body."" A Labour spokesperson had earlier said it was taking the matter ""extremely seriously"" and pledged ""appropriate action will be taken"". Conservative MP Steve Baker said it was ""an extraordinary, absolutely intolerable remark"" which must have a ""robust response"" from Labour. The BBC has contacted Unite for a comment.

"Harry: I want to break cycle of pain for my familyThe Duke of Sussex says he does not want to pass on the ""suffering"" of his parents to his children.","This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons The Duke of Sussex has said he wants to ""break the cycle"" of the ""pain and suffering"" of his upbringing with his own children. Prince Harry, who is expecting a daughter with wife Meghan and is already father to their son Archie, said he did not want to pass on pain from his own experience. But he said he did not think ""we should be pointing the finger"" at anybody. Buckingham Palace and Clarence House declined to comment on his remarks. During an appearance on the Armchair Expert podcast,external, Prince Harry compared his life to a mixture of the film The Truman Show, in which the main character unwittingly lives his life on a TV show, and being in a zoo. He said in being born into the Royal Family ""you inherit every element of it without choice"", including that the UK media ""feel an ownership over you"". Inside the media's 'invisible contract' with the royals Prince Harry told American actor and podcast co-host Dax Shepard: ""I don't think we should be pointing the finger or blaming anybody, but certainly when it comes to parenting, if I've experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I'm going to make sure I break that cycle so that I don't pass it on, basically. ""It's a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on,"" he said, adding that parents should be trying to stop that happening. He said: ""I started to piece it together and go 'okay, so this is where he went to school, this is what happened, I know this about his life, I also know that is connected to his parents so that means he's treated me the way he was treated, so how can I change that for my own kids?'"" The Prince of Wales ignored questions from a BBC reporter about his son's remarks, which were put to him as he arrived at a royal engagement in Cardiff earlier. The duke and duchess stepped down as senior royals in January 2020 The 36-year-old duke said he was in his early twenties when he thought: ""I don't want this job, I don't want to be here. I don't want to be doing this. Look what it did to my mum, how am I ever going to settle down and have a wife and family when I know that it's going to happen again? ""I've seen behind the curtain, I've seen the business model. I know how this operation runs and how it works, I don't want to be part of this."" In the wide-ranging 90-minute interview, the prince said his family's move to the US had not been part of the plan but he had to put his family and their mental health first. On his and Meghan's life in Los Angeles, California, he said: ""Living here now I can actually lift my head and I feel different, my shoulders have dropped, so have hers, you can walk around feeling a little bit more free, I can take Archie on the back of my bicycle, I would never have had the chance to do that."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said, for the palaces, Prince Harry's comments come ""firmly on the private side of the curtain"". ""That's not to say that they don't talk about it behind the curtain. It's been put to me by various people in different quarters that this is largely as a result of Meghan, that Harry is - or was - happier in his role before Meghan,"" he said. ""But Harry himself says in this podcast... that Meghan was part of the process of him understanding that there was a different way, and a different place for him to be. So he's pretty open about that."" During the episode, Prince Harry says he decided to go to therapy after a conversation with Meghan. ""Suddenly it was like the bubble was burst,"" he said. ""I plucked my head out of the sand, gave it a good shake off and I was like, 'Okay, you're in this position of privilege, stop complaining or stop thinking as though you want something different.

Gupta empire facing UK fraud probe over GreensillThe group run by Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.Business,"Sanjeev Gupta, head of GFG Alliance The business empire of Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The probe is over suspected fraudulent trading and money laundering, including its financing arrangements with failed company Greensill Capital UK. Greensill, a major lender to Mr Gupta's business, collapsed in March. GFG Alliance, Mr Gupta's family conglomerate, said it would co-operate fully with the investigation. ""As these matters are the subject of an SFO investigation we cannot make any further comment,"" a GFG spokesperson added. GFG Alliance employs 35,000 people at companies stretching from Wales to Australia. Its Liberty Steel arm in the UK has about 3,000 staff. The company's reliance on Greensill caused many to worry that it might itself be at risk following the finance firm's demise. GFG is in talks with finance firms about providing emergency loans. A request for a Â£170m from the UK government was rejected. On Thursday, former prime minister David Cameron, who worked for Greensill and lobbied the government on its behalf,appeared before MPs to answer questions about his role. The announcement of a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the workings of Sanjeev Gupta's metals-based empire has serious consequences, before any evidence is even heard. First, the BBC understands that the Department for Business feels vindicated that it did not agree to give the so-called ""saviour of steel"" a requested government bailout of Â£170m. Second, and perhaps more importantly, it sets back Mr Gupta's attempts to raise new finance to replace the money it once received from the now defunct Greensill. The government has promised to save the steel plants - owned by Gupta's GFG alliance that are now in dire financial straits - but this investigation makes the chance of it surviving in its current form an increasingly remote possibility. The news comes a day after former prime minister and former Greensill employee, David Cameron, defended his role in lobbying the government to grant Greensill access to a government-backed Covid loan programme. In its statement, GFG said it ""continues to serve its customers around the world and is making progress in the refinancing of its operations which are benefitting from the operational improvements it has made and the very strong steel, aluminium and iron ore markets"". Greensill's business model - called supply chain finance - worked by placing itself between customers and suppliers. It would immediately pay the invoices that suppliers gave to their customers, meaning those suppliers would not have to wait possibly for months for payment. The Financial Times has claimed that one of Mr Gupta's companies had sent Greensill invoices for business it had supposedly done with four European metal companies. But those European companies told the newspaper they had not dealt with GFG. However, GFG said the invoices were for products it expected to perhaps sell in the future and that the financial arrangement was common for many of Greensill's clients. During Mr Cameron's appearance before the Treasury Committee on Thursday, he acknowledged that GFG had a very close relationship with Greensill, and said it was ""disturbing"" to read the reports about the invoices. Mr Gupta was once hailed as the saviour of British steel when his company bought a struggling steel mill in South Wales, saving it from likely closure. Liberty Steel then went on to snap up several ailing UK plants and turn them around. GFG now operates in 30 countries, and has revenues of about Â£20bn.

"Harry: I want to break cycle of pain for my familyThe Duke of Sussex says he does not want to pass on the ""suffering"" of his parents to his children.UK","This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons The Duke of Sussex has said he wants to ""break the cycle"" of the ""pain and suffering"" of his upbringing with his own children. Prince Harry, who is expecting a daughter with wife Meghan and is already father to their son Archie, said he did not want to pass on pain from his own experience. But he said he did not think ""we should be pointing the finger"" at anybody. Buckingham Palace and Clarence House declined to comment on his remarks. During an appearance on the Armchair Expert podcast,external, Prince Harry compared his life to a mixture of the film The Truman Show, in which the main character unwittingly lives his life on a TV show, and being in a zoo. He said in being born into the Royal Family ""you inherit every element of it without choice"", including that the UK media ""feel an ownership over you"". Inside the media's 'invisible contract' with the royals Prince Harry told American actor and podcast co-host Dax Shepard: ""I don't think we should be pointing the finger or blaming anybody, but certainly when it comes to parenting, if I've experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I'm going to make sure I break that cycle so that I don't pass it on, basically. ""It's a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on,"" he said, adding that parents should be trying to stop that happening. He said: ""I started to piece it together and go 'okay, so this is where he went to school, this is what happened, I know this about his life, I also know that is connected to his parents so that means he's treated me the way he was treated, so how can I change that for my own kids?'"" The Prince of Wales ignored questions from a BBC reporter about his son's remarks, which were put to him as he arrived at a royal engagement in Cardiff earlier. The duke and duchess stepped down as senior royals in January 2020 The 36-year-old duke said he was in his early twenties when he thought: ""I don't want this job, I don't want to be here. I don't want to be doing this. Look what it did to my mum, how am I ever going to settle down and have a wife and family when I know that it's going to happen again? ""I've seen behind the curtain, I've seen the business model. I know how this operation runs and how it works, I don't want to be part of this."" In the wide-ranging 90-minute interview, the prince said his family's move to the US had not been part of the plan but he had to put his family and their mental health first. On his and Meghan's life in Los Angeles, California, he said: ""Living here now I can actually lift my head and I feel different, my shoulders have dropped, so have hers, you can walk around feeling a little bit more free, I can take Archie on the back of my bicycle, I would never have had the chance to do that."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said, for the palaces, Prince Harry's comments come ""firmly on the private side of the curtain"". ""That's not to say that they don't talk about it behind the curtain. It's been put to me by various people in different quarters that this is largely as a result of Meghan, that Harry is - or was - happier in his role before Meghan,"" he said. ""But Harry himself says in this podcast... that Meghan was part of the process of him understanding that there was a different way, and a different place for him to be. So he's pretty open about that."" During the episode, Prince Harry says he decided to go to therapy after a conversation with Meghan. ""Suddenly it was like the bubble was burst,"" he said. ""I plucked my head out of the sand, gave it a good shake off and I was like, 'Okay, you're in this position of privilege, stop complaining or stop thinking as though you want something different. Make this different, because you can't get out.'""

measures to tackle rising cases of the Indian variant. Here's the latest from the UK:  And from the rest of the world: Missed this evening's briefing? Here's what you need to know:  You can readour full story here. Before Christmas, Graeme Carling didn't know anyone who had caught Covid. But within the space of less than an hour one evening in January, the virus changed his and his family's lives forever. The CEO of investment company United Capital hastold the BBChow he lost his mother and father to Covid within an hour. At the start of the year, his mother, Margaret, died three weeks after contracting coronavirus. As he left the hospice where she'd slipped away, he got a phone call about his father, Graeme senior. ""They said he was doing okay, the oxygen was working, he did need it but they would have liked to have seen more progress,"" he said. Margaret was 65 and her husband Graeme was 66. They were married for 47 years. By the time Graeme was driving home with his wife Leanne, he got another call. ""The doctor was in a distressed state because I had just spoken to her 15 minutes before and by the time she had gone back to the ward, my dad had passed also,"" he said. ""It was so surreal. I was in complete shock."" You can read Graeme's storyhere. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE) says is highly likely the variant that emerged in India is more transmissible than the Kent variant and that it is a ""realistic possibility that it is as much as 50% more transmissible"". It adds there are ""plausible biological reasons"" as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible. Boris Johnson is asked whether easing restrictions in England from next Monday might one day be seen as a ""big mistake"". The PM replies that the position is ""different"" because of better knowledge than before about Covid, and better testing. He adds that ""on balance"" it's right to proceed, given ""low numbers"" of infections but the government remains ""very alive"" to changes in the data. On foreign travel, people going abroad will be subject to appropriate tests, he says. He adds that he doubts the government's list of permitted destinations will be added to ""very rapidly"". Ministers ""take nothing off the table"" in doing what is necessary to keep people safe, Johnson says. That ends today's Downing Street press conference. Sam Coates from Sky says the fourth test for the next step of the lockdown to go ahead is that there can't be variants of concern changing the assessment. But he asks given cases of the Indian variant have almost tripled in the last week how can you say you've passed that test? Johnson says: ""We are concerned about this variant...and we do think it certainly may cause disruption to our attempts to continue down the roadmap but it doesn't change the assessment to step three."" ""If you look at the numbers, even in Bolton you're not seeing a significant increase in hospitalisations and the overall numbers across the country remain low so they're not changing the assessment at present."" Prof Whitty says we are broadly in the same territory with regards to the four tests. The thing that has changed is the ""very clear view"" that the Indian variant is more transmissible. ""We expect over time this variant will overtake and come to dominate in the UK in the way that the Kent variant did,"" he says. We need some time to gather the data but if it is a lot more transmissible that would imply we could have a really significant surge, Whitty says. We also do not know what impact the vaccines will have in practice, he says. Asked by Hugo Gye from the i newspaper about the impact of prioritising second doses in England, Prof Whitty says the move will not lead to a delay in younger people getting their first jabs. He says that is because the JCVI's recommendation is that most people under the age of 40 will be vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, ""whereas the revaccination programme is largely at this point"" with AstraZeneca vaccines. ""This should not lead to significant delays, we don't have that trade off,"" he says. He adds that there is still a desire to ""maintain a slightly longer gap"" of eight weeks between doses because there are ""some advantages to that"". The PM is asked how long any delay beyond 21 June restrictions could last. He replies that he can't speculate and there will be better information on the new variant in a couple of weeks. Boris Johnson also says it's possible we ""could still be on the right track"". Reality Check Boris Johnson has been asked about whether it was a mistake
not to close the border with India sooner. The government announced India would be added to the
travel ban red list on 19 April, but the restrictions did not come into force
until 23 April. Neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the red list
two weeks earlier. Figures
published yesterday showed that the number of cases of the new variant of
Covid-19 first identified in India, which has now been designated as a variant
of concern,had risen from 520 to 1,313 in the past week,external. TheWorld Health Organization said,externalthe India variant appeared to have a higher rate of
transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines
may be less effective against it. You can read more about why Indiawasnât added to the redlist sooner here. The PM is asked whether people planning to travel to visit family in areas where there have been spikes of the Indian variant should still go - and whether they should they stay overnight. ""I do think it's important that in respect to the areas where we are seeing these spikes... given the caution that I think we have to exercise with this new variant, the risk of extra transmissibility, I would urge people just to think twice about that,"" he says. He says he wants people in those areas to recognise that there is an extra risk and a ""threat of disruption to progress"" and asks them to ""exercise their discretion"". Josh from Corby asks when under 30s can expect to receive the Covid vaccine? Prof Chris Whitty says the vaccine is making a rapid and steady progression through the age ranges starting with the oldest people. This is because risk is very strongly correlated with age, he says. ""We've actually got to the point where 38 and 39s are having their jabs and this will steadily move down over the next weeks,"" he says. He says the goal is for everybody to have their first vaccine by the end of July. There is now an aim to accelerate to the point where people have their second vaccination after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks. This is because people who have a second vaccine will not only have greater protection against the original variant but also the new variant. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With overall cases and hospitalisations low, the
Conservative MPs in the Covid Recovery Group â who are concerned about the
economic effects of the lockdowns â will be hugely concerned that the prime minister is not committing himself to ""freedom day"" on 21 June in England. This
is when the roadmap envisaged social distancing measures being lifted. But if
the Indian variant is very much more transmissible, Boris Johnson has warned of
difficult choices ahead. Prof Chris Whitty says that, if vaccines lose some ""efficacy"", this tends to happen first with those who show mild symptoms rather than those likely to suffer most from the virus. That's why those in more vulnerable groups are being prioritised, he adds. There are ""very strong aims"" to increase jabs in areas affected by the new variant, Prof Whitty says. The PM says Colonel Russell Miller, commander army HQ north west, is being deployed to support local leaders in managing the response to the Indian variant on the ground. The response will include surge testing, mobile tesing units and the army will be on the streets handing out tests. There will be ""targeted new activity"" in Bolton and Blackburn to accelerate the vaccine take-up, including longer opening hours at vaccination sites. ""We are going to have to live with this new variant of the virus for some time,"" Johnson says. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson was under huge political pressure in
particular from his own side of the Commons not delay the further lifting of
restrictions on Monday. And the Conservative leader of Bolton council said imposing
local restrictions could be counter productive â creating an incentive to move
around and potentially spread the new variant further. But his policy now contrasts with the Scottish government
which isnât easing restrictions in Glasgow and Moray due to case rates, so opposition voices may soon urge greater caution in England too. The prime minister is also likely to be asked whether he
added India swiftly enough to the âred listâ which would have meant hotel
quarantine for all arrivals from there. On to media questions now. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh asks how likely it is that the final unlocking of restrictions in England will happen on 21 June. Boris Johnson says he can't say ""for certain"". Numbers of infections remain ""low"" across the country, he adds, and the situation is different from last year because of vaccines. People will have to ""wait and see"" whether the new variant is more transmissible and wait for more evidence that vaccines have cut risks of hospitalisations and deaths. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Mr Johnson says the government would ""implement further restrictions immediately"" as soon as it saw ""there was a risk of really serious increase of hospitalisations"" that could overwhelm the NHS. Chris Whitty says there is no doubt UK cases of the Indian variant are up, and that there's ""confidence"" it's ""more transmissible"" than existing strains. He adds that scientists are working to find out how much more transmissible it is. It's ""quite widely seeded"" in places other than Bolton, but there's not a greater increase in rates among over-60s than other age groups, Prof Whitty adds.  Professor Chris Whitty, England's Chief Medical Officer, says the number of people testing positive for Covid in the UK is going ""steadily"" downwards, as is the number of people in hospital. Deaths of people following a positive Covid test are also down, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

The CEO of investment company United Capital hastold the BBChow he lost his mother and father to Covid within an hour. At the start of the year, his mother, Margaret, died three weeks after contracting coronavirus. As he left the hospice where she'd slipped away, he got a phone call about his father, Graeme senior. ""They said he was doing okay, the oxygen was working, he did need it but they would have liked to have seen more progress,"" he said. Margaret was 65 and her husband Graeme was 66. They were married for 47 years. By the time Graeme was driving home with his wife Leanne, he got another call. ""The doctor was in a distressed state because I had just spoken to her 15 minutes before and by the time she had gone back to the ward, my dad had passed also,"" he said. ""It was so surreal. I was in complete shock."" You can read Graeme's storyhere. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE) says is highly likely the variant that emerged in India is more transmissible than the Kent variant and that it is a ""realistic possibility that it is as much as 50% more transmissible"". It adds there are ""plausible biological reasons"" as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible. Boris Johnson is asked whether easing restrictions in England from next Monday might one day be seen as a ""big mistake"". The PM replies that the position is ""different"" because of better knowledge than before about Covid, and better testing. He adds that ""on balance"" it's right to proceed, given ""low numbers"" of infections but the government remains ""very alive"" to changes in the data. On foreign travel, people going abroad will be subject to appropriate tests, he says. He adds that he doubts the government's list of permitted destinations will be added to ""very rapidly"". Ministers ""take nothing off the table"" in doing what is necessary to keep people safe, Johnson says. That ends today's Downing Street press conference. Sam Coates from Sky says the fourth test for the next step of the lockdown to go ahead is that there can't be variants of concern changing the assessment. But he asks given cases of the Indian variant have almost tripled in the last week how can you say you've passed that test? Johnson says: ""We are concerned about this variant...and we do think it certainly may cause disruption to our attempts to continue down the roadmap but it doesn't change the assessment to step three."" ""If you look at the numbers, even in Bolton you're not seeing a significant increase in hospitalisations and the overall numbers across the country remain low so they're not changing the assessment at present."" Prof Whitty says we are broadly in the same territory with regards to the four tests. The thing that has changed is the ""very clear view"" that the Indian variant is more transmissible. ""We expect over time this variant will overtake and come to dominate in the UK in the way that the Kent variant did,"" he says. We need some time to gather the data but if it is a lot more transmissible that would imply we could have a really significant surge, Whitty says. We also do not know what impact the vaccines will have in practice, he says. Asked by Hugo Gye from the i newspaper about the impact of prioritising second doses in England, Prof Whitty says the move will not lead to a delay in younger people getting their first jabs. He says that is because the JCVI's recommendation is that most people under the age of 40 will be vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, ""whereas the revaccination programme is largely at this point"" with AstraZeneca vaccines. ""This should not lead to significant delays, we don't have that trade off,"" he says. He adds that there is still a desire to ""maintain a slightly longer gap"" of eight weeks between doses because there are ""some advantages to that"". The PM is asked how long any delay beyond 21 June restrictions could last. He replies that he can't speculate and there will be better information on the new variant in a couple of weeks. Boris Johnson also says it's possible we ""could still be on the right track"". Reality Check Boris Johnson has been asked about whether it was a mistake
not to close the border with India sooner. The government announced India would be added to the
travel ban red list on 19 April, but the restrictions did not come into force
until 23 April. Neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the red list
two weeks earlier. Figures
published yesterday showed that the number of cases of the new variant of
Covid-19 first identified in India, which has now been designated as a variant
of concern,had risen from 520 to 1,313 in the past week,external. TheWorld Health Organization said,externalthe India variant appeared to have a higher rate of
transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines
may be less effective against it. You can read more about why Indiawasnât added to the redlist sooner here. The PM is asked whether people planning to travel to visit family in areas where there have been spikes of the Indian variant should still go - and whether they should they stay overnight. ""I do think it's important that in respect to the areas where we are seeing these spikes... given the caution that I think we have to exercise with this new variant, the risk of extra transmissibility, I would urge people just to think twice about that,"" he says. He says he wants people in those areas to recognise that there is an extra risk and a ""threat of disruption to progress"" and asks them to ""exercise their discretion"". Josh from Corby asks when under 30s can expect to receive the Covid vaccine? Prof Chris Whitty says the vaccine is making a rapid and steady progression through the age ranges starting with the oldest people. This is because risk is very strongly correlated with age, he says. ""We've actually got to the point where 38 and 39s are having their jabs and this will steadily move down over the next weeks,"" he says. He says the goal is for everybody to have their first vaccine by the end of July. There is now an aim to accelerate to the point where people have their second vaccination after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks. This is because people who have a second vaccine will not only have greater protection against the original variant but also the new variant. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With overall cases and hospitalisations low, the
Conservative MPs in the Covid Recovery Group â who are concerned about the
economic effects of the lockdowns â will be hugely concerned that the prime minister is not committing himself to ""freedom day"" on 21 June in England. This
is when the roadmap envisaged social distancing measures being lifted. But if
the Indian variant is very much more transmissible, Boris Johnson has warned of
difficult choices ahead. Prof Chris Whitty says that, if vaccines lose some ""efficacy"", this tends to happen first with those who show mild symptoms rather than those likely to suffer most from the virus. That's why those in more vulnerable groups are being prioritised, he adds. There are ""very strong aims"" to increase jabs in areas affected by the new variant, Prof Whitty says. The PM says Colonel Russell Miller, commander army HQ north west, is being deployed to support local leaders in managing the response to the Indian variant on the ground. The response will include surge testing, mobile tesing units and the army will be on the streets handing out tests. There will be ""targeted new activity"" in Bolton and Blackburn to accelerate the vaccine take-up, including longer opening hours at vaccination sites. ""We are going to have to live with this new variant of the virus for some time,"" Johnson says. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson was under huge political pressure in
particular from his own side of the Commons not delay the further lifting of
restrictions on Monday. And the Conservative leader of Bolton council said imposing
local restrictions could be counter productive â creating an incentive to move
around and potentially spread the new variant further. But his policy now contrasts with the Scottish government
which isnât easing restrictions in Glasgow and Moray due to case rates, so opposition voices may soon urge greater caution in England too. The prime minister is also likely to be asked whether he
added India swiftly enough to the âred listâ which would have meant hotel
quarantine for all arrivals from there. On to media questions now. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh asks how likely it is that the final unlocking of restrictions in England will happen on 21 June. Boris Johnson says he can't say ""for certain"". Numbers of infections remain ""low"" across the country, he adds, and the situation is different from last year because of vaccines. People will have to ""wait and see"" whether the new variant is more transmissible and wait for more evidence that vaccines have cut risks of hospitalisations and deaths. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Mr Johnson says the government would ""implement further restrictions immediately"" as soon as it saw ""there was a risk of really serious increase of hospitalisations"" that could overwhelm the NHS. Chris Whitty says there is no doubt UK cases of the Indian variant are up, and that there's ""confidence"" it's ""more transmissible"" than existing strains. He adds that scientists are working to find out how much more transmissible it is. It's ""quite widely seeded"" in places other than Bolton, but there's not a greater increase in rates among over-60s than other age groups, Prof Whitty adds.  Professor Chris Whitty, England's Chief Medical Officer, says the number of people testing positive for Covid in the UK is going ""steadily"" downwards, as is the number of people in hospital. Deaths of people following a positive Covid test are also down, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Second jab could be given sooner to tackle variantLocal restrictions have also not been ruled out in areas worst affected by the Indian variant.,"The NHS is sending a mobile vaccine bus into parts of Bolton with high infections Second vaccine doses could be brought forward and local restrictions introduced to help tackle the Indian variant in the worst-affected areas, the UK  government has said. Minister Nadhim Zahawi said steps could also include vaccinating younger people in multi-generational households. Meanwhile, a top scientist has warned lifting restrictions on 21 June is in doubt because of the Indian variant. Cases in the UK have more than doubled to 1,313, Public Health England said. The figures released on Thursday have risen from520 cases recorded by PHE up to 5 May,external. Most of the cases - 1,255 - are in England, while there are 35 in Scotland, 12 in Northern Ireland and 11 in Wales, according to PHE. However, Prof Paul Hunter, who sits on a number of Covid advisory committees for the World Health Organization, said current figures were around two weeks out of date and would now be higher. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Indian variant was now in most regions of the UK, with the possible exception of Yorkshire and Humber and north-east England. More than 30% of cases are in London, followed by 25% in north-west England, 12% in eastern England, 10% in the East Midlands and 8% in the South East, PHE said. Four people have now died with the Indian variant of concern as of 12 May, according to PHE. According to Friday's government figures, a further 17 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test and another 2,193 coronavirus cases have been recorded. Covid in Bolton: What's causing the spike? Why is the Indian variant causing concern in the UK? What is the Indian Covid variant? Do India reinfections pose a challenge to vaccines? The Department of Health and Social Care said there was ""no firm evidence yet to show this variant has any greater impact on severity of disease or evades the vaccine"". But experts believe it may be more transmissible. And the department said ministers could not rule out imposing local restrictions if they were necessary to suppress a variant which vaccines are less effective against. Vaccines Minister Mr Zahawi said the government was also considering reducing the gap between vaccine doses for people in areas where the variant is spreading. He added that pilots of vaccinating younger people in multi-generational households in Luton had been successful. Prof Hunter said there was ""possibly"" a case for targeting vaccines in certain areas - but jabs took two to three weeks to work. This would mean diverting doses from other areas, where the Indian variant could also soon be spreading. He added that he thought it was more important to administer as many first doses as possible than boost the number of second doses at this stage. On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsaid there was no evidence to suggest England's planned lockdown easing could not go ahead. The next major easing of restrictions is due to take place on 17 May. But Prof Hunter said step four of the roadmap out of lockdown, which is due on 21 June and would see all legal limits on social contact lifted, ""is in doubt"". Currently, he said the Indian variant was spreading in younger, unvaccinated people but if cases increased in the elderly so would hospital admissions, putting pressure on the NHS. Mr Zahawi said easing restrictions on 21 June depended on the government'sfour tests,externalbeing met - including that vaccines continue to be effective and the risks are not fundamentally changed by new variants. Why could the Indian variant be a problem when the vaccination programme is doing so well? The issue is that we are only part way through even though those most at risk have been prioritised. There is still debate about how transmissible the new variant is. But modelling by the University of Warwick has estimated that a 30%-40% more transmissible variant combined with relaxing restrictions in May and June could lead to more hospital admissions than in the first wave. It would be a very different situation if we were in the autumn when overall levels of immunity would be making it harder for the virus to spread. Instead, we are in the delicate phase where restrictions are being eased as the vaccine is taking over the burden of suppressing the virus. One option being considered is closing the gap between the first and second doses. This would give vulnerable people, who have already been offered their first jab, extra protection more quickly. However, there could be a trade-off as studies suggest the current 12-week gap between doses leads to a better immune response than the originally planned three-week gap. Asked whether local lockdowns were being considered, Mr Zahawi said nothing was ""off the table"", including further regional or national measures. However, he said surge testing was the ""most effective way"" of dealing with variants. Surge testing is already taking place in 15 areas across England, includingBolton,Blackburn, London,SeftonandNottingham. This is when increased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in specific locations to try to prevent the spread of outbreaks. Greater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham told BBC Breakfast local lockdowns ""can't be the answer"" and urged ministers to deliver more vaccines to areas where case rates are highest. The Conservative leader of Bolton Council, David Greenhalgh, also appealed to the government not to enforce a local lockdown, saying people would simply travel to pubs and restaurants in neighbouring areas. He said he had also asked the health secretary for more resources and vaccines, including for younger people, to tackle the surge. Mr Greenhalgh said talks on the introduction of vaccines for younger age groups had been ""very constructive"" and ""all the soundings"" were that the government was looking to progress this as soon as possible. PHE said mobile testing units had been set up in Bolton, and door-to-door PCR testing had been offered to 22,000 residents. A PCR test is the most accurate way to check for Covid. More doses have been delivered to the town, which has also set up a vaccine bus to increase uptake among those who are eligible. Extra clinics will open in Blackburn and Darwen in Lancashire from next week to offer the vaccine to those who are eligible under national guidelines. But the area's public health director, Prof Dominic Harrison,said he was ""furious"" the government had refused a request to extend vaccinations in Blackburn. On Thursday, the council initially said all over-18s would be offered a jab, before later stating only those with underlying conditions could book an appointment. Meanwhile, the R number - or reproduction number - in England is estimated to have risen slightly from between 0.8 and 1.0 to between 0.8 and 1.1, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. If the R number is above one then the number of cases keeps increasing. Additional reporting by Hazel Shearing LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

He says he wants people in those areas to recognise that there is an extra risk and a ""threat of disruption to progress"" and asks them to ""exercise their discretion"". Josh from Corby asks when under 30s can expect to receive the Covid vaccine? Prof Chris Whitty says the vaccine is making a rapid and steady progression through the age ranges starting with the oldest people. This is because risk is very strongly correlated with age, he says. ""We've actually got to the point where 38 and 39s are having their jabs and this will steadily move down over the next weeks,"" he says. He says the goal is for everybody to have their first vaccine by the end of July. There is now an aim to accelerate to the point where people have their second vaccination after eight weeks instead of 12 weeks. This is because people who have a second vaccine will not only have greater protection against the original variant but also the new variant. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent With overall cases and hospitalisations low, the
Conservative MPs in the Covid Recovery Group â who are concerned about the
economic effects of the lockdowns â will be hugely concerned that the prime minister is not committing himself to ""freedom day"" on 21 June in England. This
is when the roadmap envisaged social distancing measures being lifted. But if
the Indian variant is very much more transmissible, Boris Johnson has warned of
difficult choices ahead. Prof Chris Whitty says that, if vaccines lose some ""efficacy"", this tends to happen first with those who show mild symptoms rather than those likely to suffer most from the virus. That's why those in more vulnerable groups are being prioritised, he adds. There are ""very strong aims"" to increase jabs in areas affected by the new variant, Prof Whitty says. The PM says Colonel Russell Miller, commander army HQ north west, is being deployed to support local leaders in managing the response to the Indian variant on the ground. The response will include surge testing, mobile tesing units and the army will be on the streets handing out tests. There will be ""targeted new activity"" in Bolton and Blackburn to accelerate the vaccine take-up, including longer opening hours at vaccination sites. ""We are going to have to live with this new variant of the virus for some time,"" Johnson says. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson was under huge political pressure in
particular from his own side of the Commons not delay the further lifting of
restrictions on Monday. And the Conservative leader of Bolton council said imposing
local restrictions could be counter productive â creating an incentive to move
around and potentially spread the new variant further. But his policy now contrasts with the Scottish government
which isnât easing restrictions in Glasgow and Moray due to case rates, so opposition voices may soon urge greater caution in England too. The prime minister is also likely to be asked whether he
added India swiftly enough to the âred listâ which would have meant hotel
quarantine for all arrivals from there. On to media questions now. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh asks how likely it is that the final unlocking of restrictions in England will happen on 21 June. Boris Johnson says he can't say ""for certain"". Numbers of infections remain ""low"" across the country, he adds, and the situation is different from last year because of vaccines. People will have to ""wait and see"" whether the new variant is more transmissible and wait for more evidence that vaccines have cut risks of hospitalisations and deaths. Responding to a question from a member of the public, Mr Johnson says the government would ""implement further restrictions immediately"" as soon as it saw ""there was a risk of really serious increase of hospitalisations"" that could overwhelm the NHS. Chris Whitty says there is no doubt UK cases of the Indian variant are up, and that there's ""confidence"" it's ""more transmissible"" than existing strains. He adds that scientists are working to find out how much more transmissible it is. It's ""quite widely seeded"" in places other than Bolton, but there's not a greater increase in rates among over-60s than other age groups, Prof Whitty adds.  Professor Chris Whitty, England's Chief Medical Officer, says the number of people testing positive for Covid in the UK is going ""steadily"" downwards, as is the number of people in hospital. Deaths of people following a positive Covid test are also down, he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Amazon set to hire 10,000 UK workersThe tech giant is tightening its grip on retail as the coronavirus pandemic continuesBusiness","US tech giant Amazon is to go on a hiring spree in the UK as online shopping continues to boom in the pandemic. Amazon is to hire 10,000 UK employees as it opens more warehouses in the north and south of England. It is also creating a number of corporate roles in Cambridge, Edinburgh, London and Manchester. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the move was ""a huge vote of confidence in the British economy"". The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated a trend towards online shopping, and tech giants such as Amazon have reaped the benefits. Now the firm, which has come under criticism over working conditions and over the amount of tax it pays, is further entrenching its position in the UK. Amazon 'must let workers join unions without fear' Amazon set to hire 75,000 workers in US and Canada The addition of 10,000 new roles, including thousands in its warehouses, will take its UK workforce to more than 55,000 by the end of the year. Amazon said pay for operations roles was Â£9.70 per hour, or Â£10.80 in London, with other benefits. Its profits tripled in the first three months of the year to $8.1bn (Â£5.76bn), up from $2.5bn a year ago. The online retail giant will open new ""fulfilment"" warehouses in Dartford, Gateshead, Hinckley and Swindon, and a ""parcel receive"" warehouse in Doncaster. It will recruit in its offices for roles in fashion, digital marketing, engineering, video production, software development, cloud computing, AI and machine learning. The company will also be recruiting for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business and its operations network. Amazon continues to face scrutiny over how much tax it pays in the UK, which prompted the government to launch adigital services tax in April 2020,external. The online retail giant has insisted that it pays all taxes required in the UK. On Thursday, it won a court battleoverturning an order for it to pay â¬250m (Â£215m) in back taxes to the EU. In March, the Unite union demanded that Amazon give its British workers a ""new deal"", including allowing them to unionise and have a greater share of the firm's profits. At the same time, it also launched a confidential hotline for Amazon workers to call to whistleblow on working conditions. ""Amazon continues to be plagued by reports of poor working conditions and anti-union tactics,"" said Unite's executive officer Sharon Graham at the time. ""Unite has written to Jeff Bezos to call on him to guarantee workers the freedom to talk with and form a union without fear."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng heralded Amazon's plans as making a ""prime investment in our retail sector"", which will ""open up a wide range of opportunities for even more workers"". Amazon will also invest Â£10m over three years into a scheme to train 5,000 employees in subjects including accountancy, HGV driving and software development, in a bid to give them transferable skills. Amazon will pay 95% of tuition and associated fees for adult education courses, up to Â£8,000 over four years. Local chambers of commerce will work with Amazon to identify regional skills shortages. Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Providing staff with training to plug the skills gaps that exist within the local business community is going to be a key driver to increasing productivity and boosting the economy as the UK recovers from the pandemic."" Amazon's UK Country Manager John Boumphrey said: ""We're proud of the front-line roles we offer across Amazon, and we also know that they will be a stepping stone for some in their career journey.""

They were edited by James Clarke, Vanessa Barford and Hazel Shearing. It's been a busy day, with briefings from the prime minister and the first ministers of Scotland and Wales. All three addressed
measures to tackle rising cases of the Indian variant. Here's the latest from the UK:  And from the rest of the world: Missed this evening's briefing? Here's what you need to know:  You can readour full story here. Before Christmas, Graeme Carling didn't know anyone who had caught Covid. But within the space of less than an hour one evening in January, the virus changed his and his family's lives forever. The CEO of investment company United Capital hastold the BBChow he lost his mother and father to Covid within an hour. At the start of the year, his mother, Margaret, died three weeks after contracting coronavirus. As he left the hospice where she'd slipped away, he got a phone call about his father, Graeme senior. ""They said he was doing okay, the oxygen was working, he did need it but they would have liked to have seen more progress,"" he said. Margaret was 65 and her husband Graeme was 66. They were married for 47 years. By the time Graeme was driving home with his wife Leanne, he got another call. ""The doctor was in a distressed state because I had just spoken to her 15 minutes before and by the time she had gone back to the ward, my dad had passed also,"" he said. ""It was so surreal. I was in complete shock."" You can read Graeme's storyhere. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE) says is highly likely the variant that emerged in India is more transmissible than the Kent variant and that it is a ""realistic possibility that it is as much as 50% more transmissible"". It adds there are ""plausible biological reasons"" as to why some of the mutations present could make this variant more transmissible. Boris Johnson is asked whether easing restrictions in England from next Monday might one day be seen as a ""big mistake"". The PM replies that the position is ""different"" because of better knowledge than before about Covid, and better testing. He adds that ""on balance"" it's right to proceed, given ""low numbers"" of infections but the government remains ""very alive"" to changes in the data. On foreign travel, people going abroad will be subject to appropriate tests, he says. He adds that he doubts the government's list of permitted destinations will be added to ""very rapidly"". Ministers ""take nothing off the table"" in doing what is necessary to keep people safe, Johnson says. That ends today's Downing Street press conference. Sam Coates from Sky says the fourth test for the next step of the lockdown to go ahead is that there can't be variants of concern changing the assessment. But he asks given cases of the Indian variant have almost tripled in the last week how can you say you've passed that test? Johnson says: ""We are concerned about this variant...and we do think it certainly may cause disruption to our attempts to continue down the roadmap but it doesn't change the assessment to step three."" ""If you look at the numbers, even in Bolton you're not seeing a significant increase in hospitalisations and the overall numbers across the country remain low so they're not changing the assessment at present."" Prof Whitty says we are broadly in the same territory with regards to the four tests. The thing that has changed is the ""very clear view"" that the Indian variant is more transmissible. ""We expect over time this variant will overtake and come to dominate in the UK in the way that the Kent variant did,"" he says. We need some time to gather the data but if it is a lot more transmissible that would imply we could have a really significant surge, Whitty says. We also do not know what impact the vaccines will have in practice, he says. Asked by Hugo Gye from the i newspaper about the impact of prioritising second doses in England, Prof Whitty says the move will not lead to a delay in younger people getting their first jabs. He says that is because the JCVI's recommendation is that most people under the age of 40 will be vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, ""whereas the revaccination programme is largely at this point"" with AstraZeneca vaccines. ""This should not lead to significant delays, we don't have that trade off,"" he says. He adds that there is still a desire to ""maintain a slightly longer gap"" of eight weeks between doses because there are ""some advantages to that"". The PM is asked how long any delay beyond 21 June restrictions could last. He replies that he can't speculate and there will be better information on the new variant in a couple of weeks. Boris Johnson also says it's possible we ""could still be on the right track"". Reality Check Boris Johnson has been asked about whether it was a mistake
not to close the border with India sooner. The government announced India would be added to the
travel ban red list on 19 April, but the restrictions did not come into force
until 23 April. Neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the red list
two weeks earlier. Figures
published yesterday showed that the number of cases of the new variant of
Covid-19 first identified in India, which has now been designated as a variant
of concern,had risen from 520 to 1,313 in the past week,external. TheWorld Health Organization said,externalthe India variant appeared to have a higher rate of
transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines
may be less effective against it. You can read more about why Indiawasnât added to the redlist sooner here. The PM is asked whether people planning to travel to visit family in areas where there have been spikes of the Indian variant should still go - and whether they should they stay overnight. ""I do think it's important that in respect to the areas where we are seeing these spikes... given the caution that I think we have to exercise with this new variant, the risk of extra transmissibility, I would urge people just to think twice about that,"" he says.

People in Wales asked to delay holidays abroad,"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford gives his first Covid update since the election People in Wales will be able to travel to a small list of countries from Monday without going into quarantine when they get back. But despite adopting thetraffic-light systemused in England, ministers are advising people not to go abroad. The first minister warned it was ""best avoided"" because of concerns travellers could bring Covid with them. Meanwhile, he revealed he had planned to go further in easing Covid rules but paused because ofthe Indian variant. Plans to allow pubs to trade indoors, and for cinemas and museums to reopen, will go ahead from Monday. Ministers had considered relaxing lockdown restrictions further on the same, but Mark Drakeford said officials had ""decided to hold back"" for more advice. He told the BBC he had been considering allowing ""some small events"" and ""greater mixing between people not in a household"". Both are now on hold. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? No new deaths with Covid-19 reported in Wales Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Experts are concerned the variant has mutationsthat may make it more transmissible, but it is not yet known if it causes more severe disease or if it might make current vaccines less effective. A total of 26 cases of two variants first identified in India had been found in Wales as of last Thursday - including 11 of a type identified by officials as a ""variant of concern"". A total of 1,313 cases of the variant of concern have been identified in the UK. Why is the India variant causing concern in the UK? Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcedon Friday eveningthe wait between jabs will be cut from 12 weeks to eight for the over-50s and clinically vulnerable because of concern over the Indian variant. The change does not apply in Wales and the Welsh government said it will continue with the rollout as planned. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We have considered the latest evidence and advice from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation]. ""Given the low numbers of the Indian variant and the high numbers of people in Wales already vaccinated, we are confident that our vaccination programme already has the flexibility it needs to respond swiftly and effectively and are not making any changes at this stage."" Most people who travel from Wales will be doing it from airports like Bristol, the first minister said People in England and Scotland can take holidays abroad ina small number of so-called ""green"" countries,external- including Portugal, Israel and Singapore - without having to quarantine when they return. Wales will be adopting the same ""traffic light"" system, with countries classified as green, amber and red. It means people will be able to travel to a small number of foreign destinations in the green list without the need to quarantine on their return. Mandatory quarantine for countries not on the green list remains in place, and visitors to red list countries will need to book hotels on their return. Everyone who travels will need to book at least one test on their return. How will the rules work? Portugal to allow UK tourists from Monday However, the Welsh government said it would continue to advise people to only travel for essential purposes. Mr Drakeford said: ""This is the year to take your holiday in Wales and foreign travel is best avoided."" He admitted his travel advice was not a rule because it would be ""unenforceable"". He urged caution against ""importing"" coronavirus from other parts of the world. ""We know most people who travel from Wales will be doing it from Bristol, Manchester, London, so once those airports are open and travel across the UK is allowed, then people from Wales will be able to travel,"" he said. Mr Drakeford told a press conference on Friday he did not want to ""make people feel guilty"" about going abroad, but urged people to ""think of their own safety and the safety of others"", adding there were ""fantastic opportunities"" to take a holiday in Wales instead. NHS app ready to become vaccine passport next week From 24 May, a ""paper-based vaccination status"" will be available for people in Wales who have had two doses of vaccination and need to urgently travel to a country that requires Covid vaccination proof. A UK government app that will act as a vaccine passport is due to be available in England on Monday, but the first minister said there was likely to be a four-week gap before it could be used in Wales due to technical reasons. Pubs will open indoors for the first time since last December Mr Drakeford told the press conference Wales would move to Covidalert level two,externalfrom Monday, meaning: Pubs and restaurants can reopen indoors for groups of six people from up to six different households Holiday accommodation can fully reopen Cinemas, theatres bingo halls, bowling alleys, indoor play centres and areas, casinos and amusement arcade can reopen Up to 30 people can take part in indoor activities, and up to 50 in organised outdoor activities From 24 May, restrictions on numbers of visitors to care homes will be eased. Mr Drakeford said that, if the situation remained positive at the start of June, he would look at whether Wales could move toalert level one,external. But he warned he may need to delay that because of the Indian variant. This move would include ""looking at relaxing the rules further around people meeting in their own homes, increasing the number of people able to attend wedding receptions and restarting larger events"". Pub owner Ellen Morris says it will be hard for the hospitality trade to police the new rules Ellen Morris, the owner of two pubs in Bala, Gwynedd, welcomed the relaxation of the rules but said it would be difficult to police rules which dictate only six people from six different household can meet. ""They are grown adults - they should be able to decide, it shouldn't be me telling them you can do this,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. ""They call it hospitality - I don't feel I'm being very hospitable these days. We are talking about people's mental health here. It's been a long enough year without being left out of groups."" Mr Drakeford said social distancing rules in hospitality venues could be lifted if transmissions continued to fall. DJ Stacey Alford is frustrated by stricter rules in Wales than in England DJ Stacey Alford, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, has been receiving support from the UK government's freelancers' fund and Universal Credit. She said she had been ""extremely cautious"" and followed the rules very closely, but was frustrated by stricter rules in Wales than in England. ""My bugbear is we can't even do things like background noise, so those opportunities are gone, but DJs in England are able to do that."" Wedding planner Gail Windley says weddings of 30 people are still too small for most people The relaxation will also mean indoor play centres can open, and indoor wedding ceremonies of up to 30 people can take place. Gail Windley, a wedding planner from Swansea, welcomed the news but said it would still mean weddings would be too small for most couples, and criticised a lack of clarity about further easing. Charmaine Heydenrych, who owns a soft play centre in Cardiff, said she was ""ready"" to open but said being limited to 30 people was ""not sustainable"". Mark Drakeford said foreign travel was best avoided Welsh Conservative Russell George welcomed the move to level two but said the Welsh government ""should have outlined a roadmap to give hope to businesses and communities"". ""It is concerning that the Welsh Government has indicated that social distancing and mask wearing will be required into the Autumn. ""What people really want is for the Welsh and UK governments to work together, to end the confusion over different restrictions in the two countries, especially as the virus does not recognise borders."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the first minister's call for people to holiday in Wales rather than go aboard. ""It's a positive message - we need it for the economy as well. It's not just about greater health protection but also supporting tourism and hospitality businesses which have had a torrid time"". Mr Price said the sector still needed further financial support: ""What is the plan for the months ahead for hospitality?"". The 26 cases of two variants first fouind in India are ""almost entirely the result of international travel"", the first minister said. Mr Drakeford said those infected were ""people coming back to Wales from overseas"" and all cases were being carefully monitored by local public health teams. ""All the information I have had is that the individuals involved are following all the advice that they are required to follow, self-isolating and so on,"" he said. ""And the advice I have is not that we need to be overly concerned about the position in Wales at the moment."" Dr Gill Richardson, deputy chief medical officer for vaccines in Wales, told BBC Wales ""we're not led to believe that it will evade the vaccine at this point"". Public Health Wales told BBC Wales it was not identifying where the 11 variant of concern cases were ""due to the risk of small number identification"". Dr Robin Howe, incident director for Public Health Wales, said the majority of cases were associated with travel or with known contact, with the remainder still under investigation.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned anti-Semitism targeting British Jews, after a video emerged of a convoy of cars brandishing Palestinian flags in North London, with anti-Semitic abuse apparently being shouted through a megaphone. London's Metropolitan Police said they were aware of the video, which appeared to be filmed in the St John's Wood area, which is home to a Jewish community. Allow Twitter content?

Police said the demonstrations had been largely peaceful but projectiles had been thrown in ""small pockets of disorder"". Air raids have reduced buildings to rubble in Gaza Israel's military says the destruction of homes in Gaza City which killed 42 Palestinians was caused by an attack on a Hamas tunnel system. Several homes were reduced to rubble following an air strike early on Sunday. Israel said it had attacked a militant tunnel system which collapsed, bringing residential buildings down with it. It said the deaths were unintentional. Ten children were among the victims. Rescue workers combed through the debris of the buildings on Sunday recovering bodies. ""These are moments of horror that no-one can describe. Like
an earthquake hit the area,"" said Mahmoud Hmaid, who was helping the efforts. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent in Jerusalem Is Israelâs military
operation in Gaza, dubbed âGuardian of the Wallsâ, nearing its conclusion? Not obviously. Benjamin
Netanyahu says attacks are continuing with âfull forceâ and will âtake timeâ. In a news conference this
afternoon, Israelâs prime minister admitted there were âpressuresâ but thanked
US President Joe Biden, in particular, for his support. Mr Netanyahu has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire with Hamas Mr Bidenâs envoy, Hady Amr, has been in Israel since Friday, discussing the crisis with Israeli officials. Unusually, at the end of a week that has also seen an alarming spate of inter-communal violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities, he also met Israeli-Arab leaders. Since the US, like Israel and many other countries, regards Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Mr Amr will not be meeting one of the two warring parties. Any messages for Hamas will have to go through traditional interlocutors, like Egypt or Qatar. Local reports suggest Hamas has been offering some kind of ceasefire for several days, only to be rebuffed by Israel, which clearly wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close. These episodes follow a familiar pattern: Israel presses home its undoubted military advantage until the international outcry over civilian casualties, and a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, demand that the operation end. In Israelâs estimation, we have not yet reached that point. Former Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett has said it will be Israel, and not Hamas, that decides when the military operation is complete. Mr Bennett, who heads the right-wing party Yamina, told the BBC that all the casualties in the current conflict were down to Hamas's decision to start it. This video can not be played Naftali Bennett spoke to the BBC earlier on Sunday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that destroying the Jala high-rise block in Gaza yesterday was justified. He's given an interview with US network CBS in which he maintained there was ""an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organisation housed in that building that plots and organises terror attacks against Israeli civilians, so it's a perfectly legitimate target"". The building housed crews from the Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, who were given an hour to leave before it was destroyed in an air strike. Mr Netanyahu confirmed Israeli reports that US officials had been given information about the attack. The building's landlord has denied it has any connection with Hamas. The Associated Press has asked Israel to present evidence. News agency Agence France Presse said earlier that its media colleagues would be moving into its offices in Gaza. This is the moment the tower block was brought down in yesterday's air strike. This video can not be played Gaza tower containing media offices collapses after Israeli strike The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of war crimes In a statement to the UN Security Council, Palestinian Foreign Minister
Riyad Al-Maliki denounced Israeli âaggressionâ, detailing attacks that had
destroyed families in the Gaza Strip. ""Israel keeps telling you 'put yourself
in our shoes', but Israel is not wearing shoes, it is wearing military boots,"" he
said. He asked how many victims were enough for the Security Council to
condemn what was going on. âWhat is the threshold for outrage?â Israelâs UN ambassador Gilad Erdan also appealed to the Security Council to
understand the Israeli response: ""This is not the first time that Hamas has
fired at Israeli civilians while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. But this time
it was different."" He said Hamas was seeking to seize power from the
Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas. ""There is never a justification for
terror,"" he said, accusing Hamas of inciting violence in Jerusalem. He was adamant that Israel was taking ""unparalleled steps"" to avoid civilian casualties. Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The end games in the wars between Hamas and Israel have followed a pattern since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Foreign mediators have thrashed out a variety of ceasefires. That's what the Americans, Egyptians, the UN and others are trying to do now. For that to work, both sides need to be able to tell their people they've won. Hamas will want to say that it is the real protector of Palestinian rights, not just in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank including Jerusalem. Israel will want to show its people that it has done serious damage to the Hamas infrastructure. A much used phrase is ""restore deterrence"". That means showing their enemies that hitting Israel will only bring pain and suffering. Both sides will struggle to find words for bereaved families or traumatised children. If you are just joining us, here are today's key developments in the Israel-Palestinian conflict: In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the military operation against Hamas is ""continuing at full strength"", appearing to reject international attempts to arrange a ceasefire. ""Our campaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force. We are acting now, for as long as necessary, to restore
calm and quiet to you, Israel's citizens. It will take time,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu added that Israel wanted to exact a price from the ""aggressor"" and to restore deterrence. He was speaking after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet which went on for several hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole,"" he said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres In his opening remarks to the UN Security Council meeting, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN was ""actively engaging all sides towards an immediate ceasefire"". He described the violence as ""utterly appalling"" and said the fighting must stop immediately. Mr Guterres also called on all parties ""to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed"". UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, told the online meeting that casualties on both sides were mounting and that the situation in Gaza was ""more dire by the day"". The UN was working tirelessly with all sides to restore calm, he said. Mr Wennesland said Gaza militants should stop firing rockets from civilians areas and Israeli authorities had to abide by international law, maintaining maximum restraint to spare civilians. The Israeli cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon and Beersheba have been hit by rocket fire from Gaza in the past hour. So far there have been no reports of major injuries but Israel's fire and rescue authority reports substantial damage to homes and cars, and to a synagogue in Ashkelon.  This is the scene of the synagogue, in a picture posted by Israel's fire and rescue services Earlier, Israel's military said more than 3,000 rockets had been fired from the Gaza Strip since the latest conflict began. Cars were hit in Ashdod and reports say a residential building under construction was also struck. This video was posted from the scene in Ashdod.  Allow Twitter content?

The UN Security Council is due to convene shortly to discuss the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The US - a long-time ally of Israel - blocked a meeting scheduled for Friday and has faced criticism for not doing enough to halt the violence. US President Joe Biden held phone calls on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. In his talks with Netanyahu he underscored Israel's right to defend itself. The US Secretary for Israel-Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, held talks earlier with Defence Minister Benny Gantz and was due to meet Palestinian officials too. Hundreds of people have been attending funerals in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel for victims of the latest violence. In Gaza City, funerals were held for members of the al-Kulak family who died in an Israeli air strike earlier today. Funeral prayers are performed for a member of the al-Kulak family In the West Bank village of Saida, near the city of Tulkarem, mourners carried the body of Yaseen Hamad who was killed during clashes with Israeli troops near his village. The streets of Saida were filled with mourners for Yaseen Hamad's funeral Crowds gathered in the West Bank city of Hebron for the funeral of teenager Muhammad Yunus Freijat, who was also killed during clashes with Israel security forces. Muhammad Yunus Freijat was killed during a protest in Hebron Meanwhile in Israel, the funeral took place for Gershon Franco, 55, who died on Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The rocket attack in Ramat Gan caused widespread damage Hamas and other Islamist militant groups in Gaza have a variety of weapons to deploy Israel says the past week has seen the highest ever rate of rocket attacks on its territory from Gaza. So just how much firepower does Hamas have there? Foreign affairs analyst Jonathan Marcus says estimating the militant group's stockpile of rockets is impossible, but it will include many thousands of projectiles of varying ranges. Some of the weaponry will have been smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt's Sinai peninsula but the bulk of it is believed to be manufactured inside the Gaza Strip itself. You can read more of Jonathan's analysis here. Differing reports are emerging about whether Israel is considering a ceasefire to halt the fighting. The Financial Times newspaper reports that the UN, Egypt and Qatar are working on a short ceasefire to enable fuel to reach Gaza's only power plant, citing two Western diplomats. Israeli officials believe the plant could run out as soon as tomorrow. However, Israeli media have quoted their own sources saying no ceasefire proposal was made or assessed when the country's security cabinet met for several hours earlier today. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has updated its figures on the number of people killed in Israeli air strikes in the early hours of Sunday. It now says 33 people died. A spokesman said 12 women and 8 children were among them, and a further 50 people were wounded. Fourteen hours on, paramedics are still searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for potential survivors. A Palestinian father carries his injured daughter from the rubble of a destroyed house after an Israeli air strike in Gaza City This brings to 181 the number of deaths in Gaza since the conflict erupted a week ago.

Next steps considered amid India variant concern,"The NHS is sending a mobile vaccine bus into parts of Bolton with high infections Second vaccine doses could be brought forward and local restrictions introduced to help tackle the Indian variant in the worst-affected areas, the UK  government has said. Minister Nadhim Zahawi said steps could also include vaccinating younger people in multi-generational households. Meanwhile, a top scientist has warned lifting restrictions on 21 June is in doubt because of the Indian variant. Cases in the UK have more than doubled to 1,313, Public Health England said. The figures released on Thursday have risen from520 cases recorded by PHE up to 5 May,external. Most of the cases - 1,255 - are in England, while there are 35 in Scotland, 12 in Northern Ireland and 11 in Wales, according to PHE. However, Prof Paul Hunter, who sits on a number of Covid advisory committees for the World Health Organization, said current figures were around two weeks out of date and would now be higher. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Indian variant was now in most regions of the UK, with the possible exception of Yorkshire and Humber and north-east England. More than 30% of cases are in London, followed by 25% in north-west England, 12% in eastern England, 10% in the East Midlands and 8% in the South East, PHE said. Four people have now died with the Indian variant of concern as of 12 May, according to PHE. According to Friday's government figures, a further 17 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test and another 2,193 coronavirus cases have been recorded. Covid in Bolton: What's causing the spike? Why is the Indian variant causing concern in the UK? What is the Indian Covid variant? Do India reinfections pose a challenge to vaccines? The Department of Health and Social Care said there was ""no firm evidence yet to show this variant has any greater impact on severity of disease or evades the vaccine"". But experts believe it may be more transmissible. And the department said ministers could not rule out imposing local restrictions if they were necessary to suppress a variant which vaccines are less effective against. Vaccines Minister Mr Zahawi said the government was also considering reducing the gap between vaccine doses for people in areas where the variant is spreading. He added that pilots of vaccinating younger people in multi-generational households in Luton had been successful. Prof Hunter said there was ""possibly"" a case for targeting vaccines in certain areas - but jabs took two to three weeks to work. This would mean diverting doses from other areas, where the Indian variant could also soon be spreading. He added that he thought it was more important to administer as many first doses as possible than boost the number of second doses at this stage. On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsaid there was no evidence to suggest England's planned lockdown easing could not go ahead. The next major easing of restrictions is due to take place on 17 May. But Prof Hunter said step four of the roadmap out of lockdown, which is due on 21 June and would see all legal limits on social contact lifted, ""is in doubt"". Currently, he said the Indian variant was spreading in younger, unvaccinated people but if cases increased in the elderly so would hospital admissions, putting pressure on the NHS. Mr Zahawi said easing restrictions on 21 June depended on the government'sfour tests,externalbeing met - including that vaccines continue to be effective and the risks are not fundamentally changed by new variants. Why could the Indian variant be a problem when the vaccination programme is doing so well? The issue is that we are only part way through even though those most at risk have been prioritised. There is still debate about how transmissible the new variant is. But modelling by the University of Warwick has estimated that a 30%-40% more transmissible variant combined with relaxing restrictions in May and June could lead to more hospital admissions than in the first wave. It would be a very different situation if we were in the autumn when overall levels of immunity would be making it harder for the virus to spread. Instead, we are in the delicate phase where restrictions are being eased as the vaccine is taking over the burden of suppressing the virus. One option being considered is closing the gap between the first and second doses. This would give vulnerable people, who have already been offered their first jab, extra protection more quickly. However, there could be a trade-off as studies suggest the current 12-week gap between doses leads to a better immune response than the originally planned three-week gap. Asked whether local lockdowns were being considered, Mr Zahawi said nothing was ""off the table"", including further regional or national measures. However, he said surge testing was the ""most effective way"" of dealing with variants. Surge testing is already taking place in 15 areas across England, includingBolton,Blackburn, London,SeftonandNottingham. This is when increased testing and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in specific locations to try to prevent the spread of outbreaks. Greater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham told BBC Breakfast local lockdowns ""can't be the answer"" and urged ministers to deliver more vaccines to areas where case rates are highest. The Conservative leader of Bolton Council, David Greenhalgh, also appealed to the government not to enforce a local lockdown, saying people would simply travel to pubs and restaurants in neighbouring areas. He said he had also asked the health secretary for more resources and vaccines, including for younger people, to tackle the surge. Mr Greenhalgh said talks on the introduction of vaccines for younger age groups had been ""very constructive"" and ""all the soundings"" were that the government was looking to progress this as soon as possible. PHE said mobile testing units had been set up in Bolton, and door-to-door PCR testing had been offered to 22,000 residents. A PCR test is the most accurate way to check for Covid. More doses have been delivered to the town, which has also set up a vaccine bus to increase uptake among those who are eligible. Extra clinics will open in Blackburn and Darwen in Lancashire from next week to offer the vaccine to those who are eligible under national guidelines. But the area's public health director, Prof Dominic Harrison,said he was ""furious"" the government had refused a request to extend vaccinations in Blackburn. On Thursday, the council initially said all over-18s would be offered a jab, before later stating only those with underlying conditions could book an appointment. Meanwhile, the R number - or reproduction number - in England is estimated to have risen slightly from between 0.8 and 1.0 to between 0.8 and 1.1, according to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. If the R number is above one then the number of cases keeps increasing. Additional reporting by Hazel Shearing LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

SNP holds Airdrie and Shotts seat in by-electionAnum Qaisar-Javed wins the by-election for the SNP after holding off a challenge from Scottish Labour.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played Anum Qaisar-Javed pays tribute to her pupils and says she hopes her win can inspire others The SNP has held one of its Westminster seats in a by-election after seeing off a challenge from Labour. Anum Qaisar-Javed won the Airdrie and Shotts seat for the SNP with a reduced majority of 1,757 over her Labour opponent. Her victory brings the total number of SNP MPs in the Commons back to 45. The by-election was held after sitting MP Neil Gray resigned in order to stand in last week's Scottish Parliament election. Ms Qaisar-Javed is a 28-year-old modern studies teacher who was a Labour activist until the independence referendum in 2014. She becomes Scotland's second-ever female Muslim MP. Her win follows the SNP's landslide victory in last week's Scottish Parliament election - which saw the SNP's Kaukab Stewart and Pam Gosal of the Scottish Conservatives become the country'sfirst women of colourto be elected to Holyrood. The by-election saw Ms Qaisar-Javed receive 10,129 votes, with Labour second on 8,372 - a majority of 1,757. The SNP's share of the vote was 46.4% - 1.4 percentage points higher than in the 2019 election - with Labour's share increasing by 6.5 percentage points to 38.4%. The Conservatives finished third with 2,812 votes, with the Liberal Democrats fourth on 220. Turnout was 34.3% - lower than the average of 46.5% for a by-election in the last parliament - with counting being done overnight. Mr Gray won the seat for the SNP with a majority of 5,201 in the last general election in 2019. He was elected as the MSP for the Airdrie and Shotts seat in the Scottish Parliament last week - with SNP rules meaning he had to quit as an MP in order to stand for Holyrood. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Qaisar-Javed said she hoped to be a role model for other people from minority backgrounds - and also pledged to ""fight for independence"" after being elected. She said she taught her students about why there are fewer people from minority communities in politics, adding: ""We talk about reasons such as a lack of role models, and it has taken until 2021, but now we have two women of colour in the Scottish Parliament. ""But I don't just want women of colour to look at me, or people of colour, I want anyone from any minority group to be able to look at me and say 'if she can do it, so can I'."" Counting was done overnight at the Ravenscraig Regional Sports Facility In a speech made after votes were counted at the Ravenscraig Regional Sports Facility in Motherwell, she added that the ""initial priority has to be the Covid recovery"". But she said: ""As we move through the pandemic and when the time is right, then yes of course we will be looking to campaign for another independence referendum, as is the right of people of Scotland. ""Whatever the result is of that referendum, so be it, but that choice is of paramount importance."" The contest was the first Westminster by-election to be held in Scotland since 2011. This was the SNP's first ever Westminster by-election defence, and one they have handled fairly comfortably - albeit with a reduced majority. In theory this could have been a closer contest, with Labour coming within 195 votes of regaining the seat in 2017, but it increasingly seemed like the forgotten election as polling day approached. It was perhaps understandable that it would fly under the radar in terms of the political debate in Scotland, coming as it did one week after a crucial set of Scottish Parliament elections. But the same was true from a Westminster angle, with the contest in Hartlepool a week earlier seeming to take on far greater significance in the eyes of Labour, particularly in the wake of their defeat. Airdrie and Shotts was once a Labour stronghold, and a textbook example of Scotland's importance to the party's position in government. It was the base first of the Scottish Secretary, Helen Liddell, and then the Home Secretary, John Reid. Tonight, it has once again been held by the SNP, the new dominant political force in this part of the world - while UK Labour's focus appears to be on bickering over the results of elections elsewhere.

"Â£13.5bn needed for pupils to catch up, report saysThe Education Policy Institute also calls for a longer school day and summer activities.England","Pupils have lost months of education due to Covid Some Â£13.5bn is needed to reverse the damage to pupils' education caused by the pandemic, a think tank has said. The Education Policy Institute says the money is needed as pupils have lost up to two months of learning in reading, and up to three months in maths. It is calling on the government to extend the school day and increase funding for poor pupils, as part of a series of measures to help recovery. The government has already given Â£1.7bn for catch-up support in England. This week, the Prime Minister promised to address the learning pupils have missed during the pandemic, and ensure every child is able to fulfil their potential. The report points out this will require significant investment. It says the government will need to put in place an ambitious programme of support to run over a number of years, to help pupils who have lost months of education since schools were first closed in March 2020. The report calculates the total cost to help pupils catch up is Â£13.5bn over three years, which compares with the annual schools budget for England of Â£48bn. Five ways children could make up for lost school time Parents worry about lost learning as schools reopen Lost school time 'may cost pupils Â£40,000' In total, it is estimated the lost learning could result in total lost lifetime earnings of between Â£62bn and Â£420bn, across the eight million school children in England. The researchers argue that extra support should be kept in place for a number of years to address the inequalities in education that existed before the pandemic, and to improve the results of pupils. The Education Policy Institute (EPI) research shows that even before Covid, poorer pupils were already 18 months of learning behind their more affluent classmates by the time they took their GCSEs - with that attainment gap already starting to widen. The impact of school closures meant that by autumn 2020, pupils had lost up to two months in reading overall, and up to three months in maths in primary schools. But following school closures before Christmas and in early 2021, losses are likely to have increased further, the report suggests. To make up for the loss of so much time in school, the report recommends a number of measures that should be part of the recovery plans the government is working on. These include longer school days, so that children can take part in a range of education, sports and social activities. Other suggestions include summer activities to help well-being, more one-to-one and small group tuition, extra funding for pupils from poorer families and mental health support. The recovery should also include support for younger children in the early years, where high-quality education and care can play a decisive role. And much more funding is needed for 16 to 19-year-olds in further education colleges and those studying apprenticeships, the researchers recommend. Natalie Perera, chief executive of the EPI, says if the government is committed to dealing with the harmful and long-term consequences of Covid, then it needs to provide a serious funding boost. ""We are calling on the government to implement a series of effective, evidence-based policies from this September to support children and young people - not only with their learning, but with their well-being and mental health too."" Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government's response has been utterly insufficient. ""The government must prioritise education in the forthcoming Spending Review so that schools can increase the number of properly qualified teachers on staff, and bring down our historically high class-sizes. The solution to Covid cannot be yet more austerity."" A government spokesman highlighted its initial Â£1.7bn investment in a catch-up plan for pupils, adding: ""We are working with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure all pupils have the chance to recover from the impact of the pandemic as quickly and comprehensively as possible - and we have appointed Sir Kevan Collins as education recovery commissioner to advise on this work.""

Israel reinforces Gaza border as conflict rages on,"This video can not be played Israeli ground troops are massing on the border with Gaza after another night of violence Israel has deployed tanks and troops to its border with Gaza, as it mulls whether to launch a ground operation in the territory after days of violence. Conflict raged throughout Thursday as Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel and the Israeli army maintained a barrage of air strikes. More than 100 people have been killed in Gaza and seven have died in Israel. Jewish and Israeli Arab mobs have also been fighting within Israel, prompting the president to warn of civil war. Defence Minister Benny Gantz ordered a ""massive reinforcement"" of security forces to suppress the internal unrest, and more than 400 people were arrested. Jewish and Arab mobs spread violence Conflict cools warming of Arab-Israel ties Who are Hamas? Two infantry units and one armoured unit were positioned near the border with Gaza on Thursday. At least 7,000 army reservists have also been called up. No decision has yet been made on whether to launch a ground operation. The Israeli army is expected to put forward plans for a possible offensive imminently, but it would need to be approved by army chiefs and various levels of government. Israel deployed additional troops to its border with Gaza on Thursday The four-days of violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. It was initially fuelled by weeks of Israeli-Palestinian tension in East Jerusalem which led to clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. This spiralled into an incessant exchange of Palestinian rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes. In other developments on Thursday: Three rockets were fired from Lebanon into the sea off the coast of northern Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. No group said they were responsible, but several militant groups operate in Lebanon, including Hezbollah which fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006 Israel's military said it had hit targets in Gaza that included intelligence buildings and homes and businesses used by militants The Palestinian militant group Hamas, meanwhile, fired further barrages of rockets towards Israel from Gaza, and a spokesman for the group said it had shown ""only a small part"" of its capabilities Further violence broke out between Jewish and Israeli Arab groups in mixed towns and cities within Israel International airlines, including KLM, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, have suspended services to Israel. Incoming flights were also diverted south from Tel Aviv's main airport According to the health ministry in Gaza, at least 103 people have been killed in the four-days of conflict. Officials in the territory, which is controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas, many civilians have died including 27 children. Israel says dozens of those killed in Gaza were militants, and that some of the deaths are from misfired rockets from Gaza. In the Israeli city of Sderot, a young boy was killed when rocket fire from Gaza hit his home, and shrapnel penetrated the shelter he was hiding in. Israel has also called up 10 reserve border patrol companies to help tackle the worst unrest between Arab and Jewish communities for many years. Political leaders have appealed for calm, and President Reuven Rivlin described the outbreaks of rioting in several towns and cities as ""senseless civil war"". There have been widespread calls for de-escalation, including from Israel's ally the US, but little sign of the conflict easing. A senior Hamas official said the group was ready for a ""reciprocal"" ceasefire if the international community pressures Israel to ""suppress military actions"" at the disputed Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. However, Israeli military spokesman Hilda Zilberman said Israel was not seeking a ceasefire at the current time, the Times of Israel reported. The fear among civilians on both sides is taking its toll. Najwa Sheikh-Ahmad, a Gaza mother, said of Wednesday night: ""You cannot sleep... In any moment your home might be your grave. ""You cannot be secure. As a mother it's very terrifying, it's very exhausting for my feelings, for my humanity,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. This video can not be played BBC reporters are on the ground in Gaza, Lod and Jerusalem In Israel, an apartment block was destroyed in the city of Petah Tikva shortly after residents had gone to their bomb shelters. ""We heard an alarm and suddenly there was a bang. Smoke entered the shelter, and the neighbour next to me who was sitting on a chair flew back,"" one resident told the news website Ynet. The fighting between Israel and Hamas was triggered by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger had already been stoked by weeks of rising tension in East Jerusalem, inflamed by a series of confrontations with police since the start of Ramadan in mid-April. What makes Jerusalem so holy? The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained It was further fuelled by the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers and Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel in effect annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of other countries. Palestinians claim the eastern half of Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state of their own. Are you in Israel or Gaza and affected by these events?

"True stories, fake claims about periods and the vaccine","At a Covid vaccine appointment, you will probably be warned of possible side effects - fever, headache, a sore arm for a day or two afterwards. Changes to the menstrual cycle will not appear on the list. But women online around the world have started asking if early, heavy or painful periods might be an unlisted reaction to the jab. Dr Kate Clancy, a medical anthropologist, shared on Twitter herexperience of an unusually heavy period,externalfollowing the Moderna vaccine, and received dozens of similar accounts in response. With former colleague Dr Katharine Lee, shelaunched a survey documenting people's experiences.,external We don't yet know whether the vaccine is causing these changes - it hasn't been studied. It's possible women post-vaccination were more likely to notice or attribute changes, particularly after hearing about others' experiences. But Dr Victoria Male, a reproductive immunologist at Imperial College London, said some post-menopausal women, and people taking hormones which stop their periods, have reported bleeding. So she's inclined to suspect there may be a physical reaction occurring. A number of trans men and post-menopausal women who don't normally have periods got in touch with Drs Clancy and Lee saying they had experienced bleeding after the jab. And, though the link is unproven, there are logical reasons the vaccine could be causing changes to periods - but these changes are not anything to worry about, reproductive specialists say. While painful or unexpected periods can be distressing, they're not a sign of any long-term harm. The womb lining is part of the immune system - in fact there are immune cells in almost every part of the body. Immune cells play a role in building up, maintaining and breaking down the lining of the uterus - which thickens to prepare for a pregnancy, and then sheds in the form of a period if the egg is not fertilised. After vaccination, lots of chemical signals which have the potential to affect immune cells are circulating round the body. This could cause the womb lining to shed, and lead to spotting or earlier periods, Dr Male explained. This doesn't mean there is any link to miscarriages though - during pregnancy different processes maintain the womb lining, including the presence of the placenta - the organ linking the fetus to its mother's blood supply. Dr Male said there is now extensive evidence from women who have had the jab which suggests they are atno higher risk of pregnancy loss,external. Pregnant women should be offered Covid vaccine What we do know, though is that other infections are linked to miscarriage and having Covid during pregnancy has been linked to pre-term delivery, according to Dr Alexandra Alvergne at the University of Oxford. She said there was a plausible link between the vaccine and menstrual changes, as the timing of ovulation (when an egg is released) can be affected by inflammation. This can be the case when people are sick and have a fever, but vaccines also cause an inflammatory response in the body - it's all part of your immune system firing up and starting to produce the antibodies and other cells that fight disease. There is also some evidence from a previous study that people with signs ofinflammation from infection had more painful periods.,external There is evidence from boththe flu,externalandHPV vaccines,externalthat they can affect the menstrual cycle temporarily - but there are no long-term side effects. And there's""masses of evidence"",externaltheydon't affect fertility,,externalDr Male said. The unfounded claims about vaccines and fertility While these changes shouldn't be of concern, Dr Male and others spoken to for this article emphasise the need for studies into the effect of the vaccine on periods, so that people know what to expect. ""There's an issue here about how often women's health is ignored,"" she said. ""Imagine if you didn't know that fever could be a vaccine side effect?"" gynaecologist Dr Jen Gunterwrote on her site The Vajenda.,external ""You might be concerned that something untoward was happening to your body, when all you were experiencing was a typical post-vaccine fever. That is exactly the same with menstrual irregularities."" Equally, for trans men and post-menopausal women, bleeding can be a sign of cancer, so it's important for people to know whether it is also a harmless vaccine side effect, Dr Lee explained. Dr Sue Ward, vice-president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said anyone who notices bleeding that is unusual for them should consider contacting their doctor. And she encouraged people to think about reporting any concerns or possible side effects to theYellow Card scheme,externalto help track them. Meanwhile, the notion of vaccines affecting periods has been picked up by people spreading misinformation on social media. Anti-vaccine and conspiracy theory groups have presented genuine accounts of people's personal experiences - like Dr Clancy's thread - as evidence of vaccines causing damage, or being part of a sterilisation plot by global elites. False claims that women's cycles or even pregnancies could be affected just by being near vaccinated people have gained significant traction on social media in recent weeks. One such video, viewed well over 300,000 times since mid-April, shows a ""holistic reproductive practitioner"" warning users that ""women's periods and their menstrual cycles are being significantly affected, even if they haven't received it [the vaccine] themselves"". Other anti-vaccine advocates and holistic health practitioners, in posts gaining hundreds of thousands of views across platforms, claimed vaccinated people can ""shed"" the virus's spike protein to others. This is physically impossible. Most Covid-19 vaccines work by giving the body instructions to make a tiny fragment of the virus's distinctive spike so it can learn how to fight it off. The spike protein, which cannot reproduce, then disintegrates or is destroyed. The mRNA - the instruction to make the spike protein - is also extremely fragile. That's why those vaccines are so hard to store and transport, because the genetic information falls apart and becomes useless very easily. None of the vaccines allow any part of the virus to replicate, let alone shed - the only thing replicating are your immune cells which produce antibodies to fight off viruses.
