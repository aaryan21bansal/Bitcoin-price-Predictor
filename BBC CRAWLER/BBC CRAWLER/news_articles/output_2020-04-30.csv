Apple boosted by streaming services despite lockdown,"Apple saw growth for the first three months of the year, as falling device sales in China were offset by demand for its streaming services due to the coronavirus lockdown. Sales climbed to $58.3bn (Â£46.2bn), up from $58bn in the same period in 2019 and beating expectations of $54.5bn. Apple boss Tim Cook said the firm saw a ""record for streaming"" and ""phenomenal"" growth in the online store. He added that ""China is headed in the right direction"". Despite the coronavirus lockdown hurting iPhone supply due to Chinese factories closing, and a drop in demand for devices in China - a major market for Apple - during February and March, Mr Cook told investors in an earnings call on Thursday: ""I don't think I can remember a quarter where I've been prouder of Apple."" Apple said iPhone sales for the quarter fell 7.2% to $28.9bn, compared to $31bn in the previous year. However, its wearables, home and accessories division - which produces the Apple Watch and AirPods - rose 22.5% to $6.3bn, while services - such as subscriptions to Apple Music and Apple TV - jumped 16.6% to $13.3bn like-for-like. Although business in China has not fully rebounded, Apple said all of its stores in the country had reopened by mid-March and sales were improving.

Mr Cook said Apple was in a strong position and that its supply chain was ""robust"" and ""back up and running at full-throttle at the end of March"". Tim Cook said the lockdown in China had not damaged Apple's global supply chain ""While we can't say for certain how many chapters are in this book, we can be assured that the ending will be a good one,"" he told investors. Apple said it would not be issuing forecasts for the following quarter, given the ongoing uncertainties of the lockdown, which has seen its sales move online or to curb-side pick-ups. Research firm eMarketer's principal analyst Yoram Wurmser said Apple's performance was ""pretty solid"". ""Growth of 1% in this environment is impressive, particularly given some of the extent of Apple's exposure to the earlier lockdowns in Asia,"" said Mr Wurmser. ""The biggest bright spot for Apple was services, which grew 17% year-over-year. As people spent more time on their phones while locked away at home, they clearly were spending more money in the App Store and on some of the subscription services offered by Apple, including Apple Music and Arcade."" According to Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, the rise in demand for wearables and services is an encouraging one for Apple, given recent lacklustre iPhone sales growth. ""Despite plenty of talk around services, Apple is still very much a hardware business. And even before coronavirus, conditions weren't perfect,"" she said. Ms Lund-Yates added that Apple's decision to price the new iPhone SE at half the cost of some of Apple's most recent models is a good way to convince customers to upgrade during the lockdown.

Amazon investors told to 'take a seat',"Amazon sales surged in the first three months of the year, as the coronavirus lockdown boosted demand for the firm's groceries, online marketplace and cloud computing services. Sales in the quarter jumped 26% year-on-year and the firm said they could rise another 28% in the next. But the demand has strained the internet giant. It said it would spend roughly $4bn (Â£3.2bn) on coronavirus measures through June. Those costs reflect increased worker pay, purchases of masks and other protective gear, expenses related to cleaning and less efficient warehouses, as the firm implements social distancing measures. ""The current crisis is demonstrating the adaptability and durability of Amazon's business as never before, but it's also the hardest time we've ever faced,"" said Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. ""If you're a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat because we're not thinking small,"" he said. ""I'm confident that our long term-oriented shareowners will understand and embrace our approach."" Amazon boss Jeff Bezos adds $24bn to fortune Amazon workers strike over virus protection 'Not smart' memo shows Amazon's union stance Amazon, with its dominance in e-commerce, video streaming and cloud computing services, plus its acquisition of the Whole Foods supermarket chain, is well poised to benefit from the changes to consumer habits forced by the pandemic. The online giant reported gains across the company.  The e-commerce business rose 24%, while sales at its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services - a significant profit driver - jumped 33%. Even its advertising unit fared well. And at Whole Foods, which Amazon purchased in 2017, sales climbed about 8%. That performance presents a sharp contrast to many other companies, which are reeling amid forced closures and plunging consumer spending as economists forecast the world's sharpest slowdown since the 1930s. ""It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone,"" said Forrester Research retail analyst Sucharita Kodali. ""A lot of physical stores around the world were closed and that drives a lot of people online and they are a huge beneficiary of online."" From a customer perspective, Ms Kodali said Amazon's performance has been somewhat lacking, with slower shipping times and many items out of stock. Its brand has also taken a beating, as workers around the world complain of inadequate safety precautions. Amazon's brand has taken a beating amid worker concerns about safety Despite those issues, Ms Kodali said she expected the firm to maintain its advantage over the long term, as rivals suffering losses due to closures are prevented from making investments that would help them compete. ""All signs point toward Amazon continuing to win - not because of anything that Amazon has done, but because of what the others can't do,"" she said. Amazon has scrambled to adjust its operations in reaction to the coronavirus risks. The company has hired 175,000 people in its fulfilment and delivery network and nearly doubled the Whole Foods stores that offer pick-up services. On Thursday, the firm said it had purchased 100 million face masks and 31,000 thermometers, which it is using for daily temperature checks. But the firm's expenses have shot up, with shipping costs alone surging 49% to nearly $11bn. This weighed on the firm's profits, which fell 29% from a year earlier to $2.5bn, lower than analysts had expected. Shares, which have surged more than 30% this year, slumped in after-hours trade. But the firm will be able to benefit long term from shifts happening now, like increased online grocery shopping, said Andrew Lipsman, principal analyst at eMarketer, ""It would be very short-term thinking to just look at what happens in this quarter alone,"" he said. Despite economic weakness, Amazon's sales are relatively ""immunised"" from declines for now, he added. ""If we come out of this in a deep recession and people can get back to normal in terms of bricks and mortar buying, then that's when Amazon like everyone else, will take a hit,"" he said.

Families still wait for free school meal vouchers,"In Wembley, north London, Elsley Primary School has resorted to food parcels and vouchers bought from its own budget The Department for Education says it does not know how many vouchers for free school meals have been delivered to parents over the past month. A scheme to give poor pupils in England vouchers worth Â£15 a week until schools reopen has been beset with problems. Some school staff have had to stay up late into the night to access the online system, while many parents cannot download the vouchers. Edenred, which runs the scheme, said it was aware of problems. About 1.3 million children in England are eligible for free school meals. One school, in Worcestershire, unable to access vouchers for their vulnerable families for the past fortnight, turned to a charity to provide food parcels. 'Emergency food' for families with nothing to eat Further delays to children's food vouchers Pinvin Federation advisory head teacher Judith Tinsley said the system ""has been a nightmare"". ""It's complicated, overloaded, we've got families who've not received a voucher for 10 days, that's two weeks' worth of vouchers,"" she said. ""They have received the codes but then the system has not allowed them in to redeem their codes. ""And then some of our families that have actually managed to get that far have turned up at the supermarket and not been able to use them against their shopping."" In Wembley, north London, Elsley Primary School has resorted to food parcels and vouchers bought from its own budget. Head teacher Raphael Moss has even had to use his own personal credit card. From the outset, he said, the ""unnecessarily complicated"" system had thrown up ""a catalogue of errors, of chaos really, with the system not being able to cope"". In Bodmin, Cornwall, school catering manager Jo Wotton said she had paid for a family's shopping after the mother's voucher code failed at a supermarket till. ""She only had Â£3 in her purse,"" she told BBC News. ""The shopping was Â£16 - it was obvious she had counted her money really carefully, going round the supermarket. ""She had a small child with her. ""I could see she was getting really flustered."" The checkout worker told her the supermarket had seen several vouchers fail the same day. Heather McNeillis, a mother of four children under 10, three of whom are eligible for free school meals, said she had waited two weeks for her first vouchers. ""The money matters - we've been able to eat fresh fruit and vegetables because of it,"" she said. But she has been unable to download her current vouchers, worth Â£45, as the website keeps crashing. Heather McNeillis has four children under 10 ""It suggests you log on at 04:00 as that's a quiet time,"" she said. ""I've had it on my computer all day, trying several different ways.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have devised their own systems for helping their vulnerable pupils, which are more straightforward and have had fewer reported problems than the English system. The Department for Education and Edenred said Â£35m worth of vouchers had been redeemed over the past month. However, neither were able to say what proportion of that total were orders registered for the 15,500 schools signed up to the system, as opposed to vouchers actually delivered in a useable form to families. The Department for Education told BBC News: ""We do not have this data available at this time."" They also said they did not know how many eligible children had been registered with the scheme, though they said the total number of schools on the system represented about 70% of those that qualified for the programme. They did, however, say schools that could not make the Edenred system work would be reimbursed for creating alternative schemes.

Coronavirus: The lives lost in a single day,"Clockwise from top left: Keith, Mary, Rahima, Salina, Brian, Abdul, Bob Each day brings confirmation of hundreds more coronavirus deaths in the UK, each one marking a devastating loss for a family or community somewhere in the country. The UK announced its first coronavirus fatality in early March. By 12 April, which was Easter Sunday, there had been more than 10,000 confirmed hospital deaths. Less than two weeks later, that figure doubled again. The scale of the pandemic means it's easy for the stories of many of the virus' victims not to be heard. On 12 April alone, at least 1,174 people died in England and Wales. These are the stories of seven of those. Robert Savory, or Bob to all who knew him, would normally be organising Easter egg hunts or games like ""pin the carrot on the rabbit"". A doting grandad, Bob was rarely happier than when he was spending quality time with his family. It was a family tradition for everyone to gather at Bob and his wife Jo's house in Gloucestershire at weekends and on special occasions. But the house that would have been full with four children and seven grandchildren was quiet this year, as isolation measures prevented everyone getting together. By then, 63-year-old Bob had been admitted to hospital. He passed away that day. Bob was best known locally for his involvement in rugby club Chosen Hill Former Pupils RFC. The club said he was ""Chosen Hill through and through"", having held positions there from player to chairman. It was in the changing rooms of the club that Bob's shoulder-length mousy brown hair was shaved off some 40 years ago. His shaved head became his trademark look and following his death, friends and family shaved their own heads to raise money for local hospitals in honour of the man they jokingly called Dr Bob. More than 150 miles to the north-west in Cumbria, another sportsman and doting parent also died on Easter Sunday. Brian Arrowsmithspent his career in the lower reaches of the football league, but was a hero to the fans of his hometown club Barrow AFC. He started out playing at right-back in the 1960s, but was a versatile defender and served as captain when the club won promotion from the old Fourth Division. No-one made more appearances in the league for Barrow than Brian, and his impact was celebrated three years ago when the club named a stand after him. He was particularly proud of playing for his local team. He was born and bred on Walney Island, a sliver of land on the southern tip of Barrow-in-Furness that he described as ""God's little acre"". ""He was well known in the town and Brian couldn't walk past anybody without stopping and chatting,"" Jean, his wife of 56 years, said. Brian remained faithful to the football team for his entire life, transitioning from the pitch to the stands. The last match he would ever attend was in early March. Brian's beloved Barrow were defeated 0-2 by Notts County - their first home league loss since September. As usual Brian was offering his support at the sidelines, still hoping his club would win promotion. Weeks later the father-of-two contracted coronavirus and passed away in hospital, almost three months before his 80th birthday. Jean said he was at peace in his final moments. ""He would tell you if he was here that he had a great life."" Not everyone who passed away on Easter Sunday died in a hospital. Mary Andrewwas one of at least 339 people in England and Wales to die in a care home that day. Those deaths were not included in the more than 10,000 announced by the government up to that point. Mary had moved into a Derbyshire nursing home about seven months earlier, after a life defined by her independence. She started a career as a dispensing chemist, but her life's passion was the card game bridge. Mary set up her own bridge club in the 1960s and played tournaments, working her way up to the top of the standings to become a grandmaster, meaning she was one of the few people able to make a living from the game. Her son David, who jokingly refers to himself as a ""bridge orphan"", says the game was an obsession for Mary, who organised tournaments, clubs and holidays. An intellectual and gregarious woman, she was drawn to bridge because it was mentally stimulating and an opportunity for her to socialise. It also led to an unlikely encounter with a Hollywood heartthrob, when Mary played in a tournament with Lawrence of Arabia actor Omar Sharif at a London hotel in the 1960s. Mary shared her love for the game with hundreds of others, teaching people to play even in her 80s. She was also a ""scatterbrain"", says her son - she once took him and their family pet to the local shop and accidentally returned with only the dog. The last time David saw his 92-year-old mother, he was informed that there was a suspected case of coronavirus at the care home, meaning visits would be forbidden and residents kept in their rooms. Within weeks he got a call to say Mary had contracted coronavirus and that she would be put on an ""end of life pathway"". Mary had held on to the ashes of her husband, who died in 2012, so that they could be interred together. In their 63 years together, the couple had rarely spent a night apart. Coronavirus has not only taken the lives of people in care homes like Mary, but also the people looking after them, likeRahima Sidhanee. Caring was in her nature. Her home was full of orchids that she bought cheaply when they were past their best and then nursed back to life. If you invited her round for dinner, she would almost certainly bring some of her own food. The 69-year-old nurse was renowned among friends, family, neighbours and colleagues for her delicious and eclectic cooking. Her samosas stirred excitement at school fairs and efforts by family members to emulate her legendary roti always fell short. The last dinner her son Abu shared with her was just before the lockdown. He and his wife urged Rahima, who suffered from respiratory problems, to retire or at least take a break from work until the situation improved. But Rahima was a compassionate woman. She had been working at the Grennell Lodge nursing and care home in the town of Sutton for the past 20 years and was not prepared to give up when they needed her most. She continued working, and contracted coronavirus three weeks later. Rahima had what her son described as a basic upbringing on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, with no electricity, gas, or running water at home. She moved to the UK in the 1960s as part of a drive for recruitment into the NHS, and worked as a nurse and midwife before moving into the care sector. Her family were Hindu, but Rahima converted to Islam when she married. Despite divorcing some 30 years ago, the mother-of-three remained committed to her Muslim faith for the rest of her life. Described by Abu as quiet and understated, Rahima had suffered from depression in recent years. This meant that she wasn't as socially active as she might once have been, but she always maintained a close relationship with her family, particularly through the regular meals they would share at each other's houses. At this time in the Islamic calendar, Rahima and her loved ones would normally meet for iftar, the evening meal when Muslims break their fast during Ramadan. She died 11 days before the Muslim holy month began. One family friend, for whom she made chilli sauce every year, said Ramadan would never be the same again. Abdul Karim Sheikhalso emigrated to the UK in the 1960s. Born in Jalalpur Jattan in Pakistan's Punjab province as the eldest of 10 children, Abdul was always driven by dreams of a better life. That led him to the UK, where he settled in Newham, in east London. Abdul quickly became a central member of the community, dedicating his life to civic causes. ""It would literally not matter to him whether he was sleeping - you could knock on the door and he would wake up and answer the call. It didn't matter what time of day you came to our door,"" his son Saleem said. ""He always put himself second."" In one of his first acts in the community, Abdul helped found one of Newham's first mosques, serving the religious, social and cultural needs of the area's growing Muslim population. He was particularly dedicated to promoting racial equality and dialogue between different faiths, in what is one of London's most racially and culturally diverse boroughs. With a passion for debate and ideas for change, politics was a natural career choice for Abdul. He became a local councillor in 1990 and ceremonial mayor of Newham in 1998. His work took the boy from Punjab to Buckingham Palace, when his service to the Muslim community was recognised through the British Empire Medal. His son Saleem said his achievements were a source of great personal pride to Abdul. ""Coming from humble backgrounds to [being a mayor] in the UK was amazing,"" he said. Even in his 80s, Abdul continued to work on the causes close to his heart. His sons say he remained healthy and independent, and had recently returned from a trip overseas. But in April, Abdul developed a temperature and breathing difficulties. He was admitted to hospital and passed away within days. His family have been inundated with calls and cards from those whose lives he touched. ""He was loved by everybody. He's being missed by everyone in the community,"" his son Naeem said. While coronavirus has disproportionately affected older people, young people are also among those dying. At 37 years old, with a thriving business and children she adored,Salina Shawhad everything to look forward to. Salina strove to make the most of every moment, and employed her favourite phrase each day in urging loved ones to live their ""best life"". Salina was a ""vibrant character who stood out within a crowd"", her sister Simone said - someone who proved to others it was possible to be happy and successful as a single parent. She ran a child-minding business in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and had also set up an affordable holiday club, which she hoped would bring communities together and allow parents to continue work during the school holidays. To Simone, she was a great listener who could always be relied upon to offer sound advice. Her biggest passion in life was her children. When the coronavirus outbreak hit the UK, she was heavily pregnant with her third daughter. She was admitted to hospital on 1 April, with suspected Covid-19. Other than gestational diabetes - a condition that can occur during pregnancy but usually disappears after giving birth - Salina was a healthy young woman with no other health conditions. Her baby was delivered via Caesarean section on 4 April, but Salina passed away just over a week later. Her daughters are now being looked after by family. Simone said Salina would ""shine within her children forever"". In the nearby Essex town of Romford,Keith Parkerwas also in hospital with coronavirus. With several underlying health conditions, Keith, 53, was among those particularly vulnerable to the pandemic. But he had overcome so much that family members jokingly called him ""the cat with nine lives"". Joanna first met Keith at school, when she had a crush on his best friend. The pair lost touch before their paths crossed again as adults in 2001. They agreed to meet for a meal, and three years later they married on the hottest day of the year. In recent years, Joanna had been his full-time carer. He was known among family and friends for his sense of humour. At a cousin's wedding, he started a flour and squirty cream fight. An old home video shows him putting M&Ms in his nose and blowing them out. The family loved going on holiday to Butlins, where Keith would be the first person to raise his hand to get up on stage. He fell ill with coronavirus in the week leading up to Easter Sunday. Other members of the family had also been unwell, but with relatively mild symptoms. By the Friday morning, Keith's condition had deteriorated - Joanna says his face had turned grey and his cheeks and nose purple from lack of oxygen. After he was taken to hospital, it quickly became clear that he would not survive. Joanna was allowed a short visit to say goodbye. Dressed in a gown, gloves and mask she struggled not to kiss or hug him. All she could do was hold his hand. When Joanna left the room, she stole a final look through a window into the room.

The five tests for ending lockdown,"After Easter, when the government in England announced lockdown was to continue for another three weeks, it set out five tests that had to be met before restrictions were eased. We are now well on the way to lifting them in both England and the rest of the UK. But to what extent are the tests being met? And what is the risk of them lapsing? As soon as images began to emerge in February of hospitals in Italy being overwhelmed with coronavirus cases, making sure the NHS could cope became the first priority. Routine operations were cancelled en masse and large field hospitals - known as Nightingales in England - began to be built. A deal was also struck with the independent sector to use ventilators and beds in private hospitals. Cases peaked in early April - and have been falling ever since. At the peak more than 3,000 Covid admissions were being seen every day. That is now down to under 500 and all the field hospitals are hibernating. Routine work has now been restarted, but the NHS remains on an emergency footing, ready for a second peak. If cases increase again the field hospitals will be re-opened - although with the exception of London, none of these has intensive care facilities. More than 40,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, government data shows. These figure relate to the numbers who die after testing positive for the virus. It does not necessarily mean the virus was the direct cause of their death - although work by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that in the overwhelming majority of cases it is. Deaths peaked in early-to-mid-April - and have been falling ever since. The downward trend is uneven because the recording of deaths slows at weekends, so the figures tend to drop then before rising during the week. But when you look at the seven-day average, the trend is clear. The number of newly diagnosed cases in the UK is hovering around the 1,500 mark on most days at the moment. Ministers say this shows infection rates are at manageable levels. At the peak there were around 6,000 positive tests a day, but this was when testing was restricted to certain groups, so was not an accurate measure of the true level of infections. It is estimated in late March there were around 100,000 new infections a day. But even now with widespread testing available, doubts remain whether the true level of infections is being identified. A surveillance programme in England run by the ONS suggests around 4,000 new infections a day are being seen. Part of the problem is that for some the virus leads to such mild symptoms or none at all, that they do not even realise they are infected. That poses a problem keeping on top of the virus because if there are significant numbers of silent spreaders, new -  more serious  - cases could keep popping up. Currently the UK has capacity to provide more than 200,000 tests a day, if you include tests posted out to individuals and care homes. That is a significant improvement on the picture at the start of March - when only around 10,000 a day were being done. Three mega-labs have been opened to process tests, while around 50 drive-through testing centres, 100 military-run mobile units and a home-testing service have been launched to complement the testing done in hospitals. That means there is plenty of capacity - anyone who needs a test can certainly get one. Staff - in hospitals, care homes and, to a lesser extent, other public services - also need personal protective equipment (PPE), such as visors, gowns and masks, to protect them from the virus. The more cases there are, the more demand for kit there will be. In the first weeks of the pandemic, there were serious concerns about the availability of PPE. Some hospitals and care homes were reporting they were struggling to get hold of the equipment they needed. The army was brought in to distribute supplies. The stockpile the government holds for pandemics has been used up, but international and domestic supply routes have improved. Local authority and NHS bosses both say the pressure on PPE has eased. Without a vaccine, this will be a very tricky one to navigate. As well as widespread testing, England has set up a contact-tracing system, with separate services being run by the other UK nations. The idea is that this service will help contain any local flare-ups by getting the close contacts of infected people to self-isolate, to stop further spread. It is still early days for the programme - with even its bosses warning it is not yet ""gold standard"". Originally the army of contact-tracers being employed was meant to be complemented by a tracing app that would alert people when they have been in close contact with an infected individual. This could be particularly useful if people have been seated close to someone on a train, for example. The app has been piloted on the Isle of Wight, but is currently not ready for national roll-out. The UK has come a long way in the past few months. But there are concerns the infection rates are still too high and tests are not being turned around quickly enough, while doubts remain about whether the contact-tracing system will be good enough. But at the end of the day, the easing of restrictions comes down to political judgement. The lockdown itself is harmful - economically, socially and for health. Ministers are taking into account more than just these five tests in the decision-making process. Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

Coronavirus: The lives lost in a single dayFrom a young mother to a professional card player: seven people lost to Covid-19 on one day.,"Clockwise from top left: Keith, Mary, Rahima, Salina, Brian, Abdul, Bob Each day brings confirmation of hundreds more coronavirus deaths in the UK, each one marking a devastating loss for a family or community somewhere in the country. The UK announced its first coronavirus fatality in early March. By 12 April, which was Easter Sunday, there had been more than 10,000 confirmed hospital deaths. Less than two weeks later, that figure doubled again. The scale of the pandemic means it's easy for the stories of many of the virus' victims not to be heard. On 12 April alone, at least 1,174 people died in England and Wales. These are the stories of seven of those. Robert Savory, or Bob to all who knew him, would normally be organising Easter egg hunts or games like ""pin the carrot on the rabbit"". A doting grandad, Bob was rarely happier than when he was spending quality time with his family. It was a family tradition for everyone to gather at Bob and his wife Jo's house in Gloucestershire at weekends and on special occasions. But the house that would have been full with four children and seven grandchildren was quiet this year, as isolation measures prevented everyone getting together. By then, 63-year-old Bob had been admitted to hospital. He passed away that day. Bob was best known locally for his involvement in rugby club Chosen Hill Former Pupils RFC. The club said he was ""Chosen Hill through and through"", having held positions there from player to chairman. It was in the changing rooms of the club that Bob's shoulder-length mousy brown hair was shaved off some 40 years ago. His shaved head became his trademark look and following his death, friends and family shaved their own heads to raise money for local hospitals in honour of the man they jokingly called Dr Bob. More than 150 miles to the north-west in Cumbria, another sportsman and doting parent also died on Easter Sunday. Brian Arrowsmithspent his career in the lower reaches of the football league, but was a hero to the fans of his hometown club Barrow AFC. He started out playing at right-back in the 1960s, but was a versatile defender and served as captain when the club won promotion from the old Fourth Division. No-one made more appearances in the league for Barrow than Brian, and his impact was celebrated three years ago when the club named a stand after him. He was particularly proud of playing for his local team. He was born and bred on Walney Island, a sliver of land on the southern tip of Barrow-in-Furness that he described as ""God's little acre"". ""He was well known in the town and Brian couldn't walk past anybody without stopping and chatting,"" Jean, his wife of 56 years, said. Brian remained faithful to the football team for his entire life, transitioning from the pitch to the stands. The last match he would ever attend was in early March. Brian's beloved Barrow were defeated 0-2 by Notts County - their first home league loss since September. As usual Brian was offering his support at the sidelines, still hoping his club would win promotion. Weeks later the father-of-two contracted coronavirus and passed away in hospital, almost three months before his 80th birthday. Jean said he was at peace in his final moments. ""He would tell you if he was here that he had a great life."" Not everyone who passed away on Easter Sunday died in a hospital. Mary Andrewwas one of at least 339 people in England and Wales to die in a care home that day. Those deaths were not included in the more than 10,000 announced by the government up to that point. Mary had moved into a Derbyshire nursing home about seven months earlier, after a life defined by her independence. She started a career as a dispensing chemist, but her life's passion was the card game bridge. Mary set up her own bridge club in the 1960s and played tournaments, working her way up to the top of the standings to become a grandmaster, meaning she was one of the few people able to make a living from the game. Her son David, who jokingly refers to himself as a ""bridge orphan"", says the game was an obsession for Mary, who organised tournaments, clubs and holidays. An intellectual and gregarious woman, she was drawn to bridge because it was mentally stimulating and an opportunity for her to socialise. It also led to an unlikely encounter with a Hollywood heartthrob, when Mary played in a tournament with Lawrence of Arabia actor Omar Sharif at a London hotel in the 1960s. Mary shared her love for the game with hundreds of others, teaching people to play even in her 80s. She was also a ""scatterbrain"", says her son - she once took him and their family pet to the local shop and accidentally returned with only the dog. The last time David saw his 92-year-old mother, he was informed that there was a suspected case of coronavirus at the care home, meaning visits would be forbidden and residents kept in their rooms. Within weeks he got a call to say Mary had contracted coronavirus and that she would be put on an ""end of life pathway"". Mary had held on to the ashes of her husband, who died in 2012, so that they could be interred together. In their 63 years together, the couple had rarely spent a night apart. Coronavirus has not only taken the lives of people in care homes like Mary, but also the people looking after them, likeRahima Sidhanee. Caring was in her nature. Her home was full of orchids that she bought cheaply when they were past their best and then nursed back to life. If you invited her round for dinner, she would almost certainly bring some of her own food. The 69-year-old nurse was renowned among friends, family, neighbours and colleagues for her delicious and eclectic cooking. Her samosas stirred excitement at school fairs and efforts by family members to emulate her legendary roti always fell short. The last dinner her son Abu shared with her was just before the lockdown. He and his wife urged Rahima, who suffered from respiratory problems, to retire or at least take a break from work until the situation improved. But Rahima was a compassionate woman. She had been working at the Grennell Lodge nursing and care home in the town of Sutton for the past 20 years and was not prepared to give up when they needed her most. She continued working, and contracted coronavirus three weeks later. Rahima had what her son described as a basic upbringing on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, with no electricity, gas, or running water at home. She moved to the UK in the 1960s as part of a drive for recruitment into the NHS, and worked as a nurse and midwife before moving into the care sector. Her family were Hindu, but Rahima converted to Islam when she married. Despite divorcing some 30 years ago, the mother-of-three remained committed to her Muslim faith for the rest of her life. Described by Abu as quiet and understated, Rahima had suffered from depression in recent years. This meant that she wasn't as socially active as she might once have been, but she always maintained a close relationship with her family, particularly through the regular meals they would share at each other's houses. At this time in the Islamic calendar, Rahima and her loved ones would normally meet for iftar, the evening meal when Muslims break their fast during Ramadan. She died 11 days before the Muslim holy month began. One family friend, for whom she made chilli sauce every year, said Ramadan would never be the same again. Abdul Karim Sheikhalso emigrated to the UK in the 1960s. Born in Jalalpur Jattan in Pakistan's Punjab province as the eldest of 10 children, Abdul was always driven by dreams of a better life. That led him to the UK, where he settled in Newham, in east London. Abdul quickly became a central member of the community, dedicating his life to civic causes. ""It would literally not matter to him whether he was sleeping - you could knock on the door and he would wake up and answer the call. It didn't matter what time of day you came to our door,"" his son Saleem said. ""He always put himself second."" In one of his first acts in the community, Abdul helped found one of Newham's first mosques, serving the religious, social and cultural needs of the area's growing Muslim population. He was particularly dedicated to promoting racial equality and dialogue between different faiths, in what is one of London's most racially and culturally diverse boroughs. With a passion for debate and ideas for change, politics was a natural career choice for Abdul. He became a local councillor in 1990 and ceremonial mayor of Newham in 1998. His work took the boy from Punjab to Buckingham Palace, when his service to the Muslim community was recognised through the British Empire Medal. His son Saleem said his achievements were a source of great personal pride to Abdul. ""Coming from humble backgrounds to [being a mayor] in the UK was amazing,"" he said. Even in his 80s, Abdul continued to work on the causes close to his heart. His sons say he remained healthy and independent, and had recently returned from a trip overseas. But in April, Abdul developed a temperature and breathing difficulties. He was admitted to hospital and passed away within days. His family have been inundated with calls and cards from those whose lives he touched. ""He was loved by everybody. He's being missed by everyone in the community,"" his son Naeem said. While coronavirus has disproportionately affected older people, young people are also among those dying. At 37 years old, with a thriving business and children she adored,Salina Shawhad everything to look forward to. Salina strove to make the most of every moment, and employed her favourite phrase each day in urging loved ones to live their ""best life"". Salina was a ""vibrant character who stood out within a crowd"", her sister Simone said - someone who proved to others it was possible to be happy and successful as a single parent. She ran a child-minding business in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and had also set up an affordable holiday club, which she hoped would bring communities together and allow parents to continue work during the school holidays. To Simone, she was a great listener who could always be relied upon to offer sound advice. Her biggest passion in life was her children. When the coronavirus outbreak hit the UK, she was heavily pregnant with her third daughter. She was admitted to hospital on 1 April, with suspected Covid-19. Other than gestational diabetes - a condition that can occur during pregnancy but usually disappears after giving birth - Salina was a healthy young woman with no other health conditions. Her baby was delivered via Caesarean section on 4 April, but Salina passed away just over a week later. Her daughters are now being looked after by family. Simone said Salina would ""shine within her children forever"". In the nearby Essex town of Romford,Keith Parkerwas also in hospital with coronavirus. With several underlying health conditions, Keith, 53, was among those particularly vulnerable to the pandemic. But he had overcome so much that family members jokingly called him ""the cat with nine lives"". Joanna first met Keith at school, when she had a crush on his best friend. The pair lost touch before their paths crossed again as adults in 2001. They agreed to meet for a meal, and three years later they married on the hottest day of the year. In recent years, Joanna had been his full-time carer. He was known among family and friends for his sense of humour. At a cousin's wedding, he started a flour and squirty cream fight. An old home video shows him putting M&Ms in his nose and blowing them out. The family loved going on holiday to Butlins, where Keith would be the first person to raise his hand to get up on stage. He fell ill with coronavirus in the week leading up to Easter Sunday. Other members of the family had also been unwell, but with relatively mild symptoms. By the Friday morning, Keith's condition had deteriorated - Joanna says his face had turned grey and his cheeks and nose purple from lack of oxygen. After he was taken to hospital, it quickly became clear that he would not survive. Joanna was allowed a short visit to say goodbye. Dressed in a gown, gloves and mask she struggled not to kiss or hug him. All she could do was hold his hand. When Joanna left the room, she stole a final look through a window into the room. ""I knew that was going to be the last time I was going to see him,"" she recalled. ""That would be it."" The family are now grappling with the reality of life without him. His infant granddaughter knew him as Grandad Munchkin. Every night she waves at a picture of him and blows a kiss. Do you have a story to share about your loved one?

Virus vaccine 'could be ready by end of the year'AstraZeneca will make and distribute Oxford University's coronavirus vaccine if it proves effective.,"This video can not be played Oxford 'started developing coronavirus vaccine in January' A coronavirus vaccine could be available for limited use by the end of the year, AstraZeneca's chief executive Pascal Soriot has said. The pharmaceutical giant has agreed to manufacture and distribute a coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford, if the treatment proves effective. Mr Soriot said that ""the need for a vaccine to defeat the virus is urgent"". The first human trial in Europe for a vaccinebegan in Oxford last week. Mr Soriot said the University of Oxford team's track record is very strong, their technology is advanced, and AstraZeneca will know by June or July whether its confidence is well-placed. The firm is partnering with the university's vaccine research team at the Jenner Institute, and data from testing could be available as early as mid-June. The plan is to submit the vaccine for fast track regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of 2020, and for it to be ready for limited use by the end of this year. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Mr Soriot said: ""Our hope is that, by joining forces, we can accelerate the globalisation of a vaccine to combat the virus and protect people from the deadliest pandemic in a generation."" Professor Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the agreement was important in order to ""see whether we can get this vaccine both to work and be manufactured and distributed to both the UK and globally"". He added: ""The challenge is that, once we get an approval by the regulators, we don't have to go back to the beginning and work out how we manufacture it at scale."" First patients injected in UK vaccine trial Why millions will soon be using coronavirus apps Dyson Covid-19 ventilators are 'no longer required' The partnership with AstraZeneca aims to build capacity to produce tens of millions of doses by the end of the year, if the treatment is effective. ""Our manufacturing capacity in the UK for vaccines isn't where it needs to be, and we're going to work together with AstraZeneca to improve that considerably,"" Prof Bell added. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said that the agreement was a ""vital step"" that could ""advance"" any manufacturing process. ""It will also ensure that, should the vaccine being developed by Oxford University's Jenner Institute work, it will be available as early as possible, helping to protect thousands of lives from this disease,"" he added.

Liam BarnesBBC News A police call handler has sketched a piece artwork in Capt Tom's honour. Bob Godber, who works at Nottinghamshire Police's control room in Mansfield, said he'd resumed a teenage interest in art after retiring as a beat sergeant. He said he was inspired to draw Capt Moore, who raised more than Â£31m for the NHS. An artist has presented Captain Tom Moore with a portrait - resulting in a smile ""as warm as his heart"". Darren Baker, from Coventry, created the image in pastel, which shows Capt Tom giving the thumbs up. Mr Baker also presented Capt Tom with a sketch of Keighley, where the former soldier grew up. The artist said: ""He was over the moon - his smile is as warm as his heart."" Gareth LloydBBC Three Counties Radio Capt Tom Moore has been shown the mosaic made up of
thousands of people from across the UK saluting him for his 100th
birthday. BBC Local Radio had been encouraging listeners over the past week to take a photo of themselves and their family saluting the fundraiser. They were uploaded via the BBCMake a Differencewebsite. Tomâs daughter Helen showed the newly-appointed colonel the mosaic made
up of 4,000 photos. Capt Tom was ""overwhelmed"" by the gesture and
stunned at how many people had taken part. People havebeen making knitted tributes to Captain Tom Mooreand coronavirus key workers. A 30cm (12in) model has been made by the Secret Society of Hertford Crafters, in Hertfordshire. It was made to mark the war veteran's 100th birthday and his massive fundraising achievement for the NHS. The group hopes its models will help raise money for local charities during the pandemic.

Watchdog threatens legal action on holiday refunds,"Firms that fail to refund people for holidays and weddings cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak could face legal action by the consumer watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says it will take companies to court if they flout the law. It says four out of five complaints made to its Covid-19 Taskforce are about cancellations and refunds. Issues include holidaymakers being pressured to take vouchers instead of refunds for accommodation. Meanwhile, some wedding venues are refusing to refund any money. The CMA said the holiday vouchers being offered can only be used during a more expensive period, while wedding venues are telling people to claim on their insurance. At the same time, the CMA said some nurseries were asking people to pay very high sums in order to keep a place open for their child. This video can not be played 'We've saved so hard for so long for it, it's beyond belief almost' Consumer law requires that a full refund is offered if a business has cancelled a contract without providing any of the promised goods or services. This includes if no service is provided because of restrictions during the current lockdown or if a consumer cancels because of the restrictions. The CMA warning covers UK holiday accommodation and private events, but not the issue of refunds for cancelled flights - a subject that has caused widespread anger. That issue is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority. Alice Jordan paid more than Â£1,800 for a special family holiday over Easter in a cottage on the Isle of Wight. Then she saw her plans thrown into chaos by the coronavirus outbreak. Alice Jordan faced an extra charge for rebooking at the same time next year But she was also told that if she cancelled she would lose all her money. The agent was not cancelling the booking, but allowing customers to rebook instead, without incurring normal amendment fees. Initially, that was impossible, but the agent would not give her a refund. Later, when the cottage became available again, she discovered it would cost her Â£49 to secure it for the same period next year. Read more on this and other cases 'Our wedding is cancelled but we still have to pay' 'I was asked for Â£430 a month for my shut nursery' What are my rights? Adam French, consumer rights expert at Which?, welcomed the CMA's move. ""We've heard from many distressed people who risk being left out of pocket for significant sums of money as they struggle to get refunds for cancelled weddings, private events, or holiday accommodation,"" he said. ""It's right the CMA investigates sectors that are skirting their legal responsibilities on refunds and cancellations by trying to rely on unfair and unenforceable terms and conditions. ""The regulator must be prepared to step in and take strong action against any businesses found to be breaching consumer law and taking advantage of consumers during these unprecedented times."" The message from the CMA is that you cannot get away with flouting consumer law, even if you are struggling to deal with the impact of the virus. It takes a dim view of businesses which avoid paying refunds and, at the same time, apply for financial help from the government. The aim is to spark a rapid change in behaviour by making a big noise with these warnings, because clamping down can be a lengthy process. The body would have to force offenders to give an undertaking to address concerns, then take them to court if they broke the agreement. Nurseries will be covered by the investigation, but providers say some have been forced to go to parents for financial support. ""Nurseries are being put between a rock and a hard place during this crisis. They are being asked to remain open and run at a loss to provide emergency childcare, while those who can't open still face staffing and other costs which the government's support doesn't fully cover,"" said Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association. ""As a result of a lack of insurance cover, delays to government support schemes and chronic underfunding of childcare places we know that some nurseries have asked parents for contributions to keep their businesses afloat.""

"NHS dashboard to predict protective gear shortagesTech firms will help the NHS spot where kit is running scarce, but privacy campaigners are concerned.","The NHS tool should help identify when hospitals and clinics are about to run out of specific PPE products The NHS has begun feeding health workers' use of personal protective equipment (PPE) into a ""data store"". The system is designed to identify which hospitals and GP surgeries are most at risk of running out of kit and address the problem before it occurs. High-level decision-makers should be able to start seeing the information via a computer dashboard within a fortnight. NHS staff saytheir lives have been put at risk because of PPE shortages. The government has said it is working ""around the clock"" to address the issue. NHS Providers - which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts in England - told the BBC that supplies of gowns and visors remained an unresolved problem. Health chiefsalready use the dashboard system to help make decisions on how,externalto redistribute ventilators, intensive care unit (ICU) beds and other critical equipment. However, privacy campaigners have raised concerns about one of the tech firms involved in the project. The BBC first revealed in March that NHSX- the health service's digital innovation unit - had hired several tech firms to help it make sense of the data it was collecting related to the pandemic. This involved mixing together information from 111 and 999 calls, diagnostic test results, and use of resources across the NHS, social care and partner organisations -a full list has been posted online,external. PPE was not originally included in the initiative. There are hundreds of different products involved - including a variety of aprons, gloves, surgical masks and eye protectors - and they are typically sourced directly by local procurement staff. But after the British Medical Association warned earlier this month that supplies of some equipment were at ""dangerously low levels"" in London and Yorkshire, andhundreds of care home providers also sounded the alarm,  efforts are being made to help track relevant data centrally. The effort coincides with other changes to the wider scheme. Until now, its focus has been to deliver ""situational awareness"" - showing the spread of Covid-19 and its impact on the NHS in ""real-time"". The next phase involves providing forecasts as to what happens next. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and other expert groups already do this on a national basis. But the tech companies involved are working with Oxford University's Big Data Institute (BDI) to provide forecasts at the level of hospital trusts, community hospitals and GP surgeries. Although the BDI is also involved with NHSX's coronavirus contact-tracing app, the two efforts are otherwise independent of each other, and there are no plans to mix information gathered via the app with that of the data store. There is also an ambition to make the dashboards available to regional managers in the future. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are all involved in the data store project. But two smaller companies are at its core. The Royal Mint is among organisations that have repurposed production to manufacture protective gear Faculty - a London-based machine learning specialist - has developed the dashboards, models and simulations. And Palantir - a California-based company that helps clients integrate and ""clean"" various sources of data, so that new connections and other insights can be discovered - is providing its Foundry software and staff to help NHSX pull all the information together. It is not charging for the work. The involvement of the latter has proved to be a concern to privacy campaigners. Palantir has been used by US immigration officials to track down undocumented workers, causing controversy among civil liberties organisations. It also has a reputation for secrecy. On Wednesday, Privacy International, Big Brother Watch, Foxglove, MedConfidential and the Open Rights Group sent a joint letter to the company asking it to disclosemore details about its involvement with the coronavirus data store,external. NHSX has said that all the data involved remains under its control - and that Palantir cannot independently store, access or pass on any of the records. But the privacy groups say they still want to know if the company will retain any ""insights gleaned"". ""It would be misleading and cynical for Palantir to offer services to the NHS without being fully transparent about how the company may benefit,"" said Privacy International.

Virus vaccine 'could be ready by end of the year',"This video can not be played Oxford 'started developing coronavirus vaccine in January' A coronavirus vaccine could be available for limited use by the end of the year, AstraZeneca's chief executive Pascal Soriot has said. The pharmaceutical giant has agreed to manufacture and distribute a coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford, if the treatment proves effective. Mr Soriot said that ""the need for a vaccine to defeat the virus is urgent"". The first human trial in Europe for a vaccinebegan in Oxford last week. Mr Soriot said the University of Oxford team's track record is very strong, their technology is advanced, and AstraZeneca will know by June or July whether its confidence is well-placed. The firm is partnering with the university's vaccine research team at the Jenner Institute, and data from testing could be available as early as mid-June. The plan is to submit the vaccine for fast track regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of 2020, and for it to be ready for limited use by the end of this year.

Why millions will soon be using coronavirus apps,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

Eurozone economy shrinks at record rate,"A pharmacist in France puts up a sign reading 'protective facemasks are available' The eurozone economy shrank at the sharpest pace on record in the first quarter as the Covid-19 pandemic forced countries into lockdown. A first estimate of GDP between January and March showed a contraction of 3.8%, worse than during the financial crisis. Separate figures revealed a steep fall in economic activity in France and Spain over the same period. In Germany, unemployment has increased though it remains relatively low compared with other nations. On Wednesday, the US revealed that its economy had suffered its most severe contraction for more than a decade, after GDP shrank at an annual rate of 4.8% in the first quarter of the year. However, this ""annualised"" rate implies that the US economy actually contracted by about 1.2% in the three-month period, a less severe contraction than in the eurozone. On Thursday, figures from the US Department of Labor showed that 3.8 million more Americans filed claims for unemployment benefits last week. That is the lowest weekly rise for a month, but still very high, bringing jobs lost during the pandemic to about 30 million. Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics called the European news a blizzard of depressing economic data that ""confirms that the eurozone economy was in free-fall"". In the case of France, the 5.8% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) was the largest the quarterly series has recorded since it began in 1949. Two other large economies have published first estimates: Spain saw a contraction of 5.1% while Italy's economy shrank by 4.7%. The figure for the eurozone as a whole was more moderate, but is still by any standards severe especially for a contraction over just three months. So far most individual European countries have not published national estimates. That applies to the largest of them, Germany. But new figures for the German labour market are beginning to show the impact of the pandemic, with the number of people out of work rising by 373,000 in April. However, the full impact is damped by the country's system of financial help to people put onto shorter working hours, known as Kurzarbeit. Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the news on the Geman labour market was ""bad, but it would have been disastrous without Kurzarbeit"". European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said that a sharp downturn in eurozone economic activity in April ""suggests that the impact [of the pandemic] is likely to be even more severe in the second quarter."" She warned that eurozone economic growth could fall between 5% and 12% this year, ""depending crucially on the duration of the containment measures and the success of policies to mitigate the economic consequences for businesses and workers"". Ms Lagarde added that the ECB was fully prepared to increaseemergency support measuresto ease the burden of the pandemic, to ""as much as necessary and for as long as needed"".

France offers subsidy to tempt lockdown cyclists,"Elisabeth Borne, Minister for Ecological Transition, called bicycles ""a real transport solution"" France is encouraging people to cycle to keep pollution levels low once lockdown restrictions end. Under the â¬20 million (Â£17m; $21.7m) scheme, everyone will be eligible for bike repairs of up to â¬50 at registered mechanics. The funding will also help pay for cycle training and temporary parking spaces. Nations worldwide are grappling with ways to change urban transport in light of the coronavirus. Emergency planners in London fearthe Tube will not be able to cope once lockdown is lifted. A report seen by the BBC says that social distancing rules would reduce capacity to 15% of normal levels, and 12% on buses. Moreover, pollution levels have dropped worldwide, and many are seeking to keep those levels low. Lockdowns 'causing record fall in CO2 emissions' How the virus cleared the worldâs most polluted skies Air pollution linked to raised Covid-19 death risk On Thursday the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast a 6% drop in energy demand for the year - it said this would lead to a drop in carbon dioxide emissions of 8%, six times larger than the biggest fall in 2009 which followed the financial crash. Elisabeth Borne, Minister for Ecological Transition, said the move was aimed at reducing driving when commuting or for short journeys to keep air pollution levels down once restrictions are lifted. In normal times, 60% of journeys made in France are less than 5 kilometres [3 miles] - making bicycles ""a real transport solution"", she said. France has announced plans to slowly wind down its restrictions from 11 May. Latest figures on Wednesday showed a recorded death toll of 24,087, with close to 130,000 confirmed cases. This video can not be played French President Emmanuel Macron: 'We are at war' Ms Borne announced the scheme in association with the Federation of Bicycle Users (FUB) on Wednesday. They will register a network of more than 3,000 repairmen on the FUB website who will agree to fix any bike for up to â¬50, such as changing tyres or old chains. French state blamed in key air pollution case Polluted Paris steps up war on diesel Citizens will not receive a printed cheque, but will go to these registered mechanics who will then be reimbursed by the state. People will have to pay any additional costs out of their own pockets. The rest of the funding will go towards temporary bike racks and cycling training and refresher courses. Local governments are also being encouraged to lay down bike lanes across the country. Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK A locked down world in maps and charts The French capital Paris is barring private cars from one of its major central roads, the Rue de Rivoli, which will instead have separate lanes for bicycles and for buses, taxis, emergency vehicles and certain deliveries. The measures will remain in place for the duration of the pandemic but should they prove successful they will be made permanent, Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Thursday. Paris is also aiming to create cycle routes along the paths of its three busiest Metro lines, she said. The aim was to prevent the city being ""swamped by cars, synonymous with pollution"", she was quoted by Le Monde newspaper as saying. Milan has begun reallocating road space away from cars The Belgian capital Brussels on Wednesday announced the creation of 40km of additional cycle paths to ensure fewer people use public transport as restrictions are relaxed. And the Italian city of Milan, which is in the worst-affected region of Lombardy, has begun reallocating space on some of its major roads for walking and cycling. It is widening pavements, adding 35km of cycle lanes and encouraging the use of scooters as a way of pushing alternatives to car use. The Milan subway's capacity is to be reduced by up to 30% to ensure all passengers are able to stay a metre away from each other. And in the German capital Berlin, the authorities have temporarily widened some cycle lanes.

Sainsburyâs boss warns queues set to stay in place,"Sainsbury's says that customers are likely to see disruption to their shopping until September amid the coronavirus pandemic. Its boss Mike Coupe told the BBC that socially-distanced queues were likely to remain ""for the foreseeable future"". In its full-year results statement,external, the supermarket said it saw huge demand for groceries in March as concerned shoppers stockpiled goods. Sales growth peaked at 48% in the week to 21 March, but then subsided. Mr Coupe told the BBC's Today programme that the peak of sales ""was crazy"". ""We sold more, for five days running, than we would normally sell in our busiest day at Christmas, that's why you saw the gaps on the shelf."" Mr Coupe added that amid the pandemic, the retailer - which is the UK's second-largest supermarket chain - had seen ""a very marked change in the way our customers are shopping"". ""They're coming less frequently and are buying about twice as much when they do come. Very much a return to the weekly shop, but beyond it."" Wetherspoons plans to open pubs in June The weekly shop is back in fashion, says Tesco boss In the seven weeks to 25 April, the firm's Argos business also saw an uptick in sales of 7%. It said this was down to customers equipping themselves for home working. Stand-alone Argos stores have been closed since 24 March after the government instructed ""non-essential"" retailers to shut temporarily, although Argos concessions with Sainsbury's stores remain open. In common with other retailers, Sainsbury's has brought in a number of measures in an attempt to keep customers and staff safe during the pandemic, as well as cope with the surge in demand for food. They included installing screens at tills, increasing cleaning and recruiting thousands of temporary staff to work in-store, as drivers and in warehouses. Sainsbury's said that those additional costs, as well as weaker demand for clothing and fuel, could result in a Â£500m hit to its profits. However, the supermarket has also benefitted from a business rates holiday worth about Â£450m offered to shops in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It also expects some of the additional coronavirus costs will be offset by higher grocery sales. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said that lockdown had ""pushed people down the grocery aisles, and away from the not-so-crucial areas of stores"", such as clothing. ""It's a mistake to assume coronavirus is an out-and-out tailwind for supermarkets. Feeding a panicked, locked-down nation comes with extraordinary costs and changes to spending habits,"" she said. Sainsbury's comments came as it reported a 2% fall in underlying pre-tax profits to Â£586m for the year to 7 March. The supermarket said that it would defer any decisions on paying dividends to shareholders until later in the year. ""At this very early point in our financial year it is impossible to predict the full nature, extent and duration of the financial impact of Covid-19 over the course of the year,"" it said.

Pharma giant teams up with university on vaccineAstraZeneca will make and distribute Oxford University's Covid-19 vaccine if it proves effective.,"This video can not be played Oxford 'started developing coronavirus vaccine in January' A coronavirus vaccine could be available for limited use by the end of the year, AstraZeneca's chief executive Pascal Soriot has said. The pharmaceutical giant has agreed to manufacture and distribute a coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford, if the treatment proves effective. Mr Soriot said that ""the need for a vaccine to defeat the virus is urgent"". The first human trial in Europe for a vaccinebegan in Oxford last week. Mr Soriot said the University of Oxford team's track record is very strong, their technology is advanced, and AstraZeneca will know by June or July whether its confidence is well-placed. The firm is partnering with the university's vaccine research team at the Jenner Institute, and data from testing could be available as early as mid-June. The plan is to submit the vaccine for fast track regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of 2020, and for it to be ready for limited use by the end of this year. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Mr Soriot said: ""Our hope is that, by joining forces, we can accelerate the globalisation of a vaccine to combat the virus and protect people from the deadliest pandemic in a generation."" Professor Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the agreement was important in order to ""see whether we can get this vaccine both to work and be manufactured and distributed to both the UK and globally"". He added: ""The challenge is that, once we get an approval by the regulators, we don't have to go back to the beginning and work out how we manufacture it at scale."" First patients injected in UK vaccine trial Why millions will soon be using coronavirus apps Dyson Covid-19 ventilators are 'no longer required' The partnership with AstraZeneca aims to build capacity to produce tens of millions of doses by the end of the year, if the treatment is effective. ""Our manufacturing capacity in the UK for vaccines isn't where it needs to be, and we're going to work together with AstraZeneca to improve that considerably,"" Prof Bell added. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said that the agreement was a ""vital step"" that could ""advance"" any manufacturing process. ""It will also ensure that, should the vaccine being developed by Oxford University's Jenner Institute work, it will be available as early as possible, helping to protect thousands of lives from this disease,"" he added. AstraZeneca's share price rose by nearly 3% off the back of the announcement. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

France offers subsidy to tempt lockdown cyclistsThe country's minister for ecological transition says the move aims to keep pollution levels low.Europe,"Elisabeth Borne, Minister for Ecological Transition, called bicycles ""a real transport solution"" France is encouraging people to cycle to keep pollution levels low once lockdown restrictions end. Under the â¬20 million (Â£17m; $21.7m) scheme, everyone will be eligible for bike repairs of up to â¬50 at registered mechanics. The funding will also help pay for cycle training and temporary parking spaces. Nations worldwide are grappling with ways to change urban transport in light of the coronavirus. Emergency planners in London fearthe Tube will not be able to cope once lockdown is lifted. A report seen by the BBC says that social distancing rules would reduce capacity to 15% of normal levels, and 12% on buses. Moreover, pollution levels have dropped worldwide, and many are seeking to keep those levels low. Lockdowns 'causing record fall in CO2 emissions' How the virus cleared the worldâs most polluted skies Air pollution linked to raised Covid-19 death risk On Thursday the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast a 6% drop in energy demand for the year - it said this would lead to a drop in carbon dioxide emissions of 8%, six times larger than the biggest fall in 2009 which followed the financial crash. Elisabeth Borne, Minister for Ecological Transition, said the move was aimed at reducing driving when commuting or for short journeys to keep air pollution levels down once restrictions are lifted. In normal times, 60% of journeys made in France are less than 5 kilometres [3 miles] - making bicycles ""a real transport solution"", she said. France has announced plans to slowly wind down its restrictions from 11 May. Latest figures on Wednesday showed a recorded death toll of 24,087, with close to 130,000 confirmed cases. This video can not be played French President Emmanuel Macron: 'We are at war' Ms Borne announced the scheme in association with the Federation of Bicycle Users (FUB) on Wednesday. They will register a network of more than 3,000 repairmen on the FUB website who will agree to fix any bike for up to â¬50, such as changing tyres or old chains. French state blamed in key air pollution case Polluted Paris steps up war on diesel Citizens will not receive a printed cheque, but will go to these registered mechanics who will then be reimbursed by the state. People will have to pay any additional costs out of their own pockets. The rest of the funding will go towards temporary bike racks and cycling training and refresher courses. Local governments are also being encouraged to lay down bike lanes across the country. Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK A locked down world in maps and charts The French capital Paris is barring private cars from one of its major central roads, the Rue de Rivoli, which will instead have separate lanes for bicycles and for buses, taxis, emergency vehicles and certain deliveries. The measures will remain in place for the duration of the pandemic but should they prove successful they will be made permanent, Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Thursday. Paris is also aiming to create cycle routes along the paths of its three busiest Metro lines, she said. The aim was to prevent the city being ""swamped by cars, synonymous with pollution"", she was quoted by Le Monde newspaper as saying. Milan has begun reallocating road space away from cars The Belgian capital Brussels on Wednesday announced the creation of 40km of additional cycle paths to ensure fewer people use public transport as restrictions are relaxed. And the Italian city of Milan, which is in the worst-affected region of Lombardy, has begun reallocating space on some of its major roads for walking and cycling. It is widening pavements, adding 35km of cycle lanes and encouraging the use of scooters as a way of pushing alternatives to car use. The Milan subway's capacity is to be reduced by up to 30% to ensure all passengers are able to stay a metre away from each other. And in the German capital Berlin, the authorities have temporarily widened some cycle lanes.

Eurozone economy shrinks at record rateSingle currency nations see a sharp fall in GDP during the first quarter of the year.Business,"A pharmacist in France puts up a sign reading 'protective facemasks are available' The eurozone economy shrank at the sharpest pace on record in the first quarter as the Covid-19 pandemic forced countries into lockdown. A first estimate of GDP between January and March showed a contraction of 3.8%, worse than during the financial crisis. Separate figures revealed a steep fall in economic activity in France and Spain over the same period. In Germany, unemployment has increased though it remains relatively low compared with other nations. On Wednesday, the US revealed that its economy had suffered its most severe contraction for more than a decade, after GDP shrank at an annual rate of 4.8% in the first quarter of the year. However, this ""annualised"" rate implies that the US economy actually contracted by about 1.2% in the three-month period, a less severe contraction than in the eurozone. On Thursday, figures from the US Department of Labor showed that 3.8 million more Americans filed claims for unemployment benefits last week. That is the lowest weekly rise for a month, but still very high, bringing jobs lost during the pandemic to about 30 million. Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics called the European news a blizzard of depressing economic data that ""confirms that the eurozone economy was in free-fall"". In the case of France, the 5.8% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) was the largest the quarterly series has recorded since it began in 1949. Two other large economies have published first estimates: Spain saw a contraction of 5.1% while Italy's economy shrank by 4.7%. The figure for the eurozone as a whole was more moderate, but is still by any standards severe especially for a contraction over just three months. So far most individual European countries have not published national estimates. That applies to the largest of them, Germany. But new figures for the German labour market are beginning to show the impact of the pandemic, with the number of people out of work rising by 373,000 in April. However, the full impact is damped by the country's system of financial help to people put onto shorter working hours, known as Kurzarbeit. Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the news on the Geman labour market was ""bad, but it would have been disastrous without Kurzarbeit"". European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said that a sharp downturn in eurozone economic activity in April ""suggests that the impact [of the pandemic] is likely to be even more severe in the second quarter."" She warned that eurozone economic growth could fall between 5% and 12% this year, ""depending crucially on the duration of the containment measures and the success of policies to mitigate the economic consequences for businesses and workers"". Ms Lagarde added that the ECB was fully prepared to increaseemergency support measuresto ease the burden of the pandemic, to ""as much as necessary and for as long as needed"".

Watchdog threatens legal action on holiday refundsFirms refusing refunds for cancelled holiday accommodation and weddings are under investigation.Business,"Firms that fail to refund people for holidays and weddings cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak could face legal action by the consumer watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says it will take companies to court if they flout the law. It says four out of five complaints made to its Covid-19 Taskforce are about cancellations and refunds. Issues include holidaymakers being pressured to take vouchers instead of refunds for accommodation. Meanwhile, some wedding venues are refusing to refund any money. The CMA said the holiday vouchers being offered can only be used during a more expensive period, while wedding venues are telling people to claim on their insurance. At the same time, the CMA said some nurseries were asking people to pay very high sums in order to keep a place open for their child. This video can not be played 'We've saved so hard for so long for it, it's beyond belief almost' Consumer law requires that a full refund is offered if a business has cancelled a contract without providing any of the promised goods or services. This includes if no service is provided because of restrictions during the current lockdown or if a consumer cancels because of the restrictions. The CMA warning covers UK holiday accommodation and private events, but not the issue of refunds for cancelled flights - a subject that has caused widespread anger. That issue is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority. Alice Jordan paid more than Â£1,800 for a special family holiday over Easter in a cottage on the Isle of Wight. Then she saw her plans thrown into chaos by the coronavirus outbreak. Alice Jordan faced an extra charge for rebooking at the same time next year But she was also told that if she cancelled she would lose all her money. The agent was not cancelling the booking, but allowing customers to rebook instead, without incurring normal amendment fees. Initially, that was impossible, but the agent would not give her a refund. Later, when the cottage became available again, she discovered it would cost her Â£49 to secure it for the same period next year. Read more on this and other cases 'Our wedding is cancelled but we still have to pay' 'I was asked for Â£430 a month for my shut nursery' What are my rights? Adam French, consumer rights expert at Which?, welcomed the CMA's move. ""We've heard from many distressed people who risk being left out of pocket for significant sums of money as they struggle to get refunds for cancelled weddings, private events, or holiday accommodation,"" he said. ""It's right the CMA investigates sectors that are skirting their legal responsibilities on refunds and cancellations by trying to rely on unfair and unenforceable terms and conditions. ""The regulator must be prepared to step in and take strong action against any businesses found to be breaching consumer law and taking advantage of consumers during these unprecedented times."" The message from the CMA is that you cannot get away with flouting consumer law, even if you are struggling to deal with the impact of the virus. It takes a dim view of businesses which avoid paying refunds and, at the same time, apply for financial help from the government. The aim is to spark a rapid change in behaviour by making a big noise with these warnings, because clamping down can be a lengthy process. The body would have to force offenders to give an undertaking to address concerns, then take them to court if they broke the agreement. Nurseries will be covered by the investigation, but providers say some have been forced to go to parents for financial support. ""Nurseries are being put between a rock and a hard place during this crisis. They are being asked to remain open and run at a loss to provide emergency childcare, while those who can't open still face staffing and other costs which the government's support doesn't fully cover,"" said Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association. ""As a result of a lack of insurance cover, delays to government support schemes and chronic underfunding of childcare places we know that some nurseries have asked parents for contributions to keep their businesses afloat.""

Coronavirus could see huge changes to jury trials,"Blue-sky thinking is underway to allow jury trials to restart safely Coronavirus could prompt the biggest changes to jury trials since World War Two, the head of judiciary in England and Wales has told the BBC. Social distancing could mean fewer jurors at trials and sittings moved to bigger buildings such as university lecture theatres, said Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett. Jury trials across the UK were halted in March due to the virus. ""Blue-sky thinking"" on restarting them safely is ongoing, said Lord Burnett. If social distancing lasts for months, Lord Burnett warned: ""It is going to be necessary to look at more radical measures to enable jury trials to continue. ""I would support a move to reduce the number of jurors. That was done during the Second World War. ""Plainly, it would be easier to ensure a safe trial for everybody, with social distancing and other precautions."" The Lord Chief Justice says measures not seen since World War Two should be considered Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said he was ""extremely interested"" in work on practical solutions, like reducing the number of jurors and virtual trials, as these could deliver ""more immediate results"" in getting jury trials going again. He said he was ""considering"" legislation ""to, in effect, create a wartime situation with regard to juries"" but added that was ""going to take time"". ""I need to see measures that can be put in place that could allow juries to come back in to court as early as next month,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Jury trials involve at least 20 people, but often considerably more, in one relatively confined courtroom. Currently, 12 jurors sit in trials in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and 15 in Scotland. During World War Two, juror numbers were reduced to seven, except in cases of treason or murder. So, any reduction would be the first in peacetime. A working group chaired by Mr Justice Edis and including the Law Society, Bar Council and Criminal Bar Association, is meeting weekly to consider how and when jury trials might resume safely in England and Wales. Traditional court rooms, like Old Bailey Court No 1, could be too small for effective social distancing Lord Burnett believes any resumption soon would require identifying ""very large courtrooms where it's possible to envisage participants maintaining social distancing. ""It involves having another courtroom available via videolink in which the press and public can view what's going on. And it involves having a large room to which the jury can retire and maintain social distancing."" However, many existing court buildings are unsuitable and, asked about using venues like university lecture halls instead, he said the use of large venues is being considered. ""Given the limited number of trials that we would be able to conduct in our crown courts, given that every trial will in fact require more than one court for all sorts of reasons, then inevitably rather more profound thinking will be needed to avoid building up an unimaginable backlog,"" Lord Burnett added. Under lockdown, cases are backing up in a system already beset by delays caused in part by the government reducing Crown Court sitting days in England and Wales. By the end of 2019 the number ofoutstanding cases had reached 37,434, official figures show.,external Delays prolong anxiety for victims, pose a risk to justice as witnesses' memories fade, and keep those on remand in prison for longer. Lord Burnett wants all courts fully used once it is safe to do so, to ""get through the backlog of jury trials"". ""I've no reason to suppose that that is going to be a controversial proposal, and I hope it will become common ground across the political spectrum, that resources should be made available to enable that to happen."" Geoffrey Robertson QC favours allowing defendants to elect to be tried by a judge alone to help ease the current crisis. While the human rights groupJustice believes safe social distancing is impossible and advocates a technological solution.,external It has run a series of ""virtual"" mock jury trials to test viability and safety. Academic evaluation has so far been positive, with Justice Secretary Robert Buckland QC, telling the Joint Committee on Human Rights that the work merited ""careful scrutiny"". Nothing, it seems, on the future of jury trials, is entirely off the table. Justice has conducted mock virtual trials to test their viability Whatever mechanisms are found to get the criminal justice system back on its feet, lawyers will be needed to service cases but many fear they will have gone out of business. Thelatest Bar Council survey,externalfound 31% of criminal barristers may not be in practice in chambers within three months; 87% will not last six months and 88% will not last a year. And things are no better for solicitors' firms. ""I've had to furlough 18 staff,"" said Ian Kelcey, a partner in Kelcey & Hall Solicitors in Bristol, and co-chair of Law Society Criminal Law Committee. ""The downturn in work has been phenomenal. Our cashflow is reduced by 70-80%. We get a bit back through furlough but still have to pay costs including rent, utility bills, professional indemnity insurance and IT contracts."" He believes most firms have a maximum of three months before they face very serious financial trouble. ""There is a real risk that in the long term 70-80% of criminal legal aid firms will disappear, leaving vast areas of the country with no legal aid criminal defence solicitors available to represent people in either police stations or in court."" The legal profession has won limited financial help from government, but is seeking far more significant support. Responding to Lord Burnett's comments on the future of jury trials, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said officials were ""working closely with the judiciary and others to resume them as soon as possible"".

Coronavirus: The lives lost in a single dayCoronavirus: Morning updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this morning.UK,"Clockwise from top left: Keith, Mary, Rahima, Salina, Brian, Abdul, Bob Each day brings confirmation of hundreds more coronavirus deaths in the UK, each one marking a devastating loss for a family or community somewhere in the country. The UK announced its first coronavirus fatality in early March. By 12 April, which was Easter Sunday, there had been more than 10,000 confirmed hospital deaths. Less than two weeks later, that figure doubled again. The scale of the pandemic means it's easy for the stories of many of the virus' victims not to be heard. On 12 April alone, at least 1,174 people died in England and Wales. These are the stories of seven of those. Robert Savory, or Bob to all who knew him, would normally be organising Easter egg hunts or games like ""pin the carrot on the rabbit"". A doting grandad, Bob was rarely happier than when he was spending quality time with his family. It was a family tradition for everyone to gather at Bob and his wife Jo's house in Gloucestershire at weekends and on special occasions. But the house that would have been full with four children and seven grandchildren was quiet this year, as isolation measures prevented everyone getting together. By then, 63-year-old Bob had been admitted to hospital. He passed away that day. Bob was best known locally for his involvement in rugby club Chosen Hill Former Pupils RFC. The club said he was ""Chosen Hill through and through"", having held positions there from player to chairman. It was in the changing rooms of the club that Bob's shoulder-length mousy brown hair was shaved off some 40 years ago. His shaved head became his trademark look and following his death, friends and family shaved their own heads to raise money for local hospitals in honour of the man they jokingly called Dr Bob. More than 150 miles to the north-west in Cumbria, another sportsman and doting parent also died on Easter Sunday. Brian Arrowsmithspent his career in the lower reaches of the football league, but was a hero to the fans of his hometown club Barrow AFC. He started out playing at right-back in the 1960s, but was a versatile defender and served as captain when the club won promotion from the old Fourth Division. No-one made more appearances in the league for Barrow than Brian, and his impact was celebrated three years ago when the club named a stand after him. He was particularly proud of playing for his local team. He was born and bred on Walney Island, a sliver of land on the southern tip of Barrow-in-Furness that he described as ""God's little acre"". ""He was well known in the town and Brian couldn't walk past anybody without stopping and chatting,"" Jean, his wife of 56 years, said. Brian remained faithful to the football team for his entire life, transitioning from the pitch to the stands. The last match he would ever attend was in early March. Brian's beloved Barrow were defeated 0-2 by Notts County - their first home league loss since September. As usual Brian was offering his support at the sidelines, still hoping his club would win promotion. Weeks later the father-of-two contracted coronavirus and passed away in hospital, almost three months before his 80th birthday. Jean said he was at peace in his final moments. ""He would tell you if he was here that he had a great life."" Not everyone who passed away on Easter Sunday died in a hospital. Mary Andrewwas one of at least 339 people in England and Wales to die in a care home that day. Those deaths were not included in the more than 10,000 announced by the government up to that point. Mary had moved into a Derbyshire nursing home about seven months earlier, after a life defined by her independence. She started a career as a dispensing chemist, but her life's passion was the card game bridge. Mary set up her own bridge club in the 1960s and played tournaments, working her way up to the top of the standings to become a grandmaster, meaning she was one of the few people able to make a living from the game. Her son David, who jokingly refers to himself as a ""bridge orphan"", says the game was an obsession for Mary, who organised tournaments, clubs and holidays. An intellectual and gregarious woman, she was drawn to bridge because it was mentally stimulating and an opportunity for her to socialise. It also led to an unlikely encounter with a Hollywood heartthrob, when Mary played in a tournament with Lawrence of Arabia actor Omar Sharif at a London hotel in the 1960s. Mary shared her love for the game with hundreds of others, teaching people to play even in her 80s. She was also a ""scatterbrain"", says her son - she once took him and their family pet to the local shop and accidentally returned with only the dog. The last time David saw his 92-year-old mother, he was informed that there was a suspected case of coronavirus at the care home, meaning visits would be forbidden and residents kept in their rooms. Within weeks he got a call to say Mary had contracted coronavirus and that she would be put on an ""end of life pathway"". Mary had held on to the ashes of her husband, who died in 2012, so that they could be interred together. In their 63 years together, the couple had rarely spent a night apart. Coronavirus has not only taken the lives of people in care homes like Mary, but also the people looking after them, likeRahima Sidhanee. Caring was in her nature. Her home was full of orchids that she bought cheaply when they were past their best and then nursed back to life. If you invited her round for dinner, she would almost certainly bring some of her own food. The 69-year-old nurse was renowned among friends, family, neighbours and colleagues for her delicious and eclectic cooking. Her samosas stirred excitement at school fairs and efforts by family members to emulate her legendary roti always fell short. The last dinner her son Abu shared with her was just before the lockdown. He and his wife urged Rahima, who suffered from respiratory problems, to retire or at least take a break from work until the situation improved. But Rahima was a compassionate woman. She had been working at the Grennell Lodge nursing and care home in the town of Sutton for the past 20 years and was not prepared to give up when they needed her most. She continued working, and contracted coronavirus three weeks later. Rahima had what her son described as a basic upbringing on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, with no electricity, gas, or running water at home. She moved to the UK in the 1960s as part of a drive for recruitment into the NHS, and worked as a nurse and midwife before moving into the care sector. Her family were Hindu, but Rahima converted to Islam when she married. Despite divorcing some 30 years ago, the mother-of-three remained committed to her Muslim faith for the rest of her life. Described by Abu as quiet and understated, Rahima had suffered from depression in recent years. This meant that she wasn't as socially active as she might once have been, but she always maintained a close relationship with her family, particularly through the regular meals they would share at each other's houses. At this time in the Islamic calendar, Rahima and her loved ones would normally meet for iftar, the evening meal when Muslims break their fast during Ramadan. She died 11 days before the Muslim holy month began. One family friend, for whom she made chilli sauce every year, said Ramadan would never be the same again. Abdul Karim Sheikhalso emigrated to the UK in the 1960s. Born in Jalalpur Jattan in Pakistan's Punjab province as the eldest of 10 children, Abdul was always driven by dreams of a better life. That led him to the UK, where he settled in Newham, in east London. Abdul quickly became a central member of the community, dedicating his life to civic causes. ""It would literally not matter to him whether he was sleeping - you could knock on the door and he would wake up and answer the call. It didn't matter what time of day you came to our door,"" his son Saleem said. ""He always put himself second."" In one of his first acts in the community, Abdul helped found one of Newham's first mosques, serving the religious, social and cultural needs of the area's growing Muslim population. He was particularly dedicated to promoting racial equality and dialogue between different faiths, in what is one of London's most racially and culturally diverse boroughs. With a passion for debate and ideas for change, politics was a natural career choice for Abdul. He became a local councillor in 1990 and ceremonial mayor of Newham in 1998. His work took the boy from Punjab to Buckingham Palace, when his service to the Muslim community was recognised through the British Empire Medal. His son Saleem said his achievements were a source of great personal pride to Abdul. ""Coming from humble backgrounds to [being a mayor] in the UK was amazing,"" he said. Even in his 80s, Abdul continued to work on the causes close to his heart. His sons say he remained healthy and independent, and had recently returned from a trip overseas. But in April, Abdul developed a temperature and breathing difficulties. He was admitted to hospital and passed away within days. His family have been inundated with calls and cards from those whose lives he touched. ""He was loved by everybody. He's being missed by everyone in the community,"" his son Naeem said. While coronavirus has disproportionately affected older people, young people are also among those dying. At 37 years old, with a thriving business and children she adored,Salina Shawhad everything to look forward to. Salina strove to make the most of every moment, and employed her favourite phrase each day in urging loved ones to live their ""best life"". Salina was a ""vibrant character who stood out within a crowd"", her sister Simone said - someone who proved to others it was possible to be happy and successful as a single parent. She ran a child-minding business in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and had also set up an affordable holiday club, which she hoped would bring communities together and allow parents to continue work during the school holidays. To Simone, she was a great listener who could always be relied upon to offer sound advice. Her biggest passion in life was her children. When the coronavirus outbreak hit the UK, she was heavily pregnant with her third daughter. She was admitted to hospital on 1 April, with suspected Covid-19. Other than gestational diabetes - a condition that can occur during pregnancy but usually disappears after giving birth - Salina was a healthy young woman with no other health conditions. Her baby was delivered via Caesarean section on 4 April, but Salina passed away just over a week later. Her daughters are now being looked after by family. Simone said Salina would ""shine within her children forever"". In the nearby Essex town of Romford,Keith Parkerwas also in hospital with coronavirus. With several underlying health conditions, Keith, 53, was among those particularly vulnerable to the pandemic. But he had overcome so much that family members jokingly called him ""the cat with nine lives"". Joanna first met Keith at school, when she had a crush on his best friend. The pair lost touch before their paths crossed again as adults in 2001. They agreed to meet for a meal, and three years later they married on the hottest day of the year. In recent years, Joanna had been his full-time carer. He was known among family and friends for his sense of humour. At a cousin's wedding, he started a flour and squirty cream fight. An old home video shows him putting M&Ms in his nose and blowing them out. The family loved going on holiday to Butlins, where Keith would be the first person to raise his hand to get up on stage. He fell ill with coronavirus in the week leading up to Easter Sunday. Other members of the family had also been unwell, but with relatively mild symptoms. By the Friday morning, Keith's condition had deteriorated - Joanna says his face had turned grey and his cheeks and nose purple from lack of oxygen. After he was taken to hospital, it quickly became clear that he would not survive. Joanna was allowed a short visit to say goodbye. Dressed in a gown, gloves and mask she struggled not to kiss or hug him. All she could do was hold his hand. When Joanna left the room, she stole a final look through a window into the room. ""I knew that was going to be the last time I was going to see him,"" she recalled. ""That would be it."" The family are now grappling with the reality of life without him. His infant granddaughter knew him as Grandad Munchkin. Every night she waves at a picture of him and blows a kiss. Do you have a story to share about your loved one?

Sainsburyâs boss says queues set to stay in place,"Sainsbury's says that customers are likely to see disruption to their shopping until September amid the coronavirus pandemic. Its boss Mike Coupe told the BBC that socially-distanced queues were likely to remain ""for the foreseeable future"". In its full-year results statement,external, the supermarket said it saw huge demand for groceries in March as concerned shoppers stockpiled goods. Sales growth peaked at 48% in the week to 21 March, but then subsided. Mr Coupe told the BBC's Today programme that the peak of sales ""was crazy"". ""We sold more, for five days running, than we would normally sell in our busiest day at Christmas, that's why you saw the gaps on the shelf."" Mr Coupe added that amid the pandemic, the retailer - which is the UK's second-largest supermarket chain - had seen ""a very marked change in the way our customers are shopping"". ""They're coming less frequently and are buying about twice as much when they do come. Very much a return to the weekly shop, but beyond it."" Wetherspoons plans to open pubs in June The weekly shop is back in fashion, says Tesco boss In the seven weeks to 25 April, the firm's Argos business also saw an uptick in sales of 7%. It said this was down to customers equipping themselves for home working. Stand-alone Argos stores have been closed since 24 March after the government instructed ""non-essential"" retailers to shut temporarily, although Argos concessions with Sainsbury's stores remain open. In common with other retailers, Sainsbury's has brought in a number of measures in an attempt to keep customers and staff safe during the pandemic, as well as cope with the surge in demand for food. They included installing screens at tills, increasing cleaning and recruiting thousands of temporary staff to work in-store, as drivers and in warehouses. Sainsbury's said that those additional costs, as well as weaker demand for clothing and fuel, could result in a Â£500m hit to its profits. However, the supermarket has also benefitted from a business rates holiday worth about Â£450m offered to shops in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It also expects some of the additional coronavirus costs will be offset by higher grocery sales. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said that lockdown had ""pushed people down the grocery aisles, and away from the not-so-crucial areas of stores"", such as clothing. ""It's a mistake to assume coronavirus is an out-and-out tailwind for supermarkets. Feeding a panicked, locked-down nation comes with extraordinary costs and changes to spending habits,"" she said. Sainsbury's comments came as it reported a 2% fall in underlying pre-tax profits to Â£586m for the year to 7 March. The supermarket said that it would defer any decisions on paying dividends to shareholders until later in the year. ""At this very early point in our financial year it is impossible to predict the full nature, extent and duration of the financial impact of Covid-19 over the course of the year,"" it said.

Tesla warning as Musk calls for end to lockdown,"Demand for Tesla's electric cars held up in the first three months of the year, despite upheavals caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Quarterly revenues jumped 30% from last year to $5.9bn (Â£4.7bn), allowing the firm to turn a small profit of $16m. It is the third quarterly profit in a row for the company, marking a turnaround after years of losses. But Tesla said forced shutdowns and limits on deliveries had clouded its forecast for coming months. ""Frankly I would call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights...that's my opinion,"" Tesla boss Elon Musk, who has been opposed to the lockdown measures, told investors in an earnings call on Wednesday. ""It will cause great harm, not just to Tesla but to many firms. While Tesla will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not. ""And all of people's - everything they've worked for their whole lives has been destroyed in real time. ""We're going to have, and have many suppliers that are on super hard times, especially the small ones, and it's causing a lot of strife to a lot of people."" He added that Tesla was ""a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay area"",  and said this should be considered ""a key risk"" because the firm only has two car factories - one in Shanghai and one in Fremont, California. Mr Musk stressed that he did not mind if people wanted to stay at home, but he was concerned that citizens were being forced to lose their livelihoods as the lockdown continued. Mr Musk had resisted closing Tesla's main car factory, located in California, waiting several days after the state's shelter-in-place order in March to formally suspend production. More recently, he has celebrated plans to relax lockdown orders, writing on Twitter ""FREE AMERICA NOW"" early on Wednesday. He had previously dismissed concerns about the coronavirus as being ""dumb"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tesla said it still had the ability to deliver more than 500,000 cars this year, despite announced shutdowns. But it warned that this could change, as re-opening dates remain unclear. ""It is difficult to predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and its global supply chain will return to prior levels,"" the firm said. ""Due to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance ... would likely be inaccurate. ""For our US factories, it remains uncertain how quickly we and our suppliers will be able to ramp production after resuming operations. We are coordinating closely with each supplier and associated government."" Tesla's performance comes as car sales have plunged. Ford earlier reported a $2bn loss in the first quarter and warned investors that it expected another $5bn hit in the April-June period. Tesla cuts staff pay as coronavirus halts production Coronavirus: Tesla donates hundreds of ventilators to New York Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, thinks it is no surprise that Tesla is withdrawing guidance, given the economic risks ahead. ""If the world slips into a potentially dramatic economic slowdown, demand for big ticket items will likely fall and we would be very surprised if Tesla escape unscathed,"" he said. ""Given that the group's only recently achieved sufficient scale to be sustainably profitable, that would be less than ideal."" Mr Musk's commentary on the virus, which has also included promotion of unproven medicines, has drawn outcry. It has also revived memories of the controversies he stirred using the social media platform two years ago, whenhe made several accusations against a British cave diver following a rescue operation in Thailand.

"Trump says China wants him to lose re-electionThe US president says Beijing faces a ""lot"" of possible consequence from the US over coronavirus.US & Canada","US President Donald Trump has said China ""will do anything they can"" to make him lose his re-election bid, stepping up his criticism of Beijing amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a White House interview with Reuters news agency, he said Beijing faced a ""lot"" of possible consequences from the US for the outbreak. He said China should have let the world know about the contagion much sooner. A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry has denied the allegations. Geng Shuang said China saw the US election as an internal issue, and said he hoped US politicians would stop using China in their domestic politics. Mr Trump himself is often accused of not doing enough to tackle the crisis. The coronavirus has ravaged a formerly humming US economy that had been the president's main selling point for his re-election campaign in November. Mr Trump, who has waged a trade war with China, offered no specifics about how he might act against Beijing. Why so many US nurses are out of work Coronavirus: Tracking the global outbreak He told Reuters: ""There are many things I can do. We're looking for what happened."" Mr Trump added: ""China will do anything they can to have me lose this race."" The Republican president said he believes Beijing wants his likely Democratic challenger Joe Biden to win in November's election. Mr Trump also said he is sceptical of data indicating Mr Biden would win. This video can not be played The unlikely coronavirus hotspot in forgotten US corner ""I don't believe the polls,"" the president said. ""I believe the people of this country are smart. And I don't think that they will put a man in who's incompetent."" US media reported earlier in the day that Mr Trump had erupted at political advisers last Friday evening about internal polling that showed him losing in critical states. His aides have doubts about whether Mr Trump will win crucial battlegrounds such as Florida, Wisconsin and Arizona, while some of his re-election team have all but given up hope of success in Michigan, according to the Associated Press news agency. ""I'm not losing to Joe Biden,"" Mr Trump reportedly said, inserting an expletive, during a conference call with campaign officials. This video can not be played Exotic dancers swap club for food delivery service The US president also reportedly snapped at his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who had called in from Florida. He cursed at Mr Parscale and at one point mentioned suing him, according to CNN and the Washington Post, though it is unclear how serious was his threat of legal action. Analysis by BBC North America Correspondent David Willis President Trump's criticism of China has been consistent - and increasingly sharp - in recent weeks. He's questioned the accuracy of the death toll there, and even said he was looking into suggestions that the virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan. But this is the harshest criticism of its kind so far. By claiming that China's delay in alerting the world to the spread of the virus was politically motivated - and designed to boost the election chances of his political rival Joe Biden at the expense of his own - Mr Trump is upping the ante in an increasingly bellicose war of words. Earlier this week a senior Chinese official, Le Yucheng, questioned the president's handling of the crisis, and accused him of not acting quickly enough in order to prepare the American people for the spread of Covid-19. For all that, the president dismisses claims that the 2020 election will amount to a referendum on his handling of this crisis, its outcome may well rest on the pace of the economic recovery in the wake of the pandemic. Expect the war of words between the world's two largest economies to continue. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he would not be renewing his government social distancing guidelines once they expire on Thursday. The guidelines - which were originally supposed to last 15 days and were then extended an additional 30 - encouraged Americans to work from home and avoid large gatherings, while advising those with underlying health conditions to self-isolate. After more than a month being stuck mainly at the White House, Mr Trump said he plans to resume travel, starting with a trip to Arizona next week. He told reporters he hopes to hold mass campaign rallies in the coming months with thousands of supporters. The US currently accounts for around a third of all coronavirus cases worldwide. Its death toll - at more than 60,000 - has in six weeks surpassed the number of Americans killed in the two decades of the Vietnam War. More than 30 million people in the US have filed for unemployment in the past six weeks, since the outbreak hit the country. Figures released on Wednesday showed the US economy had shrunk by nearly 5% -  its sharpest contraction since the Depression. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"Trump says China wants him to lose re-electionThe US president says Beijing faces a ""lot"" of possible consequence from the US over coronavirus.","US President Donald Trump has said China ""will do anything they can"" to make him lose his re-election bid, stepping up his criticism of Beijing amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a White House interview with Reuters news agency, he said Beijing faced a ""lot"" of possible consequences from the US for the outbreak. He said China should have let the world know about the contagion much sooner. A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry has denied the allegations. Geng Shuang said China saw the US election as an internal issue, and said he hoped US politicians would stop using China in their domestic politics. Mr Trump himself is often accused of not doing enough to tackle the crisis. The coronavirus has ravaged a formerly humming US economy that had been the president's main selling point for his re-election campaign in November. Mr Trump, who has waged a trade war with China, offered no specifics about how he might act against Beijing. Why so many US nurses are out of work Coronavirus: Tracking the global outbreak He told Reuters: ""There are many things I can do. We're looking for what happened."" Mr Trump added: ""China will do anything they can to have me lose this race."" The Republican president said he believes Beijing wants his likely Democratic challenger Joe Biden to win in November's election. Mr Trump also said he is sceptical of data indicating Mr Biden would win.

And I don't think that they will put a man in who's incompetent."" US media reported earlier in the day that Mr Trump had erupted at political advisers last Friday evening about internal polling that showed him losing in critical states. His aides have doubts about whether Mr Trump will win crucial battlegrounds such as Florida, Wisconsin and Arizona, while some of his re-election team have all but given up hope of success in Michigan, according to the Associated Press news agency. ""I'm not losing to Joe Biden,"" Mr Trump reportedly said, inserting an expletive, during a conference call with campaign officials.

He cursed at Mr Parscale and at one point mentioned suing him, according to CNN and the Washington Post, though it is unclear how serious was his threat of legal action. Analysis by BBC North America Correspondent David Willis President Trump's criticism of China has been consistent - and increasingly sharp - in recent weeks. He's questioned the accuracy of the death toll there, and even said he was looking into suggestions that the virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan. But this is the harshest criticism of its kind so far. By claiming that China's delay in alerting the world to the spread of the virus was politically motivated - and designed to boost the election chances of his political rival Joe Biden at the expense of his own - Mr Trump is upping the ante in an increasingly bellicose war of words. Earlier this week a senior Chinese official, Le Yucheng, questioned the president's handling of the crisis, and accused him of not acting quickly enough in order to prepare the American people for the spread of Covid-19. For all that, the president dismisses claims that the 2020 election will amount to a referendum on his handling of this crisis, its outcome may well rest on the pace of the economic recovery in the wake of the pandemic. Expect the war of words between the world's two largest economies to continue. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he would not be renewing his government social distancing guidelines once they expire on Thursday. The guidelines - which were originally supposed to last 15 days and were then extended an additional 30 - encouraged Americans to work from home and avoid large gatherings, while advising those with underlying health conditions to self-isolate. After more than a month being stuck mainly at the White House, Mr Trump said he plans to resume travel, starting with a trip to Arizona next week. He told reporters he hopes to hold mass campaign rallies in the coming months with thousands of supporters. The US currently accounts for around a third of all coronavirus cases worldwide. Its death toll - at more than 60,000 - has in six weeks surpassed the number of Americans killed in the two decades of the Vietnam War. More than 30 million people in the US have filed for unemployment in the past six weeks, since the outbreak hit the country. Figures released on Wednesday showed the US economy had shrunk by nearly 5% -  its sharpest contraction since the Depression. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

Tesla warning as Musk calls for end to lockdownThe electric car company says forced shutdowns and limits on deliveries have clouded its forecast.Business,"Demand for Tesla's electric cars held up in the first three months of the year, despite upheavals caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Quarterly revenues jumped 30% from last year to $5.9bn (Â£4.7bn), allowing the firm to turn a small profit of $16m. It is the third quarterly profit in a row for the company, marking a turnaround after years of losses. But Tesla said forced shutdowns and limits on deliveries had clouded its forecast for coming months. ""Frankly I would call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights...that's my opinion,"" Tesla boss Elon Musk, who has been opposed to the lockdown measures, told investors in an earnings call on Wednesday. ""It will cause great harm, not just to Tesla but to many firms. While Tesla will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not. ""And all of people's - everything they've worked for their whole lives has been destroyed in real time. ""We're going to have, and have many suppliers that are on super hard times, especially the small ones, and it's causing a lot of strife to a lot of people."" He added that Tesla was ""a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay area"",  and said this should be considered ""a key risk"" because the firm only has two car factories - one in Shanghai and one in Fremont, California. Mr Musk stressed that he did not mind if people wanted to stay at home, but he was concerned that citizens were being forced to lose their livelihoods as the lockdown continued. Mr Musk had resisted closing Tesla's main car factory, located in California, waiting several days after the state's shelter-in-place order in March to formally suspend production. More recently, he has celebrated plans to relax lockdown orders, writing on Twitter ""FREE AMERICA NOW"" early on Wednesday. He had previously dismissed concerns about the coronavirus as being ""dumb"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tesla said it still had the ability to deliver more than 500,000 cars this year, despite announced shutdowns. But it warned that this could change, as re-opening dates remain unclear. ""It is difficult to predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and its global supply chain will return to prior levels,"" the firm said. ""Due to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance ... would likely be inaccurate. ""For our US factories, it remains uncertain how quickly we and our suppliers will be able to ramp production after resuming operations. We are coordinating closely with each supplier and associated government."" Tesla's performance comes as car sales have plunged. Ford earlier reported a $2bn loss in the first quarter and warned investors that it expected another $5bn hit in the April-June period. Tesla cuts staff pay as coronavirus halts production Coronavirus: Tesla donates hundreds of ventilators to New York Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, thinks it is no surprise that Tesla is withdrawing guidance, given the economic risks ahead. ""If the world slips into a potentially dramatic economic slowdown, demand for big ticket items will likely fall and we would be very surprised if Tesla escape unscathed,"" he said. ""Given that the group's only recently achieved sufficient scale to be sustainably profitable, that would be less than ideal."" Mr Musk's commentary on the virus, which has also included promotion of unproven medicines, has drawn outcry. It has also revived memories of the controversies he stirred using the social media platform two years ago, whenhe made several accusations against a British cave diver following a rescue operation in Thailand.

Child abuse calls to NSPCC up 20% since lockdown,"There has been an almost 20% rise in calls to the NSPCC since the start of the coronavirus lockdown from adults concerned about child abuse. Figures show calls about children facing potential emotional abuse rose from 529 to 792 in the first month since government measures were imposed. Calls could be from neighbours, extended family or delivery drivers. Overall calls rose from 1,867 in the four weeks before lockdown to 2,216 between 23 March and 19 April. The NSPCC fear lockdown could be intensifying abuse as schools and other spaces remain closed. One caller told the charity she heard ""screaming and shouting"" from a neighbour's home. ""I approached the boy and asked if he was OK and he replied, 'Does it look like I'm OK?'"" they said. 'I sometimes wonder how I managed to survive' Coronavirus: Internet child abuse images 'not being deleted' Bethan, not her real name, suffered emotional and physical abuse from her father. After a recent car crash, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder which brought back the traumatic memories of childhood. From the age of six, she said she was tormented by her father. ""It would be anywhere from a slap to a push down the stairs, it was always forceful,"" Bethan, who lives in north Wales, said He would ensure marks never showed. Figures show calls about children facing emotional abuse rose 50% Bethan recalled her hand being put on a table and, using a knife, her father would stab the knife into the spaces between her fingers, increasing the speed as he did. ""That was an emotional trick because you knew as soon as you flinched you were getting stabbed,"" Bethan said. She also said he ""wouldn't think twice"" about holding a knife across her throat. ""It was his way, I think, of having that control over you. When it's happening on a daily basis, you just get accustomed to it and it's just normal."" Bethan is concerned for those experiencing similar issues at home now. ""To be stuck inside at a point like this, it's got to be terrifying, and it just gives me chills to even think about being back in that position and being stuck in that home for so long,"" she said. The new figures come as the British Association of Social Workers (BASW) said personal protective equipment (PPE) access for its frontline workers was still ""patchy"" across England, Wales and Scotland and was ""having an impact on how the profession is able to function"". BASW is concerned social workers are struggling to get into homes, due to a combination of a lack of staffing, PPE and social distancing. Allison Hulmes, national director of BASW Wales, said: ""We are concerned that social workers are struggling to get into homes, and what the potential impact of that may be in future."" NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""The longer the lockdown goes on, the more intense and at-risk children are if they are invisible to the outside world. ""Reports we're getting around emotional abuse, in particular, are rising so that is troubling."" Health and social care are devolved across the four home nations. The Welsh Government said safeguarding the vulnerable was ""paramount"" and social services teams have ""remained in close contact"" with those they support. ""Where social workers are working in environments where social distancing cannot be maintained, a risk assessment on the use of PPE should be undertaken,"" a spokesman said. The Scottish Government said it had ""agreed an improved model to extend access to NHS stocks of PPE to all social care staff."" while the UK Government said it was ""working around the clock to ensure PPE is delivered as quickly as possible to those on the frontline"". BASW said the PPE situation was different in Northern Ireland as social workers were employed by the health trusts.

Facebook and Twitter allow scammers 'free rein',"A fake passport was offered for sale on Twitter for Â£3,000 Social-media companies are failing to clamp down on scammers selling people's personal details through their platforms, an investigation from consumer watchdog Which? has shown. It found 50 profiles, pages and groups on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram offering stolen credit-card details, and  Netflix and Uber Eats accounts. And much of the content had remained on the platforms after being reported. Facebook and Twitter said such activity was not tolerated and would be removed. The investigation, carried out before the coronavirus lockdown, found one Facebook post revealing a Yorkshire man's: full name date of birth address mobile phone number credit-card number, security code and expiry data bank name and sort code Some Uber Eats accounts were also for sale on social media According to Which?, the post had been live for four months. Which? said it had reported it to Facebook but the social network had refused to remove it because it did not breach its community standards. Only after Which? had requested a review of that decision had the post been removed - and, even then, the group in which it had been posted had remained active. In response, Facebook, which also owns Instagram, told BBC News it had now acted to take down all the content. ""Fraudulent activity is not tolerated on our platforms and we have removed the groups and profiles flagged to us by Which?... for violating our policies."" ""We continue to invest in people and technology to identify and remove fraudulent content and we urge people to report any suspicious content to us so we can take action."" On Twitter, investigators found fraudsters offering: the full credit-card details of someone with a ""Â£13,000 plus balance"" for Â£100 - or three sets of card details for Â£200 a fake passport for Â£3,000 Which? said it had found the content simply by searching for slang terms for fraud. And Twitter's algorithms had then even suggested similar accounts via its ""Who to follow"" section. Twitter said it was against its rules ""to use scam tactics to obtain money or private financial information"". ""Where we identify violations of our rules, we take robust enforcement action,"" it said. ""We're constantly adapting to bad actors' evolving methods and will continue to iterate and improve upon our polices as the industry evolves."" All accounts provided to it by Which? have now been suspended. Which? Money editor Jenny Ross said: ""It's astonishing that social media sites make it so easy for criminals to trade people's personal and financial information, particularly as fraud is such a prevalent crime that can have devastating consequences."" She called on Facebook and Twitter ""to take stronger action to prevent their sites becoming a safe haven for scammers"" and ""work with the financial industry and police to address serious flaws with their platforms"".

Lockdown could cripple builders firms 'in months',"Sites in Scotland have been closed for more than five weeks Many construction firms in Scotland face the prospect of financial collapse within months unless the lockdown can be eased, an industry body has said. All but essential construction sites in Scotland have been closed for more than five weeks since the coronavirus restrictions were introduced. From next week, three of the UK's biggest housebuilders will reopen their sites in England. The Federation of Master Builders wants the same rules for Scottish firms. And it has warned that many smaller builders will go bust if they are not allowed to follow suit. The group is now asking the Scottish government for a timeline - and updated guidance - to allow them to get safely back to work. FMB Scotland director Gordon Nelson said that financial problems were mounting as each week goes by. He said: ""There's evidence that about two thirds of small and medium-sized construction firms may only have the cash to survive another two to three months if the present circumstances continue. ""We're pleased about the job retention scheme from the UK government for furloughed workers. ""But we're also asking for small grants for more building companies around the country so that they can survive."" Gordon Nelson said that cashflow problems were growing by the week Mr Nelson said his members ""first and foremost recognise this is a public health crisis"". But he said the industry was more than capable of adapting to new workplace guidelines to get builders back on site. ""The pressure is to resolve this and demonstrate safe working practices,"" he said. ""Our members are very keen that we don't unintentionally rush back to work too soon in a way that may lead to a spike in new infections of the coronavirus. ""We're keeping a close eye on, and are in dialogue with, construction firms in England to see what evidence they can demonstrate for safe operating. We want to use that evidence and take it to the Scottish government. ""We are determined to get back to work as quickly as possible so our members can generate work and survive and thrive in the medium to longer term."" Andrew Haldane wants an industry-wide collaboration Andrew Haldane's construction firm had to temporarily shut down on 23 March and all its employees are currently furloughed. He has plenty of orders in his books for when work does resume but says, like all builders, he has serious concerns about the future. And he believes the Scottish government must ""open the door slightly"" by agreeing to new working practices that would comply with social distancing instructions. Mr Haldane said: ""Only essential works are being done in Scotland, which is understandable given the current situation. ""Down in England they have a different format where contractors are going back to work in the near future. ""I think we just need a collaborative effort from everyone in the business to agree that there is a way we can to go back to work. ""Whether that be our people travelling to work on their own, not using public transport, working in phases with staggered breaks and PPE where that's necessary."" EASY STEPS:What can I do?

Lockdown could cripple builders firms 'in months'Construction firms in Scotland call for a limited return to work as financial pressure mounts.Scotland business,"Sites in Scotland have been closed for more than five weeks Many construction firms in Scotland face the prospect of financial collapse within months unless the lockdown can be eased, an industry body has said. All but essential construction sites in Scotland have been closed for more than five weeks since the coronavirus restrictions were introduced. From next week, three of the UK's biggest housebuilders will reopen their sites in England. The Federation of Master Builders wants the same rules for Scottish firms. And it has warned that many smaller builders will go bust if they are not allowed to follow suit. The group is now asking the Scottish government for a timeline - and updated guidance - to allow them to get safely back to work. FMB Scotland director Gordon Nelson said that financial problems were mounting as each week goes by. He said: ""There's evidence that about two thirds of small and medium-sized construction firms may only have the cash to survive another two to three months if the present circumstances continue. ""We're pleased about the job retention scheme from the UK government for furloughed workers. ""But we're also asking for small grants for more building companies around the country so that they can survive."" Gordon Nelson said that cashflow problems were growing by the week Mr Nelson said his members ""first and foremost recognise this is a public health crisis"". But he said the industry was more than capable of adapting to new workplace guidelines to get builders back on site. ""The pressure is to resolve this and demonstrate safe working practices,"" he said.
