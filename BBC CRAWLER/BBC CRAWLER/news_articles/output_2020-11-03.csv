Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

Pub plans eased as takeaway beer sales now allowed,"Kris Gumbrell,, who runs 22-pub chain Brewhouse & Kitchen, says the shift is 'a tremendous result' A government U-turn allowing pubs to sell takeaway beer during the latest lockdown has been broadly welcomed by the industry, but some chains say they will still struggle to survive. Kris Gumbrell, chief executive officer of 22-pub chain Brewhouse & Kitchen, said it was ""a tremendous result"". ""I think it will make a significant difference, not only for my company, but for the entire sector"", he told Radio 4's Today Programme. During the first lockdown, a lot of pubs served takeaway meals and drinks as another revenue stream, which was ""essential"", he said. ""What we noticed is that businesses evolve through a crisis, and also the guest evolves through a crisis as well. People miss pubs, they miss the connection, they miss the community part of what a pub actually means, so they want to support their local pub,"" he said. ""Giving a pub the opportunity to open up a new revenue stream was really critical in helping to pay those bills,"" he said. Mark Newcombe says: ""Our income will be reduced to nothing."" However, Mark Newcombe, head of a community-run pub called the Craufurd Arms, in Maidenhead, says his pub will still have to close for the duration. Under the new restrictions, customers must order their drink via a website, phone or text message. Deliveries are also allowed. Pre-ordered alcohol can be collected by customers as long as they do not enter the premises, the legislation says. Mr Newcombe's pub stayed open when the first lockdown rules were eased because it was able to serve takeaway real ale on the spot. But this time it will close for the second one because his pub doesn't have an app, and is ""not in the position to run a [pre-ordered] takeaway service,"" he said. To keep its head above water, the pub will furlough staff, apply for local government grants, launch a crowdfunding campaign, and perhaps sell more shares in the venture. As for the pub's longer-term future, he said it was ""very difficult to plan"" as he didn't know when it would be able to reopen. ""At the end of the day our income will be reduced to nothing,"" he said. But Mr Newcombe was also concerned about the wider implications of shutting the pub on the local community, particularly on the mental health of people adjusting to a second lockdown who may use the pub for social interactions. The new restrictions ""take away that social engagement"", he said. Plans published at the weekend originally suggested that while restaurants could sell takeaway food, takeaway alcohol was to be banned. The industry has hailed the turnaround as a small victory but said the rules should allow venues to sell drink in the same way as an off-licence. ""Takeaway alcohol from pubs if it is pre-ordered and customers don't enter the premises is movement, but still not anywhere near enough,"" said Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association. ""Supermarkets and off-licences can still sell alcohol, so this is grossly unfair on pubs with off-licences. It remains the case that to help pubs and brewers survive, and to stop up to 7.5 million pints from being wasted, the government needs to give pubs the same ability to sell off-licence alcohol as it did in the first lockdown."" In the last lockdown, pubs in England had been allowed to sell takeaway pints and food, and were concerned that closure for a month would mean pouring millions of pints of ale down the drain as open kegs would go off. ""It is a welcome and helpful clarification that pubs and restaurants will be permitted to continue with off-licence sales of alcohol through delivery, as well as click and collect for pre-ordered sales,"" said Kate Nichols of lobby group UK Hospitality. ""This was a lifeline to many businesses in the first lockdown and it is good to see common sense prevail this time too - avoiding waste and providing a valuable community service - although we can see no reason why a pub could not operate as a retail outlet for pre-packaged food and drink as many did last time."" A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise that these are extremely challenging circumstances for pubs and the hospitality industry. Public health and safety remains our number one priority and that is why pubs and other hospitality venues cannot serve alcohol on site to takeaway to prevent people from gathering outside their premises. ""However, they can sell alcohol as part of delivery services, including through click and collect, over the telephone and by other remote methods of ordering for collection, provided customers do not congregate as groups once they have picked up their order.""

'Heroes' praised for helping Vienna attack victims,"Recep Gultekin (right) and Mikail Ãzen (left) were invited to Turkey's Vienna embassy in thanks for their help Three men have been hailed for helping a police officer and an elderly woman during Monday's attack in Vienna. Recep Gultekin was shot in the leg while aiding the woman with his friend, Mikail Ãzen. They also carried an injured police officer to safety after a Palestinian man, Osama Joda, gave him first aid. Five people, including an attacker, were killed and another 22 wounded as firing broke out opposite a synagogue in the Austrian capital. The man accused of carrying out the attack was a 20-year-old ""Islamist terrorist"" who was released early from jail in December, and shot dead by police during the incident. Mr Joda, 23, was working at a nearby McDonalds, and told local newspaper Kurier that he was carrying goods into the restaurant when the attacker began shooting at passers-by. Security remained high in Vienna on Tuesday afternoon When two police officers came to help, the attacker opened fire on them and one was struck by a bullet. ""I pulled him behind the concrete bench and tried to stop the bleeding,"" said Mr Joda. ""There was blood everywhere."" The perpetrator fled after more police arrived at the scene, and Mr Joda then helped to drag the officer to a nearby ambulance. He was assisted in this by Mr Ãzen and Mr Gultekin, who  are both of Turkish descent. Earlier Mr Gultekin, 21, had carried the injured woman to a restaurant. This video can not be played 'This was one of the scariest moments in my life' Mr Ãzen, a mixed martial artist and personal trainer, told Kurier that they then noticed the policeman bleeding on the floor after gunfire erupted. ""We knew immediately what to do, there was no choice but to help,"" said the 25-year-old. ""Austria is our home. We would help at any time."" Police have not confirmed details of the incident, but Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told local media that the officer was taken to safety by Austrians with a migrant background. In pictures: Scene of gun attack in Vienna Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat ""No terrorist attack will succeed in tearing up or dividing our society,"" he added. Turkey's ambassador to Austria, Ozan Ceyhun, also hosted Mr Ãzen and Mr Gultekin at the Turkish embassy and praised their conduct. Security has been tight in Vienna as police launched a manhunt for further attackers, and 14 people have been arrested after a series of police raids. But authorities believe the gunman killed by police may have acted alone. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the four who died were an elderly woman, an elderly man, a young male passer-by and a waitress. It was clearly an attack driven by ""hatred of our way of life, our democracy"", the chancellor said. Do you have any information you can share?

Arrests after 'freed jihadist' kills four in Vienna,"This video can not be played Eyewitness Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister talks about the 2 November Vienna attack Austrian police have carried out a series of raids and made 14 arrests after a gunman murdered four people in the heart of Vienna on Monday. The man, described as a 20-year-old Islamist terrorist who had been freed from jail last December, was shot dead by police as he fired on passers-by. Security has been tight in the Austrian capital as police launched a manhunt for any further attackers. But authorities now believe the gunman may have acted alone. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the four who died were an elderly woman, an elderly man, a young man and a waitress. Another 22 people were wounded. One of the women who died was German, Germany's foreign minister said. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said there was no indication that a second assailant had been involved, though that could no be ruled out. Police were still assessing some 20,000 mobile phone videos of what happened. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed in a video on its online propaganda channel that it was behind the attacks, without providing any evidence. Security remained high in Vienna as authorities suggested the attacker may have acted alone The attacks began at 20:00 (19:00 GMT) on Monday, opposite the main synagogue in a pedestrian alley called Seitenstettengasse, and continued until the gunman was shot dead at 20:09. Police identified a total of six crime scenes in the area. It was clearly an attack driven by ""hatred of our way of life, our democracy"", Chancellor Kurz said. Nine minutes of murder in Vienna: What we know Three days of national mourning have begun, with flags flying at half mast. Children - those in Vienna were kept at home for safety on Tuesday - will observe a minute's silence at school on Wednesday. The UK raised its terrorism alert levelto ""severe"", from ""substantial"", meaning an attack is highly likely, but no specific intelligence points to one. It has also emerged that a police officer who was shot and wounded by the gunman was taken to safety by two men of Turkish descent. ""I took his legs, he took his shoulders, the police were there too of course and helped, and we quickly got him to the ambulance,"" Mikail Ãzen, a personal trainer and mixed martial arts fighter, told journalists. Mr Nehammer praised them, saying ""more than ever: if people think that they can divide our society with violence, terror and fear it's important to stand together"". 'Heroes' praised for helping Vienna attack victims He said 14 people linked to the gunman had been arrested in the Vienna area, the town of St PÃ¶lten and the city of Linz. Two Swiss citizens - men aged 18 and 24 - were also arrested in Winterthur near Zurich, suspected of links to the gunman. This video can not be played ""This was one of the scariest moments in my life"" Earlier, Mr Nehammer described the gunman as an ""Islamist terrorist"" named Kujtim Fejzulai, who had been jailed for 22 months in April 2019 for trying to travel to Syria to join IS jihadists. He was released early in December under more lenient terms for young adults, after convincing the authorities that he no longer held extremist Islamist views, Mr Nehammer said. Originally from North Macedonia, he had both Austrian and Macedonian citizenship. He had posted a photo on a social media, showing himself with weapons, before the attack, the minister said. Police searched his home and seized video material. As well as being heavily armed, he was wearing a fake explosive belt, police said. Mr Nehammer said the gunman opened fire with a shortened Kalashnikov assault rifle, but was also armed with a machete and a pistol. In pictures: Scene of gun attack in Vienna Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat The attack came hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were enjoying having a drink or eating out before a midnight curfew. Elsewhere in Europe, France has suffered a spate of Islamist militant attacks recently, involving ""lone wolf"" jihadists. The gunman had posted a photo showing himself with weapons before the attack, the interior minister said Last month French history teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded outside a school in a suburb of Paris by a Chechen youth, who was then shot dead by police. As the French government launched new measures to tackle militant Islam, a Tunisian man fatally stabbed three people in a cathedral in Nice. The worst IS attack in Europe in recent years was in November 2015, when gunmen killed 130 people in Paris.

Shops extend hours in 'early Christmas rush',"A quarter of John Lewis's stores are staying open later John Lewis, Currys PC World and toy chain the Entertainer are among retailers that are extending their opening hours to meet a surge in demand ahead of the lockdown in England. Hair salons are also opening later as all non-essential retailers prepare to shut for a month from Thursday. It comes amid reports of queues outside stores such as Primark as people rush to do last-minute shopping. Gary Grant, boss of the Entertainer, said it was ""just like Christmas"". His 173 shops are extending their hours until 7pm or 8pm from 5.30pm and expect brisk trading right up until Wednesday night. ""When the closedown announcement was made on Saturday, the penny finally dropped for people that if you take away four of the eight weeks left before Christmas, it is going to make shopping quite hard,"" he told the BBC. ""Also there is concern toy retailers won't be able to meet the massive increase in online orders because of courier constraints."" The Entertainer says it is opening late to meet demand Among the retailers changing their opening hours: More than a quarter of John Lewis's 42 shops are extending their hours, including in Newcastle, Liverpool, London's Oxford Street and Peterborough. Around 200 M&S stores are operating ""slightly extended"" trading hours. Currys PC World is keeping most of its shops in England open until 8pm until Wednesday, with some larger stores open as late as 10pm. ""While we expect footfall to increase between now and Thursday, our extended opening hours will help ease the busy periods in store,"" said Mark Allsop, chief operating officer at Currys PC World. âWe have 100 million toilet rolls standing byâ 'We will have to throw our beer down the drain' Since news of the second lockdown broke on Saturday, there have been queues outside shops in Birmingham, Norwich and Nottingham as people rush to make pre-lockdown purchases. Long queues were seen minutes before closing time at Ikea Tottenham Shopper numbers were up 9% in the week to Saturday, said data company Springboard, although they remain far below pre-pandemic levels. ""The first national lockdown saw a rise in spending in the days prior,"" said Kyle Monk, director of insights at the British Retail Consortium. ""We now expect many people to be picking up the items they desperately need before these shops are forced to close by government."" Long queues were seen minutes before a planned 21:00 GMT closing time at Ikea Tottenham in London on Tuesday. A member of staff told the BBC that the store would probably not close until 23:00. It is not just retailers who are busy. Hairdresser chains such as Regis, Saks and KH Hair Salons are opening earlier and closing later as customers bring forward appointments. Regis, which owns 56 salons, said it had seen a 30% rise in bookings since Saturday. Restaurants and pubs are also reported to be seeing a surge in last-minute bookings, as hospitality businesses prepare to shut. Bookings platform OpenTable said bookings on Sunday were up 11% from a year earlier, following weeks of subdued demand.

Bake Off star Luis Troyano dies at 48,"Former Great British Bake Off finalist Luis Troyano, who starred in series five of the show in 2014, has died from oesophageal cancer at the age of 48. ""Sadly, my lovely client lost his brave fight against oesophageal cancer last week,""tweeted his agent,externalAnne Kibel. ""A fantastic man with a love of baking that saw him get to the finals of GBBO, write a wonderful book, Bake It Great, and do so much more,"" she added. After the show, Troyano said Bake Off had ""totally changed my life"". ""As well as being given the opportunity to write a book, I now also bake for a living, which is simply amazing. As far as baking goes, I can certainly bake a lot faster now than before the GBBO,"" he told Food and Drinks Guide. Following his stint on Bake Off, Troyano made appearances on BBC Good Food and BBC Breakfast shows. He released a book called Bake it Great in 2015. Luis Troyano (R) and his fellow GBBO finalists Richard Burr and Nancy Birtwhistle, who won the competition Writing on a Just Giving page she set up to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support, his wife Louise wrote: ""Your life was a blessing, your memory a treasure, you are loved beyond words and missed beyond measure. ""This page has been set up for Macmillan Cancer Support but in truth, Luis gave a big thank you to everyone involved in his care."" She then posted Troyano's own words, in which he thanked Macmillan, the NHS and East Cheshire Hospice ""for trying to save my life and their tireless work to try and eliminate cancer. But more importantly a massive thank you to all the amazing professionals who really did try their absolute best for me, showed me absolute compassion and gave me more time than what was seemingly possible. I thank you sincerely."" Before competing on the show, Troyano was a marketing manager, hailing from Poynton, near Stockport. During the contest he memorably created a tribute to his hometown in one of his showstopper bakes. He also made a caramel-gilded cake depicting The Cage, a tower in the National Trust's Lyme Park in Cheshire. In an interview with Cheshire Life,externalhe said: ""I'm a proud Stockport guy. I have no shame in saying where I'm from. ""I did The Cage mainly because it's my wife's favourite place to visit. I never expected that cake to get the response it did. When it aired, it went crazy with people going, 'Where is this and what is it he's done?'"" Nadiya Hussain, who won the baking contest in 2015, paid tribute, writing ""RIP"" on Twitter.

Rape suspect urged to surrender 'for own safety',"Police released an image of a man wanted in connection with the attack in south-west London Police have urged a rape suspect to hand himself in ""for his own safety"" amid reports he is being hunted by groups of people. Kadian Nelson, 26, is wanted in connection with an attack on a teenage girl in south-west London. The Met Police, which earlier released an image of Mr Nelson, appealed for him to come forward. Det Supt Owain Richards also urged those ""attending various addresses"" in a bid to find him to ""go home"". ""Do not try to take the law into your own hands or you may end up doing something you regret and potentially face police action yourself,"" he said. Officers said the victim was reportedly assaulted shortly after 07:00 GMT near North Place, Colliers Wood. Video shared on social media appears to show a girl being approached from behind before being forced into a side street by a man. In the clip, a woman can be heard asking the man whether he knows the girl. He then walks away, and the girl is heard to cry: ""Thank you, thank you"". Referring to the footage in a tweet, Mitcham and Morden MP Siobhain McDonagh said the girl had been on her way to school when she was attacked. ""The extraordinary bravery of a lady who followed and filmed them has almost certainly saved the victim from even further distress,"" she said. The video ""has provided the police extremely important evidence for what I sincerely hope will be the swift apprehension and the early arrest of the attacker,"" Ms McDonagh added. Kadian Nelson is believed to be from the Mitcham area Det Supt Richards said he recognised the attack was ""shocking and distressing and emotions locally are running very high"". But he urged the public to ""allow us to do our jobs"". ""It is imperative that we follow the right processes as we investigate this incident as any interference could potentially affect proceedings further down the line."" he said. A Section 60 stop and search order has been authorised for Merton and Wandsworth areas. People have been warned to not share information via social media which could identify the girl or affect any future proceedings.

Would Trump or Biden be best for the UK?,"Donald Trump and Joe Biden are battling to become the 46th US president. ""They call him Britain Trump."" In Donald Trump's world, perhaps there was no greater compliment for Boris Johnson than saying he was, well, just like him.  And this washow he greetedthe prime minister's ascent to power. While both leaders enjoy casting themselves as outsiders, that caricatured comparison is far from a complete picture. But as the world waits to find out whether the president will defy the polls and stay in the White House, or Joe Biden will get to move in, it's worth wondering for a moment who the UK government would rather hold the key. For one senior politician with experience of dealing with Trump's White House and Boris Johnson, it's a simple equation: ""It's short term, versus long term"". What to look out for on election night A really simple guide to the US election Fact-checking the closing days of the US election They suggest in the immediate future, it's better to have a very pro-UK ally on Pennsylvania Avenue, easing the path to a trade deal, and holding the diplomatic ties between our two countries firm, rather than being tempted to move closer to Paris or Berlin. But in the long term, Biden's a better pick, they suggest, because the UK's standing in the world is based on its participation in institutions and alliances - the very structures they say Trump wants to ""wreck"". And has the president's obvious liking for the prime minister really translated into much for the UK anyway? Another source who has been involved with handling that fabled special relationship isn't so sure, suggesting the Britain that ""Trump loves is the country of the royal family and Winston Churchill, not modern Britain"". And his liking for the PM and his own ties to the UK ""haven't translated to listening"" to the government's opinion. President Trump has spoken warmly of Boris Johnson as a ""really good man"". But the relationship with Biden could have problems. The same insider suggests that he thinks that Brexit is ""nuts"" and sees the UK government as a little too like Trump's for his liking. During the campaign, he even went on the record to make plain his opposition to the UK's controversialInternal Market Bill. Joe Biden's public image might perhaps be less aggressive, more reasonable and predictable. But when it comes to a trade deal, a Biden White House would be dealing with the same strong commercial interests in the US - the same farmers, the same car makers, the same healthcare industry that wants to make the most of potential opportunities in the UK and defend their same interests just as strongly. And if there is a change of administration, one senior official told me the work of the trade deal with the US would essentially have to start again. Biden in charge, however, could bring other opportunities for the UK, particularly on climate change, when the Trump administration seems barely interested in the conversation. This video can not be played That was wild - a three-year campaign in three minutes The UK is hosting the huge COP26 climate conference in 2021 - a willing White House could make all the difference to making that count. And with the UK taking charge of the G7 group through next year comes another opportunity to prove that international cooperation can work. Whitehall doesn't expect immediately to be Joe Biden's best European friend if he wins - the expectation is that he would go first to Berlin. But there are big chances to show that the special relationship, so fretted over on this side of the pond, counts in the near future, if Biden is in charge. The personal and political contrasts between the two US rivals are vast, as are their attitudes to the UK, particularly over the issue of Brexit. But in practice, the gap from across the Atlantic on many issues may not be so wide after all. For all the angst and excitement of an election, for all the profound differences between the candidates this time round, the longer-term strategic interests shared by the UK and the US are bigger than any one, or even two politicians. The security and defence cooperation between the two countries is close and longstanding, and many miles under the radar of the wild swings of Trump's Twitter diplomacy. And whisper it, VERY different domestic administrations in the White House have held similar positions sometimes when it comes to foreign affairs. President Trump has used a megaphone to criticise Nato, as well as how much other EU countries stump up towards the alliance. But one insider points out that Barack Obama shared that view: ""Trump shouts it. Obama whispered it,"" but essentially they agreed. How Joe Biden might say it, if he wins, we'll have to see. For all that the ""Britain Trump"" characterisation is a misleading tag, the chemistry between leaders does matter. A change in the White House would mean a loss of political affinity between the prime minister and the most powerful leader in the West. But it could mean a more predictable partner for the UK, at a time of huge change. Westminster will be watching the election results carefully, along with the rest of the world.

The people behind the political memes you share,"Rafael and Omar Rivero; Dan Bongino You probably haven't heard of Dan Bongino, but if you are on Facebook you might have seen one of his posts. You may have even shared one. Dan Bongino is ex-NYPD and Secret Service and also worked as presidential protection for two presidents - George W Bush and Barack Obama. Now a prolific right-wing commentator, in the last two months his Facebook posts have attracted more shares than those of Fox News and CNN, combined. But he's not the only one to have an outsized influence over America's social media conversation. As the election campaign became more intense, a very small group of personalities and social media accounts on both sides of the political divide have resonated with audiences in a way even politicians and media organisations have not. Their rapid surge in popularity has seen such people generate more social media interactions than almost every politician and major publisher. They have become this election's ""influencers"" - with strong but pithy opinions, picking up what they see as political contradictions and hypocrisy. Some make memes, others just inspire the meme-makers with their ironic observations. ""My life is all about owning the libs now,"" said Mr Bongino two years ago. He attacks the left and defends President Trump in a direct and aggressive style - not being part of the traditional political establishment seems to be part of his appeal. Dan Bongino hosting his show (left); One of Bongino's most shared Facebook videos (right) He is also very critical of mainstream media (although he is himself a commentator on Fox News) and a section of his website is dedicated to ""debunking liberal myths"". Some of his most successful posts have titles like ""Exposing how much of a liar Joe Biden is"" and ""Fact-checking Kamala Harris' fake Lincoln quote at the debate"".  He has been criticised and fact-checked himself many  times - but that hasn't stopped people sharing his posts. One video montage of Ronald Reagan's speeches on law and order had almost as many shares as all New York Times Facebook posts in the previous month. Mr Bongino hasrecently told The New York Times,externalthat he doesn't know what's behind this rapid increase but attributes his success to his team and Facebook's user base - older and more conservative than other social networks. Conservative voices have been particularly strong on Facebook during this campaign. Evangelist Franklin Graham organised a Facebook collective prayer in support of President Trump Franklin Graham, son of late preacher Billy Graham, is one of the most influential evangelicals in America. His Facebook posts are consistently among the most shared, whether he is praising Trump's foreign policy, urging followers to pray for the president's victory or sharing discredited theories about the origin of the coronavirus pandemic. Hollywood actor James Woods returned to Twitter the start of 2020 after a 10-month hiatus. Woods's account has been suspended multiple times for spreading conspiracy theories and violating the platform's rules. His blistering attacks on Democrats are often screenshotted and widely shared by pro-Trump accounts on other social platforms. One of James Woods' most successful tweets One progressive (the more liberal-leaning end of the Democratic Party) page is winning the meme war. Occupy Democrats, founded in 2012 by immigrant twin brothers Rafael and Omar Rivero, amasses millions of shares every month with its text heavy, highly partisan pictures. The page had more shares than Donald Trump's official account this month. When Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign in April, Rafael Rivero started a new page, ""Ridin' With Biden"", which quickly surged to a rapid success. The brothers run other popular accounts, including ""Impeach Trump"" and ""Fight Trump"". Two of the most shared Occupy Democrats memes on Facebook Robert Reich, economic adviser and former US Secretary of Labor, has served in the administrations of three Democratic presidents. His tweets and memes attacking Trump and criticising economic inequality are hugely popular with left-leaning Americans on social media. Reich is arguably the biggest left-wing personality on Facebook - in October, his page had more shares than Joe Biden and Barack Obama combined. It is well known that Facebook and Twitter have been battlegrounds for years, but Instagram hasn't always seemed like a natural place for political activism. In 2020 this has changed as the pandemic and the protests following George Floyd's death generated a huge increase in social justice content being widely shared on Instagram. ""We don't think you should need to have a degree, or to be able to afford to get behind paywalls, in order to understand the world around you, so we try to break it down into simple, digestible round-ups,"" said Lucy Blakiston, one of the co-founders of SYSCA, a hugely popular account she runs from New Zealand. Popular slideshow-style Instagram posts. Ms Blakiston and two other young women started the project in 2018, while all three were at university. Two of them now have full-time jobs, and run SYSCA on the side. Their Instagram account has grown from fewer than 100,000 followers at the start of this year to over 2 million, more than most progressive media brands. To put this into context, it took The Guardian almost four years to get its Instagram following to that level. It is not news that in a highly polarised landscape, activism can drown out impartial information and many have warned that social media ""echo chambers"" mean people only see and share content which matches their political point of view. ""I think our US election coverage has made an impact, but among people who already think similarly to how we do,"" said Ms Blakiston. ""We are from New Zealand, a place where we are lucky enough to have a leader who we can trust to look after us in times of need,"" she added. ""We look at how things are going in America and think that everyone deserves to have a leader that they trust to look after them."" Popular slideshow-style Instagram posts Slideshow explainers seem to have resonated really strongly with Instagram's younger and more progressive audiences. Progressive accounts dedicated to this format, like ""So You Want To Talk About..."" now generate a number of interactions comparable to major news outlets. This small group of influencers have clearly benefited from the divisive nature of an election campaign - many posts take advantage of schadenfreude (glee at another's misfortune), one-upmanship and function as digital calls to action. But there are also hints that things could change - these highly liked posts featuring moments of unity show positive messages can and do break through.

Who will be next US president? You decide,"This year's US presidential election could come down to results in just a few key states. Most states are tipped to vote one way or another - so we have already assigned 188 votes to Mr Trump and 233 to Mr Biden. Can Joe Biden wrestle enough away to seize the presidency? Or will Donald Trump romp home to a second term? It's all about the race to 270 electoral votes - and this time you decide. Votes:10 Mr Trump won a surprise victory in Wisconsin in 2016 by a small margin, mainly by appealing to rural areas and working-class white women. But this same group of voters helped elect a Democratic state governor two years later - and Mr Biden is currently ahead in the polls.Wisconsinites may have been put off Mr Trump by foreign trade wars that have strangled exports from the state's many dairy farmers, leading to plummeting prices and farm closures.The state has been rocked further by violent protests after a black man was shot by police in the city of Kenosha. Republicans warn that a Democrat win would bring lawlessness and further violence. But will Wisconsin voters be persuaded? Votes:11 Mr Trump scooped the traditionally Republican state in 2016, but his 4% lead was a lot smaller than those enjoyed by Republican candidates in previous elections. This time, pollsters are forecasting Mr Trump will lose to Mr Biden.The Grand Canyon state has a growing Latino population and an increasing number of rich city dwellers, who both tend to vote Democrat. The state has also been badly hit by coronavirus, so voters who think the president has handled the crisis badly may want change.But Mr Trump's focus on building a wall along the state's southern border with Mexico, and a crackdown on visas for foreign workers, could still play well with voters. Votes:15 North Carolina was a Republican stronghold before Barack Obama won with a narrow majority in 2008. That blue blip in a history of voting red suggests that a Democratic victory is not off the cards completely.Both Mr Biden and Mr Trump have shelled out millions in advertising to try to capture the state, where Mr Biden is leading in the polls.North Carolina is the first state to begin early voting by post and record numbers of requests for postal votes have flooded in - more than half of them registered Democrats. If mail-in voting swings the final result, things are looking less rosy for Mr Trump. Votes:16 Mr Trump squeaked out a win here in 2016 with just a 0.3% lead on Hillary Clinton. The traditionally Democratic, working-class state bucked a 28-year trend to elect Mr Trump after he promised trade deals to benefit manufacturing.Mr Biden, whose father was a car salesman, says he has a deep personal connection to Detroit and often visited Michigan as vice-president. He even considered popular Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer as his running mate. Mr Biden's seen as a strong moderate candidate, the type that has always done well in Michigan. Votes:20 Four years ago, many western Pennsylvanians voted to preserve their way of life, which is reliant on the energy industry, and flipped the traditionally Democratic state for Mr Trump. He promised protection from Democratic promises to reform coal mining and fracking. But has Mr Trump delivered?Unemployment has hovered in double-digits since the pandemic struck. Mr Biden, who was born in the eastern town of Scranton (more well-known, perhaps, for being the home of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. in the US version of British comedy The Office), has long been a familiar face and that personal touch might carry him to victory. Votes:29 One thing is sure in Florida: its elections are always close. The Sunshine State may be the adopted second home of Mr Trump, but his victory at the last election was no landslide.The result in Florida is difficult to call because its population is diverse and ever-shifting. The state's large Cuban population leans Republican, but they tend to live in some of the most Democratic counties of the state. Pensioners from other states continue to retire to Florida, and they turn out to vote in droves. Younger voters, who tend to lean Democrat, are multiplying. And suburban voters across the state have been shifting slowly away from the Republican party.Keep your eyes peeled for Florida's result on election night: in every election bar one since 1964, the presidential candidate who has won Florida has also won the White House. Votes:16 Georgia has voted solidly Republican in all but two presidential elections since 1960. Yet this year, Mr Biden's campaign team believes he may have a shot. They're betting on support from black voters, who make up at least a quarter of all registered voters in the state.On race-related issues, Mr Biden polls far better than Mr Trump. Black Lives Matter protests have gripped national news this year, and Georgia's youth have often led the demonstrations outside major cities.But Mr Trump is pitching himself as the ""law-and-order candidate"", which could carry weight amongst white, conservative Georgians, who usually drive the state's result.It all depends on who shows up on polling day.  First to 270 wins   Click here if you can't see the interactive,external In the US election system, it's the state-level results that count. Each state has a number of electoral votes, based on population, and many reliably vote the same way each time. Two independent American sources, Real Clear Politics and The Cook Political Report, publish lists of states grouped by how they are expected to vote on election night. Several states are classified as ""toss-ups"", which means they could be won by either side. We chose our seven key states from those toss-ups which have enough electoral votes to sway the final outcome and where we expect the battle to be fought most closely. President Trump won all of them in 2016 Since most states are already tipped to vote one way or another, we've assigned their respective electoral votes to the candidate that each is considered most likely to vote for. This means the game starts at 188 votes for Mr Trump and 233 for Mr Biden. Technically, yes. There are a total of 538 electoral college votes and it is possible for two candidates to win states in such a way that each will come out with 269 votes. Awkward. It's also possible for no candidate to receive a majority. To determine a single winner, the US House of Representatives will vote for the next president and the US Senate will vote for the next vice-president. This is so rare, though, that it's only happened a few times in US historyâ¦ and not since the 19th Century.

Diana's brother demands BBC inquiry over interview,"Princess Diana's brother has called for a BBC inquiry over faked bank statements he says helped secure his sister's historic Panorama interview. Charles Spencer said ""sheer dishonesty"" was used to secure the 1995 Martin Bashir interview with the princess. In a letter to BBC director-general Tim Davie,reported by the Daily Mail,external, the earl accused the BBC of a ""whitewash"". The BBC has apologised for the faked statements, but it says a note from the princess says she did not see them. ""They had played no part in her decision to take part in the interview,"" the BBC said. The corporation said it would investigate ""substantive new information"" but this was ""hampered at the moment"" by the fact that Bashir was ""seriously unwell"" and unable to discuss the claims. Bashir, 57, currently BBC News religion editor,has been unwell with Covid-19 complications, the BBC said last month. Nearly 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama interview, recorded almost 25 years ago, on 20 November 1995. In the interview the princess famously said that ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time Princess Diana was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced. The letter comes afterthe Sunday Times reported,externalthat the director-general of the BBC apologised to Earl Spencer last week for the use of the fake bank statements 25 years ago but declined to open a further investigation. In Earl Spencer's response, reported by the Daily Mail, he said Bashir had used the forged bank statements to persuade the princess into doing the interview. The statements wrongly purported to show that two senior courtiers were being paid by the security services for information on his sister, the newspaper said. Earl Spencer wrote: ""If it were not for me seeing these statements, I would not have introduced Bashir to my sister. ""In turn, he would have remained just one of thousands of journalists hoping that he/she had a tiny chance of getting her to speak to them, with no realistic prospect of doing so."" Earl Spencer accused Bashir of ""yellow journalism"" - a term for sensationalist and unethical reporting - and said the BBC had not accepted ""the full gravity of this situation"". The earl also said he had a letter allegedly written by Bashir in 1995, in which the journalist referred to false rumours about the Prince of Wales having an affair with her children's nanny, Tiggy Legge-Bourke. In a statement, the BBC said: ""The BBC has apologised. We are happy to repeat that apology. ""And while this was a quarter of a century ago, we absolutely will investigate - robustly and fairly - substantive new information."" The statement said Earl Spencer had been asked to share further information with the BBC. It said: ""Unfortunately, we are hampered at the moment by the simple fact that we are unable to discuss any of this with Martin Bashir, as he is seriously unwell.  When he is well, we will of course hold an investigation into these new issues."" The BBC added that a ""key piece of information"" in investigations following the interview was a handwritten statement from the princess. Her note ""said she hadn't seen the mocked-up documents and they had played no part in her decision to take part in the interview"".

'I'll vote for you if you save my life',"This video can not be played US election: New Orleans musicians are struggling financially in the pandemic As I landed in New Orleans ahead of the US election, the thing I noticed first were the masks. Passengers at Louis Armstrong International Airport wore their politics on their faces. Face coverings were emblazoned with slogans like 'MAGA 2020' - not a souvenir from an all-inclusive to Magaluf but Donald Trump's campaign message to ""make America great again"". Others had 'I Can't Breathe' written on them - a symbolic phrase used in the global black lives matter protests since the summer. This state of Louisiana is almost certain to remain Republican red, supporting Donald Trump's pitch for another four years in the White House. Why does the US Election matter to people in the UK? Donald Trump is in the fight of his political life ""He's for us and our country,"" a black mother tells me at a gas station stop in Kentwood, worried the America she loves will be taken away if Joe Biden wins. ""I hope he gets it again,"" a driver calls out of his window before driving off. Curator Miss Fay shows me an umbrella prop Britney Spears used to perform Everytime on tour I find it hard to find anyone here who wants Joe Biden as their leader. Kentwood, which has a population of about 2000 people, is where Britney Spears grew up. Just up the road from the gas pump there's a museum dedicated to her career. Its curator - a Republican voter called Miss Fay - says Kentwood is ""the type of town where we pray for each other"". She confirms the area's support for Donald Trump, saying America is stronger with him in charge. ""I think he's been good for the nation,"" she says, standing in front of a reconstruction of Britney's old bedroom - complete with a teddy bear wearing an N-Sync jersey. ""I know a lot of people say he's a little rough and tumble but that doesn't bother me, he gets things done."" Louisiana might be where Britney, Frank Ocean, Normani, Lil Wayne and DJ Khaled all began their careers, but the coronavirus pandemic has muted other musicians trying to make it big, especially in New Orleans - the state's biggest city and one that boasts it's ""the birthplace of jazz"". For 27-year-old vocalist Christien Bold, the past eight months have been financially tough, with gigs cancelled as bars in the city closed their doors. He says there have been times when he's not had money in his pockets and knows of other musicians who rely on tips to to pay their bills and have been ""left out to dry"". ""There are a lot of poor folks here,"" he says, standing on the empty Frenchmen Street, which he describes as ""the music Mecca of the city"". Christien is voting for the Democrat candidate Joe Biden, claiming ""we're screwed either way"" but ""Biden is a beacon of light"" who can help those struggling with employment. It's something Pamela, a respiratory therapist from Texas who moved to New Orleans 18 months ago, agrees with. ""Turn it blue,"" she yells at me in a bar, where she's sheltering from Hurricane Zeta's 110mph winds. She's hoping Louisiana will vote for Joe Biden. ""I'm embarrassed by Trump,"" she says. ""All the people I meet from other countries, I apologise. I don't want people to think all Americans are buffoons."" What has Donald Trump said about your country? Pamela announces, while ordering a vodka soda to buckle in for the hurricane, that Great British Bake Off host Paul Hollywood is her ""fantasy boyfriend because of his most gorgeous blue eyes"". She really is blue through and through. Derek, celebrating his birthday three seats away, completely disagrees (about the politics, not Paul's allure) believing Donald Trump's message ""appeals to working people and that's what we have in America"". The power goes off and on in the bar as Zeta's strength rips through, but the flooding won't be that bad here, I'm told by Pamela. It's elsewhere in the state that'll get it worse. This video can not be played Climate change is a major election issue for residents of Jean Lafitte, Louisiana Emerson Boutte has been preparing for the worst for most of her life, as Louisiana bears the brunt of the United States hurricane season every year. But this year it's different because for the first time, 18-year-old Emerson has a vote on who gets to lead her country in the fight against climate change. She doesn't know who to choose. ""If one of the candidates would directly address the climate change, coastal erosion and land loss happening in Louisiana, I think that would definitely sway my vote for them,"" she says, nervous about how many days - or weeks - she's going to be without power because of how strong Zeta was. This state hasn't been a focus in this election campaign - it rarely is. Both Biden and Trump's teams know it's almost certain to vote Republican like it has in every presidential vote since 2000, which means it's not featured on the rolling news channels as the two candidates don't organise huge rallies here. It's for that reason many people in Louisiana feel they're not being heard when it comes to their daily battles for survival because politicians don't try as hard to get their vote as they do in other states. ""I want our elected officials to come out here. Come put a human face on this fight that we're battling,"" Shamara Lavigne tells me outside her home in an area nicknamed Cancer Alley. âWe are only fighting for fresh air,"" she says, her two dogs running around nearby - there's also an alligator nearby called Geoffrey. This video can not be played This area of Louisiana has the highest cancer risk of anywhere in America. The air tastes notably different in St James Parish and it feels ""ironic"" to Shamara that people in this predominantly black community only started wearing masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, and not because of the toxic emissions. Everybody who lives around here knows someone who either has cancer or has died from it. They're fighting to stop more industry coming to the area, fearing it could increase the risk of cancer - something the companies dispute. The tweets Donald Trump posts or the adverts Joe Biden pays for have no impact here. For Shamara's mum Sharon, she has just one request to the two wannabe presidents: ""I want them to save our lives."" Desperate words I didn't expect to hear covering this election.

"Bake Off star Luis Troyano dies at 48The finalist from 2014 died last week from oesophageal cancer, his agent says.Entertainment & Arts","Former Great British Bake Off finalist Luis Troyano, who starred in series five of the show in 2014, has died from oesophageal cancer at the age of 48. ""Sadly, my lovely client lost his brave fight against oesophageal cancer last week,""tweeted his agent,externalAnne Kibel. ""A fantastic man with a love of baking that saw him get to the finals of GBBO, write a wonderful book, Bake It Great, and do so much more,"" she added. After the show, Troyano said Bake Off had ""totally changed my life"". ""As well as being given the opportunity to write a book, I now also bake for a living, which is simply amazing. As far as baking goes, I can certainly bake a lot faster now than before the GBBO,"" he told Food and Drinks Guide. Following his stint on Bake Off, Troyano made appearances on BBC Good Food and BBC Breakfast shows. He released a book called Bake it Great in 2015. Luis Troyano (R) and his fellow GBBO finalists Richard Burr and Nancy Birtwhistle, who won the competition Writing on a Just Giving page she set up to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support, his wife Louise wrote: ""Your life was a blessing, your memory a treasure, you are loved beyond words and missed beyond measure. ""This page has been set up for Macmillan Cancer Support but in truth, Luis gave a big thank you to everyone involved in his care."" She then posted Troyano's own words, in which he thanked Macmillan, the NHS and East Cheshire Hospice ""for trying to save my life and their tireless work to try and eliminate cancer. But more importantly a massive thank you to all the amazing professionals who really did try their absolute best for me, showed me absolute compassion and gave me more time than what was seemingly possible. I thank you sincerely."" Before competing on the show, Troyano was a marketing manager, hailing from Poynton, near Stockport. During the contest he memorably created a tribute to his hometown in one of his showstopper bakes. He also made a caramel-gilded cake depicting The Cage, a tower in the National Trust's Lyme Park in Cheshire. In an interview with Cheshire Life,externalhe said: ""I'm a proud Stockport guy. I have no shame in saying where I'm from. ""I did The Cage mainly because it's my wife's favourite place to visit. I never expected that cake to get the response it did. When it aired, it went crazy with people going, 'Where is this and what is it he's done?'"" Nadiya Hussain, who won the baking contest in 2015, paid tribute, writing ""RIP"" on Twitter.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

We answer some of your questions about the rapidly changing rules and restrictions in the UK.  As we reported earlier, there have been calls for youth sport to be exempt when thenew restrictions come into effectin England on Thursday. But the governmentâs chief scientific adviser says the decision to suspend children's sport is a matter for ministers. Sir Patrick Vallance told MPs: âWe just donât go down to
that level of individual activities. âTheyâve had advice from us in terms of the general principles
and some of the areas but not down to individual, specific activities like
that.â Appearing alongside him at the Commons science select committee, Prof Chris Whitty agreed, saying it
was the job of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to âgive the broad adviceâ.

But, when Evie Bowles could not have the big party she had planned due to coronavirus restrictions, her grandson had another idea to mark the occasion. He took to social media to ask people to send a birthday card to Evie at her care home in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh. The post went viral and more than 1,000 people from around the world sent cards to celebrate her big day. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor British Cycling chief Julie Harrington has written to the culture secretary to ask for ""small outdoor groups and club-led"" activities to be allowed to continue during England's lockdown. Writing on behalf of GB Cycling, British Triathlon & England Athletics she said: ""We have, largely thanks to the work of volunteers, been able to reintroduce group rides and runs, club activity, adapted competitions and coaching sessions. And given that all activities take place outdoors, participants are able to maintain appropriate social distancing at all times, we believe that the risk of transmission through taking part is limited."" Harrington added that while training alone or with members of their household might work for some, many people rely on the support and encouragement of a friendly group, and may ""stop altogether"" without it. ""Prohibiting group activities will deny millions of people the right to be active at a time when they need it most,"" she said. A leading imam has joined other faith leaders in calling for the government to reconsider its restrictions on places of worship during the second national lockdown in England. Qari Asim, of Makkah Mosque in Leeds, said finding a way of keeping mosques open was of ""paramount importance"" and should be considered ""essential"", along with other services. Places of worship will be closed from Thursday, unless they are being used for funerals, individual prayer, formal childcare or other essential voluntary and public services such as support groups. Imam Asim, who is a government adviser on Islamophobia, said: ""The complete cessation of communal prayer and worship is a matter of concern for Muslim communities."" He added there was no evidence of Covid outbreaks in mosques and said they ""serve not only the spiritual and religious needs of the Muslim community but also they help maintain the mental wellbeing of the community as well"". Prof Chris Whitty says the new national lockdown in England
will reduce the R number - the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to - below 1 if the measures are followed by the public. England's chief medical officer, speaking to MPs, says that would ""make a huge differenceâ but he wants to
reiterate that the virus will still be a problem that âwe need to see through winterâ. He adds that this doesnât mean that the country will need to stay in lockdown through winter but âweâll need to be doing things that keep the rates downâ. He adds that young people have âbrought the rates down in their
own age groups by their actions â that has been remarkableâ. Asked whether the restrictions will be lifted on 2 December,
he says that is a decision for ministers but the aim of the lockdown is to get
rates down so âwe can move far enough that itâs a realistic possibility to move
into a different state of play at that pointâ. Reality Check As we've been reporting, chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance are being questioned by MPs about the figures they gave at Saturdayâs briefing when the prime minister announced the new lockdown for England. There has been much focus on the chart above, which included one model that gave a scenario of 4,000 people a day dying of coronavirus over winter (roughly four times the figure during the worst days of the first wave). Sir Patrick said he hoped the focus had not been on the longer term models in that chart, but on the six week forecasts in other charts in the presentation. Prof Whitty said âI have never used anything beyond six weeks in anything I have ever said to any minister on this issueâ, but Sir Patrick then said that the chart had indeed been shown to the prime minister. There has also been criticism that the curves in the chart were all produced at the start of October, just after the rapid rise in cases that followed students returning to university. These were based on models for worst-case planning that assumed no changes in policy or behaviour. But, since then, England has introduced a three-tier system of stricter measures and the epidemic has grown more slowly than the curves assumed it would. Indeed, on the day the chart was used, an average of 215 deaths had been reported each day in the previous week. That was far below the 1,000 a day envisioned by the most pessimistic model. David PorterScotland Westminster editor There has been much discussion of the furlough scheme today, and UK government sources now insist the  scheme and funding will be extended to the devolved administrations if needed because of further lockdowns. A source said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement yesterday, in which he said ""the furlough scheme is a UK-wide scheme"", still stood. The Treasury is now ""dotting the i's and crossing the t's"", the source said, although they added a formal statement may not come today. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay was questioned on the matter earlier in the House of Commons and echoed the prime minister's words that the furlough was a UK-wide scheme. You can read more about the rowhere. Prof Chris Whitty has defended England's Test and Trace system after being questioned about its effectiveness by MPs. ""Test and trace has gone from a standing start to a long way
down the track,"" says England's chief medical officer, however he adds that once
you have very high rates of transmission of the virus it is not as effective. âWeâve all said from the very beginning this is most
effective when the rates are lowâ. He says Test and Trace will probably be having âa bigger
effectâ on areas which have lower rates right now, than those in the areas where it is higher. He adds that a âsecondary gainâ of the new lockdown in England is that
it âwill bring the numbers down to the rate where this becomes a much bigger
part of the solutionâ. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific officer, adds that across Europe âeven very
effective test and trace systems do not work well at high prevalenceâ. Back to the Science and Technology Committee now, and Prof Chris Whitty was asked why, given improvements in treatments for coroanvirus patients, the number of deaths this winter could still reach the levels of the first peak. England's chief medical adviser replied that treatments like the drug dexamethasone ""reduce mortality"" but ""they are not going to take it right the way down"". âSome people, sadly, will come into hospital and whatever you do they will die,"" he told MPs. âI think the idea thereâs been a huge transformation
in the mortality rate would not be supported by the data."" He added that he was ""confident"" there had been a reduction in the mortality rate but ""the best we can hope for"" is that it has halved. Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said she does not plan to make any changes to her Covid restrictions before next week. The first minister saidshe wanted to stick to the timetable under which new measures, that came into effect this week, will be reviewed next Tuesday. Sturgeon had indicated on Monday that questions over furlough funding meant she may need to decide within days whether to take tougher steps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said support will be available in the future. At her daily press conference Sturgeon said: ""We are going to stick, if we can, to our scheduled review period. That is probably, on balance, the best thing to do."" While Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Valance have been explaining the current situation to MPs, some changes to the rules in Wales have been announced. Up to four people will be able to meet  in pubs, cafes and restaurants in in the countryafter its firebreak lockdown ends on 9 November. The 22:00 curfew on alcohol sales will remain in place. First Minister Mark Drakeford asked people to visit the venues in the smallest groups possible. He said reopening would be ""subject to strict protections discussed with the hospitality sector, including advance booking, time-limited slots and verified identification"". ""Our clear advice to people in Wales is that we should visit these places in as small a group as possible, and for many, this will only be the people we live with,"" he told the Welsh Parliament. ""But we have listened to those young people, and single people especially have told us how important it is for them to meet some friends and other family members."" England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, says he understands why some documents about virus scenarios are not put into the public domain because they can create unnecessary worry. He was asked whetherthe government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario""- which is used by
officials and the NHS to plan for the months ahead - would be published. Speaking to MPs, he says: ""Thereâs a danger with these extreme forward projections that
people then misinterpret them as âthis is what itâs going to happenââ. He says this can cause people to get âunduly worriedâ by
something when the whole point of a reasonable worst case scenario
is to say âwe need to stop this happeningâ. However, he adds that heâs âin favour of publishing as much as
possibleâ. The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has defended presenting modelling to the public that suggested deaths could reach more than 4,000 a day if no action was taken. Labour MP Graham Stringer suggested that without caveats this data could frighten people, who did not fully understand the context. Sir Patrick said the aim was to give as much information as possible, not to frighten people but he acknowledged models looking further ahead were less reliable. Prof Chris Whitty says the three-tier system of restrictions in England has âslowed
things down from where they would have been otherwiseâ. âI am confident that the tier two has had an effect and that
the tier three has had a bigger effect,â he says. Prof Whitty says he believes infection rates are âsubstantially lower then
they would have beenâ without those tighter measures being implemented in large parts of the country. But the measures have not managed to reduce the reproduction rate of the virus - or R number - below 1, at which point it would decline in the population. However, he did say it had got closer to 1. ""That's due to the remarkable work of individuals taking really quite difficult social decisions for quite prolonged periods,"" he said. He also said there was âno evidenceâ the R number was falling below 1 in the older age groups. What is the R number?Here is a reminder. Prof Chris Whitty says putting exact dates on virus projections
is âalmost impossibleâ and he says none of the government's scientific advisers would say âthis
is definitely going to happen on this dateâ. But he says the chances that things are ""likely to improve without
actionâ once the R number - the rate at which the virus is spreading - goes above 1 and youâre heading into the winter
months âare quite lowâ. He tells MPs: ""If youâre giving advice to ministers, that has to be the
advice you give. Ministers then have to make decisions not just on that advice.
They have to use multiple other things."" He says the government's scientific advisers give âone
strand of adviceâ but he believes âquite strongly"" that these ""deeply difficult
societal measures fundamentally are decided by ministersâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

""Test and trace has gone from a standing start to a long way
down the track,"" says England's chief medical officer, however he adds that once
you have very high rates of transmission of the virus it is not as effective. âWeâve all said from the very beginning this is most
effective when the rates are lowâ. He says Test and Trace will probably be having âa bigger
effectâ on areas which have lower rates right now, than those in the areas where it is higher. He adds that a âsecondary gainâ of the new lockdown in England is that
it âwill bring the numbers down to the rate where this becomes a much bigger
part of the solutionâ. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific officer, adds that across Europe âeven very
effective test and trace systems do not work well at high prevalenceâ. Back to the Science and Technology Committee now, and Prof Chris Whitty was asked why, given improvements in treatments for coroanvirus patients, the number of deaths this winter could still reach the levels of the first peak. England's chief medical adviser replied that treatments like the drug dexamethasone ""reduce mortality"" but ""they are not going to take it right the way down"". âSome people, sadly, will come into hospital and whatever you do they will die,"" he told MPs. âI think the idea thereâs been a huge transformation
in the mortality rate would not be supported by the data."" He added that he was ""confident"" there had been a reduction in the mortality rate but ""the best we can hope for"" is that it has halved. Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said she does not plan to make any changes to her Covid restrictions before next week. The first minister saidshe wanted to stick to the timetable under which new measures, that came into effect this week, will be reviewed next Tuesday. Sturgeon had indicated on Monday that questions over furlough funding meant she may need to decide within days whether to take tougher steps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said support will be available in the future. At her daily press conference Sturgeon said: ""We are going to stick, if we can, to our scheduled review period. That is probably, on balance, the best thing to do."" While Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Valance have been explaining the current situation to MPs, some changes to the rules in Wales have been announced. Up to four people will be able to meet  in pubs, cafes and restaurants in in the countryafter its firebreak lockdown ends on 9 November. The 22:00 curfew on alcohol sales will remain in place. First Minister Mark Drakeford asked people to visit the venues in the smallest groups possible. He said reopening would be ""subject to strict protections discussed with the hospitality sector, including advance booking, time-limited slots and verified identification"". ""Our clear advice to people in Wales is that we should visit these places in as small a group as possible, and for many, this will only be the people we live with,"" he told the Welsh Parliament. ""But we have listened to those young people, and single people especially have told us how important it is for them to meet some friends and other family members."" England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, says he understands why some documents about virus scenarios are not put into the public domain because they can create unnecessary worry. He was asked whetherthe government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario""- which is used by
officials and the NHS to plan for the months ahead - would be published. Speaking to MPs, he says: ""Thereâs a danger with these extreme forward projections that
people then misinterpret them as âthis is what itâs going to happenââ. He says this can cause people to get âunduly worriedâ by
something when the whole point of a reasonable worst case scenario
is to say âwe need to stop this happeningâ. However, he adds that heâs âin favour of publishing as much as
possibleâ. The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has defended presenting modelling to the public that suggested deaths could reach more than 4,000 a day if no action was taken. Labour MP Graham Stringer suggested that without caveats this data could frighten people, who did not fully understand the context. Sir Patrick said the aim was to give as much information as possible, not to frighten people but he acknowledged models looking further ahead were less reliable. Prof Chris Whitty says the three-tier system of restrictions in England has âslowed
things down from where they would have been otherwiseâ. âI am confident that the tier two has had an effect and that
the tier three has had a bigger effect,â he says. Prof Whitty says he believes infection rates are âsubstantially lower then
they would have beenâ without those tighter measures being implemented in large parts of the country. But the measures have not managed to reduce the reproduction rate of the virus - or R number - below 1, at which point it would decline in the population. However, he did say it had got closer to 1. ""That's due to the remarkable work of individuals taking really quite difficult social decisions for quite prolonged periods,"" he said. He also said there was âno evidenceâ the R number was falling below 1 in the older age groups. What is the R number?Here is a reminder. Prof Chris Whitty says putting exact dates on virus projections
is âalmost impossibleâ and he says none of the government's scientific advisers would say âthis
is definitely going to happen on this dateâ. But he says the chances that things are ""likely to improve without
actionâ once the R number - the rate at which the virus is spreading - goes above 1 and youâre heading into the winter
months âare quite lowâ. He tells MPs: ""If youâre giving advice to ministers, that has to be the
advice you give. Ministers then have to make decisions not just on that advice.
They have to use multiple other things."" He says the government's scientific advisers give âone
strand of adviceâ but he believes âquite strongly"" that these ""deeply difficult
societal measures fundamentally are decided by ministersâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Diana's brother demands BBC inquiry over interviewThe BBC will investigate ""substantial new information"" amid a row over the 1995 Panorama interview.","Princess Diana's brother has called for a BBC inquiry over faked bank statements he says helped secure his sister's historic Panorama interview. Charles Spencer said ""sheer dishonesty"" was used to secure the 1995 Martin Bashir interview with the princess. In a letter to BBC director-general Tim Davie,reported by the Daily Mail,external, the earl accused the BBC of a ""whitewash"". The BBC has apologised for the faked statements, but it says a note from the princess says she did not see them. ""They had played no part in her decision to take part in the interview,"" the BBC said. The corporation said it would investigate ""substantive new information"" but this was ""hampered at the moment"" by the fact that Bashir was ""seriously unwell"" and unable to discuss the claims. Bashir, 57, currently BBC News religion editor,has been unwell with Covid-19 complications, the BBC said last month. Nearly 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama interview, recorded almost 25 years ago, on 20 November 1995. In the interview the princess famously said that ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time Princess Diana was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced. The letter comes afterthe Sunday Times reported,externalthat the director-general of the BBC apologised to Earl Spencer last week for the use of the fake bank statements 25 years ago but declined to open a further investigation. In Earl Spencer's response, reported by the Daily Mail, he said Bashir had used the forged bank statements to persuade the princess into doing the interview. The statements wrongly purported to show that two senior courtiers were being paid by the security services for information on his sister, the newspaper said. Earl Spencer wrote: ""If it were not for me seeing these statements, I would not have introduced Bashir to my sister. ""In turn, he would have remained just one of thousands of journalists hoping that he/she had a tiny chance of getting her to speak to them, with no realistic prospect of doing so."" Earl Spencer accused Bashir of ""yellow journalism"" - a term for sensationalist and unethical reporting - and said the BBC had not accepted ""the full gravity of this situation"". The earl also said he had a letter allegedly written by Bashir in 1995, in which the journalist referred to false rumours about the Prince of Wales having an affair with her children's nanny, Tiggy Legge-Bourke. In a statement, the BBC said: ""The BBC has apologised. We are happy to repeat that apology. ""And while this was a quarter of a century ago, we absolutely will investigate - robustly and fairly - substantive new information."" The statement said Earl Spencer had been asked to share further information with the BBC. It said: ""Unfortunately, we are hampered at the moment by the simple fact that we are unable to discuss any of this with Martin Bashir, as he is seriously unwell.  When he is well, we will of course hold an investigation into these new issues."" The BBC added that a ""key piece of information"" in investigations following the interview was a handwritten statement from the princess.

LiveLiveTrump or Biden? US presidential race reaches climax,"President-elect Joe Biden made his first appointments, naming a group of scientists and experts who will lead his administration's response to Covid-19 However, President Donald Trump is still planning legal challenges to the results in some key states Biden says it will take time to develop a vaccine, and urges Americans to wear a mask to reduce Covid-19 transmissions Biden and President Trump both welcome news that a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech is 90% effective Biden advisers are discussing who can fill key posts after the Democrat pledged the most diverse cabinet in history Results from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding Edited by Helier Cheung Thank you for joining us for our ongoing coverage of the 2020 US presidential election. It's been nearly a week since the 3 November election day, and there are another 10 weeks to go until Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th US president.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

Dan RoanBBC Sports editor British Cycling chief Julie Harrington has written to the culture secretary to ask for ""small outdoor groups and club-led"" activities to be allowed to continue during England's lockdown. Writing on behalf of GB Cycling, British Triathlon & England Athletics she said: ""We have, largely thanks to the work of volunteers, been able to reintroduce group rides and runs, club activity, adapted competitions and coaching sessions. And given that all activities take place outdoors, participants are able to maintain appropriate social distancing at all times, we believe that the risk of transmission through taking part is limited."" Harrington added that while training alone or with members of their household might work for some, many people rely on the support and encouragement of a friendly group, and may ""stop altogether"" without it. ""Prohibiting group activities will deny millions of people the right to be active at a time when they need it most,"" she said. A leading imam has joined other faith leaders in calling for the government to reconsider its restrictions on places of worship during the second national lockdown in England. Qari Asim, of Makkah Mosque in Leeds, said finding a way of keeping mosques open was of ""paramount importance"" and should be considered ""essential"", along with other services. Places of worship will be closed from Thursday, unless they are being used for funerals, individual prayer, formal childcare or other essential voluntary and public services such as support groups. Imam Asim, who is a government adviser on Islamophobia, said: ""The complete cessation of communal prayer and worship is a matter of concern for Muslim communities."" He added there was no evidence of Covid outbreaks in mosques and said they ""serve not only the spiritual and religious needs of the Muslim community but also they help maintain the mental wellbeing of the community as well"". Prof Chris Whitty says the new national lockdown in England
will reduce the R number - the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to - below 1 if the measures are followed by the public. England's chief medical officer, speaking to MPs, says that would ""make a huge differenceâ but he wants to
reiterate that the virus will still be a problem that âwe need to see through winterâ. He adds that this doesnât mean that the country will need to stay in lockdown through winter but âweâll need to be doing things that keep the rates downâ. He adds that young people have âbrought the rates down in their
own age groups by their actions â that has been remarkableâ. Asked whether the restrictions will be lifted on 2 December,
he says that is a decision for ministers but the aim of the lockdown is to get
rates down so âwe can move far enough that itâs a realistic possibility to move
into a different state of play at that pointâ. Reality Check As we've been reporting, chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance are being questioned by MPs about the figures they gave at Saturdayâs briefing when the prime minister announced the new lockdown for England. There has been much focus on the chart above, which included one model that gave a scenario of 4,000 people a day dying of coronavirus over winter (roughly four times the figure during the worst days of the first wave). Sir Patrick said he hoped the focus had not been on the longer term models in that chart, but on the six week forecasts in other charts in the presentation. Prof Whitty said âI have never used anything beyond six weeks in anything I have ever said to any minister on this issueâ, but Sir Patrick then said that the chart had indeed been shown to the prime minister. There has also been criticism that the curves in the chart were all produced at the start of October, just after the rapid rise in cases that followed students returning to university. These were based on models for worst-case planning that assumed no changes in policy or behaviour. But, since then, England has introduced a three-tier system of stricter measures and the epidemic has grown more slowly than the curves assumed it would. Indeed, on the day the chart was used, an average of 215 deaths had been reported each day in the previous week. That was far below the 1,000 a day envisioned by the most pessimistic model. David PorterScotland Westminster editor There has been much discussion of the furlough scheme today, and UK government sources now insist the  scheme and funding will be extended to the devolved administrations if needed because of further lockdowns. A source said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement yesterday, in which he said ""the furlough scheme is a UK-wide scheme"", still stood. The Treasury is now ""dotting the i's and crossing the t's"", the source said, although they added a formal statement may not come today. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay was questioned on the matter earlier in the House of Commons and echoed the prime minister's words that the furlough was a UK-wide scheme. You can read more about the rowhere. Prof Chris Whitty has defended England's Test and Trace system after being questioned about its effectiveness by MPs. ""Test and trace has gone from a standing start to a long way
down the track,"" says England's chief medical officer, however he adds that once
you have very high rates of transmission of the virus it is not as effective. âWeâve all said from the very beginning this is most
effective when the rates are lowâ. He says Test and Trace will probably be having âa bigger
effectâ on areas which have lower rates right now, than those in the areas where it is higher. He adds that a âsecondary gainâ of the new lockdown in England is that
it âwill bring the numbers down to the rate where this becomes a much bigger
part of the solutionâ. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific officer, adds that across Europe âeven very
effective test and trace systems do not work well at high prevalenceâ. Back to the Science and Technology Committee now, and Prof Chris Whitty was asked why, given improvements in treatments for coroanvirus patients, the number of deaths this winter could still reach the levels of the first peak. England's chief medical adviser replied that treatments like the drug dexamethasone ""reduce mortality"" but ""they are not going to take it right the way down"". âSome people, sadly, will come into hospital and whatever you do they will die,"" he told MPs. âI think the idea thereâs been a huge transformation
in the mortality rate would not be supported by the data."" He added that he was ""confident"" there had been a reduction in the mortality rate but ""the best we can hope for"" is that it has halved. Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said she does not plan to make any changes to her Covid restrictions before next week. The first minister saidshe wanted to stick to the timetable under which new measures, that came into effect this week, will be reviewed next Tuesday. Sturgeon had indicated on Monday that questions over furlough funding meant she may need to decide within days whether to take tougher steps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said support will be available in the future. At her daily press conference Sturgeon said: ""We are going to stick, if we can, to our scheduled review period. That is probably, on balance, the best thing to do."" While Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Valance have been explaining the current situation to MPs, some changes to the rules in Wales have been announced. Up to four people will be able to meet  in pubs, cafes and restaurants in in the countryafter its firebreak lockdown ends on 9 November. The 22:00 curfew on alcohol sales will remain in place. First Minister Mark Drakeford asked people to visit the venues in the smallest groups possible. He said reopening would be ""subject to strict protections discussed with the hospitality sector, including advance booking, time-limited slots and verified identification"". ""Our clear advice to people in Wales is that we should visit these places in as small a group as possible, and for many, this will only be the people we live with,"" he told the Welsh Parliament. ""But we have listened to those young people, and single people especially have told us how important it is for them to meet some friends and other family members."" England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, says he understands why some documents about virus scenarios are not put into the public domain because they can create unnecessary worry. He was asked whetherthe government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario""- which is used by
officials and the NHS to plan for the months ahead - would be published. Speaking to MPs, he says: ""Thereâs a danger with these extreme forward projections that
people then misinterpret them as âthis is what itâs going to happenââ. He says this can cause people to get âunduly worriedâ by
something when the whole point of a reasonable worst case scenario
is to say âwe need to stop this happeningâ. However, he adds that heâs âin favour of publishing as much as
possibleâ. The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has defended presenting modelling to the public that suggested deaths could reach more than 4,000 a day if no action was taken. Labour MP Graham Stringer suggested that without caveats this data could frighten people, who did not fully understand the context. Sir Patrick said the aim was to give as much information as possible, not to frighten people but he acknowledged models looking further ahead were less reliable. Prof Chris Whitty says the three-tier system of restrictions in England has âslowed
things down from where they would have been otherwiseâ. âI am confident that the tier two has had an effect and that
the tier three has had a bigger effect,â he says. Prof Whitty says he believes infection rates are âsubstantially lower then
they would have beenâ without those tighter measures being implemented in large parts of the country. But the measures have not managed to reduce the reproduction rate of the virus - or R number - below 1, at which point it would decline in the population. However, he did say it had got closer to 1. ""That's due to the remarkable work of individuals taking really quite difficult social decisions for quite prolonged periods,"" he said. He also said there was âno evidenceâ the R number was falling below 1 in the older age groups. What is the R number?Here is a reminder. Prof Chris Whitty says putting exact dates on virus projections
is âalmost impossibleâ and he says none of the government's scientific advisers would say âthis
is definitely going to happen on this dateâ. But he says the chances that things are ""likely to improve without
actionâ once the R number - the rate at which the virus is spreading - goes above 1 and youâre heading into the winter
months âare quite lowâ. He tells MPs: ""If youâre giving advice to ministers, that has to be the
advice you give. Ministers then have to make decisions not just on that advice.
They have to use multiple other things."" He says the government's scientific advisers give âone
strand of adviceâ but he believes âquite strongly"" that these ""deeply difficult
societal measures fundamentally are decided by ministersâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Alcohol licensing changes 'strike right balance',"A bill that will lead to changes in NI's alcohol licensing laws ""strikes the right balance"", Communities Minister CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n has said. Underthe plans,external, pubs and nightclubs will be able to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend. The legislation also proposesremoving restrictions around Easter drinking. It will have to pass several legislative hurdles before becoming law. The other main change is the extension in ""drinking-up time"" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends. Currently restrictions on selling alcohol are in place from theThursday before Easter until Easter Sunday,external. Alcohol can only be served between 17:00 and 23:00 on Good Friday and bars have to stop serving at midnight on Thursday and Easter Saturday. The Department for Communities carried out a consultation last year, and said ""changing social habits and the growing importance of the tourism industry"" had prompted the calls for changes to Easter licensing laws. Setting out her department's plans in the assembly on Tuesday, Mrs NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n urged the Stormont assembly to vote for the bill. ""I know many people would like the licensing regime to be more flexible where licensees would have more freedom to open and close when they like,"" she said. ""But on the other hand, there are many people concerned about harm caused to our society by misuse of alcohol, who wish to see greater restrictions on the advertising and sale of drink. ""I believe this bill strikes the right balance between offering a level of support to the hospitality sector, which we all agree is very much needed, whilst protecting our communities by ensuring the sale of alcohol is controlled."" Much of the hospitality sector is struggling to maintain jobs due to the latest restrictions that forced many firms to shut The law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol. The current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements. The proposals have been a very long time in the making, with Stormont first proposing changes eight years ago. Can NI 'learn to live' with Covid-19? Pubs to be allowed to serve alcohol until 2am Brewers 'let down' by alcohol laws Aprevious bill to change NI's licensing lawsbegan its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, who share power together at Stormont. The new bill is expected to become law in time for Easter 2022. NI's hospitality sectorhas been closed since 16 October, due to restrictions agreed by the executive to tackle the spread of Covid-19. Some in the industry have proposed a compliance certificate should be drawn up, to allow those firms adhering properly to the rules to reopen.

Manhunt after 'Islamist terror' attack in Vienna,"This video can not be played Eyewitness Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister talks about the 2 November Vienna attack Austrian police have urged people to stay indoors as they hunt for suspects after a multiple gun attack in the capital Vienna that killed four people. A gunman shot dead by police has been identified as a 20-year-old ""Islamist terrorist"" who was released early from jail in December. Two men and two women died of their wounds after gunmen opened fire at six locations in the city centre on Monday evening. Twenty-two people were wounded. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the four who died were an elderly woman, an elderly man, a young male passer-by and a waitress. Witnesses described how the gunmen had opened fire on people outside bars and chased them as they fled inside. It was clearly an attack driven by ""hatred of our way of life, our democracy"", the chancellor said. He earlier spoke of a ""repulsive terror attack"". The nation was engaged not in a battle between Christians and Muslims, he stressed, but ""between civilisation and barbarism"". Austria's political leaders honoured the victims in Vienna as the nation mourned Interior Minister Karl Nehammer described the dead gunman as an ""Islamist terrorist"", jailed for 22 months in April 2019 after trying to get to war-torn Syria to join Islamic State (IS) jihadists. The 20-year-old had been released early last December under more lenient terms for young adults. Mr Nehammer urged Austrians to ""please stay at home if possible"" during the police operation and ""avoid the inner city"". Children should stay at home, not go to school on Tuesday, he said. Austrian daily Der Standard reports that 90% of shops in the city centre are now shut. The victims were in a city centre area busy with people in bars and restaurants, near Vienna's central synagogue. Police cordoned off some streets and brought in reinforcements. They are also being helped by the Austrian army. In pictures: Scene of gun attack in Vienna Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat Addressing a news conference, Mr Nehammer said police had searched the home of the dead gunman and seized video material. He had been wearing a fake explosive belt, police said. The man was originally from North Macedonia and had a previous conviction for terrorist association, Mr Nehammer said. He had both Austrian and Macedonian citizenship. Several arrests were made during searches of 15 nearby homes. Two suspects were also arrested in St PÃ¶lten, a town to the west of Vienna. Bars were targeted in a popular area of Vienna known as the ""Bermuda Triangle"" The Vienna shooting comes after a spate of Islamist militant attacks in France. Last month French history teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded outside a school in a suburb of Paris. Then, as the government launched new measures to tackle militant Islam, a Tunisian man fatally stabbed three people in a cathedral in Nice. The worst IS attack in Europe in recent years was in November 2015, when gunmen killed 130 people in Paris. Police flooded into several central streets where shooting took place Mr Nehammer said at least one ""heavily armed and dangerous"" attacker was believed to be still at large. Officials were quoted as saying there could have been as many as four attackers. The attack came hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were enjoying drinks and eating out before a midnight curfew. Police named six crime scenes in central Vienna: Seitenstettengasse and nearby Morzinplatz, Salzgries, Fleischmarkt, Bauernmarkt and Graben. The suspect was shot dead near St Rupert's Church. Austria's government announced three days of national mourning, starting immediately. Flags flew at half-mast and a minute's silence was held at midday. Schools are to hold a minute's silence for the victims on Wednesday morning. Police say the incident began at about 20:00 (19:00 GMT), near the Seitenstettengasse synagogue, when a heavily armed man opened fire on people outside cafes and restaurants. Vienna Community Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least two gunmen shoot at least 100 rounds in front of the synagogue compound. ""They were attacking the guests of bars and pubs. People were jumping and running, falling over the tables, running inside the bars followed by the gunmen also running inside the bars,"" he told London radio station LBC. Members of the special forces quickly arrived at the scene. One policeman was shot and critically wounded before the perpetrator, armed with an automatic rifle, a pistol and a machete, was, in the police chief's words, ""neutralised"" at 20:09. Police increased security outside the interior ministry after the shooting Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch said the synagogue was closed at the time. Footage posted on social media showed scenes of chaos as people ran through the streets with gunshots ringing out in the background. Witness Chris Zhao, who was in a nearby restaurant, told the BBC: ""We heard noises that sounded like firecrackers. We heard about 20 to 30 and we thought that to be actually gunfire. Sadly, we also saw a body lying down the street next to us."" Guests left the Vienna State Opera under the watch of armed police A major anti-terrorist operation swung into action and police set up roadblocks around the city centre. Barbara Lovett, who was in the Vienna State Opera at the time, said that when the evening performance ended the manager had told the audience of the attack and that they could not leave. ""The players came back out from the dressing rooms, in their normal clothes, sat down in the orchestra pit and played for another 20 minutes,"" she told the BBC. ""They played the German national anthem, which used to be the Austrian anthem - the Emperor Quartet by Haydn."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Police in the neighbouring Czech Republic said they were carrying out random checks on the border with Austria in case the attackers fled in that direction. European leaders strongly condemned the shooting. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply shocked by the terrible attacks"" while Germany's Angela Merkel said ""the fight against Islamist terrorism is our common struggle"". Austria had until now been spared the sort of attacks that have hit other European countries. French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe must not ""give up"" in the face of attacks. Last week he described the murder of three people in Nice as an ""Islamist terrorist attack"". Home Secretary Priti Patel said the UK would ""stand ready to support in any way we can"". US President Donald Trump - on the campaign trail ahead of Tuesday's election - described it as ""yet another vile act of terrorism in Europe"". His Democratic challenger Joe Biden condemned the ""horrific terrorist attack"", adding: ""We must all stand united against hate and violence.""

Arrests after 'freed jihadist' attacks Vienna,"This video can not be played Eyewitness Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister talks about the 2 November Vienna attack Austrian police have carried out a series of raids and made 14 arrests after a gunman murdered four people in the heart of Vienna on Monday. The man, described as a 20-year-old Islamist terrorist who had been freed from jail last December, was shot dead by police as he fired on passers-by. Security has been tight in the Austrian capital as police launched a manhunt for any further attackers. But authorities now believe the gunman may have acted alone. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the four who died were an elderly woman, an elderly man, a young man and a waitress. Another 22 people were wounded. One of the women who died was German, Germany's foreign minister said. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said there was no indication that a second assailant had been involved, though that could no be ruled out. Police were still assessing some 20,000 mobile phone videos of what happened. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed in a video on its online propaganda channel that it was behind the attacks, without providing any evidence. Security remained high in Vienna as authorities suggested the attacker may have acted alone The attacks began at 20:00 (19:00 GMT) on Monday, opposite the main synagogue in a pedestrian alley called Seitenstettengasse, and continued until the gunman was shot dead at 20:09. Police identified a total of six crime scenes in the area. It was clearly an attack driven by ""hatred of our way of life, our democracy"", Chancellor Kurz said. Nine minutes of murder in Vienna: What we know Three days of national mourning have begun, with flags flying at half mast. Children - those in Vienna were kept at home for safety on Tuesday - will observe a minute's silence at school on Wednesday. The UK raised its terrorism alert levelto ""severe"", from ""substantial"", meaning an attack is highly likely, but no specific intelligence points to one. It has also emerged that a police officer who was shot and wounded by the gunman was taken to safety by two men of Turkish descent. ""I took his legs, he took his shoulders, the police were there too of course and helped, and we quickly got him to the ambulance,"" Mikail Ãzen, a personal trainer and mixed martial arts fighter, told journalists. Mr Nehammer praised them, saying ""more than ever: if people think that they can divide our society with violence, terror and fear it's important to stand together"". 'Heroes' praised for helping Vienna attack victims He said 14 people linked to the gunman had been arrested in the Vienna area, the town of St PÃ¶lten and the city of Linz. Two Swiss citizens - men aged 18 and 24 - were also arrested in Winterthur near Zurich, suspected of links to the gunman. This video can not be played ""This was one of the scariest moments in my life"" Earlier, Mr Nehammer described the gunman as an ""Islamist terrorist"" named Kujtim Fejzulai, who had been jailed for 22 months in April 2019 for trying to travel to Syria to join IS jihadists. He was released early in December under more lenient terms for young adults, after convincing the authorities that he no longer held extremist Islamist views, Mr Nehammer said. Originally from North Macedonia, he had both Austrian and Macedonian citizenship. He had posted a photo on a social media, showing himself with weapons, before the attack, the minister said. Police searched his home and seized video material. As well as being heavily armed, he was wearing a fake explosive belt, police said. Mr Nehammer said the gunman opened fire with a shortened Kalashnikov assault rifle, but was also armed with a machete and a pistol. In pictures: Scene of gun attack in Vienna Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat The attack came hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were enjoying having a drink or eating out before a midnight curfew. Elsewhere in Europe, France has suffered a spate of Islamist militant attacks recently, involving ""lone wolf"" jihadists. The gunman had posted a photo showing himself with weapons before the attack, the interior minister said Last month French history teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded outside a school in a suburb of Paris by a Chechen youth, who was then shot dead by police. As the French government launched new measures to tackle militant Islam, a Tunisian man fatally stabbed three people in a cathedral in Nice.

Shops extend hours in 'early Christmas rush'John Lewis and Currys PC World among those opening later as demand surges ahead of lockdown.BusinessComments,"A quarter of John Lewis's stores are staying open later John Lewis, Currys PC World and toy chain the Entertainer are among retailers that are extending their opening hours to meet a surge in demand ahead of the lockdown in England. Hair salons are also opening later as all non-essential retailers prepare to shut for a month from Thursday. It comes amid reports of queues outside stores such as Primark as people rush to do last-minute shopping. Gary Grant, boss of the Entertainer, said it was ""just like Christmas"". His 173 shops are extending their hours until 7pm or 8pm from 5.30pm and expect brisk trading right up until Wednesday night. ""When the closedown announcement was made on Saturday, the penny finally dropped for people that if you take away four of the eight weeks left before Christmas, it is going to make shopping quite hard,"" he told the BBC. ""Also there is concern toy retailers won't be able to meet the massive increase in online orders because of courier constraints."" The Entertainer says it is opening late to meet demand Among the retailers changing their opening hours: More than a quarter of John Lewis's 42 shops are extending their hours, including in Newcastle, Liverpool, London's Oxford Street and Peterborough. Around 200 M&S stores are operating ""slightly extended"" trading hours. Currys PC World is keeping most of its shops in England open until 8pm until Wednesday, with some larger stores open as late as 10pm. ""While we expect footfall to increase between now and Thursday, our extended opening hours will help ease the busy periods in store,"" said Mark Allsop, chief operating officer at Currys PC World. âWe have 100 million toilet rolls standing byâ 'We will have to throw our beer down the drain' Since news of the second lockdown broke on Saturday, there have been queues outside shops in Birmingham, Norwich and Nottingham as people rush to make pre-lockdown purchases. Long queues were seen minutes before closing time at Ikea Tottenham Shopper numbers were up 9% in the week to Saturday, said data company Springboard, although they remain far below pre-pandemic levels. ""The first national lockdown saw a rise in spending in the days prior,"" said Kyle Monk, director of insights at the British Retail Consortium. ""We now expect many people to be picking up the items they desperately need before these shops are forced to close by government."" Long queues were seen minutes before a planned 21:00 GMT closing time at Ikea Tottenham in London on Tuesday. A member of staff told the BBC that the store would probably not close until 23:00. It is not just retailers who are busy. Hairdresser chains such as Regis, Saks and KH Hair Salons are opening earlier and closing later as customers bring forward appointments. Regis, which owns 56 salons, said it had seen a 30% rise in bookings since Saturday. Restaurants and pubs are also reported to be seeing a surge in last-minute bookings, as hospitality businesses prepare to shut. Bookings platform OpenTable said bookings on Sunday were up 11% from a year earlier, following weeks of subdued demand.

Parents fined for children breaking lockdown rulesYouths throwing eggs and attending parties over the weekend were among the breaches.Wales,"Fixed penalty notices can be issued for most types of breaches Parents of children who broke lockdown rules by throwing eggs and attending a party over the weekend have been fined by police. South Wales Police said fixed penalty notices were issued to parents for the covid breaches and anti-social behaviour in St Mellons, Cardiff. A number of parents were also fined when their children attended a party in Taibach, Neath Port Talbot. Calls to the force spiked at 1,500 on Saturday and 30 fines were issued. The force said about 50 acceptable behaviour contracts  would be issued to students at a Cardiff halls of residence following reports of a party. More than 200 of the calls to the force related to concerns about Covid breaches including youths congregating and engaging in antisocial behaviour, house parties, suspected breaches by licensed premises that should be closed, failure of Covid-positive individuals to self-isolate and gatherings at religious settings. A total of 137 warnings or other police interventions were also handed out, and officers made five anti-social behaviour referrals. Police said it also made several joint visits to licensed premises, among them a pub in Neath that was found to be continuing to trade despite the firebreak lockdown. Ch Supt Andy Valentine said: ""I think it is telling that among those fined this weekend were a number of parents who clearly weren't ensuring their children were also following the rules. ""If we are to help slow the spread of this virus, each and every one of us must take responsibility and ensure that we - and those dependent upon us - are doing the right thing.""

"Primark: Pyjamas in and suits out in Covid shiftThe retailer's owner, Associated British Foods, says the change reflects how ""we live our lives"".BusinessComments","Primark has said customer demand for pyjamas has grown but sales of men's suits have dropped, reflecting a shift in lifestyle since the coronavirus. The chain's owner, Associated British Foods, said sales of nightwear, leisure and children's clothing have increased compared to before the pandemic. In contrast, demand for formal menswear was ""weak"" as people worked from home. In its full-year results, AB Foods said that so far Covid-19 had cost Primark Â£2bn in lost sales and Â£650m in profit. Since reopening its shops in June following the UK lockdown in March, Primark said trade at its large city centre stores was slower because of fewer commuters travelling to work as well as a drop in tourist numbers. But it said footfall at retail parks was ahead of the previous year, while it has maintained customer numbers in shopping centres and regional high street shops. 'It has been the toughest year I've ever had' Coronavirus drives shop closures to new record Between reopening on 15 June and the end of its financial year on 12 September, AB Foods said UK like-for-like sales at Primark were down 12% from a year earlier. Addressing new lockdown restrictions to stop a second wave of the coronavirus, AB Foods has already temporarily shut Primark shops in Ireland, France, Belgium, Wales, Slovenia and Catalonia in Spain. It said these closures, together with the lockdown in England - which is due to come into force on Thursday for a month - will close 57% of its total selling space, and lead to an estimated Â£375m in lost sales. Primark does not sell products online and has no plans to provide a click and collect service during the coming lockdown. A spokesperson for Primark said: ""Although we will look at alternative business models from time to time, there are no immediate plans to trade online."" Across Associated British Foods as a whole, sales dropped 12% to Â£13.9bn in the year to 12 September and pre-tax profit fell to Â£686m from Â£1.1bn. Sales within its food business grew by 2% to Â£3.5bn over the year, helped by the shift to many people working from home. ""Associated British Foods' food business has also been turned on its head during the pandemic, as consumers switched from dining out to eating in,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""While demand for food service business fell, home cooking product sales soared."" In particular, demand for baking ingredients rose in North America and sales of a Twinings teas grew. On the downside, sales for the Ovaltine brand were affected by a drop in impulse purchases in Thailand and Vietnam. Its Allied Bakeries division was also forced to write down Â£15m after losing a contract to supply goods to the Co-op supermarket group.

Covid-19: Welsh Government update,"NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall says nearly 200 people have caught Covid-19 in hospital in a week He says it is ""incredibly difficult"" to stop the virus spreading in hospital but said such cases only accounted for 3% of the total At least 99 people have died after being infected with Covid at hospitals in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg area of south Wales The number of people in hospital in Wales with coronavirus has reached its highest level since late April Non-Covid hospital treatment has resumed but not yet returned to normal levels in every area, Dr Goodall says His briefing comes the day after First Minister Mark Drakeford outlined new rules to take effect when Wales' lockdown ends next Monday Natalie Grice and Andy Roberts That brings our coverage of the Welsh Government's coronavirus press briefing to a close. Here's a summary of the main points:  Follow ourSenedd Live blogas coronavirus discussions continue in the Welsh Parliament. We'll be back tomorrow with live coverage of the next Welsh Government briefing at 12:15 GMT. Thanks for joining us. Patients must feel sure the Welsh Government is doing everything it can to provide Covid-free hospital sites following the news nearly 200 people have caught the virus in hospital in the past week, Plaid Cymru has said. Health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""After the emerging of the seven-fold increase in waiting lists, and a Macmillan
report showing deeply concerning backlogs to cancer services, we now find out
that nearly 200 patients have contracted coronavirus in our hospitals in the
last week. âPeople must have confidence that government is doing all it can
to urgently provide âgreenâ Covid-free, or âCovid-lightâ sites for diagnosis
and treatment. ""And given how quickly the virus can spread when it gets into
health and care settings, they must have confidence also in steps taken to keep
the virus out in the first place. ""I donât want people who may need treatment
deciding to stay away, shoring up more serious problems for themselves and the
health service.â Rhun ap Iorwerth is worried people with serious conditions will stay clear of hospitals for fear of catching Covid This video can not be played Dr Andrew Goodall says he is ""concerned"" about the number of people needing hospital treatment Demand for critical care beds for people with coronavirus in Wales is expected to increase over the coming days and weeks, the chief executive of NHS Wales has said. Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Dr Andrew Goodall said he ""continued to be concerned"" with the growing number of hospital admissions for coronavirus-related patients. He said 1,275 Covid-related patients were in hospital in Wales - an 18% increase on last week - and 57 of those were in critical care, about a third of Wales' capacity. Andrew RT Davies: ""We have no idea of the scale"" A senior Welsh Conservative has spoken of increasing concern about the number of cancelled operations as hospitals focused on the coronavirus outbreak. Andrew RT Davies, the party's health spokesman in the Senedd, said: ""Each and every person who is not treated by the NHS is another person on a waiting list. ""Regrettably the Welsh Government haven't restarted publishing waiting times, so we have no idea of the scale."" Earlier, NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall said planned surgery and other non-Covid activity in hospitals had resumed but had not yet returned to normal levels in every area. There have been four more deaths of people with Covid-19 and 1,119 new cases reported to Public Health Wales as of Tuesday. This take the total deaths in Wales to 1,895 and the cumulative number of confirmed coronavirus cases to 54,456. Local Democracy Reporting Service A supply teacher who tested positive for Covid-19continued teaching at a school despite knowing she was infected, the school's head has said. The woman taught five classes - totalling 150 children - at Kitchener Primary School in Canton, Cardiff. All have since had to self-isolate. Head teacher Reena Patel delivered the ""devastating news"" in a video message to parents and carers on Monday. Cardiff council said the children would return at the end of the week. Ms Patel said of the supply teacher concerned: ""She carried on coming into school and she didn't tell us that she was tested or that she had received the results. Unfortunately, I have only just found out. ""I am disappointed, I am angry, I am just absolutely devastated as to why people would not do the right thing. ""Your children are my priority and they always will be."" Around 150 pupils at Kitchener Primary School in Cardiff have been sent home to self-isolate This video can not be played Panteg House has become a focus of efforts to help those suffering hardship due to Covid As the pandemic continues, Panteg House social club in Pontypool has become a distribution centre and food bank - and the hub of the local effort to feed those who've fallen on hard times. Food bank manager Allan and some local teachers who have become community volunteers share their experiences. Read more hereabout the impact of coronavirus on Pontypool. There have been another 30 deaths linked to Covid-19 infections caught inside four hospitals, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board has reported. It takes to 99 the total number of deaths due to the outbreaks, with 51 coming at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital. It comes as the NHS Wales chief executive said stopping coronavirus from spreading in hospitals was ""incredibly difficult"". There are now 469 cases linked to outbreaks at the health board. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall said there were nearly 200 cases of hospital-acquired coronavirus in the last week in Wales. He said they amounted to one in 40 of the total confirmed cases. There have been 65 deaths involving coronavirus
in Wales registered for the latest week, according to the Office for National
Statistics (ONS). This is a further rise on the 47 deaths
reported the previous week and the highest weekly figure since early June. The place across England and Wales with the
most registered deaths involving Covid-19 for the week was Liverpool with 52. Across England and Wales, there were 640 deaths
mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate â a rise for a seventh successive
week and 232 more than the week before. When looking at excess deaths â thatâs whether
deaths from all causes are above what weâd normally expect to see â then there
were 33 more (5.3%) than the five-year average in Wales for this week. So far
this year, there have been 2,248 deaths more than the average. Deaths from Covid were 9.8% of all deaths. According to the figures, Rhondda Cynon Taf has had a total of 374 deaths from
Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Its death rate â 155.7 deaths per 100,000 - is
the fifth highest in England and Wales. Cardiff was the local authority area with the most deaths in Wales at 415. In total in Wales, there were 2,762 deaths
involving Covid-19 of deaths registered by 23 October. And itâs a total of
2,806 deaths occurring up to 23 October and being registered up to
31 October. Parents of children who broke lockdown rules by throwing eggs and attending a party over the weekend have been fined by South Wales Police. The force said fixed penalty notices were issued to parents for the Covid breaches and anti-social behaviour in St Mellons, Cardiff. A number of parents were also fined when their children attended a party in Taibach, Port Talbot. Calls to the force spiked at 1,500 on Saturdayand 30 fines were issued. Police said about 50 acceptable behaviour contracts would be issued to students at a Cardiff student block following reports of a party. The chief executive of the NHS in Wales has said there
are some signs the Covid mortality rate in hospital is lower during this second
phase of the pandemic. Dr Andrew Goodall told journalists that though the NHS
was under considerable strain, ""there is some success in the
second wave of actually treating patients earlier with some of the
interventions that we've learned... we're actually seeing a lower mortality
rate at this phase"". He did however say critical care still may not be
seeing the worst of the outbreak at the moment, because of the two or three-week lag in terms of the admission of patients. Dr Goodall went on to say discussions were taking place about
the possibility of mass testing in certain areas, as was to be carried out in Liverpool. ""We may well have some opportunities to do similar in Wales,"" he said. The NHS in Wales has not reached the point where it needs to
cancel non-Covid health care, according to its boss. Dr Andrew Goodall, the chief executive of NHS Wales, said: âWe have to consider a range of scenarios."" However he stressed the health service in Wales was in a
different situation now compared to the spring, âwhich is why the general
feeling from the NHS in Wales is a wish to look to protect the range of
activities happening as much as possible"". Dr Goodall said if the numbers continued to rise, âthen
inevitably there is a point where we have to focus on safety and emergency
responseâ. âI donât feel that we have reached that point yet,â he added. NHS Wales chief Dr Andrew Goodall said
coronavirus needed 100% compliance with measures to reduce transmission. He was responding to a question on hospital acquired
infections following a high number of cases at the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board
and a rising number at Swansea Bay and Aneurin Bevan health boards. Dr Goodall said there was a ""connection point"" between a
growth in prevalence of the virus and the number of cases in communities. âThe number of patients admitted into a hospital with
coronavirus is around 6% for the whole of Wales. Itâs actually 15% for Cwm Taf
Morgannwg [covering Rhondda Cynon Taf, which has one of Wales highest case rates] - so there is a connecting point.â Dr Goodall said it was important that the NHS ensured it was âdischarging all of the appropriate practicesâ and that it was âlearning from
experiences across the UK and indeed internationally and in Walesâ. He said: âWe normally can see that if weâre able to get
about 90% compliance on the range of areas, we will see some of the normal
winter bugs that break out coming under control. âCoronavirus almost needs the system, for people and staff,
to be 100% complying 100% of the time.â He added: âI have an expectation to look to contain and
control these areas. We have had evidence of that across Wales with other
hospital areas able to do so."" The boss of the NHS in Wales said local
lockdowns ""perhaps haven't had the impact that we wanted"". But Dr Andrew Goodall said they ""did
help to slow down some of the potential transmission"" that was occurring
during September and the start of October. Speaking at the Welsh Government's press
conference, he said the hope was the firebreak lockdown ""can have an
impact by bringing together different sectors in response rather than just
relying on an NHS response"". Dr Goodall added: ""What we do know is that in
terms of actions that made a difference and our ability to respond, the
national set of actions that occurred back in March had a very significant
impact on the trends that were happening in the NHS across the UK and in Wales
itself. ""As well as us trying to prepare
and professionally respond to the pressures that we were facing at that time...a lot of the impact came from the behaviours of people, individuals,
community and society. ""So the introduction of a firebreak
under that kind of level, similar to what we experienced in March, we would
hope and expect has the same kind of impact."" The head of the NHS in Wales has warned there could be ""very
significant increases in both hospital admissions and deaths right through the
whole winter period"" if the spread of coronavirus was not broken. Dr Andrew Goodall stressed the Welsh Government's national ""firebreak"" measures were in
line ""with needing to do something very different from a society and a
community perspective, to protect the NHS"". He added: ""We're getting very close to the peak levels that we saw in
April. ""And I don't think that the peak that we saw in April represents the NHS
being overwhelmed, but I think it's a very visible milestone to demonstrate the
significance of the impact that we're going to see across the NHS system. ""But
the NHS is more prepared. We have got plans in place and that does include our
ability to expand additional capacity, working with the plans from the
individual health boards across Wales based on where we are at the moment."" Dr Goodall emphasised the importance of the next two weeks in order to review the data and
the impact the firebreak and earlier local lockdowns have had. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall said they wanted to maintain as much NHS activity as possible alongside its coronavirus response. ""We want to ensure
     that the NHS can balance its emergency response alongside services we have
     gradually restored,"" he said. ""But
     the higher the level of coronavirus in the community, the more difficult
     this is to achieve. This will be a difficult winter and we will continue
     to support the NHS to prepare and respond. ""It
     is important we all play our part and do everything we can to look after
     ourselves and each other. ""Itâs important we all follow the rules; we keep
     our distance from each other; practise good hand hygiene; work from home
     where we can and wear a face mask in indoor public places."" Despite the rise in non-Covid activity, not all NHS services have returned to normal levels, its Welsh chief has admitted. Dr Andrew Goodall told the coronavirus press briefing: ""Delivering
     normal NHS services in an environment where coronavirus is widespread in
     our communities makes this very difficult. ""Providing safe
     care is always our first priority."" He said the flu vaccination programme had had a higher uptake than last year, more than 300,000 people had had dental treatment since March and optometry services had seen 38% more patients in September compared with July. However he added: ""The protections
      we have put in place to respond to coronavirus take more time and slow
      down the number of patients who can be seen and treated. ""This means that
      across the UK the NHS is seeing waiting times increase and the waiting
      list grow â and this is our pattern in Wales too."" NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall told the briefing that normal NHS activity had restarted since the first lockdown ended, following postponements of planned operations and appointments when Covid was at its height in the spring. He said: ""This
      means that the NHS is now busier â it has more than twice the number of
      non-coronavirus patients in hospital beds, because we have been able to
      admit more emergency and patients over recent months. ""While the number of
     people with coronavirus is moving towards the April peak, our information
     shows the NHS is doing more planned activity than it was in the
     spring."" Dr Goodall said planned inpatient and day-case admissions in September increased by more than 160% compared to April. Cancer referrals have returned to expected to levels. and treatment levels were higher in August than April. The number of new outpatients seen in September was 75% higher than in April. Stopping coronavirus from spreading in hospitals is âincredibly difficultâ, the chief executive of the NHS in Wales has admitted. There were nearly 200 cases of hospital-acquired coronavirus in the last week, Dr Andrew Goodall said. The Cwm Taf Bro Morgannwg health board area in south Wales has been particularly badly hit, with at least 69 deaths in its hospitals. But Dr Goodall said that even in that region, hospital-acquired cases only accounted for three per cent of the total. âI want to be clear, this is not as simple as a failure of hand-washing or poor infection control procedures,â he said. âThis virus is highly infectious and it can be passed on in the asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of the infection. âIt is incredibly difficult to prevent its spread in busy healthcare environments, especially with around 90 people with Covid currently admitted each day.â There were 192 cases of probable or definite cases of hospital transmission in Wales last week, he said, around 1 in 40 of the total confirmed cases. âDespite hospital transmissions, over 85% of our available beds do not have coronavirus patients, so care remains safe for the vast majority needing to access hospital,â Dr Goodall added. He confirmed there were 1,275 Covid-related patients in hospital, only 9% lower than the April peak. He added: âOur normal critical care capacity of 152 beds is full, mainly with people who do not have coronavirus â we currently have 163 people in critical care at the moment. âWe have plans to expand critical care capacity if required.â Some 16,000 people have now been discharged from hospital after being treated for coronavirus. There are four levels of escalation in the NHS to show pressures in the system and 11 hospitals in Wales are currently at level three or four. Addressing the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall said it showed the increased pressures across the NHS. He said he ""continued to be concerned"" about the rising trend. ""We expect demand for
      hospital treatment for people with coronavirus will continue to increase
      in the days and weeks ahead,"" he told journalists. ""It will take time to see the full impact of
      the national firebreak to work its way through the NHS.""  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
City Hall to move from central London to East End,"City Hall was designed by Sir Norman Foster Sadiq Khan is to move London's government from City Hall to a new headquarters in the east of the city. The Crystal building in the Royal Docks in Newham will become the home of the mayor and the Greater London Authority (GLA) at the end of next year. More than 1,000 employees of the GLA group were informed on Tuesday about the decision, which followed a consultation over the summer. The GLA's Conservative leader Susan Hall said the plan was ""flawed"". A spokesman for the Mayor of London said the move would save more than Â£60m over the next five years. City Hall, which was designed by Sir Norman Foster, has been the official home of the GLA since it was opened by the Queen in 2002 and occupies a prominent position on the south bank of the Thames. The GLA has leased the building from a private landlord - the Kuwaiti-owned St Martin's Property Group - at a cost of more than Â£11m a year. Howeverthe terms of the 25-year-old lease allow for a breakin the contract at the end of 2021. Faced by Mr Khan's threat in the summer to move out of City Hall, the landlords offered an undisclosed reduction in the annual rent, but negotiations failed to produce a deal. The Crystal was opened in 2012 by electronics giant Siemens which cited it as an exemplar of sustainable design. It is located near London's cross-river cable car, which was opened by Boris Johnson when he was mayor. Siemenssold the building to the GLA,externalin June 2019. The Crystal was opened in 2012, having been commissioned by Siemens as an exemplar of sustainable design. The Crystal is close to a new station on the Crossrail route - though the Elizabeth Line, as it will be known, is not currently due to open until 2022. The glass building has less capacity than City Hall and some GLA staff will instead be relocated to the London Fire Brigade's headquarters in Union Street, Southwark. Millions of pounds will have to be spent to upgrade security for the mayor and members of the London Assembly. The London Fire Brigade will still be asked to look for savings by November Mr Khan would be expected to divide his time between the Crystal and Union Street, although meetings of the London Assembly would take place in the new headquarters. Over the summer, the Conservative group on the London Assembly claimed Mr Khan had exaggerated the potential savings from the move. A subsequent review of the options by the GLA found the savings would actually be greater than first thought. Front-line police services will be protected from any potential cuts, Sadiq Khan said The mayor told the London Assembly recently that the move was necessary because of government under-funding. Moving London's government from its central location to a site in Newham to the east of the capital has been criticised by some as likely to diminish its role and status. Others - including Labour-run Newham council - maintain it will spur the regeneration of one of the poorest parts of the capital. The mayor says he faces cuts to the GLA, police, fire service and Transport for London (TFL) of more than Â£400m over the next year and his priority is to protect jobs. Covid and Crossrail - why TfL's finances are precarious In response to the confirmation of the move, Conservative leader Ms Hall said she was ""disappointed"" and described it as a ""half-baked plan based on dodgy numbers"". She added: ""The mayor was offered a substantial rent reduction by the landlord of the existing building. ""Instead of accepting it, Khan has chosen a flawed plan to move. We will doubtlessly see costs spiral and fewer savings than he promises."" Tim Donovan, Political Editor, BBC News, London Moving HQ from the heart of the city to east London might seem at first glance a dramatic, if not over-dramatic, response to the financially straitened times faced by the mayor. Yet he argues it needs to be about people, not places. As well as enabling him to protect jobs, it looks ahead to a post-Covid world where fewer organisations and fewer employees will be quite as wedded to their offices and their brass nameplates. Some will feel it diminishes the status of the mayoralty to up sticks and shuffle downstream to an area of the capital which feels a bit remote - and is, let's face it, a work in progress. On the other hand, that is precisely the point. Regenerating the Royal Docks is a post-Olympic mayoral policy priority once backed by one Boris Johnson. So what impact could anchoring the seat of London government there have? There are swathes of public land (a lot of it owned by the GLA) begging for development. The Crystal nestles beneath an under-used cable car, and the ExCel Centre, City Airport, Newham Council's HQ, the University of East London and a new Crossrail station are nearby. Things are happening. This could help make things happen even faster. Practically as well as symbolically it could prove an exciting and transformative journey.

Fact-checking the closing days,"After months of bitter campaigning - and plenty of spin and distortion of the facts - the US election has come to an end. We've been fact-checking the candidates throughout, and here is our selection from the final week of the campaign. Donald Trump has been far more active on the campaign trail over the past few days, with a punishing schedule of rallies in key states. There's been no let-up of his repetition of false claims about the pandemic, his record in office and the integrity of postal voting. Mr Biden has appeared in public far less, but he's also presented fact-checking challenges and often misrepresented the economy under President Trump. Verdict:  This is not correct. Only in a few states can you change your vote after you've submitted a postal ballot. There are just a handful of states - including Michigan, Connecticut, Minnesota, New York and Wisconsin - where your postal vote can be cancelled after it has been submitted. In these states, you can then either request a new postal ballot or vote in person. Most states will allow you to vote in person if you've been sent a postal vote but haven't returned it. Some of these ballots have to be counted last to make sure no-one votes twice. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Verdict:  Only after the onset of the pandemic did economic growth take a nose-dive. It has subsequently experienced a strong recovery. The latest numbers show economic output surged by an annualised 33% in the third quarter of 2020, following a record fall as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the economy has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Prior to the pandemic, during President Trump's first three years in office,he oversaw an annual average growth of 2.5%. The last three years of the Obama administration saw a similar level of growth (2.3%). Mr Trump has said the recent recovery in growth is ""the biggest in the history of our country by almost triple... that's bigger than any nation"". This isn't right. Over the third quarter period (July-September) this year,the economy grew by 7.4% in the US(33.1% is the annualised figure). This is less than Germany, Italy and the eurozone as a whole. If you look at economic growth from the start of the pandemic to the present, the US has done better than Europe but ""worse that China and some other Asian economies"" such as South Korea, says Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics. Verdict: The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) does not make this projection, nor do others. Mr Biden may have been referring to a projection, not by the CDC, but from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. However, the 100,000 figure Mr Biden quotes is significantly above the IHME's latest estimate that 62,000 lives would be saved by the end of January 2021, if mask-wearing was almost universal. The CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings, events and gatherings, to help stop the spread of coronavirus. Verdict: This needs context. Joe Biden does want to end the cash bail system, but Mr Trump is wrong about its impact. Joe Biden has pledged to end cash bail - the deposit a defendant pays to avoid being kept in detention while awaiting trial. His website says: ""The cash bail system incarcerates people who are presumed innocent."" There are about 450,000 individuals currently detained before trial. However, a significant proportion of these are not given the option of bail - in particular those charged with serious crimes. So Mr Trump's figure of 400,000 is too high, say experts. And it's also not correct to call all the people who can't afford to pay bail ""dangerous criminals"". ""Cash bail results in detention based on inability to pay. As a result, a low-risk indigent person may be detained and a high-risk wealthy person may be released,"" says Prof Crystal Yang at Harvard University. Verdict: This is true, according to a study. The context for this claim is that Mr Biden has criticised big cuts in taxes under the Trump administration that have led to companies and wealthy individuals paying substantially less. In 2018, 91 of the top 500 companies in the US effectively paid no tax, according to a report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Despite making almost $80bn in pre-tax income, some companies paid no taxes, as the US corporate tax code ""lowers the bar for the amount of tax avoidance it takes to get you down to zero"", according to the Institute. The companies paying zero tax included Amazon and Starbucks.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president.""

Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader.

The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

'A mask over my mouth feels like my attacker's hand',"A rape survivor is calling for government to ""educate"" the public about face-covering exemptions, as England moves into a second lockdown. Having her mouth covered still prompts traumatic flashbacks for Georgina Fallows, who was attacked some years ago. And now, she feels re-traumatised by being verbally abused in public when she doesn't wear a mask. She has written to ministers with seven mental-health and disability charities. They are asking the government to promote a ""recognised badge [or] identifier to signify the wearer as exempt"". But, the letter states, a badge ""is no substitute for greater public understanding"" of why people might not be able to wear face coverings and that this reason may be invisible. ""My attacker literally pulled me off the street and raped me,"" Ms Fallows says. ""Having something in front of my mouth feels like his hand."" She has severe post-traumatic stress disorder and flashbacks, sometimes so extreme she has been sedated by paramedics. And she has waived her right to anonymity in order to campaign for greater awareness. Face coverings are mandatory in most indoor public spaces in England, including shops and public transport. But there are exemptions for people for whom ""putting on, wearing or removing a face covering"" will cause ""severe distress"". People who cannot wear a mask because of a physical or mental illness or disability are also exempt. There is a note that can be downloaded from the government website. But Ms Fallows is concerned it is not viewed as ""official"". And when she has shown her exemption pass after being challenged, people will often not accept it. Man with chronic asthma 'forced' to wear mask on plane What are the rules on face coverings? The 30-year-old solicitor has been ""screamed at"" for not wearing a mask. And one woman accused ""people like me of killing her father"". There are also fears the notes could be misused by people who do not have a valid reason not to wear a face covering. Ms Fallows wants government to consider backing the Hidden Disabilities charity's sunflower lanyard, which is already being used for this purpose and is widely recognised. For now, though, she avoids shops and transport wherever possible for fear of being verbally abused. ""People think it's just a bit uncomfortable,"" wearing a mask. But for Ms Fallows, it can be a ""medical emergency"", resulting in three- or four-hour flashbacks that end with her being restrained and unconscious. And it is a problem shared by people with a range of other mental-health conditions, disabilities, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. The letter, sent to Public Health Minister Jo Churchill, Disability Minister Justin Tomlinson and former Disability Minister Penny Mordaunt, was co-signed by charities including Mind, Sense, Alzheimer's Society and Disability Rights UK. A  Disability Rights UK survey of 350 people uncovered reports of people fearing hate crimes and feeling like prisoners in their own homes. Difficulties wearing face coverings particularly affect people with mental-health conditions, sensory disorders and hidden disabilities such as autism, its research suggests. Widespread misinformation online has suggested face coverings can physically impair breathing. The British Lung Foundation says: ""Wearing a mask does not reduce a person's oxygen supply or cause a build-up of carbon dioxide. ""You may have read stories that say that it can - but this isn't true."" But wearing a face covering can give people a psychological perception of heightened breathlessness. And Ms Fallows says those who do not wear one ""through choice... do a genuine disservice to those who 'cannot' wear one and are exempt"". ""They make it easier for those who are sceptical of the exemptions to case aspersions on those who qualify"".

Sunak 'must come up with six-month economy plan',"Labour has urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to come up with a six-month plan to get the country through the economic challenges of coronavirus. He announced at the weekend that furlough would last until the English lockdown is due to end, on 2 December. But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds called this ""last-minute"" and demanded less ""panicked"" decision-making. Mr Sunak has said he will ""do whatever it takes"" to protect jobs and businesses during the pandemic. Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Spending review dropped amid Covid uncertainty Furlough - a UK-wide scheme paying up to 80% of people's wages, to a maximum value of Â£2,500 a month - was due to conclude on 31 October. But it was extended to coincide with the English lockdown announced at the weekend, which will see pubs, restaurants, gyms and non-essential shops close for four weeks from Thursday - if MPs back this in a vote on Wednesday. Ms Dodds is asking an urgent question in the House of Commons later on what longer-term support the government is planning to offer businesses and individuals. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have had very panicked, last-minute decision-making."" Ms Dodds added that the change had happened ""just five hours before"" the previous furlough cut-off point, and that self-employed people ""apparently"" had been ""completely forgotten about"" until the government announced extra help for them on Monday. She also said: ""The chancellor's stubborn refusal to address problems of his own making until the last possible minute is risking lives, costing jobs and causing chaos in the middle of a pandemic. ""Businesses need certainty if we're to avoid a 1980s-style jobs crisis, not endless chopping and changing by a chancellor who is always playing catch-up."" Ms Dodds said Mr Sunak should meet politicians from other parties and set out a ""proper, strategic plan for the next six months that gives workers and businesses the certainty they need"". Meanwhile, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called for ""clarity"" on whether furlough will continue in Scotland after 2 December, should lockdown-type measures be imposed there which go beyond that date. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told Sky News the UK government would ""do whatever we can to continue to support Scotland"". And the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""If other parts of the UK decide to go into measures that require direct economic support, we will of course make [furlough funding] available to them."" Announcing the extension of furlough on Saturday, Mr Sunak said: ""I have always said that we will do whatever it takes as the situation evolves. ""Now, as restrictions get tougher, we are taking steps to provide further financial support to protect jobs and businesses. These changes will provide a vital safety net for people across the UK."" Last month, the chancellor cancelled this autumn's Comprehensive Spending Review, which would have set out government departments' budgets for the next few years. Citing the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, he replaced this with a one-year review, scheduled to take place later this month.

'It has been the toughest year I've ever had',"Will Watts runs the Fossil Shop in Scarborough The new lockdown in England means all ""non-essential"" retailers, such as clothing and electronics stores and tourist shops, will have to shut from Thursday. It has left many thousands of shops scrambling to adapt. We spoke to some of them about how they're trying to prepare for the disruption. When Will Watts had to mothball his coastal tour business during the first lockdown, he decided to fulfil a long-held dream - opening his own fossil shop in Scarborough in Yorkshire. After nine weeks setting it up and much investment, he opened in late October and saw strong sales over the half-term break. But cruelly, within a week the prime minister had called another national lockdown, meaning that from this Thursday Will must shut his new store to the public. ""It has been the toughest year I've ever had,"" he tells the BBC. ""It does make you question why you do what you do."" Some things will be easier than in the first shutdown in March - for example, all non-essential shops can offer deliveries and click-and-collect, while the newly extended furlough scheme will be up and running from day one. And while a full list is yet to be published, it seems a slightly wider range of retailerswill be allowed to stay open,external, with garden centres joining the usual suspects like supermarkets and food shops. Clothing stores Electronics stores Vehicle showrooms Travel agents Betting shops Auction houses Tailors Car washes Tobacco Vape shops The government will publish a more detailed list in due course But, as Will points out, lockdown two falls in the vital period running up to Christmas and ""gift stuff is a big part of what we do"". ""We can do deliveries and click-and-collect but we are selling unique things that people want to see and feel before they buy,"" he says. ""When you go online you are in direct competition with Ebay and Amazon,"" he adds. Naturally he's worried about the future, as he has just moved into a new building and has his staff to think about. ""I think we can make it but there is a slight nagging doubt that we won't."" Helen Sheward, owner of Gently stores in South East London According to the British Retail Consortium, the forced closure of shops in November will cost about Â£2bn per week in lost sales as we enter the ""all-important"" Christmas period. That's at a time when shop sales are already well below pre-pandemic levels. Helen Sheward, who runs Gently, a chain of four gift and homeware shops in South East London, was hoping to make up some of her losses from the first lockdown this Christmas, but that won't happen now. ""People don't realise we've bought all of our stock for Christmas already,"" she says. ""I cried all weekend after I heard the prime minister's announcement."" Second England lockdown 'a devastating blow' She also thinks competing online won't be easy, but she plans to go to town on social media and use her shop windows as a marketing tool. ""In the last lockdown the shutters were down, but this time we are going to open them every morning so people can browse through the windows. We will keep refreshing the displays to showcase the products."" Her six staff will go back on furlough, meaning she will be running the business single-handed in a lockdown she fears could last well into December. ""It's a big ask for me - we have two kids, my husband works. But you put it in perspective and you think, we will survive and there are far more people living with much greater problems than this."" William Skinner, managing director of tailor Dege & Skinner On top of the furlough scheme, which covers 80% of employees' wages, the government is offering shops forced to close cash grants of up to Â£3,000. However, the Federation of Small Businesses says for many this is not even enough to cover rent, while small business owners as company directors get little by way of income support. William Skinner, managing director of Savile Row tailor Dege & Skinner, thinks the government shouldn't be closing shops at all, arguing they aren't a major source of infection with proper social distancing in place. But he is optimistic about his 155-year-old business's chances: ""We've survived two world wars and we can survive this."" On the downside, he says the business will lose what little passing trade it had left after the first lockdown. In addition, fewer business people will need bespoke suits for business trips due to the travel ban. But he says the company learned valuable lessons in the first lockdown - for example, its tailors can now make suits and coats easily from home, although the cutting still takes place at the shop. The firm has also moved to an appointments-based system for fittings which he hopes can continue with the right safety precautions in place. William furloughed 17 of his 21 staff in the last lockdown but expects the figure will be closer to 10 or 11 this time. ""Now everyone is familiar and aware and going into it with more open eyes,"" he says of the second lockdown. ""But the question is how long will this last? Will we get a vaccine? Will the virus peter out? I am not sure.""

Manhunt after 'Islamist terror' attack in ViennaAustrian police hunt at least one suspect after a shooting that kills four people in the capital.Europe,"This video can not be played Eyewitness Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister talks about the 2 November Vienna attack Austrian police have urged people to stay indoors as they hunt for suspects after a multiple gun attack in the capital Vienna that killed four people. A gunman shot dead by police has been identified as a 20-year-old ""Islamist terrorist"" who was released early from jail in December. Two men and two women died of their wounds after gunmen opened fire at six locations in the city centre on Monday evening. Twenty-two people were wounded. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the four who died were an elderly woman, an elderly man, a young male passer-by and a waitress. Witnesses described how the gunmen had opened fire on people outside bars and chased them as they fled inside. It was clearly an attack driven by ""hatred of our way of life, our democracy"", the chancellor said. He earlier spoke of a ""repulsive terror attack"". The nation was engaged not in a battle between Christians and Muslims, he stressed, but ""between civilisation and barbarism"". Austria's political leaders honoured the victims in Vienna as the nation mourned Interior Minister Karl Nehammer described the dead gunman as an ""Islamist terrorist"", jailed for 22 months in April 2019 after trying to get to war-torn Syria to join Islamic State (IS) jihadists. The 20-year-old had been released early last December under more lenient terms for young adults. Mr Nehammer urged Austrians to ""please stay at home if possible"" during the police operation and ""avoid the inner city"". Children should stay at home, not go to school on Tuesday, he said. Austrian daily Der Standard reports that 90% of shops in the city centre are now shut. The victims were in a city centre area busy with people in bars and restaurants, near Vienna's central synagogue. Police cordoned off some streets and brought in reinforcements. They are also being helped by the Austrian army. In pictures: Scene of gun attack in Vienna Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat Addressing a news conference, Mr Nehammer said police had searched the home of the dead gunman and seized video material. He had been wearing a fake explosive belt, police said. The man was originally from North Macedonia and had a previous conviction for terrorist association, Mr Nehammer said. He had both Austrian and Macedonian citizenship. Several arrests were made during searches of 15 nearby homes. Two suspects were also arrested in St PÃ¶lten, a town to the west of Vienna. Bars were targeted in a popular area of Vienna known as the ""Bermuda Triangle"" The Vienna shooting comes after a spate of Islamist militant attacks in France. Last month French history teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded outside a school in a suburb of Paris. Then, as the government launched new measures to tackle militant Islam, a Tunisian man fatally stabbed three people in a cathedral in Nice. The worst IS attack in Europe in recent years was in November 2015, when gunmen killed 130 people in Paris. Police flooded into several central streets where shooting took place Mr Nehammer said at least one ""heavily armed and dangerous"" attacker was believed to be still at large. Officials were quoted as saying there could have been as many as four attackers. The attack came hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were enjoying drinks and eating out before a midnight curfew. Police named six crime scenes in central Vienna: Seitenstettengasse and nearby Morzinplatz, Salzgries, Fleischmarkt, Bauernmarkt and Graben. The suspect was shot dead near St Rupert's Church. Austria's government announced three days of national mourning, starting immediately. Flags flew at half-mast and a minute's silence was held at midday. Schools are to hold a minute's silence for the victims on Wednesday morning. Police say the incident began at about 20:00 (19:00 GMT), near the Seitenstettengasse synagogue, when a heavily armed man opened fire on people outside cafes and restaurants. Vienna Community Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least two gunmen shoot at least 100 rounds in front of the synagogue compound. ""They were attacking the guests of bars and pubs. People were jumping and running, falling over the tables, running inside the bars followed by the gunmen also running inside the bars,"" he told London radio station LBC. Members of the special forces quickly arrived at the scene. One policeman was shot and critically wounded before the perpetrator, armed with an automatic rifle, a pistol and a machete, was, in the police chief's words, ""neutralised"" at 20:09. Police increased security outside the interior ministry after the shooting Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch said the synagogue was closed at the time. Footage posted on social media showed scenes of chaos as people ran through the streets with gunshots ringing out in the background. Witness Chris Zhao, who was in a nearby restaurant, told the BBC: ""We heard noises that sounded like firecrackers. We heard about 20 to 30 and we thought that to be actually gunfire. Sadly, we also saw a body lying down the street next to us."" Guests left the Vienna State Opera under the watch of armed police A major anti-terrorist operation swung into action and police set up roadblocks around the city centre. Barbara Lovett, who was in the Vienna State Opera at the time, said that when the evening performance ended the manager had told the audience of the attack and that they could not leave. ""The players came back out from the dressing rooms, in their normal clothes, sat down in the orchestra pit and played for another 20 minutes,"" she told the BBC. ""They played the German national anthem, which used to be the Austrian anthem - the Emperor Quartet by Haydn."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Police in the neighbouring Czech Republic said they were carrying out random checks on the border with Austria in case the attackers fled in that direction. European leaders strongly condemned the shooting. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply shocked by the terrible attacks"" while Germany's Angela Merkel said ""the fight against Islamist terrorism is our common struggle"". Austria had until now been spared the sort of attacks that have hit other European countries. French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe must not ""give up"" in the face of attacks. Last week he described the murder of three people in Nice as an ""Islamist terrorist attack"". Home Secretary Priti Patel said the UK would ""stand ready to support in any way we can"". US President Donald Trump - on the campaign trail ahead of Tuesday's election - described it as ""yet another vile act of terrorism in Europe"". His Democratic challenger Joe Biden condemned the ""horrific terrorist attack"", adding: ""We must all stand united against hate and violence.""

"City Hall to move from central London to East EndThe opposition leader describes the mayor's plans to move to The Crystal in Newham as ""half-baked"".London","City Hall was designed by Sir Norman Foster Sadiq Khan is to move London's government from City Hall to a new headquarters in the east of the city. The Crystal building in the Royal Docks in Newham will become the home of the mayor and the Greater London Authority (GLA) at the end of next year. More than 1,000 employees of the GLA group were informed on Tuesday about the decision, which followed a consultation over the summer. The GLA's Conservative leader Susan Hall said the plan was ""flawed"". A spokesman for the Mayor of London said the move would save more than Â£60m over the next five years. City Hall, which was designed by Sir Norman Foster, has been the official home of the GLA since it was opened by the Queen in 2002 and occupies a prominent position on the south bank of the Thames. The GLA has leased the building from a private landlord - the Kuwaiti-owned St Martin's Property Group - at a cost of more than Â£11m a year. Howeverthe terms of the 25-year-old lease allow for a breakin the contract at the end of 2021. Faced by Mr Khan's threat in the summer to move out of City Hall, the landlords offered an undisclosed reduction in the annual rent, but negotiations failed to produce a deal. The Crystal was opened in 2012 by electronics giant Siemens which cited it as an exemplar of sustainable design. It is located near London's cross-river cable car, which was opened by Boris Johnson when he was mayor. Siemenssold the building to the GLA,externalin June 2019. The Crystal was opened in 2012, having been commissioned by Siemens as an exemplar of sustainable design. The Crystal is close to a new station on the Crossrail route - though the Elizabeth Line, as it will be known, is not currently due to open until 2022. The glass building has less capacity than City Hall and some GLA staff will instead be relocated to the London Fire Brigade's headquarters in Union Street, Southwark. Millions of pounds will have to be spent to upgrade security for the mayor and members of the London Assembly. The London Fire Brigade will still be asked to look for savings by November Mr Khan would be expected to divide his time between the Crystal and Union Street, although meetings of the London Assembly would take place in the new headquarters. Over the summer, the Conservative group on the London Assembly claimed Mr Khan had exaggerated the potential savings from the move. A subsequent review of the options by the GLA found the savings would actually be greater than first thought. Front-line police services will be protected from any potential cuts, Sadiq Khan said The mayor told the London Assembly recently that the move was necessary because of government under-funding. Moving London's government from its central location to a site in Newham to the east of the capital has been criticised by some as likely to diminish its role and status. Others - including Labour-run Newham council - maintain it will spur the regeneration of one of the poorest parts of the capital. The mayor says he faces cuts to the GLA, police, fire service and Transport for London (TFL) of more than Â£400m over the next year and his priority is to protect jobs. Covid and Crossrail - why TfL's finances are precarious In response to the confirmation of the move, Conservative leader Ms Hall said she was ""disappointed"" and described it as a ""half-baked plan based on dodgy numbers"". She added: ""The mayor was offered a substantial rent reduction by the landlord of the existing building. ""Instead of accepting it, Khan has chosen a flawed plan to move. We will doubtlessly see costs spiral and fewer savings than he promises."" Tim Donovan, Political Editor, BBC News, London Moving HQ from the heart of the city to east London might seem at first glance a dramatic, if not over-dramatic, response to the financially straitened times faced by the mayor. Yet he argues it needs to be about people, not places. As well as enabling him to protect jobs, it looks ahead to a post-Covid world where fewer organisations and fewer employees will be quite as wedded to their offices and their brass nameplates. Some will feel it diminishes the status of the mayoralty to up sticks and shuffle downstream to an area of the capital which feels a bit remote - and is, let's face it, a work in progress. On the other hand, that is precisely the point. Regenerating the Royal Docks is a post-Olympic mayoral policy priority once backed by one Boris Johnson. So what impact could anchoring the seat of London government there have? There are swathes of public land (a lot of it owned by the GLA) begging for development. The Crystal nestles beneath an under-used cable car, and the ExCel Centre, City Airport, Newham Council's HQ, the University of East London and a new Crossrail station are nearby. Things are happening. This could help make things happen even faster. Practically as well as symbolically it could prove an exciting and transformative journey.

"Third of staff 'fear catching Covid at work'The poorest paid are particularly worried - but are also the least likely to speak up, research finds.BusinessComments","More than a third of workers are concerned about catching coronavirus on the job, according to a study by  the Resolution Foundation think tank. The poorest paid are particularly worried, the research found, but also the least likely to speak up about it. Younger workers are also less likely to raise a complaint, the Resolution Foundation said. The widespread concerns come despite government advice on making workplaces Covid-secure, researchers said. Lindsay Judge, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""More than one-in-three workers are worried about catching coronavirus on the job, despite the extensive steps employers have taken to make workplaces Covid-secure. ""Given many workers' limited ability to get employers to address Covid concerns, the UK needs a strong enforcement regime to ensure that workplaces are as safe as can be. ""But instead health and safety resources have been cut, inspections have been slow, and Covid-related enforcement notices are few and far between."" The researchers said they were also concerned about the reduction in funding at the Health and Safety Executive. The HSE's funding for each site it has the right to inspect has shrunk from Â£224 a decade ago to Â£100 for the current financial year, according to the report. ""The Foundation says policy makers should overturn the current view that health and safety is a 'brake on business' and take a more proactive approach to enforcement in the face of the pandemic,"" it said. A government spokesman said Â£14m of funding was given to the HSE to combat coronavirus earlier this year. An HSE spokesperson said: ""We thank the Resolution Foundation for its report, and with our partners across government we will examine its findings. We welcome the acknowledgement of our increased activity and share the commitment to ensure all employees have a voice. ""Making sure Great Britain's workplaces are Covid-Secure is our priority; this effort will not be affected by recent additional restrictions announced across England, Scotland and Wales. We will work with stakeholders to deliver workplace health and safety during this coronavirus pandemic. ""Inspection and putting duty holders on the spot is just one part of a wide ranging regulatory approach. We use a number of different ways to gather intelligence and reach out to businesses with a combination of site visits, phone calls and through collection of supporting visual evidence such as photos and video footage."" While a new lockdown in England is planned from Thursday, up to half of workers could still be going to work in jobs such as essential retail, education and health, Resolution said.

It includes: Hull Trains will stop its four services a day to and from London on 5 November due to the new lockdown in England. That's the second time it has felt the need to do this - the first suspension saw services paused on 29 March and reopened with a reduced timetable on 21 August. Hull Trains is thought to be Britain's smallest train company with about 130 staff. It started in 2000 and usually operates 92 direct services a week between Hull and London. The RMT union wants to see the government offering financial support. Read more about the storyhere.

""We have a very serious situation,"" Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven warned, saying the virus was ""going in the wrong direction"". Sweden has reported 31 Covid deaths since Friday, taking the death toll to 5,969 - far higher than its neighbours. Unlike them, Sweden has never imposed a nationwide lockdown. Mr LÃ¶fven also announced stricter recommendations - including working from home if possible and avoiding public transport - for another three regions: Halland, Ãrebro and JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping, This means that about 70% of the country's 10.5 million people now live under the new government guidelines, which are voluntary.

We answer some of your questions about the rapidly changing rules and restrictions in the UK.  As we reported earlier, there have been calls for youth sport to be exempt when thenew restrictions come into effectin England on Thursday. But the governmentâs chief scientific adviser says the decision to suspend children's sport is a matter for ministers. Sir Patrick Vallance told MPs: âWe just donât go down to
that level of individual activities. âTheyâve had advice from us in terms of the general principles
and some of the areas but not down to individual, specific activities like
that.â Appearing alongside him at the Commons science select committee, Prof Chris Whitty agreed, saying it
was the job of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to âgive the broad adviceâ.

But, when Evie Bowles could not have the big party she had planned due to coronavirus restrictions, her grandson had another idea to mark the occasion. He took to social media to ask people to send a birthday card to Evie at her care home in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh. The post went viral and more than 1,000 people from around the world sent cards to celebrate her big day. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor British Cycling chief Julie Harrington has written to the culture secretary to ask for ""small outdoor groups and club-led"" activities to be allowed to continue during England's lockdown. Writing on behalf of GB Cycling, British Triathlon & England Athletics she said: ""We have, largely thanks to the work of volunteers, been able to reintroduce group rides and runs, club activity, adapted competitions and coaching sessions. And given that all activities take place outdoors, participants are able to maintain appropriate social distancing at all times, we believe that the risk of transmission through taking part is limited."" Harrington added that while training alone or with members of their household might work for some, many people rely on the support and encouragement of a friendly group, and may ""stop altogether"" without it. ""Prohibiting group activities will deny millions of people the right to be active at a time when they need it most,"" she said. A leading imam has joined other faith leaders in calling for the government to reconsider its restrictions on places of worship during the second national lockdown in England. Qari Asim, of Makkah Mosque in Leeds, said finding a way of keeping mosques open was of ""paramount importance"" and should be considered ""essential"", along with other services. Places of worship will be closed from Thursday, unless they are being used for funerals, individual prayer, formal childcare or other essential voluntary and public services such as support groups. Imam Asim, who is a government adviser on Islamophobia, said: ""The complete cessation of communal prayer and worship is a matter of concern for Muslim communities."" He added there was no evidence of Covid outbreaks in mosques and said they ""serve not only the spiritual and religious needs of the Muslim community but also they help maintain the mental wellbeing of the community as well"". Prof Chris Whitty says the new national lockdown in England
will reduce the R number - the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to - below 1 if the measures are followed by the public. England's chief medical officer, speaking to MPs, says that would ""make a huge differenceâ but he wants to
reiterate that the virus will still be a problem that âwe need to see through winterâ. He adds that this doesnât mean that the country will need to stay in lockdown through winter but âweâll need to be doing things that keep the rates downâ. He adds that young people have âbrought the rates down in their
own age groups by their actions â that has been remarkableâ. Asked whether the restrictions will be lifted on 2 December,
he says that is a decision for ministers but the aim of the lockdown is to get
rates down so âwe can move far enough that itâs a realistic possibility to move
into a different state of play at that pointâ. Reality Check As we've been reporting, chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance are being questioned by MPs about the figures they gave at Saturdayâs briefing when the prime minister announced the new lockdown for England. There has been much focus on the chart above, which included one model that gave a scenario of 4,000 people a day dying of coronavirus over winter (roughly four times the figure during the worst days of the first wave). Sir Patrick said he hoped the focus had not been on the longer term models in that chart, but on the six week forecasts in other charts in the presentation. Prof Whitty said âI have never used anything beyond six weeks in anything I have ever said to any minister on this issueâ, but Sir Patrick then said that the chart had indeed been shown to the prime minister. There has also been criticism that the curves in the chart were all produced at the start of October, just after the rapid rise in cases that followed students returning to university. These were based on models for worst-case planning that assumed no changes in policy or behaviour. But, since then, England has introduced a three-tier system of stricter measures and the epidemic has grown more slowly than the curves assumed it would. Indeed, on the day the chart was used, an average of 215 deaths had been reported each day in the previous week. That was far below the 1,000 a day envisioned by the most pessimistic model. David PorterScotland Westminster editor There has been much discussion of the furlough scheme today, and UK government sources now insist the  scheme and funding will be extended to the devolved administrations if needed because of further lockdowns. A source said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement yesterday, in which he said ""the furlough scheme is a UK-wide scheme"", still stood. The Treasury is now ""dotting the i's and crossing the t's"", the source said, although they added a formal statement may not come today. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay was questioned on the matter earlier in the House of Commons and echoed the prime minister's words that the furlough was a UK-wide scheme. You can read more about the rowhere. Prof Chris Whitty has defended England's Test and Trace system after being questioned about its effectiveness by MPs. ""Test and trace has gone from a standing start to a long way
down the track,"" says England's chief medical officer, however he adds that once
you have very high rates of transmission of the virus it is not as effective. âWeâve all said from the very beginning this is most
effective when the rates are lowâ. He says Test and Trace will probably be having âa bigger
effectâ on areas which have lower rates right now, than those in the areas where it is higher. He adds that a âsecondary gainâ of the new lockdown in England is that
it âwill bring the numbers down to the rate where this becomes a much bigger
part of the solutionâ. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific officer, adds that across Europe âeven very
effective test and trace systems do not work well at high prevalenceâ. Back to the Science and Technology Committee now, and Prof Chris Whitty was asked why, given improvements in treatments for coroanvirus patients, the number of deaths this winter could still reach the levels of the first peak. England's chief medical adviser replied that treatments like the drug dexamethasone ""reduce mortality"" but ""they are not going to take it right the way down"". âSome people, sadly, will come into hospital and whatever you do they will die,"" he told MPs. âI think the idea thereâs been a huge transformation
in the mortality rate would not be supported by the data."" He added that he was ""confident"" there had been a reduction in the mortality rate but ""the best we can hope for"" is that it has halved. Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said she does not plan to make any changes to her Covid restrictions before next week. The first minister saidshe wanted to stick to the timetable under which new measures, that came into effect this week, will be reviewed next Tuesday. Sturgeon had indicated on Monday that questions over furlough funding meant she may need to decide within days whether to take tougher steps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said support will be available in the future. At her daily press conference Sturgeon said: ""We are going to stick, if we can, to our scheduled review period. That is probably, on balance, the best thing to do."" While Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Valance have been explaining the current situation to MPs, some changes to the rules in Wales have been announced. Up to four people will be able to meet  in pubs, cafes and restaurants in in the countryafter its firebreak lockdown ends on 9 November. The 22:00 curfew on alcohol sales will remain in place. First Minister Mark Drakeford asked people to visit the venues in the smallest groups possible. He said reopening would be ""subject to strict protections discussed with the hospitality sector, including advance booking, time-limited slots and verified identification"". ""Our clear advice to people in Wales is that we should visit these places in as small a group as possible, and for many, this will only be the people we live with,"" he told the Welsh Parliament. ""But we have listened to those young people, and single people especially have told us how important it is for them to meet some friends and other family members."" England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, says he understands why some documents about virus scenarios are not put into the public domain because they can create unnecessary worry. He was asked whetherthe government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario""- which is used by
officials and the NHS to plan for the months ahead - would be published. Speaking to MPs, he says: ""Thereâs a danger with these extreme forward projections that
people then misinterpret them as âthis is what itâs going to happenââ. He says this can cause people to get âunduly worriedâ by
something when the whole point of a reasonable worst case scenario
is to say âwe need to stop this happeningâ. However, he adds that heâs âin favour of publishing as much as
possibleâ. The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has defended presenting modelling to the public that suggested deaths could reach more than 4,000 a day if no action was taken. Labour MP Graham Stringer suggested that without caveats this data could frighten people, who did not fully understand the context. Sir Patrick said the aim was to give as much information as possible, not to frighten people but he acknowledged models looking further ahead were less reliable. Prof Chris Whitty says the three-tier system of restrictions in England has âslowed
things down from where they would have been otherwiseâ. âI am confident that the tier two has had an effect and that
the tier three has had a bigger effect,â he says. Prof Whitty says he believes infection rates are âsubstantially lower then
they would have beenâ without those tighter measures being implemented in large parts of the country. But the measures have not managed to reduce the reproduction rate of the virus - or R number - below 1, at which point it would decline in the population. However, he did say it had got closer to 1. ""That's due to the remarkable work of individuals taking really quite difficult social decisions for quite prolonged periods,"" he said. He also said there was âno evidenceâ the R number was falling below 1 in the older age groups. What is the R number?Here is a reminder. Prof Chris Whitty says putting exact dates on virus projections
is âalmost impossibleâ and he says none of the government's scientific advisers would say âthis
is definitely going to happen on this dateâ. But he says the chances that things are ""likely to improve without
actionâ once the R number - the rate at which the virus is spreading - goes above 1 and youâre heading into the winter
months âare quite lowâ. He tells MPs: ""If youâre giving advice to ministers, that has to be the
advice you give. Ministers then have to make decisions not just on that advice.
They have to use multiple other things."" He says the government's scientific advisers give âone
strand of adviceâ but he believes âquite strongly"" that these ""deeply difficult
societal measures fundamentally are decided by ministersâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

That's the second time it has felt the need to do this - the first suspension saw services paused on 29 March and reopened with a reduced timetable on 21 August. Hull Trains is thought to be Britain's smallest train company with about 130 staff. It started in 2000 and usually operates 92 direct services a week between Hull and London.

Sweden has reported 31 Covid deaths since Friday, taking the death toll to 5,969 - far higher than its neighbours. Unlike them, Sweden has never imposed a nationwide lockdown.

We answer some of your questions about the rapidly changing rules and restrictions in the UK.  As we reported earlier, there have been calls for youth sport to be exempt when thenew restrictions come into effectin England on Thursday. But the governmentâs chief scientific adviser says the decision to suspend children's sport is a matter for ministers. Sir Patrick Vallance told MPs: âWe just donât go down to
that level of individual activities. âTheyâve had advice from us in terms of the general principles
and some of the areas but not down to individual, specific activities like
that.â Appearing alongside him at the Commons science select committee, Prof Chris Whitty agreed, saying it
was the job of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to âgive the broad adviceâ.

But, when Evie Bowles could not have the big party she had planned due to coronavirus restrictions, her grandson had another idea to mark the occasion. He took to social media to ask people to send a birthday card to Evie at her care home in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh. The post went viral and more than 1,000 people from around the world sent cards to celebrate her big day. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor British Cycling chief Julie Harrington has written to the culture secretary to ask for ""small outdoor groups and club-led"" activities to be allowed to continue during England's lockdown. Writing on behalf of GB Cycling, British Triathlon & England Athletics she said: ""We have, largely thanks to the work of volunteers, been able to reintroduce group rides and runs, club activity, adapted competitions and coaching sessions. And given that all activities take place outdoors, participants are able to maintain appropriate social distancing at all times, we believe that the risk of transmission through taking part is limited."" Harrington added that while training alone or with members of their household might work for some, many people rely on the support and encouragement of a friendly group, and may ""stop altogether"" without it. ""Prohibiting group activities will deny millions of people the right to be active at a time when they need it most,"" she said. A leading imam has joined other faith leaders in calling for the government to reconsider its restrictions on places of worship during the second national lockdown in England. Qari Asim, of Makkah Mosque in Leeds, said finding a way of keeping mosques open was of ""paramount importance"" and should be considered ""essential"", along with other services. Places of worship will be closed from Thursday, unless they are being used for funerals, individual prayer, formal childcare or other essential voluntary and public services such as support groups. Imam Asim, who is a government adviser on Islamophobia, said: ""The complete cessation of communal prayer and worship is a matter of concern for Muslim communities."" He added there was no evidence of Covid outbreaks in mosques and said they ""serve not only the spiritual and religious needs of the Muslim community but also they help maintain the mental wellbeing of the community as well"". Prof Chris Whitty says the new national lockdown in England
will reduce the R number - the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to - below 1 if the measures are followed by the public. England's chief medical officer, speaking to MPs, says that would ""make a huge differenceâ but he wants to
reiterate that the virus will still be a problem that âwe need to see through winterâ. He adds that this doesnât mean that the country will need to stay in lockdown through winter but âweâll need to be doing things that keep the rates downâ. He adds that young people have âbrought the rates down in their
own age groups by their actions â that has been remarkableâ. Asked whether the restrictions will be lifted on 2 December,
he says that is a decision for ministers but the aim of the lockdown is to get
rates down so âwe can move far enough that itâs a realistic possibility to move
into a different state of play at that pointâ. Reality Check As we've been reporting, chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance are being questioned by MPs about the figures they gave at Saturdayâs briefing when the prime minister announced the new lockdown for England. There has been much focus on the chart above, which included one model that gave a scenario of 4,000 people a day dying of coronavirus over winter (roughly four times the figure during the worst days of the first wave). Sir Patrick said he hoped the focus had not been on the longer term models in that chart, but on the six week forecasts in other charts in the presentation. Prof Whitty said âI have never used anything beyond six weeks in anything I have ever said to any minister on this issueâ, but Sir Patrick then said that the chart had indeed been shown to the prime minister. There has also been criticism that the curves in the chart were all produced at the start of October, just after the rapid rise in cases that followed students returning to university. These were based on models for worst-case planning that assumed no changes in policy or behaviour. But, since then, England has introduced a three-tier system of stricter measures and the epidemic has grown more slowly than the curves assumed it would. Indeed, on the day the chart was used, an average of 215 deaths had been reported each day in the previous week. That was far below the 1,000 a day envisioned by the most pessimistic model. David PorterScotland Westminster editor There has been much discussion of the furlough scheme today, and UK government sources now insist the  scheme and funding will be extended to the devolved administrations if needed because of further lockdowns. A source said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement yesterday, in which he said ""the furlough scheme is a UK-wide scheme"", still stood. The Treasury is now ""dotting the i's and crossing the t's"", the source said, although they added a formal statement may not come today. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay was questioned on the matter earlier in the House of Commons and echoed the prime minister's words that the furlough was a UK-wide scheme. You can read more about the rowhere. Prof Chris Whitty has defended England's Test and Trace system after being questioned about its effectiveness by MPs. ""Test and trace has gone from a standing start to a long way
down the track,"" says England's chief medical officer, however he adds that once
you have very high rates of transmission of the virus it is not as effective. âWeâve all said from the very beginning this is most
effective when the rates are lowâ. He says Test and Trace will probably be having âa bigger
effectâ on areas which have lower rates right now, than those in the areas where it is higher. He adds that a âsecondary gainâ of the new lockdown in England is that
it âwill bring the numbers down to the rate where this becomes a much bigger
part of the solutionâ. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific officer, adds that across Europe âeven very
effective test and trace systems do not work well at high prevalenceâ. Back to the Science and Technology Committee now, and Prof Chris Whitty was asked why, given improvements in treatments for coroanvirus patients, the number of deaths this winter could still reach the levels of the first peak. England's chief medical adviser replied that treatments like the drug dexamethasone ""reduce mortality"" but ""they are not going to take it right the way down"". âSome people, sadly, will come into hospital and whatever you do they will die,"" he told MPs. âI think the idea thereâs been a huge transformation
in the mortality rate would not be supported by the data."" He added that he was ""confident"" there had been a reduction in the mortality rate but ""the best we can hope for"" is that it has halved. Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said she does not plan to make any changes to her Covid restrictions before next week. The first minister saidshe wanted to stick to the timetable under which new measures, that came into effect this week, will be reviewed next Tuesday. Sturgeon had indicated on Monday that questions over furlough funding meant she may need to decide within days whether to take tougher steps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said support will be available in the future. At her daily press conference Sturgeon said: ""We are going to stick, if we can, to our scheduled review period. That is probably, on balance, the best thing to do."" While Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Valance have been explaining the current situation to MPs, some changes to the rules in Wales have been announced. Up to four people will be able to meet  in pubs, cafes and restaurants in in the countryafter its firebreak lockdown ends on 9 November. The 22:00 curfew on alcohol sales will remain in place. First Minister Mark Drakeford asked people to visit the venues in the smallest groups possible. He said reopening would be ""subject to strict protections discussed with the hospitality sector, including advance booking, time-limited slots and verified identification"". ""Our clear advice to people in Wales is that we should visit these places in as small a group as possible, and for many, this will only be the people we live with,"" he told the Welsh Parliament. ""But we have listened to those young people, and single people especially have told us how important it is for them to meet some friends and other family members."" England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, says he understands why some documents about virus scenarios are not put into the public domain because they can create unnecessary worry. He was asked whetherthe government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario""- which is used by
officials and the NHS to plan for the months ahead - would be published. Speaking to MPs, he says: ""Thereâs a danger with these extreme forward projections that
people then misinterpret them as âthis is what itâs going to happenââ. He says this can cause people to get âunduly worriedâ by
something when the whole point of a reasonable worst case scenario
is to say âwe need to stop this happeningâ. However, he adds that heâs âin favour of publishing as much as
possibleâ. The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has defended presenting modelling to the public that suggested deaths could reach more than 4,000 a day if no action was taken. Labour MP Graham Stringer suggested that without caveats this data could frighten people, who did not fully understand the context. Sir Patrick said the aim was to give as much information as possible, not to frighten people but he acknowledged models looking further ahead were less reliable. Prof Chris Whitty says the three-tier system of restrictions in England has âslowed
things down from where they would have been otherwiseâ. âI am confident that the tier two has had an effect and that
the tier three has had a bigger effect,â he says. Prof Whitty says he believes infection rates are âsubstantially lower then
they would have beenâ without those tighter measures being implemented in large parts of the country. But the measures have not managed to reduce the reproduction rate of the virus - or R number - below 1, at which point it would decline in the population. However, he did say it had got closer to 1. ""That's due to the remarkable work of individuals taking really quite difficult social decisions for quite prolonged periods,"" he said. He also said there was âno evidenceâ the R number was falling below 1 in the older age groups. What is the R number?Here is a reminder. Prof Chris Whitty says putting exact dates on virus projections
is âalmost impossibleâ and he says none of the government's scientific advisers would say âthis
is definitely going to happen on this dateâ. But he says the chances that things are ""likely to improve without
actionâ once the R number - the rate at which the virus is spreading - goes above 1 and youâre heading into the winter
months âare quite lowâ. He tells MPs: ""If youâre giving advice to ministers, that has to be the
advice you give. Ministers then have to make decisions not just on that advice.
They have to use multiple other things."" He says the government's scientific advisers give âone
strand of adviceâ but he believes âquite strongly"" that these ""deeply difficult
societal measures fundamentally are decided by ministersâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

UK cyber-threat agency confronts Covid-19 attacksNCSC says more than a quarter of incidents it responded to over the past year were coronavirus-related.Technology,"More than a quarter of the incidents which the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) responded to were Covid-related, according to its latest annual report. The review covers the period from September 2019 to August 2020, so the pandemic occupied an even higher proportion of the agency's efforts after the first lockdown began. In total there were 723 incidents of all kinds, marking close to a 10% rise on the previous period. Of those, 194 were Covid-related. Some of the incidents related to countering nation-state attacks, but most were criminal in nature, the GCHQ division reported. It also disclosed that it had thwarted 15,354 campaigns that had used coronavirus themes as a ""lure"" to fool people into clicking on a link or opening an attachment containing malicious software. Some involved fake shops selling PPE (personal protective equipment), test kits and even vaccines. Protecting the NHS and health-related research has been a priority, the report said.. In July, the UK accused Russiaof trying to steal vaccine-related informationthrough cyber-espionage. And officials said they had continued to see an ""ongoing threat"" of states targeting the vaccine research-and-delivery programme. The NCSC said it had scanned more than one million NHS IP (internet protocol) addresses to look for vulnerabilities, and had shared 51,000 indicators of compromise. It has also carried out ""threat hunting"" to look for security risks on connected devices, and worked on the security of the NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app. The NCSC also warned ransomware attacks had become more common. Ransomware locks people out of their computers and demands victims make a blackmail payment to restore access - and even then it is not always granted. The NCSC said it had handled more than three times as many ransomware incidents as in the previous year. These included an attack against Redcar and Cleveland Council which, the officials said, had ""caused considerable damage and disruption"". The report added the NCSC had observed a growing trend for such attacks to be more targeted and aggressive than previously. Rather than just locking people out of access to their data until a ransom was paid, attackers often warned they would embarrass victims if they refused to comply. ""We have seen the threat of data being leaked,"" Paul Chichester, director of operations, told the BBC. Examples included details of staff salaries being published online. This meant victims were at risk even if they have backed up their data. However, the NCSC said the UK did not appear to be as heavily targeted as some countries, because British victims were less likely to pay the attackers. The NCSC has also been working to increase skills and diversity in the cyber-security industry. It said almost 12,000 girls had taken part in its 2020 competition. However, an advert for the government's related CyberFirst campaignwas widely criticised last month for featuring a ballerinaand the slogan ""Fatima's next job could be in cyber"". NCSC has said it was not involved in the creation of the CyberFirst poster The report also highlighted the agency's role in protecting parliament as it became ""virtual"" to prevent hacking of debates or votes.

Thanks for joining us and we will be back tomorrow morning.  The government has publisheda list of businesses which will be allowed to remain open,externalin England during the four-week lockdown. It includes: Hull Trains will stop its four services a day to and from London on 5 November due to the new lockdown in England. That's the second time it has felt the need to do this - the first suspension saw services paused on 29 March and reopened with a reduced timetable on 21 August. Hull Trains is thought to be Britain's smallest train company with about 130 staff. It started in 2000 and usually operates 92 direct services a week between Hull and London. The RMT union wants to see the government offering financial support. Read more about the storyhere. Sweden has not imposed tough restrictions seen elsewhere in Europe Sweden has limited to eight per table the number of people sitting together in cafes and restaurants, amid a sharp rise in coronavirus infections. ""We have a very serious situation,"" Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven warned, saying the virus was ""going in the wrong direction"". Sweden has reported 31 Covid deaths since Friday, taking the death toll to 5,969 - far higher than its neighbours. Unlike them, Sweden has never imposed a nationwide lockdown. Mr LÃ¶fven also announced stricter recommendations - including working from home if possible and avoiding public transport - for another three regions: Halland, Ãrebro and JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping, This means that about 70% of the country's 10.5 million people now live under the new government guidelines, which are voluntary.

We answer some of your questions about the rapidly changing rules and restrictions in the UK.  As we reported earlier, there have been calls for youth sport to be exempt when thenew restrictions come into effectin England on Thursday. But the governmentâs chief scientific adviser says the decision to suspend children's sport is a matter for ministers. Sir Patrick Vallance told MPs: âWe just donât go down to
that level of individual activities. âTheyâve had advice from us in terms of the general principles
and some of the areas but not down to individual, specific activities like
that.â Appearing alongside him at the Commons science select committee, Prof Chris Whitty agreed, saying it
was the job of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to âgive the broad adviceâ. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Celebrating a 100th birthday with thousands of cards Turning 100 is a cause for big celebrations. But, when Evie Bowles could not have the big party she had planned due to coronavirus restrictions, her grandson had another idea to mark the occasion. He took to social media to ask people to send a birthday card to Evie at her care home in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh. The post went viral and more than 1,000 people from around the world sent cards to celebrate her big day. Dan RoanBBC Sports editor British Cycling chief Julie Harrington has written to the culture secretary to ask for ""small outdoor groups and club-led"" activities to be allowed to continue during England's lockdown. Writing on behalf of GB Cycling, British Triathlon & England Athletics she said: ""We have, largely thanks to the work of volunteers, been able to reintroduce group rides and runs, club activity, adapted competitions and coaching sessions. And given that all activities take place outdoors, participants are able to maintain appropriate social distancing at all times, we believe that the risk of transmission through taking part is limited."" Harrington added that while training alone or with members of their household might work for some, many people rely on the support and encouragement of a friendly group, and may ""stop altogether"" without it. ""Prohibiting group activities will deny millions of people the right to be active at a time when they need it most,"" she said. A leading imam has joined other faith leaders in calling for the government to reconsider its restrictions on places of worship during the second national lockdown in England. Qari Asim, of Makkah Mosque in Leeds, said finding a way of keeping mosques open was of ""paramount importance"" and should be considered ""essential"", along with other services. Places of worship will be closed from Thursday, unless they are being used for funerals, individual prayer, formal childcare or other essential voluntary and public services such as support groups. Imam Asim, who is a government adviser on Islamophobia, said: ""The complete cessation of communal prayer and worship is a matter of concern for Muslim communities."" He added there was no evidence of Covid outbreaks in mosques and said they ""serve not only the spiritual and religious needs of the Muslim community but also they help maintain the mental wellbeing of the community as well"". Prof Chris Whitty says the new national lockdown in England
will reduce the R number - the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to - below 1 if the measures are followed by the public. England's chief medical officer, speaking to MPs, says that would ""make a huge differenceâ but he wants to
reiterate that the virus will still be a problem that âwe need to see through winterâ. He adds that this doesnât mean that the country will need to stay in lockdown through winter but âweâll need to be doing things that keep the rates downâ. He adds that young people have âbrought the rates down in their
own age groups by their actions â that has been remarkableâ. Asked whether the restrictions will be lifted on 2 December,
he says that is a decision for ministers but the aim of the lockdown is to get
rates down so âwe can move far enough that itâs a realistic possibility to move
into a different state of play at that pointâ. Reality Check As we've been reporting, chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance are being questioned by MPs about the figures they gave at Saturdayâs briefing when the prime minister announced the new lockdown for England. There has been much focus on the chart above, which included one model that gave a scenario of 4,000 people a day dying of coronavirus over winter (roughly four times the figure during the worst days of the first wave). Sir Patrick said he hoped the focus had not been on the longer term models in that chart, but on the six week forecasts in other charts in the presentation. Prof Whitty said âI have never used anything beyond six weeks in anything I have ever said to any minister on this issueâ, but Sir Patrick then said that the chart had indeed been shown to the prime minister. There has also been criticism that the curves in the chart were all produced at the start of October, just after the rapid rise in cases that followed students returning to university. These were based on models for worst-case planning that assumed no changes in policy or behaviour. But, since then, England has introduced a three-tier system of stricter measures and the epidemic has grown more slowly than the curves assumed it would. Indeed, on the day the chart was used, an average of 215 deaths had been reported each day in the previous week. That was far below the 1,000 a day envisioned by the most pessimistic model. David PorterScotland Westminster editor There has been much discussion of the furlough scheme today, and UK government sources now insist the  scheme and funding will be extended to the devolved administrations if needed because of further lockdowns. A source said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement yesterday, in which he said ""the furlough scheme is a UK-wide scheme"", still stood. The Treasury is now ""dotting the i's and crossing the t's"", the source said, although they added a formal statement may not come today. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay was questioned on the matter earlier in the House of Commons and echoed the prime minister's words that the furlough was a UK-wide scheme. You can read more about the rowhere. Prof Chris Whitty has defended England's Test and Trace system after being questioned about its effectiveness by MPs. ""Test and trace has gone from a standing start to a long way
down the track,"" says England's chief medical officer, however he adds that once
you have very high rates of transmission of the virus it is not as effective. âWeâve all said from the very beginning this is most
effective when the rates are lowâ. He says Test and Trace will probably be having âa bigger
effectâ on areas which have lower rates right now, than those in the areas where it is higher. He adds that a âsecondary gainâ of the new lockdown in England is that
it âwill bring the numbers down to the rate where this becomes a much bigger
part of the solutionâ. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific officer, adds that across Europe âeven very
effective test and trace systems do not work well at high prevalenceâ. Back to the Science and Technology Committee now, and Prof Chris Whitty was asked why, given improvements in treatments for coroanvirus patients, the number of deaths this winter could still reach the levels of the first peak. England's chief medical adviser replied that treatments like the drug dexamethasone ""reduce mortality"" but ""they are not going to take it right the way down"". âSome people, sadly, will come into hospital and whatever you do they will die,"" he told MPs. âI think the idea thereâs been a huge transformation
in the mortality rate would not be supported by the data."" He added that he was ""confident"" there had been a reduction in the mortality rate but ""the best we can hope for"" is that it has halved. Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said she does not plan to make any changes to her Covid restrictions before next week. The first minister saidshe wanted to stick to the timetable under which new measures, that came into effect this week, will be reviewed next Tuesday. Sturgeon had indicated on Monday that questions over furlough funding meant she may need to decide within days whether to take tougher steps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said support will be available in the future. At her daily press conference Sturgeon said: ""We are going to stick, if we can, to our scheduled review period. That is probably, on balance, the best thing to do."" While Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Valance have been explaining the current situation to MPs, some changes to the rules in Wales have been announced. Up to four people will be able to meet  in pubs, cafes and restaurants in in the countryafter its firebreak lockdown ends on 9 November. The 22:00 curfew on alcohol sales will remain in place. First Minister Mark Drakeford asked people to visit the venues in the smallest groups possible. He said reopening would be ""subject to strict protections discussed with the hospitality sector, including advance booking, time-limited slots and verified identification"". ""Our clear advice to people in Wales is that we should visit these places in as small a group as possible, and for many, this will only be the people we live with,"" he told the Welsh Parliament. ""But we have listened to those young people, and single people especially have told us how important it is for them to meet some friends and other family members."" England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, says he understands why some documents about virus scenarios are not put into the public domain because they can create unnecessary worry. He was asked whetherthe government's ""reasonable worst-case scenario""- which is used by
officials and the NHS to plan for the months ahead - would be published. Speaking to MPs, he says: ""Thereâs a danger with these extreme forward projections that
people then misinterpret them as âthis is what itâs going to happenââ. He says this can cause people to get âunduly worriedâ by
something when the whole point of a reasonable worst case scenario
is to say âwe need to stop this happeningâ. However, he adds that heâs âin favour of publishing as much as
possibleâ. The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has defended presenting modelling to the public that suggested deaths could reach more than 4,000 a day if no action was taken. Labour MP Graham Stringer suggested that without caveats this data could frighten people, who did not fully understand the context. Sir Patrick said the aim was to give as much information as possible, not to frighten people but he acknowledged models looking further ahead were less reliable. Prof Chris Whitty says the three-tier system of restrictions in England has âslowed
things down from where they would have been otherwiseâ. âI am confident that the tier two has had an effect and that
the tier three has had a bigger effect,â he says. Prof Whitty says he believes infection rates are âsubstantially lower then
they would have beenâ without those tighter measures being implemented in large parts of the country. But the measures have not managed to reduce the reproduction rate of the virus - or R number - below 1, at which point it would decline in the population. However, he did say it had got closer to 1. ""That's due to the remarkable work of individuals taking really quite difficult social decisions for quite prolonged periods,"" he said. He also said there was âno evidenceâ the R number was falling below 1 in the older age groups. What is the R number?Here is a reminder. Prof Chris Whitty says putting exact dates on virus projections
is âalmost impossibleâ and he says none of the government's scientific advisers would say âthis
is definitely going to happen on this dateâ. But he says the chances that things are ""likely to improve without
actionâ once the R number - the rate at which the virus is spreading - goes above 1 and youâre heading into the winter
months âare quite lowâ. He tells MPs: ""If youâre giving advice to ministers, that has to be the
advice you give. Ministers then have to make decisions not just on that advice.
They have to use multiple other things."" He says the government's scientific advisers give âone
strand of adviceâ but he believes âquite strongly"" that these ""deeply difficult
societal measures fundamentally are decided by ministersâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
'It has been the toughest year I've ever had''Non-essential' retailers have to shut for a month from Thursday and they are scrambling to adapt.,"Will Watts runs the Fossil Shop in Scarborough The new lockdown in England means all ""non-essential"" retailers, such as clothing and electronics stores and tourist shops, will have to shut from Thursday. It has left many thousands of shops scrambling to adapt. We spoke to some of them about how they're trying to prepare for the disruption. When Will Watts had to mothball his coastal tour business during the first lockdown, he decided to fulfil a long-held dream - opening his own fossil shop in Scarborough in Yorkshire. After nine weeks setting it up and much investment, he opened in late October and saw strong sales over the half-term break. But cruelly, within a week the prime minister had called another national lockdown, meaning that from this Thursday Will must shut his new store to the public. ""It has been the toughest year I've ever had,"" he tells the BBC. ""It does make you question why you do what you do."" Some things will be easier than in the first shutdown in March - for example, all non-essential shops can offer deliveries and click-and-collect, while the newly extended furlough scheme will be up and running from day one. And while a full list is yet to be published, it seems a slightly wider range of retailerswill be allowed to stay open,external, with garden centres joining the usual suspects like supermarkets and food shops. Clothing stores Electronics stores Vehicle showrooms Travel agents Betting shops Auction houses Tailors Car washes Tobacco Vape shops The government will publish a more detailed list in due course But, as Will points out, lockdown two falls in the vital period running up to Christmas and ""gift stuff is a big part of what we do"". ""We can do deliveries and click-and-collect but we are selling unique things that people want to see and feel before they buy,"" he says. ""When you go online you are in direct competition with Ebay and Amazon,"" he adds. Naturally he's worried about the future, as he has just moved into a new building and has his staff to think about. ""I think we can make it but there is a slight nagging doubt that we won't."" Helen Sheward, owner of Gently stores in South East London According to the British Retail Consortium, the forced closure of shops in November will cost about Â£2bn per week in lost sales as we enter the ""all-important"" Christmas period. That's at a time when shop sales are already well below pre-pandemic levels. Helen Sheward, who runs Gently, a chain of four gift and homeware shops in South East London, was hoping to make up some of her losses from the first lockdown this Christmas, but that won't happen now. ""People don't realise we've bought all of our stock for Christmas already,"" she says. ""I cried all weekend after I heard the prime minister's announcement."" Second England lockdown 'a devastating blow' She also thinks competing online won't be easy, but she plans to go to town on social media and use her shop windows as a marketing tool. ""In the last lockdown the shutters were down, but this time we are going to open them every morning so people can browse through the windows. We will keep refreshing the displays to showcase the products."" Her six staff will go back on furlough, meaning she will be running the business single-handed in a lockdown she fears could last well into December. ""It's a big ask for me - we have two kids, my husband works. But you put it in perspective and you think, we will survive and there are far more people living with much greater problems than this."" William Skinner, managing director of tailor Dege & Skinner On top of the furlough scheme, which covers 80% of employees' wages, the government is offering shops forced to close cash grants of up to Â£3,000. However, the Federation of Small Businesses says for many this is not even enough to cover rent, while small business owners as company directors get little by way of income support. William Skinner, managing director of Savile Row tailor Dege & Skinner, thinks the government shouldn't be closing shops at all, arguing they aren't a major source of infection with proper social distancing in place. But he is optimistic about his 155-year-old business's chances: ""We've survived two world wars and we can survive this."" On the downside, he says the business will lose what little passing trade it had left after the first lockdown. In addition, fewer business people will need bespoke suits for business trips due to the travel ban. But he says the company learned valuable lessons in the first lockdown - for example, its tailors can now make suits and coats easily from home, although the cutting still takes place at the shop. The firm has also moved to an appointments-based system for fittings which he hopes can continue with the right safety precautions in place. William furloughed 17 of his 21 staff in the last lockdown but expects the figure will be closer to 10 or 11 this time. ""Now everyone is familiar and aware and going into it with more open eyes,"" he says of the second lockdown. ""But the question is how long will this last? Will we get a vaccine? Will the virus peter out? I am not sure.""

UK cyber-threat agency confronts Covid-19 attacks,"More than a quarter of the incidents which the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) responded to were Covid-related, according to its latest annual report. The review covers the period from September 2019 to August 2020, so the pandemic occupied an even higher proportion of the agency's efforts after the first lockdown began. In total there were 723 incidents of all kinds, marking close to a 10% rise on the previous period. Of those, 194 were Covid-related. Some of the incidents related to countering nation-state attacks, but most were criminal in nature, the GCHQ division reported. It also disclosed that it had thwarted 15,354 campaigns that had used coronavirus themes as a ""lure"" to fool people into clicking on a link or opening an attachment containing malicious software. Some involved fake shops selling PPE (personal protective equipment), test kits and even vaccines. Protecting the NHS and health-related research has been a priority, the report said.. In July, the UK accused Russiaof trying to steal vaccine-related informationthrough cyber-espionage. And officials said they had continued to see an ""ongoing threat"" of states targeting the vaccine research-and-delivery programme. The NCSC said it had scanned more than one million NHS IP (internet protocol) addresses to look for vulnerabilities, and had shared 51,000 indicators of compromise. It has also carried out ""threat hunting"" to look for security risks on connected devices, and worked on the security of the NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app. The NCSC also warned ransomware attacks had become more common. Ransomware locks people out of their computers and demands victims make a blackmail payment to restore access - and even then it is not always granted. The NCSC said it had handled more than three times as many ransomware incidents as in the previous year. These included an attack against Redcar and Cleveland Council which, the officials said, had ""caused considerable damage and disruption"". The report added the NCSC had observed a growing trend for such attacks to be more targeted and aggressive than previously. Rather than just locking people out of access to their data until a ransom was paid, attackers often warned they would embarrass victims if they refused to comply. ""We have seen the threat of data being leaked,"" Paul Chichester, director of operations, told the BBC. Examples included details of staff salaries being published online. This meant victims were at risk even if they have backed up their data. However, the NCSC said the UK did not appear to be as heavily targeted as some countries, because British victims were less likely to pay the attackers. The NCSC has also been working to increase skills and diversity in the cyber-security industry. It said almost 12,000 girls had taken part in its 2020 competition. However, an advert for the government's related CyberFirst campaignwas widely criticised last month for featuring a ballerinaand the slogan ""Fatima's next job could be in cyber"". NCSC has said it was not involved in the creation of the CyberFirst poster The report also highlighted the agency's role in protecting parliament as it became ""virtual"" to prevent hacking of debates or votes. And it revealed that the NCSC had just updated the system for producing cryptographic keys, which encrypt classified government and military systems. A new electronic system was introduced to replace old-fashioned punch-tape.

Stormont to debate alcohol licensing laws changesA new bill proposing significant changes to NI's licensing laws could become law next year.Northern Ireland,"A bill that will lead to changes in NI's alcohol licensing laws ""strikes the right balance"", Communities Minister CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n has said. Underthe plans,external, pubs and nightclubs will be able to serve alcohol for an extra hour, until 02:00, almost every weekend. The legislation also proposesremoving restrictions around Easter drinking. It will have to pass several legislative hurdles before becoming law. The other main change is the extension in ""drinking-up time"" from half an hour to an hour, meaning venues can operate until 03:00 at weekends. Currently restrictions on selling alcohol are in place from theThursday before Easter until Easter Sunday,external. Alcohol can only be served between 17:00 and 23:00 on Good Friday and bars have to stop serving at midnight on Thursday and Easter Saturday. The Department for Communities carried out a consultation last year, and said ""changing social habits and the growing importance of the tourism industry"" had prompted the calls for changes to Easter licensing laws. Setting out her department's plans in the assembly on Tuesday, Mrs NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n urged the Stormont assembly to vote for the bill. ""I know many people would like the licensing regime to be more flexible where licensees would have more freedom to open and close when they like,"" she said. ""But on the other hand, there are many people concerned about harm caused to our society by misuse of alcohol, who wish to see greater restrictions on the advertising and sale of drink. ""I believe this bill strikes the right balance between offering a level of support to the hospitality sector, which we all agree is very much needed, whilst protecting our communities by ensuring the sale of alcohol is controlled."" Much of the hospitality sector is struggling to maintain jobs due to the latest restrictions that forced many firms to shut The law will also be tightened in some areas - supermarkets will face restrictions on where they can place in-store advertising for alcohol. The current voluntary code of practice for drinks promotions will be replaced with legal requirements. The proposals have been a very long time in the making, with Stormont first proposing changes eight years ago. Can NI 'learn to live' with Covid-19? Pubs to be allowed to serve alcohol until 2am Brewers 'let down' by alcohol laws Aprevious bill to change NI's licensing lawsbegan its legislative passage in 2016, but the assembly collapsed in January 2017 amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, who share power together at Stormont. The new bill is expected to become law in time for Easter 2022. NI's hospitality sectorhas been closed since 16 October, due to restrictions agreed by the executive to tackle the spread of Covid-19. Some in the industry have proposed a compliance certificate should be drawn up, to allow those firms adhering properly to the rules to reopen.

"Universities and colleges 'face cash shortfalls'Worries about overseas students, Covid and pensions are damaging university finances, says report.Family & Education","The IFS says student numbers have held up better than expected Universities and colleges in England face ""significant funding shortfalls and heightened uncertainty"" due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a report warns. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says fewer overseas students, potentially higher dropouts and high pension costs are a financial risk for universities. Further education colleges still face budget pressures, despite a Â£400m cash boost, says the report. The government says it understands this is a ""challenging time"" for the sector. The IFSreport on education spending in England,external, which was funded by  the Nuffield Foundation, warns that universities could be exposed to a range of financial losses, such as falling international student numbers and more students failing to complete their degrees. ""By far the largest source of financial risk for universities is pension costs,"" it says. ""New figures suggest the additional cost to universities of meeting existing pension promises may well be as high as Â£8bn, or double our previous estimate of around Â£4bn."" Colleges' financial health 'fragile', say auditors Emergency loans for universities about to go bust Can I get a refund from my university this year? More students say university not value for money Universities could only reduce this by ""taking on more risk, making further reductions in the pensions provided by the scheme, big rises in employees' contributions"" or a combination of these. But such measures are likely to be controversial - last academic year, lecturers went on strike over pensions, as well as pay and conditions. The IFS also says student numbers in further education colleges and sixth forms are likely to increase this year, partly due to rising numbers of young people and partly due to ""unusually high GCSE results"" and significant reductions in training and employment opportunities. While England's colleges and sixth forms will receive an extra Â£400m this year,  ""exceptional rises in student numbers could still generate a real-terms fall in funding per student"". The early years sector could face further financial pressure from Covid lockdowns, says the IFS study They will also face challenges around educational catch-up, but may also ""need to expand to accommodate extra students as apprenticeship and employment opportunities dry up"", the IFS says. The report also raises concerns about early years provision, saying settings are likely to be ""much more financially exposed, both to the second lockdown and more broadly to a rather slow and incomplete return of demand for childcare"". While early years providers ""were financially well protected"" during the first lockdown by the government's commitment to continue to fund the free entitlement hours, a reassessment of this funding in January 2021 could prove problematic for providers. Report co-author Ben Waltmann said there had been speculation in the summer that universities would need a financial bailout. ""In the end, student numbers have held up better than expected, but universities still face financial risks from no-shows or higher-than-usual dropout, as well as reductions in other income streams,"" he said. ""By far the biggest source of risk now appears to be the large deficit on the main university pension scheme, which has increased from Â£3.6bn in March 2018 to a monumental Â£21.5bn in August 2020, according to the latest preliminary estimate. Lecturers went on strike over pensions last academic year ""With contributions already at more than 30% of earnings, it is hard to see how a deficit on this scale, if confirmed, could be evened out without further cuts in the generosity of the scheme."" Co-author Imran Tahir said the government had made transforming further education colleges a big priority, pledging  Â£400m in extra funding at the 2019 Spending Review. He said this could be ""the first real-terms increase in spending per student for about a decade"". ""However, student numbers could have risen dramatically more than expected due to a reduction in training, apprenticeship and employment opportunities, on top of population growth. ""If there is no additional funding forthcoming, planned real-terms increases in spending per student could be mostly - if not entirely - eroded."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said the government had introduced a range of support. ""We have protected grant funding for further education, worth over Â£3bn for a full year and increased education and training investment this year for 16-19  year olds by an additional Â£400m. ""We also brought forward over Â£2bn worth of tuition fee payments for universities and announced a major package of Â£280m to stabilise research funding."" But Geoff Barton, head of the head teachers' union ASCL, said colleges were often ""treated by the government in terms of funding as a Cinderella service"". Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said the reduction in funding had led to ""courses being cut, support services reduced and extra-curricular activities removed for 16 to 18 year olds across the country"". The Â£400m investment ""was a welcome step"", he said, ""but was only a one year deal following a decade of neglect.""

It's been nearly a week since the 3 November election day, and there are another 10 weeks to go until Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th US president.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader.

""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

Biden and Trump make final pitches to votersThe candidates make last-ditch efforts to persuade voters in key states on the final day of campaigning.,"This video can not be played That was wild - a three-year campaign in three minutes US President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden have spent the final hours of the White House race delivering their closing pitch to voters in critical states. Mr Biden campaigned in Pennsylvania and Ohio, as Mr Trump toured the voting battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. National polls suggest a firm lead for Mr Biden in Tuesday's election. But his lead is narrower in the handful of states that could decide the result. Nearly 99 million people have already cast their ballots in early voting, putting the country on course for its highest turnout in a century. Three election headlines you could wake up to What to look out for on election night US election 2020: A really simple guide In the US election, voters decide state-level contests rather than an overall single national one. This video can not be played When Tim's Biden sign was stolen, he got some unexpected help To be elected president, a candidate must win at least 270 votes in what is called the electoral college. Each US state gets a certain number of votes partly based on its population and there are a total of 538 up for grabs. This system explains why it is possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - like Hillary Clinton did in 2016 - but still lose the election. Tuesday's vote comes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The US has recorded more cases and more deaths than any other country worldwide, reporting more than 81,000 new infections on Sunday alone. Businesses in New York City are boarding up their shop fronts in case of post-election unrest As the nation counts down the hours to the vote, there are fears that pockets of post-election violence could break out. Businesses in the nation's capital, Washington DC, and in New York City have been seen boarding up their premises due to concerns about unrest. US businesses brace for election unrest After a punishing schedule of rallies in six states on Sunday, President Trump sprinted through four more battleground states on Monday. In North Carolina, he told supporters that ""next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country"". The rally was postponed from Thursday due to Hurricane Zeta. Mr Trump addressed a rescheduled campaign rally in Fayetteville Regional Airport, North Carolina He touted numbers that he says ""nobody even thought possible"". The US economy saw record-breaking 33% growth in the third financial quarter of this year, following a record 31% contraction in the second. Economists warn the damage inflicted by the pandemic - the biggest decline in the US economy in more than 80 years - could still take years to overcome. After North Carolina, Mr Trump headed to Scranton, Pennsylvania, the city where his opponent lived until he was 10. At a rally there he reminded his supporters that he won the state in 2016 despite polls suggesting he would lose.

Where Trump and Biden stand on guns, race and climate The women who hold the key to Trump's survival At a last-minute campaign stop in Ohio, Mr Biden repeated the core message of his campaign, telling voters that the race was about the soul of America. He said it was time for Mr Trump to ""pack his bags"", saying ""we're done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility"". Mr Biden made a last-minute campaign stop for a drive-in rally in Ohio The race in Ohio is extremely tight. In 2016, Mr Trump won by more than eight points - currently, he has a 0.2% lead over Mr Biden, according to an aggregate of polls by RealClearPolitics. On Monday, Mr Trump also held rallies in Traverse City, Michigan, and Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kenosha was rocked by violent protests in August after the police shooting of a black man. In Traverse City he asked for the votes of black Americans. The great dividing line of US election Why racism is still a problem for the world's most powerful country He travelled to Grand Rapids, Michigan for his last rally, the same city where he held the final event of the 2016 election race. On Sundaythe candidates attacked each other on two of this campaign's key themes- Covid-19 and racial tension. The president and his campaign have meanwhile indicated they will sue to block the potentially pivotal state of Pennsylvania from counting postal ballots received three days after the election. The US Supreme Court allowed a lower court ruling granting the extended deadline to stand, but several conservative justices signalled they might be open to revisiting the issue after the vote. This video can not be played How much is Covid-19 an election issue? Mr Trump tweeted on Monday that the high court decision allowing ballots to be accepted three days after election day was ""a very dangerous one"". ""It will allow rampant and unchecked cheating and will undermine our entire systems of laws. It will also induce violence in the streets. Something must be done!"" Twitter added a warning label that the tweet might contain ""misleading"" information and blocked it from being retweeted. Legal fights over ballots have also been unfolding in Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas. Mr Biden has already vowed to stop Mr Trump ""stealing"" the election. The president is to host an election night party inside the White House with about 400 guests invited. Up to 10,000 protesters are expected to gather on election night at Black Lives Matter Plaza and a park not far from the White House, according to CBS News. Mr Biden and Ms Harris will watch the election night returns in the former vice-president's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. It can take several days for every vote to be counted after any US presidential election, but it is usually pretty clear who the winner is by the early hours of the following morning. In 2016, Donald Trump took to the stage in New York at about 03:00 local time to give his victory speech in front of a crowd of jubilant supporters. What is the electoral college? How many Americans have voted early so far? But do not set your alarm clocks just yet. Officials are already warning that we may have to wait longer - possibly days, even weeks - for the result this year because of the expected surge in postal ballots. The last time the result was not clear within a few hours was in 2000, when the winner was not confirmed until a Supreme Court ruling was made a month later. Different states have different rules for how - and when - to count postal ballots, meaning there will be large gaps between them in terms of reporting results. In some states it will take weeks to get complete results. On Sunday,a report by news site Axios said Mr Trump would declare victory,externalon Tuesday night if it looked as if he was ahead. Mr Trump denied the report, but said that counting ballots after election day was a ""terrible thing"". Meanwhile, Mr Biden vowed to stop President Trump ""stealing"" the election.

The two rivals have radically different policies on several key issues. On thecoronavirus outbreak, Mr Trump set up a task force in January which he says has now shifted its focus to ""safety and opening up our country"". The president is also prioritising the speedy development of Covid treatments and vaccines, directing $10bn towards such projects. Mr Biden wants to set up a national contact-tracing programme, establish at least 10 testing centres in every state, and provide free coronavirus testing to all. He supports a nationwide mask mandate, which would require face coverings to be worn on federal property. What are Trump's and Biden's policies? What has Trump said about your country? Onclimate change, Mr Trump, being a sceptic, wants to expand non-renewable energy, and he has committed to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord. Mr Biden says he would immediately re-join the Paris deal, and he also wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050. On theeconomy, Mr Trump has pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, as well as one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Mr Biden wants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15.

National polls suggest a firm lead for Mr Biden in Tuesday's election. But his lead is narrower in the handful of states that could decide the result.

Hospital given 'urgent' maternity safety deadlineNHS inspectors find a hospital trust has not dealt with serious failings it had been warned about.Essex,"Gabriela Pintilie died after losing six litres of blood giving birth to her second child at Basildon Hospital's maternity unit An NHS hospital where a woman bled to death in childbirth has been given an ""urgent"" deadline to keep patients at its maternity unit safe. A letter seen by the BBC reveals the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found unsafe staffing levels at the unit at Basildon Hospital throughout August. The CQC said the trust that runs it had until next Monday to implement appropriate measures. The trust said it had a ""robust improvement plan in place"". The seven-page document, sent by the CQC on 7 October, puts the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust on notice that it has to ""implement an effective governance system"", among other measures. Consequences for missing the deadline were not stated, but the CQC said it was using its powers under the Health and Social Care Act to impose conditions on the trust's registration. The Act does allow the CQC to temporarily close health services. Deaths at Essex mental health unit to be probed Coronavirus nurse leaves Southend Hospital after 75 days Harlow hospital had 'overwhelming demand' for care The letter described how inspectors returned on 18 September and found the trust had still not dealt with serious failings it had been warned about in August, following a visit prompted by a whistleblower. It highlighted that it did not accept that some of the problems had been addressed, despite assurances from the trust that they had been. The letter continued ""we were not assured that you effectively reviewed staffing and escalated appropriately to maintain safe staffing in the maternity unit"". The CQC said Basildon Hospital was continuing to fail to deliver safe maternity care despite repeated warnings Only four shifts throughout the month of August had safe staffing levels The CQC was told 20 midwives had been recruited, yet subsequent documents submitted by the trust did not support this Required safety meetings during shift handovers did not take take place Incidents affecting patient safety were inappropriately categorised, including one in which a woman who lost more than a litre of blood was graded ""no harm"" Babies were transferred to intensive care, yet graded as ""low"" or ""no harm"" Inconsistent guidance to staff on identifying the risk of post-partum haemorrhage. A CQC visit in June found failings in six serious cases andrated the maternity unit inadequate. Its August report said lessons had not been learnt following the death of Gabriela Pintilie in February 2019. The Essex coroner said there had beendelays, confusion and a lack of leadershipafter Ms Pintilie, 36, lost six litres of blood while giving birth to her daughter. Mrs Pintilie's husband Ionel Pintilie said he was ""relieved"" the urgent safety deadline has been imposed on the unit. ""My wife died needlessly at the hospital and the fact that it is still deemed unsafe 18 months after we lost her is a scandal,"" he said. This video can not be played Stela Ernu said ""they're just not doing their jobs properly"" Stela Ernu, from South Ockendon, was more than 41 weeks pregnant when she was told her baby boy's heart was no longer beating. She said had been to Basildon Hospital twice on 12 and 13 March 2019 but ""was not listened to"" when she said there was something wrong and was sent home on both occasions. When she returned a third time, on 14 March, she was given the devastating news. She said there ""were not words"" to describe how the family felt, and said there were ""plenty"" of staff members who could have helped. ""Every time I went in there, there were plenty of rooms empty... it's a silly excuse for them to say they've been too busy. They're just not doing their jobs properly,"" she said. The hospital said a full investigation was carried out in light of Mrs Ernu's case and staff met with the family to share the findings. It said all of the recommendations from the investigation had been implemented. The CQC said in a statement it was now taking ""action to protect the welfare of people using the service"". Clare Panniker, chief executive for Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, said it had ""taken action following [the CQC's] initial feedback to make our services better"". ""We have a robust improvement plan in place, and continue to work closely with the CQC and our regulators as we make the necessary changes and are committed to improving the quality of maternity care,"" she said. Stephanie Prior, a solicitor for families who have lost loved ones and babies at the unit, said ""these words needed to be actioned into a foolproof, safe working environment for patients and staff"". The CQC letter said the trust had until 16:00 on 9 November to implement the recommended changes. Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

It's been nearly a week since the 3 November election day, and there are another 10 weeks to go until Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th US president.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

Green energy 'hindered by strained grid capacity',"Around two-thirds of renewable electricity generated in Wales comes from wind farms like this one on Mynydd y Gwair near Swansea Developers of green energy schemes in Wales face ""significant challenges"" in linking up to electricity power lines, the industry association has warned. Lower emissions targets could be missed as a result, Renewable UK Cymru said. It also claimed new zones allocated by ministers for onshore wind farms provided ""virtually no opportunity whatsoever"" for development. The Welsh Government said it was working with partners to design the energy networks needed. It is currently hosting a Wales Climate Week to debate ways of tackling global warming, during the period when a major UN conference - COP 26 - had been scheduled to take place. Rhys Wyn Jones, director of Renewable UK Cymru, said the Welsh Government needed to go ""beyond simply co-ordinating activity"" between different stakeholders to solve issues with grid capacity. He said: ""The Welsh Government wants to heat and power all new homes from clean energy sources by 2025. It also says in its transport strategy that large uptake of electric vehicles will place pressure on the grid - so it's not that we don't know these challenges are coming."" Housing minister Julie James recently acknowledged grid capacity problems, telling a Senedd committee: ""You'll know how bad the grid is in mid Wales. It isn't great north and south either."" Offshore wind farm step closer off north Wales coast Campaigners 'would fight' more turbines off Wales coast Building wind farms 'could destroy Welsh landscape' Gareth Cemlyn Jones of Ynni Ogwen said the grid was ""under strain"" It is understood there are parts of the country - including mid Wales in particular - where power lines are close to full capacity, leaving developers of potential energy schemes facing prohibitive upfront costs to upgrade the local networks before they can start generating. Ynni Ogwen, a community energy company based in Bethesda, Gwynedd, said the grid locally was ""under a lot of strain"". Chairman Gareth Cemlyn Jones said: ""It can result in either projects not taking off or possibly being downgraded so they're not generating to their full potential."" The issue is complicated by the fact that powers over grid infrastructure are shared between governments in Cardiff Bay and Westminster, while energy regulator Ofgem sets the amount firms can invest in upgrading their networks each year. Western Power Distribution, which supplies south Wales as well as south-west England and the Midlands, told BBC Wales it had re-engineered its network over the last decade to allow a greater integration of renewables, but recognised ""further investment"" was needed. Rhys Wyn Jones has concerns about land earmarked for wind energy Renewable UK Cymru said the Welsh Government needed to set out a plan to deal with the issue. The Welsh Conservatives' spokeswoman on climate change, Janet Finch-Saunders, wants targets for increasing grid capacity. ""I think the Welsh Government should have been more proactive in sorting out the grid capacity issues because why should we be starved of using the relevant renewable technologies because of this? It's not good enough,"" she said. Meanwhile, Llyr Gruffydd, Plaid Cymru's shadow minister for the environment said Wales should have full control over energy and grid capacity. He said: ""The matter is complicated by powers over grid infrastructure being shared by Welsh Government and Westminster. We can be a world leader in green energy but the current arrangement is holding Wales back."" Renewable UK Cymru said only around 5% of the land identified by Welsh Government would be ""theoretically developable"" Meanwhile, concerns have also been raised about the Welsh Government's recently publishednational development framework,externalfor the next 20 years - known as Future Wales. It sets out a series of zones where ministers would like to see onshore wind farms to help meet climate change goals. But Renewable UK Cymru said only around 5% of the land identified would be ""theoretically developable"" and even this figure was optimistic as it included areas that would not be large enough to support developments of national significance. The Senedd's climate change committee isdiscussing the issue later this week,external. The Welsh Government is ""broadly supportive"" of onshore wind energy - but not in national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty The Welsh Government's energy generation 2019 report said 51% of Wales' energy needs were met from renewables. Two-thirds of renewable electricity generated in Wales comes from wind. A spokesman said the national development framework was put together with the aim of fostering a ""coherent approach"" to development and it was ""broadly supportive"" of onshore wind energy developments throughout Wales, except in national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. He added it was working with councils, National Grid and district network operators ""to design the energy networks needed for the long term"".

Ex-rugby player's legal action against former boss,"Former Wales lock Ian Gough is taking legal action over tens of thousands of pounds he says he is still owed A businesswoman who sponsored the Scarlets and Cardiff City Football Club is facing bankruptcy after her firm collapsed with debts of more than Â£12m. Former Wales rugby international Ian Gough said he was taking legal action against Clare Louise Thomas over an unpaid court judgement totalling more than Â£20,000. He said her firm Juno Moneta Wealth also owed him Â£31,000 for unpaid wages. Ms Thomas said she believed she had reached a settlement with Mr Gough. She said she refuted any allegations made about her business. Mr Gough, a former Wales lock and Newport Gwent Dragons second row, said he began working for the financial solutions business in June 2017 as a part of its senior leadership team. It is also understood the Scarlets are owed Â£500,000 from a three-year sponsorship deal with Juno Moneta launched in 2018 The retired player said after asking questions about the business and Ms Thomas, also known as Louise O'Halloran, he ""stopped being paid his wages"". He said he also failed to receive money owed to him following a property deal with Ms Thomas. ""It's been a nightmare 18 months old and has created a lot of stress and strain on my side,"" he said. Ms Thomas said Mr Gough left her company as a result of a ""mutual decision"", adding as a group they were ""unhappy with his performance"". It is understood the Scarlets are owed Â£500,000 from a three-year sponsorship deal with Juno Moneta launched in 2018. The wealth management company became the region's main shirt sponsor, with Ms Thomas sitting as a board director before resigning in January this year. The businesswoman said she was ""a huge supporter of the world of rugby"", adding her board had been disappointed with the level of service they received from the rugby region. The Scarlets declined to comment. Cardiff City Football Club has confirmed Juno Moneta's sponsorship of a lounge at the stadium finished a year early due to the company's financial circumstances. Ms Thomas confirmed the deal ended earlier than planned but said she believed it was because the company was sponsoring a lounge that could no longer be attended because of Covid-19. She added she was unaware of any issues with her company and Cardiff City Football Club. Mr Gough is one of several creditors to companies within the Juno Moneta Group, which entered administration in August this year.

Instead, Contrad demanded repayment and the company entered administration. The administrators' statement said the company directors attributed its insolvency to ""the Covid-19 pandemic reducing face-to-face contacts with clients along with a steep decline in revenue"". Ms Thomas claimed the ""administration of Juno Moneta came as a complete shock"" to her. The 48-year-old added she was ""very unwell"" at the time and believed the issue of ""capital adequacy"" with the FCA had been sorted with Contrad.

""I'm getting to the point where I'm going to have to write this off, and I'm fortunate that I can,"" they added. In response, Ms Thomas said she and her family had found the situation and rumours about her business ""exceptionally distressing"".

Third of staff 'fear catching Covid at work',"More than a third of workers are concerned about catching coronavirus on the job, according to a study by  the Resolution Foundation think tank. The poorest paid are particularly worried, the research found, but also the least likely to speak up about it. Younger workers are also less likely to raise a complaint, the Resolution Foundation said. The widespread concerns come despite government advice on making workplaces Covid-secure, researchers said. Lindsay Judge, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""More than one-in-three workers are worried about catching coronavirus on the job, despite the extensive steps employers have taken to make workplaces Covid-secure. ""Given many workers' limited ability to get employers to address Covid concerns, the UK needs a strong enforcement regime to ensure that workplaces are as safe as can be. ""But instead health and safety resources have been cut, inspections have been slow, and Covid-related enforcement notices are few and far between."" The researchers said they were also concerned about the reduction in funding at the Health and Safety Executive. The HSE's funding for each site it has the right to inspect has shrunk from Â£224 a decade ago to Â£100 for the current financial year, according to the report. ""The Foundation says policy makers should overturn the current view that health and safety is a 'brake on business' and take a more proactive approach to enforcement in the face of the pandemic,"" it said. A government spokesman said Â£14m of funding was given to the HSE to combat coronavirus earlier this year. An HSE spokesperson said: ""We thank the Resolution Foundation for its report, and with our partners across government we will examine its findings. We welcome the acknowledgement of our increased activity and share the commitment to ensure all employees have a voice. ""Making sure Great Britain's workplaces are Covid-Secure is our priority; this effort will not be affected by recent additional restrictions announced across England, Scotland and Wales. We will work with stakeholders to deliver workplace health and safety during this coronavirus pandemic. ""Inspection and putting duty holders on the spot is just one part of a wide ranging regulatory approach. We use a number of different ways to gather intelligence and reach out to businesses with a combination of site visits, phone calls and through collection of supporting visual evidence such as photos and video footage."" While a new lockdown in England is planned from Thursday, up to half of workers could still be going to work in jobs such as essential retail, education and health, Resolution said. The research used an online YouGov survey of 6,061 adults across the UK. Covid: How worried should we be? Testing lab 'chaotic and dangerous', scientist claims 'I'm not happy going back to work.

Hospital given 'urgent' maternity safety deadline,"Gabriela Pintilie died after losing six litres of blood giving birth to her second child at Basildon Hospital's maternity unit An NHS hospital where a woman bled to death in childbirth has been given an ""urgent"" deadline to keep patients at its maternity unit safe. A letter seen by the BBC reveals the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found unsafe staffing levels at the unit at Basildon Hospital throughout August. The CQC said the trust that runs it had until next Monday to implement appropriate measures. The trust said it had a ""robust improvement plan in place"". The seven-page document, sent by the CQC on 7 October, puts the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust on notice that it has to ""implement an effective governance system"", among other measures. Consequences for missing the deadline were not stated, but the CQC said it was using its powers under the Health and Social Care Act to impose conditions on the trust's registration. The Act does allow the CQC to temporarily close health services. Deaths at Essex mental health unit to be probed Coronavirus nurse leaves Southend Hospital after 75 days Harlow hospital had 'overwhelming demand' for care The letter described how inspectors returned on 18 September and found the trust had still not dealt with serious failings it had been warned about in August, following a visit prompted by a whistleblower. It highlighted that it did not accept that some of the problems had been addressed, despite assurances from the trust that they had been. The letter continued ""we were not assured that you effectively reviewed staffing and escalated appropriately to maintain safe staffing in the maternity unit"". The CQC said Basildon Hospital was continuing to fail to deliver safe maternity care despite repeated warnings Only four shifts throughout the month of August had safe staffing levels The CQC was told 20 midwives had been recruited, yet subsequent documents submitted by the trust did not support this Required safety meetings during shift handovers did not take take place Incidents affecting patient safety were inappropriately categorised, including one in which a woman who lost more than a litre of blood was graded ""no harm"" Babies were transferred to intensive care, yet graded as ""low"" or ""no harm"" Inconsistent guidance to staff on identifying the risk of post-partum haemorrhage. A CQC visit in June found failings in six serious cases andrated the maternity unit inadequate. Its August report said lessons had not been learnt following the death of Gabriela Pintilie in February 2019. The Essex coroner said there had beendelays, confusion and a lack of leadershipafter Ms Pintilie, 36, lost six litres of blood while giving birth to her daughter. Mrs Pintilie's husband Ionel Pintilie said he was ""relieved"" the urgent safety deadline has been imposed on the unit. ""My wife died needlessly at the hospital and the fact that it is still deemed unsafe 18 months after we lost her is a scandal,"" he said. This video can not be played Stela Ernu said ""they're just not doing their jobs properly"" Stela Ernu, from South Ockendon, was more than 41 weeks pregnant when she was told her baby boy's heart was no longer beating. She said had been to Basildon Hospital twice on 12 and 13 March 2019 but ""was not listened to"" when she said there was something wrong and was sent home on both occasions. When she returned a third time, on 14 March, she was given the devastating news. She said there ""were not words"" to describe how the family felt, and said there were ""plenty"" of staff members who could have helped. ""Every time I went in there, there were plenty of rooms empty... it's a silly excuse for them to say they've been too busy. They're just not doing their jobs properly,"" she said. The hospital said a full investigation was carried out in light of Mrs Ernu's case and staff met with the family to share the findings. It said all of the recommendations from the investigation had been implemented. The CQC said in a statement it was now taking ""action to protect the welfare of people using the service"". Clare Panniker, chief executive for Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, said it had ""taken action following [the CQC's] initial feedback to make our services better"". ""We have a robust improvement plan in place, and continue to work closely with the CQC and our regulators as we make the necessary changes and are committed to improving the quality of maternity care,"" she said. Stephanie Prior, a solicitor for families who have lost loved ones and babies at the unit, said ""these words needed to be actioned into a foolproof, safe working environment for patients and staff"". The CQC letter said the trust had until 16:00 on 9 November to implement the recommended changes. Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

Twilight Payment wins Melbourne Cup,"Winning jockey Jye McNeil was riding in the Melbourne Cup for the first time Twilight Payment gave Irish trainer Joseph O'Brien a second triumph in the Melbourne Cup but victory was overshadowed by the death of 2019 Derby winner Anthony Van Dyck. The 25-1 winner, ridden by Jye McNeil, led from start to finish and held on from Tiger Moth - trained by O'Brien's father Aidan - and Prince Of Arran. Tiger Moth's stablemate Anthony Van Dyck, winner of the Derby at Epsom in 2019, broke down in the home straight. The horse broke a leg in the incident. ""It is with sadness that we confirm that Anthony Van Dyck had to be humanely euthanised after sustaining a fractured fetlock during the running of the Melbourne Cup at Flemington,"" said Racing Victoria spokesman Jamie Stier. Anthony Van Dyck euthanised after Melbourne Cup The race, which usually attracts a crowd of about 100,000, was held behind closed doors because of the coronavirus pandemic. It was a winning debut Melbourne Cup ride for McNeil and a seventh triumph for owner Lloyd Williams in the two-mile handicap that has a first prize of more than Â£2.3m. O'Brien, 27, also landed the race at Flemington with Rekindling four years ago. ""The horse has got incredible heart. Jye gave him a fantastic ride and he has a huge will to win and he just kept on fighting all the way to the line,"" said the trainer. Kerrin McEvoy, the rider of runner-up Tiger Moth, was fined A$50,000 (Â£27,000) and suspended for 13 meetings for excessive whip use in the closing stages. Feature: The truth behind racing tipster Prince Monolulu 'There's something about him' - trainer on Prince Of Arran McNeil had his mount prominent throughout with Tiger Moth also to the fore in the early stages before settling back into third. With five furlongs to run, the 23-strong field was well strung out and Twilight Payment had lengths to spare entering the closing stages. Tiger Moth charged home late, but Joseph O'Brien again denied his father, as he did three years ago when Rekindling beat Johannes Vermeer. ""We both realise how hard it is to win on the world stage in these big, big races, but I am very lucky that I have been able to win a couple of big races,"" said Joseph. ""Dad has been very lucky, he has won a lot of big races, I'd be delighted for him if he had won, and I'm sure he is for me having won. We do our best on the track and whatever happens out there happens."" British challenger Prince Of Arran, trained in Newmarket by Charlie Fellowes, flew at the finish to be placed for the third year running after coming second last year and third in 2018. 1Twilight Payment 25-1 2Tiger Moth 11-2 3Prince Of Arran 17-2 4The Chosen One 40-1 23 ran Small Axe Trailer:Sneak peak of Steve McQueen's powerful new drama Top Gear:Watch the boys race around a deserted theme park 'Everton need stability' - how chaotic day unfolded Lakers and Kings postpone games amid Los Angeles wildfires Ryan Giggs - what happened?

Universities and colleges 'face cash shortfalls',"The IFS says student numbers have held up better than expected Universities and colleges in England face ""significant funding shortfalls and heightened uncertainty"" due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a report warns. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says fewer overseas students, potentially higher dropouts and high pension costs are a financial risk for universities. Further education colleges still face budget pressures, despite a Â£400m cash boost, says the report. The government says it understands this is a ""challenging time"" for the sector. The IFSreport on education spending in England,external, which was funded by  the Nuffield Foundation, warns that universities could be exposed to a range of financial losses, such as falling international student numbers and more students failing to complete their degrees. ""By far the largest source of financial risk for universities is pension costs,"" it says. ""New figures suggest the additional cost to universities of meeting existing pension promises may well be as high as Â£8bn, or double our previous estimate of around Â£4bn."" Colleges' financial health 'fragile', say auditors Emergency loans for universities about to go bust Can I get a refund from my university this year? More students say university not value for money Universities could only reduce this by ""taking on more risk, making further reductions in the pensions provided by the scheme, big rises in employees' contributions"" or a combination of these. But such measures are likely to be controversial - last academic year, lecturers went on strike over pensions, as well as pay and conditions. The IFS also says student numbers in further education colleges and sixth forms are likely to increase this year, partly due to rising numbers of young people and partly due to ""unusually high GCSE results"" and significant reductions in training and employment opportunities. While England's colleges and sixth forms will receive an extra Â£400m this year,  ""exceptional rises in student numbers could still generate a real-terms fall in funding per student"". The early years sector could face further financial pressure from Covid lockdowns, says the IFS study They will also face challenges around educational catch-up, but may also ""need to expand to accommodate extra students as apprenticeship and employment opportunities dry up"", the IFS says. The report also raises concerns about early years provision, saying settings are likely to be ""much more financially exposed, both to the second lockdown and more broadly to a rather slow and incomplete return of demand for childcare"". While early years providers ""were financially well protected"" during the first lockdown by the government's commitment to continue to fund the free entitlement hours, a reassessment of this funding in January 2021 could prove problematic for providers. Report co-author Ben Waltmann said there had been speculation in the summer that universities would need a financial bailout. ""In the end, student numbers have held up better than expected, but universities still face financial risks from no-shows or higher-than-usual dropout, as well as reductions in other income streams,"" he said. ""By far the biggest source of risk now appears to be the large deficit on the main university pension scheme, which has increased from Â£3.6bn in March 2018 to a monumental Â£21.5bn in August 2020, according to the latest preliminary estimate. Lecturers went on strike over pensions last academic year ""With contributions already at more than 30% of earnings, it is hard to see how a deficit on this scale, if confirmed, could be evened out without further cuts in the generosity of the scheme."" Co-author Imran Tahir said the government had made transforming further education colleges a big priority, pledging  Â£400m in extra funding at the 2019 Spending Review. He said this could be ""the first real-terms increase in spending per student for about a decade"". ""However, student numbers could have risen dramatically more than expected due to a reduction in training, apprenticeship and employment opportunities, on top of population growth. ""If there is no additional funding forthcoming, planned real-terms increases in spending per student could be mostly - if not entirely - eroded."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said the government had introduced a range of support. ""We have protected grant funding for further education, worth over Â£3bn for a full year and increased education and training investment this year for 16-19  year olds by an additional Â£400m. ""We also brought forward over Â£2bn worth of tuition fee payments for universities and announced a major package of Â£280m to stabilise research funding."" But Geoff Barton, head of the head teachers' union ASCL, said colleges were often ""treated by the government in terms of funding as a Cinderella service"". Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said the reduction in funding had led to ""courses being cut, support services reduced and extra-curricular activities removed for 16 to 18 year olds across the country"". The Â£400m investment ""was a welcome step"", he said, ""but was only a one year deal following a decade of neglect.""

Deadly 'terrorist' shooting in Vienna,"This video can not be played A large-scale security operation is ongoing Gunmen armed with rifles have opened fire in six different locations in central Vienna, killing three people and wounding several more, police say. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called it a ""repulsive terror attack"" and said one gunman was also killed. Police were searching for at least one attacker who was still at large, the interior minister said. The shootings took place near Vienna's central synagogue but it is not yet clear if that was the target. The city's police chief said two men and a woman were killed. At least a dozen other people were wounded, officials said. In pictures: Scene of gun attack The attack happened just hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were out enjoying bars and restaurants which are now closed until the end of November. European leaders strongly condemned the shooting. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply shocked by the terrible attacks"". Police said the incident began at about 20:00 (19:00 GMT) on Monday, near the Seitenstettengasse synagogue, when a heavily armed man opened fire on people outside cafes and restaurants. Members of the special forces quickly arrived at the scene. One policeman suffered a gunshot wound before other officers shot the perpetrator, who was armed with an automatic rifle, a pistol and a machete. Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch tweeted that the synagogue was closed at the time the attack began. Police sealed off streets near Schwedenplatz in Vienna An officer guarding the synagogue was among the wounded, newspaper Kronen Zeitung reported. It was not immediately clear how many attackers took part in the shooting. Austrian media said one person had been arrested, citing the interior ministry. Footage posted on social media showed people running through the streets as gunshots rang out. Witness Chris Zhao was in a nearby restaurant when the shooting started. He told the BBC: ""We heard noises that sounded like firecrackers. We heard about 20 to 30 and we thought that to be actually gunfire. We saw the ambulances... lining up. There were victims. Sadly, we also saw a body lying down the street next to us."" The shooting began at about 20:00 local time As a major anti-terror operation swung into action, police urged people to avoid the area and not to use public transport. Roadblocks were set up around the city centre. Police in the neighbouring Czech Republic said they were carrying out random checks on the border with Austria amid fears that the gunman might head in that direction. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said the attacker still at large was ""heavily armed and dangerous"". He told a news conference that children in Vienna would not be expected to attend school on Tuesday. On Twitter, Mr Kurz said ""we are experiencing difficult hours in our republic"", adding that the army would take over the security of major buildings in Vienna. ""Our police will act decisively against the perpetrators of this hideous terrorist attack. We will never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism,"" he said. This man raised his hands as police checked his identity during their search for the gunmen A number of people have been taken to hospital, including some with serious injuries Austria had until now been spared the sort of attacks that have hit other European countries. Leaders across the region condemned the shooting, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying that Europe must not ""give up"" in the face of attacks. ""We the French people share the shock and grief of the Austrian people, struck this evening by an attack in the heart of their capital, Vienna. After France, a friend of ours is attacked. This is our Europe. Our enemies must know who they are dealing with,"" he said. Three people died in a knife attack in a church in the French city of Nicelast week in what Mr Macron said was an ""Islamist terrorist attack"". The UK prime minister also said the country's ""thoughts are with the people of Austria - we stand united with you against terror"" while Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""we stand ready to support in any way we can"". European Council President Charles Michel called it a cowardly act that violated life and human values. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the shooting ""a heinous act"" and expressed ""solidarity"" with Austria. In pictures: Scene of gun attack Hunt for gunman after attack.

Manhunt after deadly 'terror' attack in Vienna,"This video can not be played Eyewitness Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister talks about the 2 November Vienna attack Austrian police have urged people to stay indoors as they hunt for suspects after a multiple gun attack in the capital Vienna that killed four people. A gunman shot dead by police has been identified as a 20-year-old ""Islamist terrorist"" who was released early from jail in December. Two men and two women died of their wounds after gunmen opened fire at six locations in the city centre on Monday evening. Twenty-two people were wounded. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the four who died were an elderly woman, an elderly man, a young male passer-by and a waitress. Witnesses described how the gunmen had opened fire on people outside bars and chased them as they fled inside. It was clearly an attack driven by ""hatred of our way of life, our democracy"", the chancellor said. He earlier spoke of a ""repulsive terror attack"". The nation was engaged not in a battle between Christians and Muslims, he stressed, but ""between civilisation and barbarism"". Austria's political leaders honoured the victims in Vienna as the nation mourned Interior Minister Karl Nehammer described the dead gunman as an ""Islamist terrorist"", jailed for 22 months in April 2019 after trying to get to war-torn Syria to join Islamic State (IS) jihadists. The 20-year-old had been released early last December under more lenient terms for young adults. Mr Nehammer urged Austrians to ""please stay at home if possible"" during the police operation and ""avoid the inner city"". Children should stay at home, not go to school on Tuesday, he said. Austrian daily Der Standard reports that 90% of shops in the city centre are now shut. The victims were in a city centre area busy with people in bars and restaurants, near Vienna's central synagogue. Police cordoned off some streets and brought in reinforcements. They are also being helped by the Austrian army. In pictures: Scene of gun attack in Vienna Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat Addressing a news conference, Mr Nehammer said police had searched the home of the dead gunman and seized video material. He had been wearing a fake explosive belt, police said. The man was originally from North Macedonia and had a previous conviction for terrorist association, Mr Nehammer said. He had both Austrian and Macedonian citizenship. Several arrests were made during searches of 15 nearby homes. Two suspects were also arrested in St PÃ¶lten, a town to the west of Vienna. Bars were targeted in a popular area of Vienna known as the ""Bermuda Triangle"" The Vienna shooting comes after a spate of Islamist militant attacks in France. Last month French history teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded outside a school in a suburb of Paris. Then, as the government launched new measures to tackle militant Islam, a Tunisian man fatally stabbed three people in a cathedral in Nice. The worst IS attack in Europe in recent years was in November 2015, when gunmen killed 130 people in Paris. Police flooded into several central streets where shooting took place Mr Nehammer said at least one ""heavily armed and dangerous"" attacker was believed to be still at large. Officials were quoted as saying there could have been as many as four attackers. The attack came hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were enjoying drinks and eating out before a midnight curfew. Police named six crime scenes in central Vienna: Seitenstettengasse and nearby Morzinplatz, Salzgries, Fleischmarkt, Bauernmarkt and Graben. The suspect was shot dead near St Rupert's Church. Austria's government announced three days of national mourning, starting immediately. Flags flew at half-mast and a minute's silence was held at midday. Schools are to hold a minute's silence for the victims on Wednesday morning. Police say the incident began at about 20:00 (19:00 GMT), near the Seitenstettengasse synagogue, when a heavily armed man opened fire on people outside cafes and restaurants. Vienna Community Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least two gunmen shoot at least 100 rounds in front of the synagogue compound. ""They were attacking the guests of bars and pubs. People were jumping and running, falling over the tables, running inside the bars followed by the gunmen also running inside the bars,"" he told London radio station LBC. Members of the special forces quickly arrived at the scene. One policeman was shot and critically wounded before the perpetrator, armed with an automatic rifle, a pistol and a machete, was, in the police chief's words, ""neutralised"" at 20:09. Police increased security outside the interior ministry after the shooting Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch said the synagogue was closed at the time. Footage posted on social media showed scenes of chaos as people ran through the streets with gunshots ringing out in the background. Witness Chris Zhao, who was in a nearby restaurant, told the BBC: ""We heard noises that sounded like firecrackers. We heard about 20 to 30 and we thought that to be actually gunfire. Sadly, we also saw a body lying down the street next to us."" Guests left the Vienna State Opera under the watch of armed police A major anti-terrorist operation swung into action and police set up roadblocks around the city centre. Barbara Lovett, who was in the Vienna State Opera at the time, said that when the evening performance ended the manager had told the audience of the attack and that they could not leave. ""The players came back out from the dressing rooms, in their normal clothes, sat down in the orchestra pit and played for another 20 minutes,"" she told the BBC. ""They played the German national anthem, which used to be the Austrian anthem - the Emperor Quartet by Haydn."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'A mask over my mouth feels like attacker's hand',"A rape survivor is calling for government to ""educate"" the public about face-covering exemptions, as England moves into a second lockdown. Having her mouth covered still prompts traumatic flashbacks for Georgina Fallows, who was attacked some years ago. And now, she feels re-traumatised by being verbally abused in public when she doesn't wear a mask. She has written to ministers with seven mental-health and disability charities. They are asking the government to promote a ""recognised badge [or] identifier to signify the wearer as exempt"". But, the letter states, a badge ""is no substitute for greater public understanding"" of why people might not be able to wear face coverings and that this reason may be invisible. ""My attacker literally pulled me off the street and raped me,"" Ms Fallows says. ""Having something in front of my mouth feels like his hand."" She has severe post-traumatic stress disorder and flashbacks, sometimes so extreme she has been sedated by paramedics. And she has waived her right to anonymity in order to campaign for greater awareness. Face coverings are mandatory in most indoor public spaces in England, including shops and public transport. But there are exemptions for people for whom ""putting on, wearing or removing a face covering"" will cause ""severe distress"". People who cannot wear a mask because of a physical or mental illness or disability are also exempt. There is a note that can be downloaded from the government website. But Ms Fallows is concerned it is not viewed as ""official"". And when she has shown her exemption pass after being challenged, people will often not accept it. Man with chronic asthma 'forced' to wear mask on plane What are the rules on face coverings? The 30-year-old solicitor has been ""screamed at"" for not wearing a mask. And one woman accused ""people like me of killing her father"". There are also fears the notes could be misused by people who do not have a valid reason not to wear a face covering. Ms Fallows wants government to consider backing the Hidden Disabilities charity's sunflower lanyard, which is already being used for this purpose and is widely recognised. For now, though, she avoids shops and transport wherever possible for fear of being verbally abused. ""People think it's just a bit uncomfortable,"" wearing a mask. But for Ms Fallows, it can be a ""medical emergency"", resulting in three- or four-hour flashbacks that end with her being restrained and unconscious. And it is a problem shared by people with a range of other mental-health conditions, disabilities, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. The letter, sent to Public Health Minister Jo Churchill, Disability Minister Justin Tomlinson and former Disability Minister Penny Mordaunt, was co-signed by charities including Mind, Sense, Alzheimer's Society and Disability Rights UK. A  Disability Rights UK survey of 350 people uncovered reports of people fearing hate crimes and feeling like prisoners in their own homes. Difficulties wearing face coverings particularly affect people with mental-health conditions, sensory disorders and hidden disabilities such as autism, its research suggests. Widespread misinformation online has suggested face coverings can physically impair breathing. The British Lung Foundation says: ""Wearing a mask does not reduce a person's oxygen supply or cause a build-up of carbon dioxide. ""You may have read stories that say that it can - but this isn't true."" But wearing a face covering can give people a psychological perception of heightened breathlessness. And Ms Fallows says those who do not wear one ""through choice... do a genuine disservice to those who 'cannot' wear one and are exempt"".

'A mask over my mouth feels like attacker's hand'Georgina Fallows is asking government to protect from harassment people who can't wear face coverings.Health,"A rape survivor is calling for government to ""educate"" the public about face-covering exemptions, as England moves into a second lockdown. Having her mouth covered still prompts traumatic flashbacks for Georgina Fallows, who was attacked some years ago. And now, she feels re-traumatised by being verbally abused in public when she doesn't wear a mask. She has written to ministers with seven mental-health and disability charities. They are asking the government to promote a ""recognised badge [or] identifier to signify the wearer as exempt"". But, the letter states, a badge ""is no substitute for greater public understanding"" of why people might not be able to wear face coverings and that this reason may be invisible. ""My attacker literally pulled me off the street and raped me,"" Ms Fallows says. ""Having something in front of my mouth feels like his hand."" She has severe post-traumatic stress disorder and flashbacks, sometimes so extreme she has been sedated by paramedics. And she has waived her right to anonymity in order to campaign for greater awareness. Face coverings are mandatory in most indoor public spaces in England, including shops and public transport. But there are exemptions for people for whom ""putting on, wearing or removing a face covering"" will cause ""severe distress"". People who cannot wear a mask because of a physical or mental illness or disability are also exempt. There is a note that can be downloaded from the government website. But Ms Fallows is concerned it is not viewed as ""official"". And when she has shown her exemption pass after being challenged, people will often not accept it. Man with chronic asthma 'forced' to wear mask on plane What are the rules on face coverings? The 30-year-old solicitor has been ""screamed at"" for not wearing a mask. And one woman accused ""people like me of killing her father"". There are also fears the notes could be misused by people who do not have a valid reason not to wear a face covering. Ms Fallows wants government to consider backing the Hidden Disabilities charity's sunflower lanyard, which is already being used for this purpose and is widely recognised. For now, though, she avoids shops and transport wherever possible for fear of being verbally abused. ""People think it's just a bit uncomfortable,"" wearing a mask. But for Ms Fallows, it can be a ""medical emergency"", resulting in three- or four-hour flashbacks that end with her being restrained and unconscious. And it is a problem shared by people with a range of other mental-health conditions, disabilities, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. The letter, sent to Public Health Minister Jo Churchill, Disability Minister Justin Tomlinson and former Disability Minister Penny Mordaunt, was co-signed by charities including Mind, Sense, Alzheimer's Society and Disability Rights UK. A  Disability Rights UK survey of 350 people uncovered reports of people fearing hate crimes and feeling like prisoners in their own homes. Difficulties wearing face coverings particularly affect people with mental-health conditions, sensory disorders and hidden disabilities such as autism, its research suggests. Widespread misinformation online has suggested face coverings can physically impair breathing. The British Lung Foundation says: ""Wearing a mask does not reduce a person's oxygen supply or cause a build-up of carbon dioxide. ""You may have read stories that say that it can - but this isn't true."" But wearing a face covering can give people a psychological perception of heightened breathlessness. And Ms Fallows says those who do not wear one ""through choice... do a genuine disservice to those who 'cannot' wear one and are exempt"".

Gunmen kill at least 32 people in Ethiopia attack,"Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has relaxed controls in what had been a tightly controlled state Gunmen have killed at least 32 people and set fire to homes in a ""horrendous"" attack in western Ethiopia, officials say. Local authorities said the rebel Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) was to blame for the attack in Oromia state. Residents said dozens were rounded up and killed and livestock was stolen. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said Sunday's attack in Guliso district, in the Oromia region, may have been identity-based. Ethnic violence has increased since Mr Abiy took office in April 2018, loosening controls in what had been a highly centralised state. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Ambo, the city cutting long hair and the internet Ethiopia's murdered musician who sang for freedom Bold reforms expose Ethiopia's ethnic divides ""Ethiopia's enemies are vowing either to rule the country or ruin it, and they are doing everything they can to achieve this. One of their tactics is to arm civilians and carry out barbaric attacks based on identity, [for me] this is heart breaking,"" Mr Abiy said in a Twitter post. Survivors counted 54 bodies in a school compound where the militants, who identified as OLA members, gathered people who did not manage to flee, mainly women, children and the elderly, and killed them, rights group Amnesty International said in a statement. A survivor told AFP news agency that security forces stationed in the area left and the OLA then rounded up civilians. ""After collecting us, they opened fire on us, and then afterwards looted cattle and burnt down houses,"" they said. The OLA is an armed group that has been blamed for kidnappings and bomb attacks in western and southern Ethiopia. The OLA broke off from the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) - an opposition party that spent years in exile and returned to the country after Mr Abiy took office in 2018. A local official told the BBC a team had been sent to Guliso district to investigate, anticipating the death toll could be ""high"". The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said up to 60 ""armed and unarmed assailants"" were involved in the attack, which was carried out on Sunday. It said members of the Amhara ethnic group, the country's second largest ethnic group, were targeted. The Amhara branch of the ruling Prosperity Party also released a statement supporting the EHRC's report. Mr Abiy said that ""measures have started to be taken against the attackers"". The head of the African Union Moussa Faki condemned the violence and urged Ethiopians to refrain ""from inflammatory rhetoric and work towards de-escalating tensions in the country"". In June,a wave of ethnic unrest broke out following the killing of popular Oromo singer Hachalu Hundessa, leaving more than 150 people dead.
