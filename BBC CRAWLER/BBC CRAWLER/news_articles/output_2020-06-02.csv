Virus death risk is higher for ethnic minorities,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock said the advice was ""the same as to everybody but with more emphasis"" People from ethnic minorities are at a higher risk of dying from coronavirus,a report by Public Health England,externalsays. It shows age remains the biggest risk factor, while being male is another. The impact of Covid-19 is also ""disproportionate"" for other Asian, Caribbean and black ethnicities. But it remains unclear why. A trade union for doctors said the report was a ""missed opportunity"" for ""action"" to be taken to protect health workers who are from ethnic minorities. The health secretary said the ""troubling"" report was ""timely"" because ""right across the world people are angry about racial injustice"". On Monday night, the Department of Health and Social Care denied reports the delay was down to official concerns of potential civil unrest linked to global anger over thedeath of African-American George Floyd. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons the public was ""understandably angry about injustices"" and that he felt a ""deep responsibility because this pandemic has exposed huge disparities in the health of our nation"". ""Black lives matter, as do those of the poorest areas of our country which have worse health outcomes and we need to make sure all of these considerations are taken into account, and action is taken to level-up the health outcomes of people across this country,"" he said. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, Mr Hancock said ""much more work"" needed to be done to understand ""what's driving these disparities"". ""We are absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this and find ways of closing this gap,"" he said, adding that he has asked equalities minister Kemi Badenoch to continue working on the issue alongside Public Health England (PHE). Call for public inquiry into virus BAME death risk Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Black Britons face 'twice the risk' of virus death The BBC's Rianna Croxford pressed Mr Hancock on whether there were any specific recommendations for people from ethnic minority backgrounds. He said everyone in ""the different high risk categories"" highlighted in the report should follow social distancing guidelines ""very stringently"". Prof John Newton said although the virus was having a worse impact on black and minority ethnic people, ""that is not necessarily because of their ethnicity"" and could instead be related to their job, for example. He said the report's findings needed to be ""widely discussed before deciding exactly what needs to be done"". ""The report if nothing else emphasises the complexity of what we're seeing, so really we're urging people not to jump to conclusions and institute measures which are not really justified by the data,"" he added. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said,external""lives depend on"" finding out why the virus disproportionately impacts black and minority ethnic people, and what actions the government was taking to stop it. Davida Wilkins, a 38-year-old district nurse in the West Midlands, told the BBC she felt ""even more anxious"" about doing her job following the report's publication. She said she felt ""obligated"" to continue her front-line role but added she cannot minimise the risks posed to her by the virus because ""it's the colour that I am and I can't change it"". A large proportion of NHS doctors are from an ethnic minority background The rapid review was launched when it became clear that some people were getting more sick with coronavirus than others. PHE reviewed thousands of existing health records and other virus data to look at disparities by: age and sex geography deprivation ethnicity pre-existing health problems or co-morbidities It is not possible to combine all of these factors together to judge an individual's risk because of the way the source data is recorded, but the data does reveal clear inequalities. The analysis on ethnicity and risk did not consider a person's occupation or obesity, even though both are known risk factors for getting seriously ill with coronavirus. The report also found: If you strip out age and sex, people of Bangladeshi ethnicity have twice the risk of death than people of white British ethnicity People aged 80 or older are 70 times more likely to die than those under 40 Working-age men diagnosed with Covid-19 are twice as likely to die as women The risk of dying with the virus is higher among those living in more deprived parts of the UK Certain occupations - security guards, taxi or bus drivers and construction workers and social care staff - are at higher risk Virus death rates were highest among people of Black and Asian ethnic groups when compared to white British ethnicity People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and other Black ethnicity had between a 10% and 50% higher risk of death when compared to white British people The government had been under pressure to publish the findings of this inquiry. It was due to be released by the end of May. Now it's here, it's not clear why there was a delay. The main findings reinforce what we already know - that belonging to an ethnic minority group is a major risk factor. It doesn't move us forward in answering why, though. The report acknowledges an important flaw in the analysis - it couldn't factor in important risks, such as a person's job and underlying health conditions, that increase the chance of dying with coronavirus. Where you live and how much you earn are important considerations too. Death rates for people living in the most deprived areas of England were more than double the least deprived areas. The report says coronavirus has replicated and in some cases increased existing health inequalities. It doesn't mention how to address those to save more lives. It acknowledges that more work is needed to understand and advise people about the risks. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the report for not providing recommendations for at-risk groups, adding that the virus ""thrives on inequality"" and ""inequality thrives on inaction"".

She said ""clear guidance and support"" from the government should be given to help the NHS tackle the risk to workers. The Royal College of Nursing pointed out that health care staff from black and ethnic minority groups faced an increased risk from the virus and that ""swift and comprehensive action"" was needed to protect workers. While the council chair of the BMA, the doctors' trade union, said the report was a ""missed opportunity"".

Only a comprehensive race equality strategy will address these issues.""

Frankie & Benny's owner: Some sites won't reopen,"Up to 3,000 jobs are at risk after one of the country's biggest restaurant operators decided as many as 120 outlets will not reopen after lockdown, the BBC has learned. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie & Benny's and Garfunkels, has about 600 outlets across the UK, with about 22,000 workers on furlough. It is understood that Frankie & Benny's will bear the brunt of the closures. The company, which declined to comment, was due to inform staff on Wednesday, In an email to managers seen by the BBC on Tuesday, the company said: ""Many sites are no longer viable to trade and will remain closed permanently. ""The Covid-19 crisis has significantly impacted our ability to trade profitably, so we've taken the tough decision to close these restaurants now."" The group appears to be speeding up previous plans to shut restaurantsas trade suffers due to the pandemic. The email was sent to managers in the group's Leisure Division, which includes more than 200 Frankie & Benny's outlets. It is not clear which outlets will be shut, or exactly how many, but BBC was told on Wednesday that up to 120 are at risk. 'Why couldn't they keep us furloughed?' When will shops open and what will the rules be? The group also owns the Wagamama chain and some pub units. Wagamama is not part of the division which received the email and the vast majority of its restaurants are expected to reopen. The Restaurant Group said in March that 61 out of 80 branches of its Tex-Mex dining chain Chiquito's would remain closed permanently as it fell into administration. It cited the Covid-19 outbreak as having had ""an immediate and significant impact on trading"". However, the group had already announced in February, prior to the introduction of lockdown measures, that it would speed up existing plans to close restaurants. Initially it had planned to make 150 closures - which were first signalled in 2019 - over a six-year period. It then said it would close 90 restaurants by the end of 2021. ""I feel completely overwhelmed and upset,"" says Georgia. She has been working as a part-time waitress at one Frankie & Benny's outlet since last April. ""I'm angry, as they feel as though staff are disposable,"" she says, adding that the lack of certainty around work amid lockdown has created mental stress. ""I just can't believe that they would send that kind of message to managers without any warning,"" she adds. The group had already seen sales falling across many outlets. That came despite stronger revenues across the wider group in its Wagamamas and pub units. It said in February that like-for-like sales - which strip out new restaurant openings - in the division that includes Frankie & Benny's and Chiquito, fell by 2.8% in 2019. Many casual dining chains had already been struggling in the face of rising overheads and falling consumer spending. But those in the hospitality sector have seen their problems worsen due to the coronavirus pandemic, as customers have been forced to stay at home amid lockdown. Carluccio's, for example,was bought out of administration by the owner of Giraffe restaurants. Despite its rescue, more than 1,000 jobs will be lost at the Italian restaurant chain, more than half of its total workforce. The administrators said the lockdown meant difficult decisions had to be taken. Restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 forced most cafes and restaurants to close in March,but some have since reopened as takeaways only. When lockdown was initially announced in March, trade association UK Hospitality said it was ""catastrophic for businesses and jobs"". Its chief executive Kate Nicholls warned at the time that the measures could ""lead to thousands of businesses closing their doors for good, and hundreds of thousands of job losses"". Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels, cinemas and places of worship will be allowed to open from 4 July at the earliest in England, if they can meet social distancing measures.

Nissan says UK factory under no-deal Brexit threat,"This video can not be played Nissan's Sunderland plant is ""unsustainable"" without a Brexit trade deal, said Ashwani Gupta. The UK's largest car manufacturing plant is ""unsustainable"" if the UK leaves the European Union without a trade deal, owner Nissan says. The Japanese company's global chief operating head told the BBC people had to understand the EU was the Sunderland factory's biggest customer. Ashwani Gupta said that Nissan's commitment could not be maintained if there was not tariff-free EU access. Nissan has invested billions of pounds in the plant, which has 7,000 workers. His comments come despite the Sunderland site surviving this week's announcement on the Japanese giant's global restructuring programme. Mr Gupta said: ""You know we are the number one carmaker in the UK and we want to continue. We are committed. Having said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it's not our intention but the business will not be sustainable. That's what everybody has to understand."" He also said that any plans for its strategic partner and 43%-shareholder Renault to take up spare capacity at Sunderland would be a matter for the French carmaker. The French government has a 15% stake in Renault. This is not the first time that Nissan has pleaded with UK and EU negotiators to ensure that the 70% of cars manufactured at Sunderland which are sold in the EU can avoid tariffs of 10% under World Trade Organisation rules - the legal default position if a deal is not struck. Renault cuts 15,000 jobs in major restructuring Nissan backs UK plant but protests erupt in Spain Those talks resumed this week, with the differences between the UK and EU being described on all sides as deep and wide. Last week, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU would consider a two-year Brexit delay, which was rebuffed by his UK counterpart David Frost, who told MPs the government's policy remains not to extend the transition period beyond the end of the year. Under an agreement signed last year, the UK has until the end of this month to decide whether it wants to request such an extension so the coming weeks are crucial. The comments by Nissan may dampen hopes raised just last week when the company said that while it was closing plants in Spain and Indonesia, it remained committed to Sunderland. An announcement by Nissan that Renault might take the European lead in the companies' global manufacturing alliance (which also includes Mitsubishi) by taking up an estimated 20% spare capacity at Sunderland were quashed for the foreseeable future by Renault last week, when it said it had no current plans to move in to the UK. Mr Gupta confirmed that any decision by its partners would be a matter for them, and that no such deal had been agreed. ""When it comes to the allocation of manufacturing, each company will take the decision based on the competitiveness of the plants."" Nissan is a huge fan of the Sunderland plant and paid tribute to the efficiency and hard work of the operation. But it reiterated that was not enough to secure its long-term future if tariffs were imposed in a market which it described last week as ""non-core"". It only has a 3% market share of the vehicle market in Europe. On a more encouraging note, Mr Gupta said recent sales figures from China showed the world's biggest car market was recovering fast and the company was winning market share. But vehicles for that market are not produced in the UK. It is still possible that Renault could decide to move production of certain vehicles to Sunderland. But it is hard to see how a company which is 15%-owned by the French taxpayer could find a way to make that work where Nissan, which has been in Sunderland for 40 years, says it cannot. Nissan's comments are a timely reminder that for many key industries, the Brexit issue - which has not been silenced by coronavirus news - has in many ways been amplified by it.

Council accused of 'increasing' Covid-19 deaths,"The care home is next to the University Hospital of North Durham At least 25 people have died at a care home amid claims from an industry body that a council's actions ""caused"" or ""increased Covid-19 deaths"". Melbury Court in Durham is thought to be the care home with the highest number of deaths in the UK. County Durham has had the highest number of care home deaths in England and Wales. Durham County Council said it ""strongly refuted"" the claim by the County Durham Care Home Association (CDCHA). Some patients went from the nearby University Hospital of North Durham to Melbury Court without being tested for coronavirus or after a positive test. Owners HC-One said the 87-bed home was now in ""recovery"" with many residents returning to health. It is not known how many people there have been ill. A BBC investigation has discovered that in a conference call in late March, council officials were told plans to move hospital patients into care homes without testing would be disastrous. The CDCHA offered to find a specific home or homes where Covid-19 positive or untested people could be cared for rather than have them spread around the network. This was never acted on and now the CDCHA has calculated there has been an outbreak of coronavirus in 81 of the county's 149 care homes. Maria Vincent, who runs Crosshill Care Home in Stanhope, told the council in March that care homes were not set up to accept Covid-19 patients, and described it as ""neglect pure and simple"". She said: ""They knew at the beginning how vulnerable older people were because in Spain they'd had numerous people who'd died in care homes. ""With just a little bit of forethought, true collaborative working, we could easily have got through this without the number of deaths we've had."" Maria Vincent told the council that care homes were not set up to accept Covid-19 patients The latest figures from the Office of National Statistics shows there have been 275 deaths in care homes in County Durham - more than in hospitals. Local care providers said deaths in care homes in the county are twice as high as the average for the whole of England. The council say high levels of ill health and deprivation are contributory factors. In a letter sent to Durham County Council and seen by the BBC, the CDCHA said: ""The council has pursued a policy which has caused and/or increased Covid-19 infections and deaths within care homes in County Durham"". Samuel Wilson's family said the home took an ""unnecessary risk which cost [him] his life Samuel Wilson died at Melbury Court in early May, aged 92, after testing positive for Covid-19 following his return from a routine procedure at the University Hospital of North Durham. Some of the family had objected to him going to hospital, arguing it was too risky amid the pandemic and urged staff to manage his condition in the home, but they were persuaded. His granddaughter Tracey O'Kennedy said: ""The home was relentless for a family member to take him into hospital for a non-essential procedure in the middle of full lockdown. ""In my opinion, they took an unnecessary risk, a risk that cost granddad his life."" In County Durham the council initially tied additional funding for coronavirus-related costs to homes being willing to accept people who had tested positive for the virus or were untested, although this was later changed. Durham County Council said it ""strongly refuted"" the accusation from the CDHCA that it had contributed to care home deaths. It said it had considered the idea of a separate care home for Covid-19 patients but felt it was not appropriate due to the predicted number of cases. Jane Robinson, corporate director for adults and health, said: ""We followed national guidelines and we've done absolutely everything that we can do. ""We've put in additional financial support, provided PPE, and we've provided training and support and psychological support for our care home staff as well."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Zoom sees sales boom amid pandemic,"Zoom has become the app many are using to stay in touch with friends, family and work colleagues When it comes to its growth rate, video conference company Zoom has lived up to its name. Use of the firm's software jumped 30-fold in April, as the coronavirus pandemic forced millions to work, learn and socialise remotely. At its peak, the firm counted more than 300 million daily participants in virtual meetings, while paying customers have more than tripled. The dramatic uptake has the potential to change the firm's path. Zoom said it expects sales as high as $1.8bn (Â£1.4bn) this year - roughly double what it forecast in March. ""It's a huge opportunity,"" chief executive Eric Yuan told investors on Tuesday. Mr Yuan didn't intend to create Zoom for the masses. Zoom has made Eric Yuan, whose visa application to the US was denied eight times, a billionaire A Chinese-born software engineer, Mr Yuan started the company in 2011, after years rising through the ranks at WebEx, one of the first US video conference companies, which was purchased by Cisco in 2007 for $3.2bn. At the time, he faced doubts from many investors, who did not see the need for another option in a market already dominated by big players such as Microsoft and Cisco. But Mr Yuan - who has credited his interest in video conferencing to the long distances he had to travel to meet up with his now-wife in their youth - was frustrated at Cisco and believed there was demand in the business world for software that would work on mobile phones and be easier to use. Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars Racist zoombombing at virtual synagogue Zoom is in all our living rooms but is it safe? When the firm sold its first shares to the public last year, it was valued at $15.9bn. That shot to more than $58bn on Tuesday. ""What Zoom has done is kind of democratised video conferencing for all kinds of businesses and made it very simple for everyone from yoga instructors through to board room executives to deploy video,"" says Alex Smith, senior director at Canalys. When the lockdowns started, Zoom lifted the limits for the free version of its software in China and for educators in many countries, including the UK, helping to drive its popularity. But the firm's bread and butter customers are corporate clients, who pay for subscriptions and enhanced features. Zoom said on Tuesday that sales jumped 169% year-on-year in the three months to 30 April to $328.2m, as it added more than 180,000 customers with more than 10 employees since January - far more than it had expected. It also turned a profit of $27m in the quarter - more than it made in all of the prior financial year. The massive uptake has also strained the firm, forcing it to invest to expand capacity to meet the needs of new users, many of whom are not paying customers. Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees. It has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use. In April, Mr Yuan, who is a US citizen, apologised for the security lapses and the firm started rolling out a number of changes intended to fix the problems. Zoom has also announced a number of new appointments familiar with Washington politics, including H R McMaster, a retired Army general and former national security adviser to Donald Trump. ""Navigating this process has been a humbling learning experience,"" Mr Yuan said on an investor call on Tuesday. Analysts said they expected the company would overcome these reputational blows. ""It's had that mishap and the fact that its name is still very much used as verbatim with video technology still gives it a lot of momentum and opportunity to continue,"" Mr Smith said. Analysts say they expect Zoom to maintain its focus on business customers, since that's how it makes money. But the pandemic is likely to create more challenges for Zoom in that market, as increased demand for remote work prompts competitors such as Microsoft and Cisco to pour resources into the field. ""The stakes are higher and the competition's getting tougher, so we'll see,"" says Ryan Koontz, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. ""They were on a very strong trajectory before... and happened to be in the right place at the right time as the whole world decided we needed to communicate well on video,"" he says. ""They have this amazing brand... now they have to leverage that brand and figure out which markets they're going to go after.""

Labour urges ban on riot control exports to US,"The UK is being urged to halt all sales of riot control equipment to the United States amid concerns they may be being used by police to suppress protests over the death of George Floyd. Labour said the UK had licensed exports of tear gas and riot shields in the past year and any use for internal repression would contravene the law. The SNP has joined calls for existing and new orders to be suspended. Boris Johnson said controls on UK exports were highly ""scrupulous"". The African-American man's death in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May prompted an international outcry and sparked a wave of peaceful and violent protests across the US. Dozens of people have been injured as authorities used tear gas and force to disperse protests which have swept more than 75 cities. President Trump has urged state governors to mobilise their national guard to control the protests and threatened to send in the military to quell the disturbances. Live: US protests continue Archbishop attacks Trump as unrest continues Labour is urging ministers to clarify whether any UK-made equipment is being used by US police in their operations and, if it is, for all future orders to be immediately suspended. Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said police forces across the US had used ""excessive force"" against peaceful protesters, including children, and it was an ""obvious matter of concern"" that UK-made equipment could potentially be used to ""crush"" legitimate demonstrations. She has urged International Trade Secretary Liz Truss to publish details of all current riot control exports, who has bought them and for what purpose over the past five years. She said a recent report from the Department for International Trade suggests licences granted include for anti-riot shields, anti-riot guns, portable riot control electric shock devices, tear gas and components for anti-riot guns. Ms Thornberry said ministers should not ""shirk"" their duty to uphold basic human rights because of the UK's close relationship with the US, with the two countries historic alliance making it all the more important for the UK to act. ""It has been the policy of successive governments over the past two decades to refuse licences for the export of arms and equipment that might be used for internal repression in the countries to whom they are being sold. ""If there is a risk that any of these riot control projectiles and equipment are being used in the United States against peaceful, unarmed civilians, then the government must act immediately to stop their export. ""The British public deserve to know how arms exported by this country are being used across the world, and the American public deserve the right to protest peacefully without the threat of violent repression."" Meanwhile, Labour's Dawn Butler says she expects 90 MPs from across the Commons to sign a separate letter to Ms Truss later this week calling for action. The Brent Central MP, who was the party's equalities spokeswoman for many years, told the BBC a cross-party approach would send a ""strong signal"" about the strength of feeling and the need for the UK to be more ""disapproving"" of the actions of the US authorities. ""Now is the time to make our voices heard,"" she told the BBC. ""This is something that can unite Parliament and is ethically and morally the right thing to do."" ""Of course this is one of the times when people are all saying the right thing but we can do something tangible."" The UK government has welcomed the fact a Minneapolispolice officer has been charged with Mr Floyd's murder. But ministers have refrained from directly criticising President Trump's response to the ensuing protests, saying they do not want to get involved in another country's domestic affairs. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said he understood the strength of feeling over Mr Floyd's ""appalling"" death but that demonstrators should always remain within the law. In response to a question from the SNP's Ian Blackford, he said ""all exports are conducted in accordance with a consolidated guidance and the UK is possibly the most scrupulous country in that respect in the world"".

Some of Europe's best-known art museums are reopening after closing in March for the Covid-19 pandemic - but it will be far from business as usual. Most of these museums and galleries will be limiting visitor numbers, intensifying cleaning procedures and insisting all tickets be bought online in advance. One example: normally at this time of year Amsterdam's huge and world-famous Rijksmuseum would have up to 12,000 visitors daily. From this week, that number will be strictly limited to 2,000 a day. Caravaggio's Narcissus is back on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam The UK's biggest cruise operator says it will not resume sailing until at least mid-October. P&O Cruises, which operates cruises all over the world from Southampton, had previously cancelled trips up to the end of July. The firm said it was working with ""governments and industry bodies at the highest level"" to ensure approval for enhanced safety and hygiene measures. P&O Cruises president Paul Ludlow said the company was focused on developing a way of keeping everyone on board ""safe and well, and still give our guests an amazing holiday"", rather than on what date it could resume sailing. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News As the UK stared down the barrel of a coronavirus epidemic in early March, the biggest fear was that  hospitals would be incapacitated by a tsunami of patients. The NHS largely pulled through, but there were still times when hospitals became overwhelmed. On 19 March, night-shift staff at Northwick Park Hospital in north-west London awoke to discover their workplace was so deluged with Covid patients that a critical incident had been declared. Thousands of visitors flocked to Durdle Door at the weekend, leaving litter scattered on the beach England's Jurassic Coast has been treated with ""shocking"" disrespect by visitors since lockdown restrictions were eased, conservation groups have said. The Unesco World Heritage site has been deluged with crowds in recent days. The Jurassic Coast Trust said many were ""determined to arrive at any cost"" and volunteers described ""horrendous"" amounts of litter being abandoned. Current rules state that households can drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. At least 500 coronavirus cases were missing from public health records because a Toronto area hospital failed to report them, officials have revealed. Most of the tests were done at a drive-through testing site operated by the William Osler Health System, but processed by a lab at Mount Sinai Hospital. There seems to have been some confusion about who was responsible for reporting the cases. A spokesperson for Ontario's health ministertold CBC,externalthey were had just been made aware of the ""reporting gap"" and were working with William Osler to ""correct the issue"".

effect on 8 June, with the home secretary expected to lay out regulations and update parliament tomorrow. Most passengers will have to self-isolate for 14 days, and in
England could be fined up to Â£1,000 if they fail to do so. More than 200 travel companies have written to the government
asking for the plan to be scrapped and replaced with ââairbridgesââ, whereby
countries with low coronavirus levels could agree to exempt one another's residents
from quarantine. Some MPs have also voiced concerns about the measures, which
the government says are being brought in to prevent a second wave of cases. Read
more about the new rules here  Creating ""air bridges"" between countries as a way of allowing flights to restart has been backed by the head of the UN aviation agency. Air bridges would be an arrangement allowing visitors to travel between low-risk countries without having to go into periods of quarantine. ""This concept can help our global sector to move as much as possible and, according to the medical advice, to carry the passenger in a safe and secure way,"" Dr Fang Liu, secretary-general of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), told BBC World News. She said restarting aviation was extremely important for the global economy and for social stability. The ICAO recommends wide-ranging coronavirus safety measures, including restricted access to toilets on flights. The guidelines also include limiting or suspending food and drink services on short-haul flights. Premier League leaders Liverpool held an 11v11 training match at their Anfield stadium this week English Premier League football clubs have beengiven permission to play friendly matches- under strict restrictions - before the planned
restart on 17 June. Measures
include teams not being allowed to travel more than 90 minutes and players having
to drive themselves to games. Meanwhile, Newcastle United doctor Paul Catterson has warned that clubs are preparing for ""a lot more injuries"" as players prepare to return to action after the three-month break. In

growing discrimination against people suspected of being infected with
coronavirus. In some cases the stigma has become so
extreme that people are being threatened with violence. In the central city of
Beira, those infected with the virus have been threatened with lynching. Health
officials say this has led to a fall in the number of people going to clinics
to report flu-like symptoms and other illnesses. Health workers have been sent
into communities to try to convince people to seek medical help when needed. The hostility towards those suspected of having the virus has led the health
ministry to restrict the amount of information it releases about the disease,
including not disclosing locations where cases have been confirmed. Mozambique has reported more than 250 infections. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News For those living in the worldâs largest refugee camp in Bangladesh, it was news they were expecting, but dreading: a 71-year-old man became the first Rohingya refugee to die of Covid-19. He was one of at least 29 in the camps who had tested positive for the virus. For months the settlements have been in lockdown, with all but essential aid workers allowed to visit to limit potential spread. But even with precautions, social distancing in the densely populated areas, home to nearly 1 million refugees who fled genocide in neighbouring Myanmar, has been tough. So too, the ability to share public health information about Coronavirus with a Bangladeshi government ban on internet in the camps still in place, despite calls from the UN for it to be lifted. And even the most basic of resources â like soap and water to wash hands regularly â are in short supply. To cope with the outbreak, hundreds of isolation beds have been set up but healthcare facilities are basic. There are no ventilators in the camps for the most serious of patients. Theyâd have to be taken to the nearby town of Coxâs Bazar but even there resources are limited. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Water companies are asking people in the UK toavoid using hosepipes and not to fill paddling poolsduring lockdown. The country has been basking inrecord-breaking dry weatherin recent weeks - and suppliers are urging people to use water carefully to help prevent a shortage. Water UK, which represents water companies, said it had noticed ""truly incredible surges of demand"" - up 25% in some areas - as people spend more time at home. Reservoirs are still in a healthy state, they said, but some firms canât get enough water to the taps and pressure is dropping. âIt's things like paddling pools and sprinklers that are the biggest challenge,"" Water UK chief executive Christine McGourty told BBC News. ""So weâre just asking people to save a little bit of water and thatâll make a huge difference.â Long-term weather forecasts suggest more dry summer months to come. But no hosepipe bans are currently in place. This video can not be played Coronavirus social distancing advice: What two metres looks like Scientists agree that the closer you are to someone who is infected with coronavirus, the greater the risk of catching it. But how close is too close? In the UK, some have called for the current 2m distance to be reduced in an effort to allow more people into restaurants and shops when they reopen. The World Health Organization's guidance - which is often cited by critics of the 2m rule - suggests people should stay only 1m apart. The rules vary by country: Which is the right distance? Our science editor David Shukman has beenfollowing the latest on the debate. Reality Check UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked whether he still thought - as he did in mid-May - that Britons would not be taking overseas holidays this year. He said that he was âmore optimistic than previouslyâ. As it stands, the UK government is still advising against non-essential international travel and from 8 June anybody arriving in the UK will have to isolate themselves for 14 days, including UK nationals. So it may well be that Britons will be holidaying in Britain this summer. If so, here are a few figures to bear in mind. Last August,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, UK residents made about 9.4 million visits overseas. In the same month, overseas residents made about 4.1 million visits to the UK. So popular UK destinations may get a bit crowded, even if foreign holidaymakers are not allowed in. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In response to criticism from the UK
Statistics Authority, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said improvement to the reporting of testing data is âconstantlyâ
being looked at. The government is no longer
reporting the number of people tested â there were problems with some apparent
double-counting and the fact that the figures never included the tests returned
from kits sent out by post. Mr Hancock said because the
testing system was expanded rapidly the counting of tests struggled to keep
pace. There is some truth to this. In the early days of the testing
regime, postal testing was not being used. But these questions will
not go away until the data is published and it is clear just how many people
are being tested rather than simply tests being provided. A nine-year-old Kenyan boy who designed a wooden hand-washing machine to help tackle the spread of coronavirus has told the BBC he is ""very happy"" after receiving a presidential award. ""I now have two machines and I want to make more,"" Stephen Wamukota said. They allow users to tip a bucket of water using a foot pedal to avoid touching surfaces and reduce infections. Stephen came up with the idea after learning on TV about ways to prevent catching the virus. Read more here. War-torn Yemen was already experiencing an acute humanitarian crisis The UNâs secretary-general has warned that there is a
ârace against timeâ to combat the coronavirus in Yemen, where a civil war
has already caused the worldâs largest humanitarian crisis. Reports indicated that mortality rates from Covid-19 in the second city of Aden were among the highest in the world,AntÃ³nio Guterres told a virtual pledging conference,external. âThat is just one sign of what lies ahead, if we do not
act now,â he added. Just half of Yemenâs health facilities are operational. There
are shortages of testing devices, oxygen, ambulances and protective
equipment. Many healthcare workers are among those who have been infected.
And 50% of the population do not have access to clean water to wash their
hands. Half of Yemenis do not have access to clean water Guterres said the UN and its partners urgently need $2.4bn (Â£1.9bn) in funding to cover their operations for the rest of the year. Otherwise, 30 out of 41 major UN programmes will have to close in the next few weeks in a country where 24 million people depend on aid. The UK has pledged Â£160m, which Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said would âmean the difference between life and death for thousands of Yemenisâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

Council accused of 'increasing' Covid-19 deathsDurham County Council says it followed national guidelines and refutes the claims.Tyne & Wear,"The care home is next to the University Hospital of North Durham At least 25 people have died at a care home amid claims from an industry body that a council's actions ""caused"" or ""increased Covid-19 deaths"". Melbury Court in Durham is thought to be the care home with the highest number of deaths in the UK. County Durham has had the highest number of care home deaths in England and Wales. Durham County Council said it ""strongly refuted"" the claim by the County Durham Care Home Association (CDCHA). Some patients went from the nearby University Hospital of North Durham to Melbury Court without being tested for coronavirus or after a positive test. Owners HC-One said the 87-bed home was now in ""recovery"" with many residents returning to health. It is not known how many people there have been ill. A BBC investigation has discovered that in a conference call in late March, council officials were told plans to move hospital patients into care homes without testing would be disastrous. The CDCHA offered to find a specific home or homes where Covid-19 positive or untested people could be cared for rather than have them spread around the network. This was never acted on and now the CDCHA has calculated there has been an outbreak of coronavirus in 81 of the county's 149 care homes. Maria Vincent, who runs Crosshill Care Home in Stanhope, told the council in March that care homes were not set up to accept Covid-19 patients, and described it as ""neglect pure and simple"". She said: ""They knew at the beginning how vulnerable older people were because in Spain they'd had numerous people who'd died in care homes. ""With just a little bit of forethought, true collaborative working, we could easily have got through this without the number of deaths we've had."" Maria Vincent told the council that care homes were not set up to accept Covid-19 patients The latest figures from the Office of National Statistics shows there have been 275 deaths in care homes in County Durham - more than in hospitals. Local care providers said deaths in care homes in the county are twice as high as the average for the whole of England. The council say high levels of ill health and deprivation are contributory factors. In a letter sent to Durham County Council and seen by the BBC, the CDCHA said: ""The council has pursued a policy which has caused and/or increased Covid-19 infections and deaths within care homes in County Durham"". Samuel Wilson's family said the home took an ""unnecessary risk which cost [him] his life Samuel Wilson died at Melbury Court in early May, aged 92, after testing positive for Covid-19 following his return from a routine procedure at the University Hospital of North Durham. Some of the family had objected to him going to hospital, arguing it was too risky amid the pandemic and urged staff to manage his condition in the home, but they were persuaded. His granddaughter Tracey O'Kennedy said: ""The home was relentless for a family member to take him into hospital for a non-essential procedure in the middle of full lockdown. ""In my opinion, they took an unnecessary risk, a risk that cost granddad his life."" In County Durham the council initially tied additional funding for coronavirus-related costs to homes being willing to accept people who had tested positive for the virus or were untested, although this was later changed. Durham County Council said it ""strongly refuted"" the accusation from the CDHCA that it had contributed to care home deaths. It said it had considered the idea of a separate care home for Covid-19 patients but felt it was not appropriate due to the predicted number of cases. Jane Robinson, corporate director for adults and health, said: ""We followed national guidelines and we've done absolutely everything that we can do. ""We've put in additional financial support, provided PPE, and we've provided training and support and psychological support for our care home staff as well."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Theyâd have to be taken to the nearby town of Coxâs Bazar but even there resources are limited. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Water companies are asking people in the UK toavoid using hosepipes and not to fill paddling poolsduring lockdown. The country has been basking inrecord-breaking dry weatherin recent weeks - and suppliers are urging people to use water carefully to help prevent a shortage. Water UK, which represents water companies, said it had noticed ""truly incredible surges of demand"" - up 25% in some areas - as people spend more time at home. Reservoirs are still in a healthy state, they said, but some firms canât get enough water to the taps and pressure is dropping. âIt's things like paddling pools and sprinklers that are the biggest challenge,"" Water UK chief executive Christine McGourty told BBC News. ""So weâre just asking people to save a little bit of water and thatâll make a huge difference.â Long-term weather forecasts suggest more dry summer months to come. But no hosepipe bans are currently in place.

But how close is too close? In the UK, some have called for the current 2m distance to be reduced in an effort to allow more people into restaurants and shops when they reopen. The World Health Organization's guidance - which is often cited by critics of the 2m rule - suggests people should stay only 1m apart. The rules vary by country: Which is the right distance? Our science editor David Shukman has beenfollowing the latest on the debate. Reality Check UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked whether he still thought - as he did in mid-May - that Britons would not be taking overseas holidays this year. He said that he was âmore optimistic than previouslyâ. As it stands, the UK government is still advising against non-essential international travel and from 8 June anybody arriving in the UK will have to isolate themselves for 14 days, including UK nationals. So it may well be that Britons will be holidaying in Britain this summer. If so, here are a few figures to bear in mind. Last August,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, UK residents made about 9.4 million visits overseas. In the same month, overseas residents made about 4.1 million visits to the UK. So popular UK destinations may get a bit crowded, even if foreign holidaymakers are not allowed in. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In response to criticism from the UK
Statistics Authority, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said improvement to the reporting of testing data is âconstantlyâ
being looked at. The government is no longer
reporting the number of people tested â there were problems with some apparent
double-counting and the fact that the figures never included the tests returned
from kits sent out by post. Mr Hancock said because the
testing system was expanded rapidly the counting of tests struggled to keep
pace. There is some truth to this. In the early days of the testing
regime, postal testing was not being used. But these questions will
not go away until the data is published and it is clear just how many people
are being tested rather than simply tests being provided. A nine-year-old Kenyan boy who designed a wooden hand-washing machine to help tackle the spread of coronavirus has told the BBC he is ""very happy"" after receiving a presidential award. ""I now have two machines and I want to make more,"" Stephen Wamukota said. They allow users to tip a bucket of water using a foot pedal to avoid touching surfaces and reduce infections. Stephen came up with the idea after learning on TV about ways to prevent catching the virus. Read more here. War-torn Yemen was already experiencing an acute humanitarian crisis The UNâs secretary-general has warned that there is a
ârace against timeâ to combat the coronavirus in Yemen, where a civil war
has already caused the worldâs largest humanitarian crisis. Reports indicated that mortality rates from Covid-19 in the second city of Aden were among the highest in the world,AntÃ³nio Guterres told a virtual pledging conference,external. âThat is just one sign of what lies ahead, if we do not
act now,â he added. Just half of Yemenâs health facilities are operational. There
are shortages of testing devices, oxygen, ambulances and protective
equipment. Many healthcare workers are among those who have been infected.
And 50% of the population do not have access to clean water to wash their
hands. Half of Yemenis do not have access to clean water Guterres said the UN and its partners urgently need $2.4bn (Â£1.9bn) in funding to cover their operations for the rest of the year. Otherwise, 30 out of 41 major UN programmes will have to close in the next few weeks in a country where 24 million people depend on aid. The UK has pledged Â£160m, which Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said would âmean the difference between life and death for thousands of Yemenisâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

Here's a reminder of today's headlines:  Live online coverage will resume early on Wednesday. It is ""insane"" to make MPs return to the House of Commons to vote, a public health expert claims. There has been a ""hybrid"" virtual system since mid-April, but MPstoday passed a motionto return to a physical parliament and develop a physical voting method that respects health and safety guidance from Public Health England. Critics say the move would still be ""discriminatory"" against those unable to attend. And Prof Linda Bauld, of Edinburgh University, says: ""I thought that was a really insane idea to require people to go back into Westminster, in terms of infection controls."" She adds that the science is evolving but ""it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility that immediately occupying the same space as somebody who's been speaking could be a risk"". Commenting on some MPs touching the despatch box as they stepped forward to vote, she adds: ""If it was a university environment, we'd be cleaning the podium before the next lecturer came to do their lecture."" Fans of Scotland's biggest football clubs continue to snap up season tickets for next term despite continued uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. National clinical director Jason Leitch on Saturday urged caution on BBC Scotland after the Scottish Professional Football League said it was pencilling in a 1 August return for the Premiership after last season was cut short. While four top-flight clubs have yet to start selling for next season, Aberdeen's sales have just passed the 6,000 mark, with the club aiming for 10,000 by July. Motherwell's have ""far surpassed"" last season, with more than 2,000 fans renewing. Hibernian's sales are up at 8,000, while city rivals Hearts have hit 5,000 sales despite relegation.

The Scottish government has responded to an accusation that it has not delivered on promises to improve pay and conditions of care home workers by saying it is ""currently working with local government, social care providers and trades unions on the details"". GMB Scotland secretary Gary Smith earlier told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime that the government had been slow to produce the changes to full sick pay, a pay rise and death in service payments. In a statement, the government replies: âWe are aware that there are social care workers who are anxious about being tested, as if they test positive and go off work, their weekly income will be reduced to the level of SSP (statutory sick pay). So we have intervened to ensure that social care workers do not face that situation but receive better levels of sick pay. ""We are establishing a sick pay fund to ensure that care workers who test positive for Covid-19 will receive sick pay above the current statutory level of Â£95.85 a week. âNo social care workers should avoid testing - and anyone who develops symptoms of Covid-19 must self-isolate and must be supported by their employer to do so, as per Health Protection Scotland guidance."" The Health Secretary rejects claims from the UK Statistics Authority that its testing data is incomplete. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's first minister today reminded people they should be wearing a face covering if they were in an enclosed space, such as in the shop or on public transport. But do they really work? Dr Mike Lonergan, an epidemiologist, says: ""There isnât much evidence but it looks like, from the
few studies have been done, maybe a third difference in the chances of you
infecting someone nearby."" Hugh Pennington, a professor of bacteriology, says there is evidence of a ""marginal benefit"" by limiting the amount of virus being excreted when someone is asymptomatic. And on whether the difference between one and two metres matters, Prof Pennington adds: ""Itâs reasonable common sense with a scientific tinge to it that the further away you are from somebody the less likely you are to breathe a virus they have pushed out of their nose or mouth.â Allow Twitter content?

There were 1,600 new cases confirmed, over 400 admissions to hospital and over 300 deaths. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says it is clear there is âstill some way to goâ. Worryingly, these figures are higher than countries like Spain and Italy are reporting. Both of those have been badly affected by the pandemic like the UK. They are a week or two ahead of us in terms of the trajectory on their outbreaks. But it still begs the question why our rates of infection are not lower. Allow Twitter content?

UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock is talking about today's report on coronavirus risk factors, which confirms thatpeople from black, asian and minority ethnic communities have been hit harder. He makes a reference to the current situation in the United States, saying: ""Black Lives Matter"" and pays tribute to health workers from ethnic minorities. He says he ""loves"" that the UK is ""one of the most welcoming"" countries in the world. Later the BBC's Rhianna Croxford.asks why the UKgovernment has not done more to ""support and protect"" BAME communities from the virus. Mr Hancock says he understands the anger that people feel about racial injustice and the need to tackle it, adding that he is trying to do his bit within the NHS. The old normal of globalisation, international trade driven by demand and competitive pricing - or something new? Holyrood LiveBBC Parliaments âWorkers must be put to the
fore in all our considerations,â Tory MSP Maurice Golden says, adding: âThe
task at hand is to keep business afloat and therefore protect and safeguard
jobs.â He claims the Scottish government has âsteadfastly refused to
utilise savings from the Scottish budget to support Scotland at this timeâ. Mr Golden calls for the SNP to coordinate more with the rest of
the UK, for example on manufacturing or construction, arguing Scotland benefits
enormously when Scottish and UK governments work together. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard says: âDespite the measures
introduced by both governments to help businesses keep afloat, many are already
going under.â He adds: âFor them, this is not an opportunity â it is a very real
threat.â âItâs why Scotland needs both governments to work together to
deliver the scale of investment that is needed. And it is why we must come
together and defeat the arguments for austerity, because there can be no going
back to austerity,â he argues. Scottish football ""might just make its way through"" the Covid-19 pandemic, but next season ""will be one of survival"", the man who oversaw administrations at Dundee, Hearts and Motherwell tells BBC Scotland. Football has been suspended since March and tentative plans are in place for the Premiership to resume playing in August. ""The biggest problem is the unknown,"" Bryan Jackson says. ""The only thing you can really do is cut down your expenditure, so I do fear for players and even non-players that contracts won't be renewed and that clubs will have to slim down to survive. I think the next season is really one of survival. ""When it's football, we can never tell because we have this asset not on the balance sheet known as the hardcore fans that do everything they can to try and maintain the survival of their clubs.""

During today's Scottish government coronavirus daily briefing Phil McDonald from
Global highlighted Black Lives Matter protests expected across Scotland and asked how these would fit current pandemic guidelines. The first minister
said she was a âfervent supporterâ of peaceful protests and the right for people
to have their voice heard. But she said âunfortunately and regrettablyâ large gatherings like protests pose a risk to
health at the moment. Ms Sturgeon said: ""What I would say to those who want
to protest, and I say this as an ally and supporter, is that we need to find ways
of allowing people to make their voices heard - and to make the points that
many of us want to be made and be heard right now - but to do so in a way that
is safe and is not putting people and communities at risk.""  Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Atwo-week
quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UKwill be enforced from 8
June. George Morgan-Grenville, the CEO of tour operator Red Savannah,
warns the move would be âdevastatingâ for the travel industry. He insists the argument is not over profits but the very
survival of a sector which employs up to four million people. A survey of CEOs found 71% believe they will have to make almost
two-thirds of staff redundant, while a third fear they will cease trading, Mr
Morgan-Grenville tells Drivetime. ""The industry is on the edge of an abyss,"" he says. As an alternative to a blanket quarantine requirement, he calls
for bilateral travel agreements to be put in place with countries where there
is a low rate of infection. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Holyrood LiveBBC Parliaments Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop
warns the scale of the challenge is significant, highlighting estimates
GDP could fall 33% for the duration of physical distancing and 10% of the
workforce may require benefits. Ms Hyslop says the circumstances are unprecedented and therefore it
requires an unprecedented response. She confirms Â£3m of the self-employed hardship fund will be
repurposed to support B&B owners who are ineligible for other support
because they do not have a business bank account. The cabinet secretary acknowledges the burden of the economic impacts will not fall
equally, adding: âOur recovery must ensure that we are closing the gender pay
gap and the disability employment gap.â She also insists any recovery must be a ""green recovery"". Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The Scottish government has failed to deliver on its promises of full sick pay, a pay rise and death in service payments for care home workers, according to the GMB union. Union secretary Gary Smith tells BBC Radio Scotland that care home workers remain ""terrified"" to call off sick or be tested for Covid-19 because of the loss in earnings and being ""unable to feed their families"". Asked if the issues were close to being resolved, he replies: ""No. It has been like wading through treacle quite honestly. ""The Scottish government has been great at making announcements. But they've been very poor at actually delivering."" Mr Smith claims that, while a 3.3% increase in pay was announced at Easter, money to pay for it had not been given to private companies by the government. He adds that one of the big care companies, HC-One, had agreed to increase sick pay, but he suggests that was only because of pressure from his union, which has began grievance procedures against other providers. The Scottish government has been asked for a response. The UK briefing is due to start in ten minutes.You can follow all the updates here.

"London key workers feature on British Vogue coverCommunity midwife Rachel Millar describes being on the cover of Vogue as ""surreal"".","Three front-line workers from London will star on the cover of British Vogue next month. A London Overground train driver, an east London midwife and a King's Cross supermarket worker will all feature on July's front page. Photographer Jamie Hawkesworth captured the trio of women for a 20-page portfolio for the fashion magazine. ""They represent the millions of people in the UK who, at the height of the pandemic, put on their uniforms and went to help,"" Vogue's editor-in-chief Edward Enninful said. ""This moment in history required something extra special, a moment of thanks to the new front line."" Rachel Millar,24, has worked as a community midwife at Homerton Hospital, in east London, for almost three years. She was on shift on one of the delivery suites at the hospital when a team from Vogue came in to take portraits of numerous staff for what she believed was to be a feature on NHS staff. Talking to the BBC, Rachel, who lives in Leyton, described being on the cover of British Vogue as ""surreal"". ""I'm a bit overwhelmed - but in a good way. I had no idea it would be what I now know it is,"" she said. ""I've had so many lovely comments about it and I think people have enjoyed seeing someone from the NHS on the cover. ""I feel it has given the NHS a lot of recognition and a lot of love to jobs that were perhaps previously overlooked."" Narguis Horsford,who has worked for Transport for London for 10 years and driven London Overground trains for the past five, said her manager called her to ask if she would like to do an interview for  the magazine. ""At first I thought he was winding me up,"" she said. ""But it later turned out to be very real."" Narguis, who lives Bounds Green, north London, said: ""I feel amazing to be representing the female front-line key workers. ""It's very important to highlight the hard work and contributions that we do to keep London moving and to provide services that everyone needs. ""NHS workers are obviously very important, but it's also good to highlight other workers in other sectors."" Nargius said she initially felt anxious going to work during the coronavirus outbreak but has since gone on to feel an immense sense of pride. ""I am proud to be a key worker and proud to be a train driver, taking those important workers to work."" Also featuring on the cover isAnisa Omar, who works as supermarket assistant at the London King's Cross branch of Waitrose. The 21-year-old, who lives in Islington with her parents, said the pandemic has given her a new sense of pride in her work. ""My job was not something that was that big of a deal before,"" she said. ""But now it's like we're important. We have to be here, regardless of what's happening in the world. It's more than just a job now.""

Some of Europe's best-known art museums are reopening after closing in March for the Covid-19 pandemic - but it will be far from business as usual. Most of these museums and galleries will be limiting visitor numbers, intensifying cleaning procedures and insisting all tickets be bought online in advance. One example: normally at this time of year Amsterdam's huge and world-famous Rijksmuseum would have up to 12,000 visitors daily. From this week, that number will be strictly limited to 2,000 a day. Caravaggio's Narcissus is back on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam The UK's biggest cruise operator says it will not resume sailing until at least mid-October. P&O Cruises, which operates cruises all over the world from Southampton, had previously cancelled trips up to the end of July. The firm said it was working with ""governments and industry bodies at the highest level"" to ensure approval for enhanced safety and hygiene measures. P&O Cruises president Paul Ludlow said the company was focused on developing a way of keeping everyone on board ""safe and well, and still give our guests an amazing holiday"", rather than on what date it could resume sailing. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News As the UK stared down the barrel of a coronavirus epidemic in early March, the biggest fear was that  hospitals would be incapacitated by a tsunami of patients. The NHS largely pulled through, but there were still times when hospitals became overwhelmed. On 19 March, night-shift staff at Northwick Park Hospital in north-west London awoke to discover their workplace was so deluged with Covid patients that a critical incident had been declared. Thousands of visitors flocked to Durdle Door at the weekend, leaving litter scattered on the beach England's Jurassic Coast has been treated with ""shocking"" disrespect by visitors since lockdown restrictions were eased, conservation groups have said. The Unesco World Heritage site has been deluged with crowds in recent days. The Jurassic Coast Trust said many were ""determined to arrive at any cost"" and volunteers described ""horrendous"" amounts of litter being abandoned. Current rules state that households can drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. At least 500 coronavirus cases were missing from public health records because a Toronto area hospital failed to report them, officials have revealed. Most of the tests were done at a drive-through testing site operated by the William Osler Health System, but processed by a lab at Mount Sinai Hospital. There seems to have been some confusion about who was responsible for reporting the cases. A spokesperson for Ontario's health ministertold CBC,externalthey were had just been made aware of the ""reporting gap"" and were working with William Osler to ""correct the issue"".

effect on 8 June, with the home secretary expected to lay out regulations and update parliament tomorrow. Most passengers will have to self-isolate for 14 days, and in
England could be fined up to Â£1,000 if they fail to do so. More than 200 travel companies have written to the government
asking for the plan to be scrapped and replaced with ââairbridgesââ, whereby
countries with low coronavirus levels could agree to exempt one another's residents
from quarantine. Some MPs have also voiced concerns about the measures, which
the government says are being brought in to prevent a second wave of cases. Read
more about the new rules here  Creating ""air bridges"" between countries as a way of allowing flights to restart has been backed by the head of the UN aviation agency. Air bridges would be an arrangement allowing visitors to travel between low-risk countries without having to go into periods of quarantine. ""This concept can help our global sector to move as much as possible and, according to the medical advice, to carry the passenger in a safe and secure way,"" Dr Fang Liu, secretary-general of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), told BBC World News. She said restarting aviation was extremely important for the global economy and for social stability. The ICAO recommends wide-ranging coronavirus safety measures, including restricted access to toilets on flights. The guidelines also include limiting or suspending food and drink services on short-haul flights. Premier League leaders Liverpool held an 11v11 training match at their Anfield stadium this week English Premier League football clubs have beengiven permission to play friendly matches- under strict restrictions - before the planned
restart on 17 June. Measures
include teams not being allowed to travel more than 90 minutes and players having
to drive themselves to games. Meanwhile, Newcastle United doctor Paul Catterson has warned that clubs are preparing for ""a lot more injuries"" as players prepare to return to action after the three-month break. In
other sporting news: Mary HarperAfrica editor, BBC World Service Health officials in Mozambique say there is
growing discrimination against people suspected of being infected with
coronavirus. In some cases the stigma has become so
extreme that people are being threatened with violence. In the central city of
Beira, those infected with the virus have been threatened with lynching. Health
officials say this has led to a fall in the number of people going to clinics
to report flu-like symptoms and other illnesses. Health workers have been sent
into communities to try to convince people to seek medical help when needed. The hostility towards those suspected of having the virus has led the health
ministry to restrict the amount of information it releases about the disease,
including not disclosing locations where cases have been confirmed. Mozambique has reported more than 250 infections. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News For those living in the worldâs largest refugee camp in Bangladesh, it was news they were expecting, but dreading: a 71-year-old man became the first Rohingya refugee to die of Covid-19. He was one of at least 29 in the camps who had tested positive for the virus. For months the settlements have been in lockdown, with all but essential aid workers allowed to visit to limit potential spread. But even with precautions, social distancing in the densely populated areas, home to nearly 1 million refugees who fled genocide in neighbouring Myanmar, has been tough. So too, the ability to share public health information about Coronavirus with a Bangladeshi government ban on internet in the camps still in place, despite calls from the UN for it to be lifted. And even the most basic of resources â like soap and water to wash hands regularly â are in short supply. To cope with the outbreak, hundreds of isolation beds have been set up but healthcare facilities are basic. There are no ventilators in the camps for the most serious of patients. Theyâd have to be taken to the nearby town of Coxâs Bazar but even there resources are limited. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Water companies are asking people in the UK toavoid using hosepipes and not to fill paddling poolsduring lockdown. The country has been basking inrecord-breaking dry weatherin recent weeks - and suppliers are urging people to use water carefully to help prevent a shortage.

Reservoirs are still in a healthy state, they said, but some firms canât get enough water to the taps and pressure is dropping. âIt's things like paddling pools and sprinklers that are the biggest challenge,"" Water UK chief executive Christine McGourty told BBC News. ""So weâre just asking people to save a little bit of water and thatâll make a huge difference.â Long-term weather forecasts suggest more dry summer months to come.

This video can not be played Coronavirus social distancing advice: What two metres looks like Scientists agree that the closer you are to someone who is infected with coronavirus, the greater the risk of catching it. But how close is too close? In the UK, some have called for the current 2m distance to be reduced in an effort to allow more people into restaurants and shops when they reopen. The World Health Organization's guidance - which is often cited by critics of the 2m rule - suggests people should stay only 1m apart. The rules vary by country: Which is the right distance? Our science editor David Shukman has beenfollowing the latest on the debate. Reality Check UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked whether he still thought - as he did in mid-May - that Britons would not be taking overseas holidays this year. He said that he was âmore optimistic than previouslyâ. As it stands, the UK government is still advising against non-essential international travel and from 8 June anybody arriving in the UK will have to isolate themselves for 14 days, including UK nationals. So it may well be that Britons will be holidaying in Britain this summer. If so, here are a few figures to bear in mind. Last August,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, UK residents made about 9.4 million visits overseas. In the same month, overseas residents made about 4.1 million visits to the UK. So popular UK destinations may get a bit crowded, even if foreign holidaymakers are not allowed in. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In response to criticism from the UK
Statistics Authority, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said improvement to the reporting of testing data is âconstantlyâ
being looked at. The government is no longer
reporting the number of people tested â there were problems with some apparent
double-counting and the fact that the figures never included the tests returned
from kits sent out by post. Mr Hancock said because the
testing system was expanded rapidly the counting of tests struggled to keep
pace. There is some truth to this. In the early days of the testing
regime, postal testing was not being used. But these questions will
not go away until the data is published and it is clear just how many people
are being tested rather than simply tests being provided. A nine-year-old Kenyan boy who designed a wooden hand-washing machine to help tackle the spread of coronavirus has told the BBC he is ""very happy"" after receiving a presidential award. ""I now have two machines and I want to make more,"" Stephen Wamukota said. They allow users to tip a bucket of water using a foot pedal to avoid touching surfaces and reduce infections.

War-torn Yemen was already experiencing an acute humanitarian crisis The UNâs secretary-general has warned that there is a
ârace against timeâ to combat the coronavirus in Yemen, where a civil war
has already caused the worldâs largest humanitarian crisis. Reports indicated that mortality rates from Covid-19 in the second city of Aden were among the highest in the world,AntÃ³nio Guterres told a virtual pledging conference,external. âThat is just one sign of what lies ahead, if we do not
act now,â he added. Just half of Yemenâs health facilities are operational. There
are shortages of testing devices, oxygen, ambulances and protective
equipment. Many healthcare workers are among those who have been infected.
And 50% of the population do not have access to clean water to wash their
hands. Half of Yemenis do not have access to clean water Guterres said the UN and its partners urgently need $2.4bn (Â£1.9bn) in funding to cover their operations for the rest of the year. Otherwise, 30 out of 41 major UN programmes will have to close in the next few weeks in a country where 24 million people depend on aid. The UK has pledged Â£160m, which Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said would âmean the difference between life and death for thousands of Yemenisâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

The New York Police Department (NYPD) is actively chasing the authors of looting in the city, ABC News reports. The NYPD's Intelligence Bureau was busy tracking down car registration numbers from vehicles that carried vandals, looters and thieves around Manhattan in the last two days, a police official told the US broadcaster. Some of these people had been seen outside shops with sledgehammers, crowbars and power tools, it said - suggesting a degree of planning and organisation.

"Risk of dying with coronavirus higher for ethnic minoritiesBeing black or from an ethnic minority is a ""major risk factor"" in coronavirus, Matt Hancock says.Health","This video can not be played Matt Hancock said the advice was ""the same as to everybody but with more emphasis"" People from ethnic minorities are at a higher risk of dying from coronavirus,a report by Public Health England,externalsays. It shows age remains the biggest risk factor, while being male is another. The impact of Covid-19 is also ""disproportionate"" for other Asian, Caribbean and black ethnicities. But it remains unclear why. A trade union for doctors said the report was a ""missed opportunity"" for ""action"" to be taken to protect health workers who are from ethnic minorities. The health secretary said the ""troubling"" report was ""timely"" because ""right across the world people are angry about racial injustice"". On Monday night, the Department of Health and Social Care denied reports the delay was down to official concerns of potential civil unrest linked to global anger over thedeath of African-American George Floyd. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons the public was ""understandably angry about injustices"" and that he felt a ""deep responsibility because this pandemic has exposed huge disparities in the health of our nation"". ""Black lives matter, as do those of the poorest areas of our country which have worse health outcomes and we need to make sure all of these considerations are taken into account, and action is taken to level-up the health outcomes of people across this country,"" he said. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, Mr Hancock said ""much more work"" needed to be done to understand ""what's driving these disparities"". ""We are absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this and find ways of closing this gap,"" he said, adding that he has asked equalities minister Kemi Badenoch to continue working on the issue alongside Public Health England (PHE). Call for public inquiry into virus BAME death risk Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Black Britons face 'twice the risk' of virus death The BBC's Rianna Croxford pressed Mr Hancock on whether there were any specific recommendations for people from ethnic minority backgrounds. He said everyone in ""the different high risk categories"" highlighted in the report should follow social distancing guidelines ""very stringently"". Prof John Newton said although the virus was having a worse impact on black and minority ethnic people, ""that is not necessarily because of their ethnicity"" and could instead be related to their job, for example. He said the report's findings needed to be ""widely discussed before deciding exactly what needs to be done"". ""The report if nothing else emphasises the complexity of what we're seeing, so really we're urging people not to jump to conclusions and institute measures which are not really justified by the data,"" he added. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said,external""lives depend on"" finding out why the virus disproportionately impacts black and minority ethnic people, and what actions the government was taking to stop it. Davida Wilkins, a 38-year-old district nurse in the West Midlands, told the BBC she felt ""even more anxious"" about doing her job following the report's publication. She said she felt ""obligated"" to continue her front-line role but added she cannot minimise the risks posed to her by the virus because ""it's the colour that I am and I can't change it"". A large proportion of NHS doctors are from an ethnic minority background The rapid review was launched when it became clear that some people were getting more sick with coronavirus than others. PHE reviewed thousands of existing health records and other virus data to look at disparities by: age and sex geography deprivation ethnicity pre-existing health problems or co-morbidities It is not possible to combine all of these factors together to judge an individual's risk because of the way the source data is recorded, but the data does reveal clear inequalities. The analysis on ethnicity and risk did not consider a person's occupation or obesity, even though both are known risk factors for getting seriously ill with coronavirus. The report also found: If you strip out age and sex, people of Bangladeshi ethnicity have twice the risk of death than people of white British ethnicity People aged 80 or older are 70 times more likely to die than those under 40 Working-age men diagnosed with Covid-19 are twice as likely to die as women The risk of dying with the virus is higher among those living in more deprived parts of the UK Certain occupations - security guards, taxi or bus drivers and construction workers and social care staff - are at higher risk Virus death rates were highest among people of Black and Asian ethnic groups when compared to white British ethnicity People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and other Black ethnicity had between a 10% and 50% higher risk of death when compared to white British people The government had been under pressure to publish the findings of this inquiry. It was due to be released by the end of May. Now it's here, it's not clear why there was a delay. The main findings reinforce what we already know - that belonging to an ethnic minority group is a major risk factor. It doesn't move us forward in answering why, though. The report acknowledges an important flaw in the analysis - it couldn't factor in important risks, such as a person's job and underlying health conditions, that increase the chance of dying with coronavirus. Where you live and how much you earn are important considerations too. Death rates for people living in the most deprived areas of England were more than double the least deprived areas. The report says coronavirus has replicated and in some cases increased existing health inequalities. It doesn't mention how to address those to save more lives. It acknowledges that more work is needed to understand and advise people about the risks. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the report for not providing recommendations for at-risk groups, adding that the virus ""thrives on inequality"" and ""inequality thrives on inaction"".

She said ""clear guidance and support"" from the government should be given to help the NHS tackle the risk to workers. The Royal College of Nursing pointed out that health care staff from black and ethnic minority groups faced an increased risk from the virus and that ""swift and comprehensive action"" was needed to protect workers. While the council chair of the BMA, the doctors' trade union, said the report was a ""missed opportunity"".

London key workers feature on British Vogue cover,"Three front-line workers from London will star on the cover of British Vogue next month. A London Overground train driver, an east London midwife and a King's Cross supermarket worker will all feature on July's front page. Photographer Jamie Hawkesworth captured the trio of women for a 20-page portfolio for the fashion magazine. ""They represent the millions of people in the UK who, at the height of the pandemic, put on their uniforms and went to help,"" Vogue's editor-in-chief Edward Enninful said. ""This moment in history required something extra special, a moment of thanks to the new front line."" Rachel Millar,24, has worked as a community midwife at Homerton Hospital, in east London, for almost three years. She was on shift on one of the delivery suites at the hospital when a team from Vogue came in to take portraits of numerous staff for what she believed was to be a feature on NHS staff. Talking to the BBC, Rachel, who lives in Leyton, described being on the cover of British Vogue as ""surreal"". ""I'm a bit overwhelmed - but in a good way. I had no idea it would be what I now know it is,"" she said. ""I've had so many lovely comments about it and I think people have enjoyed seeing someone from the NHS on the cover. ""I feel it has given the NHS a lot of recognition and a lot of love to jobs that were perhaps previously overlooked."" Narguis Horsford,who has worked for Transport for London for 10 years and driven London Overground trains for the past five, said her manager called her to ask if she would like to do an interview for  the magazine. ""At first I thought he was winding me up,"" she said. ""But it later turned out to be very real."" Narguis, who lives Bounds Green, north London, said: ""I feel amazing to be representing the female front-line key workers. ""It's very important to highlight the hard work and contributions that we do to keep London moving and to provide services that everyone needs. ""NHS workers are obviously very important, but it's also good to highlight other workers in other sectors."" Nargius said she initially felt anxious going to work during the coronavirus outbreak but has since gone on to feel an immense sense of pride. ""I am proud to be a key worker and proud to be a train driver, taking those important workers to work."" Also featuring on the cover isAnisa Omar, who works as supermarket assistant at the London King's Cross branch of Waitrose. The 21-year-old, who lives in Islington with her parents, said the pandemic has given her a new sense of pride in her work. ""My job was not something that was that big of a deal before,"" she said. ""But now it's like we're important. We have to be here, regardless of what's happening in the world. It's more than just a job now.""

Chief medical officers against lowering Covid alert,"There is no judgement more important right now than gauging the trade-off between reopening the economy and the measures limiting the spread of coronavirus. But the BBC understands that all four chief medical officers of the UK nations, including England's Professor Chris Whitty, opposed the prime minister's hopes of lowering the Covid-19 alert level last week. Less than a month ago, Boris Johnson announced that any easing of the lockdown would be conditional on a lower alert level, alongside ""five tests"" on the spread of infection being met. Indeed, when the prime minister promised on 10 May to ease the lockdown around open air markets and primary schools, as happened on Monday, he issued an important caveat: ""If the alert level won't allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right."" The next day, the government's ""Plan to Rebuild"" said that the changes to the lockdown ""must be warranted by the current alert level"". At that time the alert level was 4, indicating that ""transmission is high or rising exponentially"". At level 3, transmission is no longer considered ""high"" but a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation. Level 3 justifies ""gradual relaxing of restrictions and social distancing measures"". On Wednesday last week, the prime minister told parliament's Liaison Committee that ""we're coming down the Covid alert system from level 4 to Level 3 tomorrow, we hope, we're going to be taking a decision tomorrow"". That was in reply to a question from the Northern Ireland Select Committee chair Simon Hoare about the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings. But the next day, the government decided instead not to lower the alert level. There were two other important meetings that day. One was between the four nations' chief medical officers. The other was between the devolved governments and the PM, and easing the alert level across the UK was expected to be discussed. Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has made a point of saying that the number of cases ""remain high - it's not a low number"" ""It was clear that government wanted to change it and scientists and the chief medical officer didn't,"" said one political source involved. This account was later confirmed to me by a scientist involved in pandemic planning, and sources in three governments said that all four chief medical officers from England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland did not back the hoped-for move to alert level 3. The government itself has not confirmed or denied this account, only suggested that it was ""always clear"" that the alert level was not the primary reason for easing lockdown. But the doubts harboured by the country's most senior medical adviser, and other scientists, about lowering the alert level do matter. The government pressed on with the modest easing of the lockdown, even after the PM's promise last month that any relaxation would be conditional on a lowering of the alert level. In early May measures such as reopening primary schools and markets were promised ""no earlier"" than 1 June. NHS Medical Director Professor Stephen Powis said the Joint Biosecurity Centre was ""currently under development setting itself up"" Last week, ministers were left describing how the alert level was ""transitioning to 3"" to justify going ahead with easing the lockdown, even as the level technically remained at 4. But at the government's daily coronavirus briefing last Thursday, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance made a point of saying that the number of cases ""remain high - it's not a low number"" and that in some places the transmission rate, or R-value, remained ""close to 1"". He added that the UK remained in a ""fragile state"" and should be prepared to re-impose measures if necessary. Over the weekend, a series of senior members of the Sage advisory committee announced that the easing of lockdown was premature. Then there is a more significant question about who actually decides the alert level. The prime minister had said last month that it should be the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC). When I asked at last Friday's government briefing what the centre had said, NHS medical director Prof Stephen Powis replied that the JBC was ""currently under development setting itself up"" and ""feeding information into the four chief medical officers who have to think about alert levels"". But on Tuesday, Number 10 confirmed that this would no longer be the case, and it was ""ultimately"" the UK chief medical officers' job to set the alert level using analysis from the JBC which has now ""begun operating"". And that raises another key concern. It is my understanding that there are some tensions between administrations, and some of this spilt out into the teleconference last Thursday. The Joint Biosecurity Centre has not been signed off by the devolved administrations. Some expressed disappointment that the government's Cobra civil contingencies committee had not met in the three-week period before the latest round of lockdown easing was confirmed in Westminster. The prime minister pointed to what he saw as particular problems in Scottish care homes, and also mentioned north Wales as a Covid-19 hotspot, although scientists say that this is due to a change in measurement. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the prime minister ""locked horns"" on the care home issue, I'm told. Another source says the half hour call ""was supposed to be about the alert level, but the doctors and scientists had already killed off the move"". Even if the medics had agreed, it is quite plausible that the Scottish and Welsh governments would have refused to lower the alert level. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is expected to make an effort to keep Welsh and Scottish administrations onside. Other experts point out that applying a terror alert-style system to pandemics simply might not work, as the government's own decisions have a significant direct impact on transmission rates, unlike terrorism. The terror alert system also has no transition state between its levels. And there are questions about whether this new system is meant to replace the Sage experts, and why exactly that is happening. The fear is that this vital new policy development, designed to clearly communicate risk levels across the nations of the UK to workers, businesses, parents and pensioners has more than just teething problems. The government is now downplaying the importance of the system to lifting lockdown. The concern is that the system, explained in some detail by the PM in an address to the nation, now risks being dead on arrival. UK alert level raised to four - what does that mean?

"Trump threatens to send in army to end unrestAs fury over a black man's killing by police continues, a top bishop condemns Mr Trump's actions.US & Canada","This video can not be played Trump declares himself the ""law and order president"" President Donald Trump has threatened to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest in the US over the death of a black man in police custody. He said if cities and states failed to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he would deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Protests over the death of George Floyd have escalated over the past week. Presidential candidate Joe Biden criticised Mr Trump on Tuesday for ""serving the passions of his base"". ""We're not going to allow any president to quiet our voice,"" the Democrat said, referencing the US constitution which guarantees protestors' freedom to assemble. On Tuesday theLas Vegas sheriff said an officer died,externalin a shooting after police attempted to disperse a crowd. Dozens of people have been injured as authorities used tear gas and force to disperse protests which have swept more than 75 cities. Four officers meanwhile were shot and injured on Monday night during unrest in St Louis, Missouri. Live updates from around the US CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African-Americans treated? NEWS REPORTERS:A new target for police? DECEPTIVE FOOTAGE:Conspiracy theories spread online HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life Dozens of major cities have imposed overnight curfews. In New York on Monday night, the iconic department store Macy's was broken into, as shops were looted and windows smashed Curfew in the city will resume at 20:00 (midnight GMT) on Tuesday In Chicago, two people were reported killed amid unrest, although the circumstances are unclear The chief of police in Louisville, Kentucky has been sacked after law enforcement officers fired into a crowd on Sunday night, killing the owner of a nearby business Australian PM Scott Morrison has demanded an investigation into the alleged assault by police of two Australian journalists covering protests in Washington DC Music channels and celebrities have pledged to mark Blackout Tuesday, pausing for eight minutes - the length of time a police officer knelt on Mr Floyd's neck This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting The protests began after a video showed Mr Floyd, 46, being arrested in Minneapolis on 25 May and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and will appear in court next week. Three other police officers have been fired. The Floyd case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. For many, the outrage also reflectsyears of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination, not least in Minneapolis itself. The president delivered a brief address from the White House Rose Garden, amid the sound of a nearby protest being dispersed. Mr Trump said ""all Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd"" but said his memory must not be ""drowned out by an angry mob"". He described the scenes of looting and violence in the capital on Sunday as ""a total disgrace"" before pledging to bolster the city's defences. ""I'm dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,"" he said. This video can not be played The peaceful protests honouring George Floyd He called on cities and states to deploy the National Guard, the reserve military force that can be called on to intervene in domestic emergencies, ""in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets"". About 16,000 troops have been deployed so far. Mr Trump added: ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary... then I'll deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" In order to take that step, the president would have to invoke the Insurrection Act, which in some circumstances first requires a request from state governors for him to do so. This law was last invoked in 1992 during riots in Los Angeles following the acquittal of four police officers charged with assaulting black motorist Rodney King. Mr Trump's warning was met with swift criticism from senior Democrats. Joe Biden, the party's presumptive presidential candidate, said Mr Trump ""[was] using the American military against the American people"". Following his address, Mr Trump walked to a nearby church which had been damaged by protesters on Sunday night. He and a number of aides stood at the steps of the building as Mr Trump held up a Bible in front of the gathered press. Mr Trump posed in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse protesters nearby His actions were condemned by Washington's Episcopalian bishop, Mariann Budde. ""He took the symbols sacred to our tradition and stood in front of a house of prayer in full expectation that would be a celebratory moment,"" she said. ""There was nothing I could do but speak out against that."" Trump's church visit shocks religious leaders Throughout Monday, pressure grew on Donald Trump to take action to address the rising unrest in major cities across the US. As the sun set in Washington DC, in a hastily arranged Rose Garden address, the president outlined what that action would be. Governors were warned that if they did not effectively secure property and safety on the streets, the president would cite a centuries-old law to dispatch the US Army on American soil. And in the District of Columbia, which is under federal authority, the president had already ordered the military to deploy in force. Moments before the president spoke, promising he was on the side of peaceful protesters, those armed soldiers cleared out peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House. It set the stage for the president to walk with his senior staff across the park to St John's Church, which was lightly damaged in a fire set by rioters the previous evening - an important symbolic gesture or an unnecessary photo opportunity, depending on one's perspective. Posing in front of the building with a Bible, he promised that America was ""coming back strong"" and ""it won't take long"". There was no talk of police reforms or the root causes of the protests that began last week at any point in the evening's proceedings. Instead, he said he was the ""president of law and order"" - a sign, it seems, that his solution to the ongoing crisis will be an escalation of force. How has the unrest affected you?

weâd like to leave you with this picture from Paris, looking more like its old self after cafes and
restaurants reopened after months of closure.

Some of Europe's best-known art museums are reopening after closing in March for the Covid-19 pandemic - but it will be far from business as usual. Most of these museums and galleries will be limiting visitor numbers, intensifying cleaning procedures and insisting all tickets be bought online in advance. One example: normally at this time of year Amsterdam's huge and world-famous Rijksmuseum would have up to 12,000 visitors daily. From this week, that number will be strictly limited to 2,000 a day. Caravaggio's Narcissus is back on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam The UK's biggest cruise operator says it will not resume sailing until at least mid-October. P&O Cruises, which operates cruises all over the world from Southampton, had previously cancelled trips up to the end of July. The firm said it was working with ""governments and industry bodies at the highest level"" to ensure approval for enhanced safety and hygiene measures. P&O Cruises president Paul Ludlow said the company was focused on developing a way of keeping everyone on board ""safe and well, and still give our guests an amazing holiday"", rather than on what date it could resume sailing. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News As the UK stared down the barrel of a coronavirus epidemic in early March, the biggest fear was that  hospitals would be incapacitated by a tsunami of patients. The NHS largely pulled through, but there were still times when hospitals became overwhelmed. On 19 March, night-shift staff at Northwick Park Hospital in north-west London awoke to discover their workplace was so deluged with Covid patients that a critical incident had been declared. Thousands of visitors flocked to Durdle Door at the weekend, leaving litter scattered on the beach England's Jurassic Coast has been treated with ""shocking"" disrespect by visitors since lockdown restrictions were eased, conservation groups have said. The Unesco World Heritage site has been deluged with crowds in recent days. The Jurassic Coast Trust said many were ""determined to arrive at any cost"" and volunteers described ""horrendous"" amounts of litter being abandoned. Current rules state that households can drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. At least 500 coronavirus cases were missing from public health records because a Toronto area hospital failed to report them, officials have revealed. Most of the tests were done at a drive-through testing site operated by the William Osler Health System, but processed by a lab at Mount Sinai Hospital. There seems to have been some confusion about who was responsible for reporting the cases. A spokesperson for Ontario's health ministertold CBC,externalthey were had just been made aware of the ""reporting gap"" and were working with William Osler to ""correct the issue"". The cases go back to April, so officials will focus their contact tracing on the ones that tested positive in the past 14 days. ""Many of the cases from more than 14 days ago would now be considered resolved,""a statement released by Ontario Health read.,external Speaking at the briefing earlier, English Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people from ethnic minorities - and anyone in a higher risk group - should ""stringently"" follow social distancing guidelines to protect themselves from coronavirus.

We have to be here, regardless of what's happening in the world. It's more than just a job now."" A two-week quarantine period for UK arrivals comes in to
effect on 8 June, with the home secretary expected to lay out regulations and update parliament tomorrow. Most passengers will have to self-isolate for 14 days, and in
England could be fined up to Â£1,000 if they fail to do so. More than 200 travel companies have written to the government
asking for the plan to be scrapped and replaced with ââairbridgesââ, whereby
countries with low coronavirus levels could agree to exempt one another's residents
from quarantine. Some MPs have also voiced concerns about the measures, which
the government says are being brought in to prevent a second wave of cases. Read
more about the new rules here  Creating ""air bridges"" between countries as a way of allowing flights to restart has been backed by the head of the UN aviation agency. Air bridges would be an arrangement allowing visitors to travel between low-risk countries without having to go into periods of quarantine. ""This concept can help our global sector to move as much as possible and, according to the medical advice, to carry the passenger in a safe and secure way,"" Dr Fang Liu, secretary-general of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), told BBC World News. She said restarting aviation was extremely important for the global economy and for social stability. The ICAO recommends wide-ranging coronavirus safety measures, including restricted access to toilets on flights. The guidelines also include limiting or suspending food and drink services on short-haul flights. Premier League leaders Liverpool held an 11v11 training match at their Anfield stadium this week English Premier League football clubs have beengiven permission to play friendly matches- under strict restrictions - before the planned
restart on 17 June. Measures
include teams not being allowed to travel more than 90 minutes and players having
to drive themselves to games. Meanwhile, Newcastle United doctor Paul Catterson has warned that clubs are preparing for ""a lot more injuries"" as players prepare to return to action after the three-month break. In
other sporting news: Mary HarperAfrica editor, BBC World Service Health officials in Mozambique say there is
growing discrimination against people suspected of being infected with
coronavirus. In some cases the stigma has become so
extreme that people are being threatened with violence. In the central city of
Beira, those infected with the virus have been threatened with lynching. Health
officials say this has led to a fall in the number of people going to clinics
to report flu-like symptoms and other illnesses. Health workers have been sent
into communities to try to convince people to seek medical help when needed. The hostility towards those suspected of having the virus has led the health
ministry to restrict the amount of information it releases about the disease,
including not disclosing locations where cases have been confirmed. Mozambique has reported more than 250 infections. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News For those living in the worldâs largest refugee camp in Bangladesh, it was news they were expecting, but dreading: a 71-year-old man became the first Rohingya refugee to die of Covid-19. He was one of at least 29 in the camps who had tested positive for the virus. For months the settlements have been in lockdown, with all but essential aid workers allowed to visit to limit potential spread. But even with precautions, social distancing in the densely populated areas, home to nearly 1 million refugees who fled genocide in neighbouring Myanmar, has been tough. So too, the ability to share public health information about Coronavirus with a Bangladeshi government ban on internet in the camps still in place, despite calls from the UN for it to be lifted. And even the most basic of resources â like soap and water to wash hands regularly â are in short supply. To cope with the outbreak, hundreds of isolation beds have been set up but healthcare facilities are basic. There are no ventilators in the camps for the most serious of patients. Theyâd have to be taken to the nearby town of Coxâs Bazar but even there resources are limited. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Water companies are asking people in the UK toavoid using hosepipes and not to fill paddling poolsduring lockdown. The country has been basking inrecord-breaking dry weatherin recent weeks - and suppliers are urging people to use water carefully to help prevent a shortage. Water UK, which represents water companies, said it had noticed ""truly incredible surges of demand"" - up 25% in some areas - as people spend more time at home. Reservoirs are still in a healthy state, they said, but some firms canât get enough water to the taps and pressure is dropping. âIt's things like paddling pools and sprinklers that are the biggest challenge,"" Water UK chief executive Christine McGourty told BBC News. ""So weâre just asking people to save a little bit of water and thatâll make a huge difference.â Long-term weather forecasts suggest more dry summer months to come. But no hosepipe bans are currently in place. This video can not be played Coronavirus social distancing advice: What two metres looks like Scientists agree that the closer you are to someone who is infected with coronavirus, the greater the risk of catching it. But how close is too close? In the UK, some have called for the current 2m distance to be reduced in an effort to allow more people into restaurants and shops when they reopen. The World Health Organization's guidance - which is often cited by critics of the 2m rule - suggests people should stay only 1m apart. The rules vary by country: Which is the right distance? Our science editor David Shukman has beenfollowing the latest on the debate. Reality Check UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked whether he still thought - as he did in mid-May - that Britons would not be taking overseas holidays this year. He said that he was âmore optimistic than previouslyâ. As it stands, the UK government is still advising against non-essential international travel and from 8 June anybody arriving in the UK will have to isolate themselves for 14 days, including UK nationals. So it may well be that Britons will be holidaying in Britain this summer. If so, here are a few figures to bear in mind. Last August,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, UK residents made about 9.4 million visits overseas. In the same month, overseas residents made about 4.1 million visits to the UK. So popular UK destinations may get a bit crowded, even if foreign holidaymakers are not allowed in. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In response to criticism from the UK
Statistics Authority, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said improvement to the reporting of testing data is âconstantlyâ
being looked at. The government is no longer
reporting the number of people tested â there were problems with some apparent
double-counting and the fact that the figures never included the tests returned
from kits sent out by post. Mr Hancock said because the
testing system was expanded rapidly the counting of tests struggled to keep
pace. There is some truth to this. In the early days of the testing
regime, postal testing was not being used. But these questions will
not go away until the data is published and it is clear just how many people
are being tested rather than simply tests being provided. A nine-year-old Kenyan boy who designed a wooden hand-washing machine to help tackle the spread of coronavirus has told the BBC he is ""very happy"" after receiving a presidential award. ""I now have two machines and I want to make more,"" Stephen Wamukota said. They allow users to tip a bucket of water using a foot pedal to avoid touching surfaces and reduce infections. Stephen came up with the idea after learning on TV about ways to prevent catching the virus. Read more here. War-torn Yemen was already experiencing an acute humanitarian crisis The UNâs secretary-general has warned that there is a
ârace against timeâ to combat the coronavirus in Yemen, where a civil war
has already caused the worldâs largest humanitarian crisis. Reports indicated that mortality rates from Covid-19 in the second city of Aden were among the highest in the world,AntÃ³nio Guterres told a virtual pledging conference,external. âThat is just one sign of what lies ahead, if we do not
act now,â he added. Just half of Yemenâs health facilities are operational. There
are shortages of testing devices, oxygen, ambulances and protective
equipment. Many healthcare workers are among those who have been infected.
And 50% of the population do not have access to clean water to wash their
hands. Half of Yemenis do not have access to clean water Guterres said the UN and its partners urgently need $2.4bn (Â£1.9bn) in funding to cover their operations for the rest of the year. Otherwise, 30 out of 41 major UN programmes will have to close in the next few weeks in a country where 24 million people depend on aid.

RSC postpones performances due to virus,"The company says the decision was made with ""huge sadness"" The Royal Shakespeare Company has postponed or cancelled planned performances and events due to the coronavirus crisis. Summer season plays including The Winter's Tale were called off as well as shows planned for autumn and winter. The RSC said the decision had been made with ""huge sadness"" and the box office would be contacting ticket holders. But it is looking at a possible earlier reopening of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre (RST) in Stratford-upon-Avon. ""The ability to stage the productions in the autumn is dependent on government advice on social distancing and whether it is financially viable for the Company to open its theatres and perform to audiences,"" it said. If possible it would re-schedule The Winter's Tale and The Comedy of Errors at the RST, where they were due to open in the spring. Meanwhile it is moving its planned winter season to next year. The RSC was looking into whether its main Stratford theatre could reopen sooner Many theatres and concert halls are struggling after closing their doors during lockdown, with no clear indication of when shows might resume. The RSC said it terminated contracts and furloughed 90% of employees while seeking income from government schemes. Latest news from the West Midlands It has made 17 productions available to watch online, including Richard II with David Tennant, Hamlet and Othello. It has also provided home learning resources.

Ministers 'consider relaxing UK travel quarantine',"Passengers at Heathrow Airport earlier this year, after being rescued from a cruise ship The government is looking at ways to relax the 14-day quarantine rule for people entering the UK over the coming months, BBC Newsnight has learnt. From Monday, most people arriving by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - must self-isolate. But some MPs and businesses have expressed concern at the plan, warning it will damage the travel industry. One government source told Newsnight that ministers were looking at ways around the coronavirus quarantine. This could include expanding the list of workers who are exempt from the 14-day rule, or travel corridors to countries with low infection rates, which the government has previously said it was considering. Any changes would be guided by the science but one possible date for a relaxation to the rule could be 20 July, coinciding with school holidays, Newsnight was told. Meanwhile, the latest Office for National Statistics figures show the number of deaths each week linked to coronavirus hasdropped to its lowest levels in England and Wales since March. The ONS figures show there were 2,589 deaths in the week ending 22 May, which was the lowest weekly number for seven weeks. The figures show that overall, there have been around 286,700 deaths this year - some 43,800 have been attributed to coronavirus. What are the new quarantine rules for passengers? Will I be able to go on holiday this year? UK must agree 'air bridges', warn business groups The quarantine measures come into force on 8 June, althoughsome professions are exempt,,externalsuch as lorry drivers, police officers, seasonal farm workers, and healthcare professionals. Also exempt will be people coming from the Irish Republic, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Travellers will have to tell the UK government where they will be staying and if they do not provide an address, officials will arrange accommodation. In England, there will be random spot checks and Â£1,000 fines, while governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can impose their own penalties. Housing minister Simon Clarke told BBC Breakfast that the quarantine policy was ""a proportionate step"" which would minimise the risk of new cases coming into the UK ""just at the time that we are getting a grip on it"". He said it was a ""temporary, time-limited measure"", but added that it was ""vital"" it was introduced for as long as required. The plan is expected to be set out in more detail when it is laid before Parliament this week. MPs are returning to Westminster on Tuesday after weeks of proceedings taking place virtually. Extra guidance about what arrivals would be allowed to do is also expected to be set out, including that travellers will be allowed to take public transport if they are unable to get to their accommodation by any other means. The quarantine plan is due to be reviewed every three weeks, with the first review due at the end of June. On Monday, some primary children returned to school, but had to socially distance Meanwhile, horseracing resumed behind closed doors Announcing the plan last month, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the measure would ""reduce the risk of cases crossing our border"". But there has been criticism from some of the government's own MPs as well as the travel and aviation industry. One former cabinet minister told Newsnight the idea was ""daft"" and suggested the government will not ""go to the stake on this"". Meanwhile, more than 200 business leaders havecalled on the government to scrap the policy,saying it was ""deeply worrying for our economy and our country"". The group of firms - including hotel The Ritz and upmarket travel agent Kuoni - want the government to instead introduce ""air bridges"", an arrangement which would allow visitors from low-risk countries into the UK without having to quarantine for 14 days. Last month, the bosses of airlines including EasyJet, Tui, Jet2 and Virgin Atlantic also said they had ""serious reservations"" about a ""blanket approach"" to all arrivals into Britain. The idea of ""air bridges"" has been around since 18 May, when Transport Secretary Grant told MPs that the government was looking at striking exemption deals with countries with low infection rates. If the government can agree a series of ""air bridge"" agreements, then they wouldn't necessarily replace the quarantine altogether. This is about moving from a blanket travel quarantine - only the Republic of Ireland will be exempt initially - on 8 June to something more nuanced in a few weeks' time. One government source told the BBC that ""a lot of work"" was currently being done on securing safe travel corridors from certain low-risk countries. The ambition from certain people in government is that some of these will be in place by the first review date of 29 June. Testing people for coronavirus when they arrive into the UK from higher risk countries is also being considered. At the weekend, former environment secretary Theresa Villiers told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour she thought quarantine rules should be targeted on flights ""from Covid hotspots"". She also said the government was ""actively looking at air bridges"". BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said reports in the Portuguese media ""suggest an air bridge with Portugal is on the cards"". But, he added, the UK is behind other countries in Europe in terms of controlling the virus and so, in negotiations, ""the ball might not be in the UK's court"". Spain's tourism minister said British coronavirus figures ""still have to improve""before the country would receive tourists from the UK, while Greece will not allow UK visitors whenit opens up later this month. THE ISOLATION TAPES:Elis and John take on yoga DAVID ATTENBOROUGH'S MINDFUL MIX:Soothing sounds to escape to A UK government spokesman previously said: ""These cross-government public health measures are designed to keep the transmission rate down, stop new cases being brought in from abroad and help prevent a devastating second wave of coronavirus. ""All of our decisions have been based on the latest scientific evidence. ""The list of exemptions has been agreed by all government departments in consultation with their stakeholders which will ensure critical supplies and services can continue and will be kept under review."" It comes as the number of people who have died after testing positive for the virus in the UK reached 39,045.

"TV, radio and music stars mark 'Blackout Tuesday'","Mistajam's BBC 1Xtra show is one of several programmes to reflect the conversation around George Floyd's death Radio stations and TV channels have changed their programmes to mark ""Blackout Tuesday"", reflecting on George Floyd's death in police custody. BBC Radio 1Xtra is hosting a series of discussions and debates in support of the black community, with song choices that reflect black pride and identity. Many record labels and music stars have stopped work to observe the initiative. MTV went silent for eight minutes - the length of time a white police officer knelt on Mr Floyd's neck. The gesture has been replicated on other channels including VH1 and Comedy Central, while 4 Music willpause its output,externalonce an hour throughout the day. Live updates from around the US Clara Amfo praised for anti-racism speech on Radio 1 Music industry 'has a long way to go' There have also been moments of reflection on BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2, while commercial radio stations including Kiss, Magic and Absolute Radio are observing a social media blackout ""to show that racism of any kind cannot be tolerated"".

On Radio 1,Clara Amfo gave a powerful speechabout the effects of racism and the recent events on her mental health. The broadcaster said Mr Floyd's death reinforced a feeling among black people ""that people want our culture, but they do not want us"". Music companies and musicians around the world adopted Tuesday as a day of reflection and protest in the wake of Mr Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. Katy Perry posted a plain black square to her Instagram account with the caption,external: ""I hope that #BlackoutTuesday gives us all (especially in the music industry) an opportunity to take what we're learning and put it into action on Wednesday, and every day going forward."" Rihanna said her Fenty beauty label would not conduct any business on Tuesday. Apple's iTunes store and its streaming service Apple Music replaced their usual carousels of new music and playlists with a slide stating: ""This moment calls upon us all to speak and act against racism and injustice of all kinds."" Listeners were then directed to a livestream of the Beats 1 radio station, where the music is focusing on themes of black empowerment and civil rights. (All of the service's usual tracks were still available through the search function, however.) Apple Music has replaced its regular carousel of new music and playlists with a simple message Spotify, meanwhile, blacked out the artwork for several of its most prominent playlists, including Today's Hits and Rap Caviar. The company also inserted a silence of eight minutes and 46 seconds into selected podcasts and playlists ""as a solemn acknowledgement for the length of time that George Floyd was suffocated"". The movement began last Friday, when a number of companies and artists shared a statement posted under the hashtag #TheShowMustBePaused, calling for ""a day to disconnect from work and reconnect with our community"" and ""an urgent step of action to provoke accountability and change"". The initiative was started by Atlantic Records marketing executives Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas, and spread by hundreds of artists including Billie Eilish, Britney Spears, the Rolling Stones, Radiohead, producer Quincy Jones and Eminem. ""Tuesday, June 2nd is meant to intentionally disrupt the work week,""wrote Agyemang and Thomas,external. ""The music industry is a multi-billion dollar industry.

All three major record labels - Universal, Sony and Warner Music, whose combined annual revenues exceed $16bn (Â£12.75bn) - signed up to the initiative, as did many independent labels, the Glastonbury Festival and event organisers Live Nation. Interscope Records also vowed to stop releasing new music for a week, while many others donated money to the George Floyd Memorial Fund.

""But I have no interest in supporting major label record executive white guilt day."" However, Agyemang and Thomas have stressed the blackout is just the beginning of a larger campaign.

House prices in 'largest monthly fall for 11 years',"House prices fell 1.7% in May from the previous month, the largest monthly fall for 11 years, according to the Nationwide. Annual house price growth halved from 3.7% to 1.8%, as the coronavirus crisis hit market activity. The latest HMRC data showed that residential property transactions fell 53% in April compared with 2019. ""The medium-term outlook for the housing market remains highly uncertain,"" the Nationwide warned. ""We have already seen a sharp economic contraction as a result of the necessary measures adopted to suppress the spread of the virus,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. But he pointed out that the raft of policies adopted to support the economy should ""set the stage for a rebound once the shock passes"" and help limit long-term damage. ""These same measures should also help ensure the impact on the housing market will ultimately be less than would normally be associated with an economic shock of this magnitude,"" he predicted. The figures are based on Nationwide's lending data, do not include cash purchases, and may have a greater volatility owing to the very low levels of activity. Yet, the big month-to-month drop in Nationwide's house price index in May - the largest since February 2009 - ""is just the start of a protracted decline over the remainder of this year,"" warned Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Before the pandemic struck the UK, the housing market had been steadily gathering momentum, the Nationwide said. Activity levels and price growth were edging up thanks to continued robust labour market conditions, low borrowing costs and a more stable political backdrop following the general election. ""Behavioural changes and social distancing are likely to impact the flow of housing transactions for some time,"" Mr Gardner said. New mortgage holiday 'should affect credit record' 'Short-lived' rebound in house hunter demand Mortgage payment holiday extended for three months UK property sales hit record low in April Recent Nationwide research suggested that one in eight people had put off moving because of the lockdown. But the majority saw the current situation as a temporary pause in the market, with would-be buyers planning to wait six months on average before looking to enter the market. Early indicators of housing demand have picked up since in-person property viewings were permitted again on 13 May, said Pantheon Macroeconomics. It said the daily volume of Google searches for the three main property portals had increased to be just 13% below its pre-lockdown level, having been down 50% in April. ""Relatively few people likely will be forced to sell their homes, given that mortgage payment holidays are easily available and home ownership has declined,"" said Mr Tombs. ""Nonetheless, the huge size of the blow from Covid-19 to households' incomes and the deterioration in consumers' confidence suggests that house prices must drop."" He predicted a 5% fall in prices by the end of the third quarter of the year. Lots of mortgage holders have deferred payments during the coronavirus outbreak Separate figures from the Bank of England show how the mortgage market decelerated sharply alongside the house sales shutdown. Some 15,848 mortgage approvals for house purchases were recorded in April - about 80% below February levels before the coronavirus crisis took hold, the Bank said. This was around half the number of approvals taking place in the trough during the financial crisis, and the lowest since the figures started in 1993. Approvals for re-mortgaging fell by a lesser extent during the month, to 34,400, some 34% lower than in February. The UK's financial watchdog has confirmed the support firms should give to mortgage customers who are either coming to the end of a payment holiday or who are yet to request one. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said last month that homeowners struggling financially due to coronavirus would be able to extend their mortgage payment holiday for a further three months, or cut payments. On Tuesday, it confirmed customers yet to apply for a payment holiday have until 31 October 2020 to do so. Meanwhile the current ban on lender repossessions of homes will be continued to 31 October. ""The measures we have confirmed today will mean anyone who needs to can get help from their lender, if they are still struggling to pay their mortgage due to coronavirus,"" said Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA. ""It is important that if a consumer can afford to re-start mortgage payments, it is in their best interests to do so. Customers should talk to their firm about the best option available for them."" On Friday, the Nationwide's chief executive, Joe Garner, argued that it would be prudent for extensions to mortgage holidays to bemarked temporarily on a borrower's credit file. However, the FCA said the current guidance - that taking a deferral should not have a negative impact on a borrower's credit file - should continue. The regulator pointed out that lenders could still use details obtained from other sources, such as bank account information, when making their decisions on whether to grant other loans.

Concerns grow over lockdown alert level system,"There is no judgement more important right now than gauging the trade-off between reopening the economy and the measures limiting the spread of coronavirus. But the BBC understands that all four chief medical officers of the UK nations, including England's Professor Chris Whitty, opposed the prime minister's hopes of lowering the Covid-19 alert level last week. Less than a month ago, Boris Johnson announced that any easing of the lockdown would be conditional on a lower alert level, alongside ""five tests"" on the spread of infection being met. Indeed, when the prime minister promised on 10 May to ease the lockdown around open air markets and primary schools, as happened on Monday, he issued an important caveat: ""If the alert level won't allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right."" The next day, the government's ""Plan to Rebuild"" said that the changes to the lockdown ""must be warranted by the current alert level"". At that time the alert level was 4, indicating that ""transmission is high or rising exponentially"". At level 3, transmission is no longer considered ""high"" but a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation. Level 3 justifies ""gradual relaxing of restrictions and social distancing measures"". On Wednesday last week, the prime minister told parliament's Liaison Committee that ""we're coming down the Covid alert system from level 4 to Level 3 tomorrow, we hope, we're going to be taking a decision tomorrow"". That was in reply to a question from the Northern Ireland Select Committee chair Simon Hoare about the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings. But the next day, the government decided instead not to lower the alert level. There were two other important meetings that day. One was between the four nations' chief medical officers. The other was between the devolved governments and the PM, and easing the alert level across the UK was expected to be discussed. Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has made a point of saying that the number of cases ""remain high - it's not a low number"" ""It was clear that government wanted to change it and scientists and the chief medical officer didn't,"" said one political source involved. This account was later confirmed to me by a scientist involved in pandemic planning, and sources in three governments said that all four chief medical officers from England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland did not back the hoped-for move to alert level 3. The government itself has not confirmed or denied this account, only suggested that it was ""always clear"" that the alert level was not the primary reason for easing lockdown. But the doubts harboured by the country's most senior medical adviser, and other scientists, about lowering the alert level do matter. The government pressed on with the modest easing of the lockdown, even after the PM's promise last month that any relaxation would be conditional on a lowering of the alert level. In early May measures such as reopening primary schools and markets were promised ""no earlier"" than 1 June. NHS Medical Director Professor Stephen Powis said the Joint Biosecurity Centre was ""currently under development setting itself up"" Last week, ministers were left describing how the alert level was ""transitioning to 3"" to justify going ahead with easing the lockdown, even as the level technically remained at 4. But at the government's daily coronavirus briefing last Thursday, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance made a point of saying that the number of cases ""remain high - it's not a low number"" and that in some places the transmission rate, or R-value, remained ""close to 1"". He added that the UK remained in a ""fragile state"" and should be prepared to re-impose measures if necessary. Over the weekend, a series of senior members of the Sage advisory committee announced that the easing of lockdown was premature. Then there is a more significant question about who actually decides the alert level. The prime minister had said last month that it should be the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC). When I asked at last Friday's government briefing what the centre had said, NHS medical director Prof Stephen Powis replied that the JBC was ""currently under development setting itself up"" and ""feeding information into the four chief medical officers who have to think about alert levels"". But on Tuesday, Number 10 confirmed that this would no longer be the case, and it was ""ultimately"" the UK chief medical officers' job to set the alert level using analysis from the JBC which has now ""begun operating"". And that raises another key concern. It is my understanding that there are some tensions between administrations, and some of this spilt out into the teleconference last Thursday. The Joint Biosecurity Centre has not been signed off by the devolved administrations. Some expressed disappointment that the government's Cobra civil contingencies committee had not met in the three-week period before the latest round of lockdown easing was confirmed in Westminster. The prime minister pointed to what he saw as particular problems in Scottish care homes, and also mentioned north Wales as a Covid-19 hotspot, although scientists say that this is due to a change in measurement. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the prime minister ""locked horns"" on the care home issue, I'm told. Another source says the half hour call ""was supposed to be about the alert level, but the doctors and scientists had already killed off the move"". Even if the medics had agreed, it is quite plausible that the Scottish and Welsh governments would have refused to lower the alert level. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is expected to make an effort to keep Welsh and Scottish administrations onside. Other experts point out that applying a terror alert-style system to pandemics simply might not work, as the government's own decisions have a significant direct impact on transmission rates, unlike terrorism. The terror alert system also has no transition state between its levels. And there are questions about whether this new system is meant to replace the Sage experts, and why exactly that is happening. The fear is that this vital new policy development, designed to clearly communicate risk levels across the nations of the UK to workers, businesses, parents and pensioners has more than just teething problems. The government is now downplaying the importance of the system to lifting lockdown.

Coronavirus: Ethnic minority report published,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock said the advice was ""the same as to everybody but with more emphasis"" People from ethnic minorities are at a higher risk of dying from coronavirus,a report by Public Health England,externalsays. It shows age remains the biggest risk factor, while being male is another. The impact of Covid-19 is also ""disproportionate"" for other Asian, Caribbean and black ethnicities. But it remains unclear why. A trade union for doctors said the report was a ""missed opportunity"" for ""action"" to be taken to protect health workers who are from ethnic minorities. The health secretary said the ""troubling"" report was ""timely"" because ""right across the world people are angry about racial injustice"". On Monday night, the Department of Health and Social Care denied reports the delay was down to official concerns of potential civil unrest linked to global anger over thedeath of African-American George Floyd. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons the public was ""understandably angry about injustices"" and that he felt a ""deep responsibility because this pandemic has exposed huge disparities in the health of our nation"". ""Black lives matter, as do those of the poorest areas of our country which have worse health outcomes and we need to make sure all of these considerations are taken into account, and action is taken to level-up the health outcomes of people across this country,"" he said. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, Mr Hancock said ""much more work"" needed to be done to understand ""what's driving these disparities"". ""We are absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this and find ways of closing this gap,"" he said, adding that he has asked equalities minister Kemi Badenoch to continue working on the issue alongside Public Health England (PHE). Call for public inquiry into virus BAME death risk Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Black Britons face 'twice the risk' of virus death The BBC's Rianna Croxford pressed Mr Hancock on whether there were any specific recommendations for people from ethnic minority backgrounds. He said everyone in ""the different high risk categories"" highlighted in the report should follow social distancing guidelines ""very stringently"". Prof John Newton said although the virus was having a worse impact on black and minority ethnic people, ""that is not necessarily because of their ethnicity"" and could instead be related to their job, for example. He said the report's findings needed to be ""widely discussed before deciding exactly what needs to be done"". ""The report if nothing else emphasises the complexity of what we're seeing, so really we're urging people not to jump to conclusions and institute measures which are not really justified by the data,"" he added. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said,external""lives depend on"" finding out why the virus disproportionately impacts black and minority ethnic people, and what actions the government was taking to stop it. Davida Wilkins, a 38-year-old district nurse in the West Midlands, told the BBC she felt ""even more anxious"" about doing her job following the report's publication. She said she felt ""obligated"" to continue her front-line role but added she cannot minimise the risks posed to her by the virus because ""it's the colour that I am and I can't change it"". A large proportion of NHS doctors are from an ethnic minority background The rapid review was launched when it became clear that some people were getting more sick with coronavirus than others. PHE reviewed thousands of existing health records and other virus data to look at disparities by: age and sex geography deprivation ethnicity pre-existing health problems or co-morbidities It is not possible to combine all of these factors together to judge an individual's risk because of the way the source data is recorded, but the data does reveal clear inequalities. The analysis on ethnicity and risk did not consider a person's occupation or obesity, even though both are known risk factors for getting seriously ill with coronavirus. The report also found: If you strip out age and sex, people of Bangladeshi ethnicity have twice the risk of death than people of white British ethnicity People aged 80 or older are 70 times more likely to die than those under 40 Working-age men diagnosed with Covid-19 are twice as likely to die as women The risk of dying with the virus is higher among those living in more deprived parts of the UK Certain occupations - security guards, taxi or bus drivers and construction workers and social care staff - are at higher risk Virus death rates were highest among people of Black and Asian ethnic groups when compared to white British ethnicity People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and other Black ethnicity had between a 10% and 50% higher risk of death when compared to white British people The government had been under pressure to publish the findings of this inquiry. It was due to be released by the end of May. Now it's here, it's not clear why there was a delay. The main findings reinforce what we already know - that belonging to an ethnic minority group is a major risk factor. It doesn't move us forward in answering why, though. The report acknowledges an important flaw in the analysis - it couldn't factor in important risks, such as a person's job and underlying health conditions, that increase the chance of dying with coronavirus. Where you live and how much you earn are important considerations too. Death rates for people living in the most deprived areas of England were more than double the least deprived areas. The report says coronavirus has replicated and in some cases increased existing health inequalities. It doesn't mention how to address those to save more lives. It acknowledges that more work is needed to understand and advise people about the risks. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the report for not providing recommendations for at-risk groups, adding that the virus ""thrives on inequality"" and ""inequality thrives on inaction"".

The Royal College of Nursing pointed out that health care staff from black and ethnic minority groups faced an increased risk from the virus and that ""swift and comprehensive action"" was needed to protect workers. While the council chair of the BMA, the doctors' trade union, said the report was a ""missed opportunity"".

"Concerns grow over lockdown alert level systemThe government has relaxed the lockdown, despite advisers warning against reducing the Covid-19 alert level.Business","There is no judgement more important right now than gauging the trade-off between reopening the economy and the measures limiting the spread of coronavirus. But the BBC understands that all four chief medical officers of the UK nations, including England's Professor Chris Whitty, opposed the prime minister's hopes of lowering the Covid-19 alert level last week. Less than a month ago, Boris Johnson announced that any easing of the lockdown would be conditional on a lower alert level, alongside ""five tests"" on the spread of infection being met. Indeed, when the prime minister promised on 10 May to ease the lockdown around open air markets and primary schools, as happened on Monday, he issued an important caveat: ""If the alert level won't allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right."" The next day, the government's ""Plan to Rebuild"" said that the changes to the lockdown ""must be warranted by the current alert level"". At that time the alert level was 4, indicating that ""transmission is high or rising exponentially"". At level 3, transmission is no longer considered ""high"" but a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation. Level 3 justifies ""gradual relaxing of restrictions and social distancing measures"". On Wednesday last week, the prime minister told parliament's Liaison Committee that ""we're coming down the Covid alert system from level 4 to Level 3 tomorrow, we hope, we're going to be taking a decision tomorrow"". That was in reply to a question from the Northern Ireland Select Committee chair Simon Hoare about the PM's adviser Dominic Cummings. But the next day, the government decided instead not to lower the alert level. There were two other important meetings that day. One was between the four nations' chief medical officers. The other was between the devolved governments and the PM, and easing the alert level across the UK was expected to be discussed. Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has made a point of saying that the number of cases ""remain high - it's not a low number"" ""It was clear that government wanted to change it and scientists and the chief medical officer didn't,"" said one political source involved. This account was later confirmed to me by a scientist involved in pandemic planning, and sources in three governments said that all four chief medical officers from England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland did not back the hoped-for move to alert level 3. The government itself has not confirmed or denied this account, only suggested that it was ""always clear"" that the alert level was not the primary reason for easing lockdown. But the doubts harboured by the country's most senior medical adviser, and other scientists, about lowering the alert level do matter. The government pressed on with the modest easing of the lockdown, even after the PM's promise last month that any relaxation would be conditional on a lowering of the alert level. In early May measures such as reopening primary schools and markets were promised ""no earlier"" than 1 June. NHS Medical Director Professor Stephen Powis said the Joint Biosecurity Centre was ""currently under development setting itself up"" Last week, ministers were left describing how the alert level was ""transitioning to 3"" to justify going ahead with easing the lockdown, even as the level technically remained at 4. But at the government's daily coronavirus briefing last Thursday, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance made a point of saying that the number of cases ""remain high - it's not a low number"" and that in some places the transmission rate, or R-value, remained ""close to 1"". He added that the UK remained in a ""fragile state"" and should be prepared to re-impose measures if necessary. Over the weekend, a series of senior members of the Sage advisory committee announced that the easing of lockdown was premature. Then there is a more significant question about who actually decides the alert level. The prime minister had said last month that it should be the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC). When I asked at last Friday's government briefing what the centre had said, NHS medical director Prof Stephen Powis replied that the JBC was ""currently under development setting itself up"" and ""feeding information into the four chief medical officers who have to think about alert levels"". But on Tuesday, Number 10 confirmed that this would no longer be the case, and it was ""ultimately"" the UK chief medical officers' job to set the alert level using analysis from the JBC which has now ""begun operating"". And that raises another key concern. It is my understanding that there are some tensions between administrations, and some of this spilt out into the teleconference last Thursday. The Joint Biosecurity Centre has not been signed off by the devolved administrations. Some expressed disappointment that the government's Cobra civil contingencies committee had not met in the three-week period before the latest round of lockdown easing was confirmed in Westminster. The prime minister pointed to what he saw as particular problems in Scottish care homes, and also mentioned north Wales as a Covid-19 hotspot, although scientists say that this is due to a change in measurement. The Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the prime minister ""locked horns"" on the care home issue, I'm told. Another source says the half hour call ""was supposed to be about the alert level, but the doctors and scientists had already killed off the move"". Even if the medics had agreed, it is quite plausible that the Scottish and Welsh governments would have refused to lower the alert level. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is expected to make an effort to keep Welsh and Scottish administrations onside. Other experts point out that applying a terror alert-style system to pandemics simply might not work, as the government's own decisions have a significant direct impact on transmission rates, unlike terrorism. The terror alert system also has no transition state between its levels. And there are questions about whether this new system is meant to replace the Sage experts, and why exactly that is happening. The fear is that this vital new policy development, designed to clearly communicate risk levels across the nations of the UK to workers, businesses, parents and pensioners has more than just teething problems. The government is now downplaying the importance of the system to lifting lockdown. The concern is that the system, explained in some detail by the PM in an address to the nation, now risks being dead on arrival. UK alert level raised to four - what does that mean?

Coronavirus in Scotland - Stay home & two metre rule remains,"Nicola Sturgeon says the ""stay at home"" message is still the core one, alongside the rule of two metre distancing The British Medical Association voices concern about the ""huge challenge"" of restarting NHS services Twelve further deaths are recorded overnight taking the total fatalities - following a positive test - to 2,375 There is a warning that people in Scotland are eating more out of boredom and consuming more alcohol since lockdown began ScotRail is urging people to travel only if they have to as passenger numbers rise Seven deaths linked to coronavirus have been reported at a council-operated care home in the Borders The RAC says there has been a ""truly shocking"" number of motorists caught driving at more than 100 miles per hour during early stages of lockdown BBC Scotland News That concludes BBC Scotland's live online coverage for Tuesday. Here's a reminder of today's headlines:  Live online coverage will resume early on Wednesday. It is ""insane"" to make MPs return to the House of Commons to vote, a public health expert claims. There has been a ""hybrid"" virtual system since mid-April, but MPstoday passed a motionto return to a physical parliament and develop a physical voting method that respects health and safety guidance from Public Health England. Critics say the move would still be ""discriminatory"" against those unable to attend. And Prof Linda Bauld, of Edinburgh University, says: ""I thought that was a really insane idea to require people to go back into Westminster, in terms of infection controls."" She adds that the science is evolving but ""it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility that immediately occupying the same space as somebody who's been speaking could be a risk"". Commenting on some MPs touching the despatch box as they stepped forward to vote, she adds: ""If it was a university environment, we'd be cleaning the podium before the next lecturer came to do their lecture."" Fans of Scotland's biggest football clubs continue to snap up season tickets for next term despite continued uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. National clinical director Jason Leitch on Saturday urged caution on BBC Scotland after the Scottish Professional Football League said it was pencilling in a 1 August return for the Premiership after last season was cut short. While four top-flight clubs have yet to start selling for next season, Aberdeen's sales have just passed the 6,000 mark, with the club aiming for 10,000 by July. Motherwell's have ""far surpassed"" last season, with more than 2,000 fans renewing. Hibernian's sales are up at 8,000, while city rivals Hearts have hit 5,000 sales despite relegation.

The Scottish government has responded to an accusation that it has not delivered on promises to improve pay and conditions of care home workers by saying it is ""currently working with local government, social care providers and trades unions on the details"". GMB Scotland secretary Gary Smith earlier told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime that the government had been slow to produce the changes to full sick pay, a pay rise and death in service payments. In a statement, the government replies: âWe are aware that there are social care workers who are anxious about being tested, as if they test positive and go off work, their weekly income will be reduced to the level of SSP (statutory sick pay). So we have intervened to ensure that social care workers do not face that situation but receive better levels of sick pay. ""We are establishing a sick pay fund to ensure that care workers who test positive for Covid-19 will receive sick pay above the current statutory level of Â£95.85 a week. âNo social care workers should avoid testing - and anyone who develops symptoms of Covid-19 must self-isolate and must be supported by their employer to do so, as per Health Protection Scotland guidance."" The Health Secretary rejects claims from the UK Statistics Authority that its testing data is incomplete. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's first minister today reminded people they should be wearing a face covering if they were in an enclosed space, such as in the shop or on public transport. But do they really work? Dr Mike Lonergan, an epidemiologist, says: ""There isnât much evidence but it looks like, from the
few studies have been done, maybe a third difference in the chances of you
infecting someone nearby."" Hugh Pennington, a professor of bacteriology, says there is evidence of a ""marginal benefit"" by limiting the amount of virus being excreted when someone is asymptomatic. And on whether the difference between one and two metres matters, Prof Pennington adds: ""Itâs reasonable common sense with a scientific tinge to it that the further away you are from somebody the less likely you are to breathe a virus they have pushed out of their nose or mouth.â Allow Twitter content?

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The daily round of figures show, while the picture is improving, the UK is still seeing a significant impact from coronavirus. There were 1,600 new cases confirmed, over 400 admissions to hospital and over 300 deaths. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says it is clear there is âstill some way to goâ. Worryingly, these figures are higher than countries like Spain and Italy are reporting. Both of those have been badly affected by the pandemic like the UK. They are a week or two ahead of us in terms of the trajectory on their outbreaks. But it still begs the question why our rates of infection are not lower. Allow Twitter content?

UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock is talking about today's report on coronavirus risk factors, which confirms thatpeople from black, asian and minority ethnic communities have been hit harder. He makes a reference to the current situation in the United States, saying: ""Black Lives Matter"" and pays tribute to health workers from ethnic minorities. He says he ""loves"" that the UK is ""one of the most welcoming"" countries in the world. Later the BBC's Rhianna Croxford.asks why the UKgovernment has not done more to ""support and protect"" BAME communities from the virus. Mr Hancock says he understands the anger that people feel about racial injustice and the need to tackle it, adding that he is trying to do his bit within the NHS. The old normal of globalisation, international trade driven by demand and competitive pricing - or something new? Holyrood LiveBBC Parliaments âWorkers must be put to the
fore in all our considerations,â Tory MSP Maurice Golden says, adding: âThe
task at hand is to keep business afloat and therefore protect and safeguard
jobs.â He claims the Scottish government has âsteadfastly refused to
utilise savings from the Scottish budget to support Scotland at this timeâ. Mr Golden calls for the SNP to coordinate more with the rest of
the UK, for example on manufacturing or construction, arguing Scotland benefits
enormously when Scottish and UK governments work together. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard says: âDespite the measures
introduced by both governments to help businesses keep afloat, many are already
going under.â He adds: âFor them, this is not an opportunity â it is a very real
threat.â âItâs why Scotland needs both governments to work together to
deliver the scale of investment that is needed. And it is why we must come
together and defeat the arguments for austerity, because there can be no going
back to austerity,â he argues. Scottish football ""might just make its way through"" the Covid-19 pandemic, but next season ""will be one of survival"", the man who oversaw administrations at Dundee, Hearts and Motherwell tells BBC Scotland. Football has been suspended since March and tentative plans are in place for the Premiership to resume playing in August. ""The biggest problem is the unknown,"" Bryan Jackson says. ""The only thing you can really do is cut down your expenditure, so I do fear for players and even non-players that contracts won't be renewed and that clubs will have to slim down to survive. I think the next season is really one of survival. ""When it's football, we can never tell because we have this asset not on the balance sheet known as the hardcore fans that do everything they can to try and maintain the survival of their clubs.""

quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UKwill be enforced from 8
June. George Morgan-Grenville, the CEO of tour operator Red Savannah,
warns the move would be âdevastatingâ for the travel industry. He insists the argument is not over profits but the very
survival of a sector which employs up to four million people. A survey of CEOs found 71% believe they will have to make almost
two-thirds of staff redundant, while a third fear they will cease trading, Mr
Morgan-Grenville tells Drivetime. ""The industry is on the edge of an abyss,"" he says. As an alternative to a blanket quarantine requirement, he calls
for bilateral travel agreements to be put in place with countries where there
is a low rate of infection. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The Scottish government has failed to deliver on its promises of full sick pay, a pay rise and death in service payments for care home workers, according to the GMB union. Union secretary Gary Smith tells BBC Radio Scotland that care home workers remain ""terrified"" to call off sick or be tested for Covid-19 because of the loss in earnings and being ""unable to feed their families"". Asked if the issues were close to being resolved, he replies: ""No. It has been like wading through treacle quite honestly. ""The Scottish government has been great at making announcements. But they've been very poor at actually delivering."" Mr Smith claims that, while a 3.3% increase in pay was announced at Easter, money to pay for it had not been given to private companies by the government. He adds that one of the big care companies, HC-One, had agreed to increase sick pay, but he suggests that was only because of pressure from his union, which has began grievance procedures against other providers. The Scottish government has been asked for a response. The UK briefing is due to start in ten minutes.You can follow all the updates here.

Some of Europe's best-known art museums are reopening after closing in March for the Covid-19 pandemic - but it will be far from business as usual. Most of these museums and galleries will be limiting visitor numbers, intensifying cleaning procedures and insisting all tickets be bought online in advance. One example: normally at this time of year Amsterdam's huge and world-famous Rijksmuseum would have up to 12,000 visitors daily. From this week, that number will be strictly limited to 2,000 a day. Caravaggio's Narcissus is back on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam The UK's biggest cruise operator says it will not resume sailing until at least mid-October. P&O Cruises, which operates cruises all over the world from Southampton, had previously cancelled trips up to the end of July. The firm said it was working with ""governments and industry bodies at the highest level"" to ensure approval for enhanced safety and hygiene measures. P&O Cruises president Paul Ludlow said the company was focused on developing a way of keeping everyone on board ""safe and well, and still give our guests an amazing holiday"", rather than on what date it could resume sailing. Thomas MackintoshBBC London News As the UK stared down the barrel of a coronavirus epidemic in early March, the biggest fear was that  hospitals would be incapacitated by a tsunami of patients. The NHS largely pulled through, but there were still times when hospitals became overwhelmed. On 19 March, night-shift staff at Northwick Park Hospital in north-west London awoke to discover their workplace was so deluged with Covid patients that a critical incident had been declared. Thousands of visitors flocked to Durdle Door at the weekend, leaving litter scattered on the beach England's Jurassic Coast has been treated with ""shocking"" disrespect by visitors since lockdown restrictions were eased, conservation groups have said. The Unesco World Heritage site has been deluged with crowds in recent days. The Jurassic Coast Trust said many were ""determined to arrive at any cost"" and volunteers described ""horrendous"" amounts of litter being abandoned. Current rules state that households can drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. At least 500 coronavirus cases were missing from public health records because a Toronto area hospital failed to report them, officials have revealed. Most of the tests were done at a drive-through testing site operated by the William Osler Health System, but processed by a lab at Mount Sinai Hospital. There seems to have been some confusion about who was responsible for reporting the cases. A spokesperson for Ontario's health ministertold CBC,externalthey were had just been made aware of the ""reporting gap"" and were working with William Osler to ""correct the issue"". The cases go back to April, so officials will focus their contact tracing on the ones that tested positive in the past 14 days. ""Many of the cases from more than 14 days ago would now be considered resolved,""a statement released by Ontario Health read.,external Speaking at the briefing earlier, English Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people from ethnic minorities - and anyone in a higher risk group - should ""stringently"" follow social distancing guidelines to protect themselves from coronavirus.

effect on 8 June, with the home secretary expected to lay out regulations and update parliament tomorrow. Most passengers will have to self-isolate for 14 days, and in
England could be fined up to Â£1,000 if they fail to do so. More than 200 travel companies have written to the government
asking for the plan to be scrapped and replaced with ââairbridgesââ, whereby
countries with low coronavirus levels could agree to exempt one another's residents
from quarantine. Some MPs have also voiced concerns about the measures, which
the government says are being brought in to prevent a second wave of cases. Read
more about the new rules here  Creating ""air bridges"" between countries as a way of allowing flights to restart has been backed by the head of the UN aviation agency. Air bridges would be an arrangement allowing visitors to travel between low-risk countries without having to go into periods of quarantine. ""This concept can help our global sector to move as much as possible and, according to the medical advice, to carry the passenger in a safe and secure way,"" Dr Fang Liu, secretary-general of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), told BBC World News. She said restarting aviation was extremely important for the global economy and for social stability. The ICAO recommends wide-ranging coronavirus safety measures, including restricted access to toilets on flights. The guidelines also include limiting or suspending food and drink services on short-haul flights. Premier League leaders Liverpool held an 11v11 training match at their Anfield stadium this week English Premier League football clubs have beengiven permission to play friendly matches- under strict restrictions - before the planned
restart on 17 June. Measures
include teams not being allowed to travel more than 90 minutes and players having
to drive themselves to games. Meanwhile, Newcastle United doctor Paul Catterson has warned that clubs are preparing for ""a lot more injuries"" as players prepare to return to action after the three-month break. In
other sporting news: Mary HarperAfrica editor, BBC World Service Health officials in Mozambique say there is
growing discrimination against people suspected of being infected with
coronavirus. In some cases the stigma has become so
extreme that people are being threatened with violence. In the central city of
Beira, those infected with the virus have been threatened with lynching. Health
officials say this has led to a fall in the number of people going to clinics
to report flu-like symptoms and other illnesses. Health workers have been sent
into communities to try to convince people to seek medical help when needed. The hostility towards those suspected of having the virus has led the health
ministry to restrict the amount of information it releases about the disease,
including not disclosing locations where cases have been confirmed. Mozambique has reported more than 250 infections. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News For those living in the worldâs largest refugee camp in Bangladesh, it was news they were expecting, but dreading: a 71-year-old man became the first Rohingya refugee to die of Covid-19. He was one of at least 29 in the camps who had tested positive for the virus. For months the settlements have been in lockdown, with all but essential aid workers allowed to visit to limit potential spread. But even with precautions, social distancing in the densely populated areas, home to nearly 1 million refugees who fled genocide in neighbouring Myanmar, has been tough. So too, the ability to share public health information about Coronavirus with a Bangladeshi government ban on internet in the camps still in place, despite calls from the UN for it to be lifted. And even the most basic of resources â like soap and water to wash hands regularly â are in short supply. To cope with the outbreak, hundreds of isolation beds have been set up but healthcare facilities are basic. There are no ventilators in the camps for the most serious of patients. Theyâd have to be taken to the nearby town of Coxâs Bazar but even there resources are limited. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Water companies are asking people in the UK toavoid using hosepipes and not to fill paddling poolsduring lockdown. The country has been basking inrecord-breaking dry weatherin recent weeks - and suppliers are urging people to use water carefully to help prevent a shortage. Water UK, which represents water companies, said it had noticed ""truly incredible surges of demand"" - up 25% in some areas - as people spend more time at home. Reservoirs are still in a healthy state, they said, but some firms canât get enough water to the taps and pressure is dropping. âIt's things like paddling pools and sprinklers that are the biggest challenge,"" Water UK chief executive Christine McGourty told BBC News. ""So weâre just asking people to save a little bit of water and thatâll make a huge difference.â Long-term weather forecasts suggest more dry summer months to come. But no hosepipe bans are currently in place. This video can not be played Coronavirus social distancing advice: What two metres looks like Scientists agree that the closer you are to someone who is infected with coronavirus, the greater the risk of catching it. But how close is too close? In the UK, some have called for the current 2m distance to be reduced in an effort to allow more people into restaurants and shops when they reopen. The World Health Organization's guidance - which is often cited by critics of the 2m rule - suggests people should stay only 1m apart. The rules vary by country: Which is the right distance? Our science editor David Shukman has beenfollowing the latest on the debate. Reality Check UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked whether he still thought - as he did in mid-May - that Britons would not be taking overseas holidays this year. He said that he was âmore optimistic than previouslyâ. As it stands, the UK government is still advising against non-essential international travel and from 8 June anybody arriving in the UK will have to isolate themselves for 14 days, including UK nationals. So it may well be that Britons will be holidaying in Britain this summer. If so, here are a few figures to bear in mind. Last August,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, UK residents made about 9.4 million visits overseas. In the same month, overseas residents made about 4.1 million visits to the UK. So popular UK destinations may get a bit crowded, even if foreign holidaymakers are not allowed in. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In response to criticism from the UK
Statistics Authority, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said improvement to the reporting of testing data is âconstantlyâ
being looked at. The government is no longer
reporting the number of people tested â there were problems with some apparent
double-counting and the fact that the figures never included the tests returned
from kits sent out by post. Mr Hancock said because the
testing system was expanded rapidly the counting of tests struggled to keep
pace. There is some truth to this. In the early days of the testing
regime, postal testing was not being used. But these questions will
not go away until the data is published and it is clear just how many people
are being tested rather than simply tests being provided. A nine-year-old Kenyan boy who designed a wooden hand-washing machine to help tackle the spread of coronavirus has told the BBC he is ""very happy"" after receiving a presidential award. ""I now have two machines and I want to make more,"" Stephen Wamukota said. They allow users to tip a bucket of water using a foot pedal to avoid touching surfaces and reduce infections. Stephen came up with the idea after learning on TV about ways to prevent catching the virus. Read more here. War-torn Yemen was already experiencing an acute humanitarian crisis The UNâs secretary-general has warned that there is a
ârace against timeâ to combat the coronavirus in Yemen, where a civil war
has already caused the worldâs largest humanitarian crisis. Reports indicated that mortality rates from Covid-19 in the second city of Aden were among the highest in the world,AntÃ³nio Guterres told a virtual pledging conference,external. âThat is just one sign of what lies ahead, if we do not
act now,â he added. Just half of Yemenâs health facilities are operational. There
are shortages of testing devices, oxygen, ambulances and protective
equipment. Many healthcare workers are among those who have been infected.
And 50% of the population do not have access to clean water to wash their
hands. Half of Yemenis do not have access to clean water Guterres said the UN and its partners urgently need $2.4bn (Â£1.9bn) in funding to cover their operations for the rest of the year. Otherwise, 30 out of 41 major UN programmes will have to close in the next few weeks in a country where 24 million people depend on aid. The UK has pledged Â£160m, which Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said would âmean the difference between life and death for thousands of Yemenisâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

"RSC postpones performances due to virusThe theatre company makes the ""difficult decision"" due to continuing social distancing rules.","The company says the decision was made with ""huge sadness"" The Royal Shakespeare Company has postponed or cancelled planned performances and events due to the coronavirus crisis. Summer season plays including The Winter's Tale were called off as well as shows planned for autumn and winter. The RSC said the decision had been made with ""huge sadness"" and the box office would be contacting ticket holders. But it is looking at a possible earlier reopening of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre (RST) in Stratford-upon-Avon. ""The ability to stage the productions in the autumn is dependent on government advice on social distancing and whether it is financially viable for the Company to open its theatres and perform to audiences,"" it said. If possible it would re-schedule The Winter's Tale and The Comedy of Errors at the RST, where they were due to open in the spring. Meanwhile it is moving its planned winter season to next year.

There has been a ""hybrid"" virtual system since mid-April, but MPstoday passed a motionto return to a physical parliament and develop a physical voting method that respects health and safety guidance from Public Health England.

The Scottish government has responded to an accusation that it has not delivered on promises to improve pay and conditions of care home workers by saying it is ""currently working with local government, social care providers and trades unions on the details"". GMB Scotland secretary Gary Smith earlier told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime that the government had been slow to produce the changes to full sick pay, a pay rise and death in service payments. In a statement, the government replies: âWe are aware that there are social care workers who are anxious about being tested, as if they test positive and go off work, their weekly income will be reduced to the level of SSP (statutory sick pay). So we have intervened to ensure that social care workers do not face that situation but receive better levels of sick pay. ""We are establishing a sick pay fund to ensure that care workers who test positive for Covid-19 will receive sick pay above the current statutory level of Â£95.85 a week. âNo social care workers should avoid testing - and anyone who develops symptoms of Covid-19 must self-isolate and must be supported by their employer to do so, as per Health Protection Scotland guidance."" The Health Secretary rejects claims from the UK Statistics Authority that its testing data is incomplete. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's first minister today reminded people they should be wearing a face covering if they were in an enclosed space, such as in the shop or on public transport. But do they really work? Dr Mike Lonergan, an epidemiologist, says: ""There isnât much evidence but it looks like, from the
few studies have been done, maybe a third difference in the chances of you
infecting someone nearby."" Hugh Pennington, a professor of bacteriology, says there is evidence of a ""marginal benefit"" by limiting the amount of virus being excreted when someone is asymptomatic. And on whether the difference between one and two metres matters, Prof Pennington adds: ""Itâs reasonable common sense with a scientific tinge to it that the further away you are from somebody the less likely you are to breathe a virus they have pushed out of their nose or mouth.â Allow Twitter content?

utilise savings from the Scottish budget to support Scotland at this timeâ. Mr Golden calls for the SNP to coordinate more with the rest of
the UK, for example on manufacturing or construction, arguing Scotland benefits
enormously when Scottish and UK governments work together. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard says: âDespite the measures
introduced by both governments to help businesses keep afloat, many are already
going under.â He adds: âFor them, this is not an opportunity â it is a very real
threat.â âItâs why Scotland needs both governments to work together to
deliver the scale of investment that is needed. And it is why we must come
together and defeat the arguments for austerity, because there can be no going
back to austerity,â he argues. Scottish football ""might just make its way through"" the Covid-19 pandemic, but next season ""will be one of survival"", the man who oversaw administrations at Dundee, Hearts and Motherwell tells BBC Scotland. Football has been suspended since March and tentative plans are in place for the Premiership to resume playing in August. ""The biggest problem is the unknown,"" Bryan Jackson says. ""The only thing you can really do is cut down your expenditure, so I do fear for players and even non-players that contracts won't be renewed and that clubs will have to slim down to survive. I think the next season is really one of survival. ""When it's football, we can never tell because we have this asset not on the balance sheet known as the hardcore fans that do everything they can to try and maintain the survival of their clubs.""

During today's Scottish government coronavirus daily briefing Phil McDonald from
Global highlighted Black Lives Matter protests expected across Scotland and asked how these would fit current pandemic guidelines. The first minister
said she was a âfervent supporterâ of peaceful protests and the right for people
to have their voice heard. But she said âunfortunately and regrettablyâ large gatherings like protests pose a risk to
health at the moment. Ms Sturgeon said: ""What I would say to those who want
to protest, and I say this as an ally and supporter, is that we need to find ways
of allowing people to make their voices heard - and to make the points that
many of us want to be made and be heard right now - but to do so in a way that
is safe and is not putting people and communities at risk.""  Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Atwo-week
quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UKwill be enforced from 8
June. George Morgan-Grenville, the CEO of tour operator Red Savannah,
warns the move would be âdevastatingâ for the travel industry. He insists the argument is not over profits but the very
survival of a sector which employs up to four million people. A survey of CEOs found 71% believe they will have to make almost
two-thirds of staff redundant, while a third fear they will cease trading, Mr
Morgan-Grenville tells Drivetime. ""The industry is on the edge of an abyss,"" he says. As an alternative to a blanket quarantine requirement, he calls
for bilateral travel agreements to be put in place with countries where there
is a low rate of infection. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Holyrood LiveBBC Parliaments Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop
warns the scale of the challenge is significant, highlighting estimates
GDP could fall 33% for the duration of physical distancing and 10% of the
workforce may require benefits. Ms Hyslop says the circumstances are unprecedented and therefore it
requires an unprecedented response. She confirms Â£3m of the self-employed hardship fund will be
repurposed to support B&B owners who are ineligible for other support
because they do not have a business bank account. The cabinet secretary acknowledges the burden of the economic impacts will not fall
equally, adding: âOur recovery must ensure that we are closing the gender pay
gap and the disability employment gap.â She also insists any recovery must be a ""green recovery"". Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The Scottish government has failed to deliver on its promises of full sick pay, a pay rise and death in service payments for care home workers, according to the GMB union. Union secretary Gary Smith tells BBC Radio Scotland that care home workers remain ""terrified"" to call off sick or be tested for Covid-19 because of the loss in earnings and being ""unable to feed their families"". Asked if the issues were close to being resolved, he replies: ""No. It has been like wading through treacle quite honestly. ""The Scottish government has been great at making announcements. But they've been very poor at actually delivering."" Mr Smith claims that, while a 3.3% increase in pay was announced at Easter, money to pay for it had not been given to private companies by the government. He adds that one of the big care companies, HC-One, had agreed to increase sick pay, but he suggests that was only because of pressure from his union, which has began grievance procedures against other providers. The Scottish government has been asked for a response. The UK briefing is due to start in ten minutes.You can follow all the updates here.

All three major record labels - Universal, Sony and Warner Music, whose combined annual revenues exceed $16bn (Â£12.75bn) - signed up to the initiative, as did many independent labels, the Glastonbury Festival and event organisers Live Nation. Interscope Records also vowed to stop releasing new music for a week, while many others donated money to the George Floyd Memorial Fund.

RSC calls off all 2020 performances due to virus,"The company says the decision was made with ""huge sadness"" The Royal Shakespeare Company has postponed or cancelled planned performances and events due to the coronavirus crisis. Summer season plays including The Winter's Tale were called off as well as shows planned for autumn and winter. The RSC said the decision had been made with ""huge sadness"" and the box office would be contacting ticket holders. But it is looking at a possible earlier reopening of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre (RST) in Stratford-upon-Avon. ""The ability to stage the productions in the autumn is dependent on government advice on social distancing and whether it is financially viable for the Company to open its theatres and perform to audiences,"" it said. If possible it would re-schedule The Winter's Tale and The Comedy of Errors at the RST, where they were due to open in the spring. Meanwhile it is moving its planned winter season to next year.

Sam FrancisBBC News Londoners were three time more likely to die from coronavirus than those in the south-west of England, a study has found. Up to 8 May there were 7,369 deaths linked to coronavirus in London,according to Public Health England.,external When taking into account the usual mortality rate and age of the two areas this was 3.7 times more than the least affected region - the south-west, which saw 2,187 deaths over the same period. The study found 9,035 excess deaths in London over the same period.

Claire Gilbody-DickersonBBC News People visiting beaches and open spaces in Decon are being urged to take their rubbish home after equivalent of about 500 wheelie bins of litter were collected after the weekend. Teignbridge Council said its staff were stretched to capacity as they worked ""flat out"" to clear stacks of waste, which included barbecue trays, beer cans, glass bottles and human faeces. Executive member for Refuse and Recycling, Councillor Alistair Dewhirst, said staff described it as the ""worst they'd ever seen it"".

They are asking people to avoid hoses and sprinklers, and not to fill paddling pools. However, so far a full hosepipe ban has not been imposed. Companies are responding to a double water whammy from the record dry spring and a surge in demand as people spend more time at home duringthe lockdown. One of the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic has been the massive reduction in air travel in recent months, with daily flights down about 80% since the start of the year. Some airlines have grounded their entire fleets, while others have been focusing on cargo flights, in an effort to help keep supply chains functioning and make what money they can.

Neil HeathBBC News Online Mountain rescue volunteers have seen a ""significant rise"" in the number of call-outs in the Peak District and further afield following changes in lockdown rules in May. The Peak District Mountain Rescue Organisation (PDMRO) said its teams were called 37 times from 18 May to 31 May, while there were only eight call-outs in the same period last year. The PDMRO has put the rise down toannouncements made on 10 May, when people were told they were allowed to drive to parks and beaches in England. Volunteers, in partnership with emergency services, have taken part in five missing vulnerable person searches, attended to walkers with lower leg injuries and ""benighted"" hikers. The PDMRO has appealed for help from the public and asked those using the national park to limit risks, wear the right attire and to take enough provisions. It has also warned about using barbecues and discarding cigarette ends, to avoid call-outs having to be made. The reduction in boat traffic, anchors and people using the waters off the Dorset coast has seemingly helped certain wildlife thrive once again. The largest number of protected spiny seahorses since 2008 has been seen at Studland Bay, the Seahorse Trust has revealed. During a single dive, 16 seahorses - including pregnant males and two babies - were discovered. Previously, no seahorses had been seen in dives since 2018, when only a dead one was found. ""We have seen so many seahorses because the food chain has recovered, giving seahorses plenty of food to eat, and crucially, somewhere to hide,"" trust founder Neil Garrick-Maidment said. He added the seagrass had also ""started to repair itself"". The Seahorse Trust and Dorset Wildlife Trust previously saidboat moorings were damaging seagrass bed habitats. Â© 2025 BBC.

Hotels and guesthouses to reopen on 20 JulyStormont Executive confirms hotels will reopen on the same date as hotels in the Republic of Ireland.Northern IrelandComments,"Hotels and tourist accommodation in Northern Ireland will be allowed to reopen on 20 July. The Northern Ireland Executive has confirmed the move as part of the relaxation of coronavirus lockdown restrictions. It has been welcomed by the Northern Ireland Hotel Federation (NIHF) as a ""step forward for the industry"". In May, the government in the Republic of Ireland confirmed its hotels will also reopen on 20 July. Last week, the executive said hotels could start taking bookings again but did not say when they could reopen. This was met with anger by many in the hospitality trade. Announcing the decision on Monday afternoon, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she believed it was the right time to provide the tourist accommodation sector with clarity about opening dates following ""unprecedented challenges for our tourism industry"". Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she wants to reopen the industry in a ""safe and managed way"" ""I want to build upon the positive progress in managing the spread of the virus and begin to re-open our tourism industry in a safe and managed way,"" she said. Tourist accommodation re-opening: Hotels Holiday parks Caravan sites and self-catering properties Guesthouses and accommodation Bed and breakfast accommodation Hostels Holiday parks, self-catering properties and caravan parks may open earlier than 20 July, said the minister, depending on scientific advice. It is not yet clear whether bars, restaurants and other facilities in hotels will be allowed to open to residents from 20 July. In the Republic of Ireland, hotel bars will remain closed when hotels reopen on 20 July. The hotels will reopen with limited occupancy and social distancing measures will continue By John Campbell, BBC News NI business and economics editor The hoteliers have their date. Last week's announcement that they could take take bookings, but without even an indicative reopening date, was met with a mixture of bemusement and anger. Particularly when rival operators in the Republic were already working towards a reopening date. The question now is what sort of experience hotels will be able to offer in seven weeks time. The economy minister has talked about working with the industry to 'explore what facilities and amenities can safely be made available.' Will restaurants be able to open? What about bars or spas? And if food and drink service is to be allowed then restaurateurs will be clamouring for an opening date too. The minister stressed, however, that progress on re-opening will depend on controlling the rate of transmission of the virus. NIHF chief executive Janice Gault said the federation has been working closely with industry colleagues to ensure that businesses can open in a safe and secure manner. She said more work was needed around the details of reopening and said safety was paramount. ""We will continue to work in a collaborative manner so that the visitor economy, including the hotel sector, can return to business and help restore the Northern Ireland economy,"" she said. ""Having an agreed date will help us to plan, promote and give businesses the opportunity to assess their viability."" Bill Wolsey, managing director of the Beannchor group, which owns the Merchant Hotel in Belfast, said the announcement ""provides the first glimmer of hope for the recovery of Northern Ireland's hospitality industry"". NIHF chief executive Janice Gault said the federation has been working closely with industry colleagues However, he said there ""is a need for further clarification around hotel facilities"". Howard Hastings, managing director of the Hastings Hotel Group, said there were no ""fully bottomed-out guidelines yet, but we can see the way it is working for other sectors, so there are certain preparations we can make now"". ""Certainly the suppliers to the industry are well geared up to provide us with the sort of additional equipment or PPE (personal protective equipment) that we might need in order to facilitate guests,"" he added. Neil Moore, from the union Unite, said the furlough period should be used to ""upskill"" hospitality workers by providing good quality training, accessing apprenticeship levy funding and measures to ensure safety when facilities reopen. He said: ""These measures must include testing and contact tracing, supply of appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE), meaningful engagement with employees, extensive risk assessments and their effective enforcement, and continuation of job supports - tied to job retention not redundancy.""

Hotels and guesthouses to reopen on 20 July,"Hotels and tourist accommodation in Northern Ireland will be allowed to reopen on 20 July. The Northern Ireland Executive has confirmed the move as part of the relaxation of coronavirus lockdown restrictions. It has been welcomed by the Northern Ireland Hotel Federation (NIHF) as a ""step forward for the industry"". In May, the government in the Republic of Ireland confirmed its hotels will also reopen on 20 July. Last week, the executive said hotels could start taking bookings again but did not say when they could reopen. This was met with anger by many in the hospitality trade. Announcing the decision on Monday afternoon, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she believed it was the right time to provide the tourist accommodation sector with clarity about opening dates following ""unprecedented challenges for our tourism industry"". Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she wants to reopen the industry in a ""safe and managed way"" ""I want to build upon the positive progress in managing the spread of the virus and begin to re-open our tourism industry in a safe and managed way,"" she said. Tourist accommodation re-opening: Hotels Holiday parks Caravan sites and self-catering properties Guesthouses and accommodation Bed and breakfast accommodation Hostels Holiday parks, self-catering properties and caravan parks may open earlier than 20 July, said the minister, depending on scientific advice. It is not yet clear whether bars, restaurants and other facilities in hotels will be allowed to open to residents from 20 July. In the Republic of Ireland, hotel bars will remain closed when hotels reopen on 20 July. The hotels will reopen with limited occupancy and social distancing measures will continue By John Campbell, BBC News NI business and economics editor The hoteliers have their date. Last week's announcement that they could take take bookings, but without even an indicative reopening date, was met with a mixture of bemusement and anger. Particularly when rival operators in the Republic were already working towards a reopening date. The question now is what sort of experience hotels will be able to offer in seven weeks time. The economy minister has talked about working with the industry to 'explore what facilities and amenities can safely be made available.' Will restaurants be able to open? What about bars or spas? And if food and drink service is to be allowed then restaurateurs will be clamouring for an opening date too. The minister stressed, however, that progress on re-opening will depend on controlling the rate of transmission of the virus. NIHF chief executive Janice Gault said the federation has been working closely with industry colleagues to ensure that businesses can open in a safe and secure manner. She said more work was needed around the details of reopening and said safety was paramount. ""We will continue to work in a collaborative manner so that the visitor economy, including the hotel sector, can return to business and help restore the Northern Ireland economy,"" she said. ""Having an agreed date will help us to plan, promote and give businesses the opportunity to assess their viability."" Bill Wolsey, managing director of the Beannchor group, which owns the Merchant Hotel in Belfast, said the announcement ""provides the first glimmer of hope for the recovery of Northern Ireland's hospitality industry"". NIHF chief executive Janice Gault said the federation has been working closely with industry colleagues However, he said there ""is a need for further clarification around hotel facilities"". Howard Hastings, managing director of the Hastings Hotel Group, said there were no ""fully bottomed-out guidelines yet, but we can see the way it is working for other sectors, so there are certain preparations we can make now"". ""Certainly the suppliers to the industry are well geared up to provide us with the sort of additional equipment or PPE (personal protective equipment) that we might need in order to facilitate guests,"" he added. Neil Moore, from the union Unite, said the furlough period should be used to ""upskill"" hospitality workers by providing good quality training, accessing apprenticeship levy funding and measures to ensure safety when facilities reopen. He said: ""These measures must include testing and contact tracing, supply of appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE), meaningful engagement with employees, extensive risk assessments and their effective enforcement, and continuation of job supports - tied to job retention not redundancy."" Mr Moore later said he had written to all the Northern Ireland Executive ministers to ""protest today's announcement by the economy minister to reopen hotels and other accommodation without any effective means of enforcement on basic infection controls"". ""Far from being welcomed by hospitality workers, today's announcement has caused widespread fear and concern among those who face the prospect of returning to work in unsafe working conditions,"" he said.

Lockdown break-ups and job changes boost rentals,"Since estate agents were allowed to reopen, demand for rental homes has increased faster than in the sales market Lockdown break-ups, job losses and urgent relocations are thought to have led to a surge in the rental sector. Demand for lettings in Great Britain is up by 22% compared to last year, according to property giant Rightmove. Experts say the lifting of lockdown restrictions has released ""two months of pent-up tension"" in the market. The supply of new rents is not keeping up with demand, however, prompting fears the surge will push up costs and leave some struggling to find homes. According to data provided by Rightmove, demand for all kinds of property plunged during the height of the lockdown. The restrictions prevented house viewings, surveys and searches from taking place, while removal companies were also temporarily closed. People were urged to stay in their current homes during lockdown unless absolutely necessary. Evictions were put on hold until 25 June. Since estate agents were allowed to reopen on 13 May though, demand for rental homes has increased at a quicker rate than the sales market, according to Rightmove. Many people have been left with an ""immediate housing need"" as a result of the pandemic, housing expert Miles Shipside said. Chloe Arnold and her housemate DJ Branch are finding it difficult to find a new place in Bristol The sector is also coping with a backlog of people who have had to cancel planned moves during lockdown. Chloe Arnold and her housemate DJ Branch are two of hundreds searching for properties in Bristol, which has emerged as one of the most-searched-for places on Rightmove aftermoving home was allowed again. ""It's been really difficult if I'm honest,"" said Chloe, 25, who works in recruitment. ""A lot of the time landlords want couples."" The South West has seen the biggest surge in demand for new rental properties with a 34% increase compared to last year, according to Rightmove. It classed demand as the number of times website visitors clicked through to the details of a property listed online. ""One of the reasons it has been tough is because a lot of the houses aren't doing viewings,"" Chloe said. ""Obviously because of the social distancing, a lot of the places we are looking at, you have to decide whether you want it based on a virtual tour. ""It's so easy to miss things that way. In Bristol a lot of places have a problem with damp you aren't going to see on a video tour."" Former banker Renecia Thompson, 35, and her four-year-old daughter moved from Anguilla in the Caribbean to the West Midlands before Christmas. As she had only just received her National Insurance number by the time lockdown was imposed, she had been unable to find work. She was turned down by eight landlords because she was claiming Universal Credit and had to stay with a friend during lockdown. ""I was in competition with others who were in a better financial position than me,"" she said. ""Some landlords wouldn't even talk to me."" Renecia has recently been accepted for a house in Wolverhampton after putting out a plea for a property on the Gumtree website. Rightmove property expert Miles Shipside says the competition for lettings will likely push up rent Wednesday 27 May saw more than six million people visit the Rightmove website, its busiest day ever. ""They may need to move for a job,"" said Rightmove's Mr Shipside. ""In this environment we are in now, there is a need for people with specialist jobs to be in a certain place - just think about the Nightingale hospitals that have sprung up. ""Where some people have enjoyed lockdown, others' relationships haven't survived it and this has had knock-on consequences. ""There could be people who need to move because of job losses too. ""And working from home has left a lot of people looking for a change in surroundings. ""Effectively we have two months of pent-up demand that needs to be satisfied."" However, supply is struggling to match demand. The number of new rental listings on Rightmove is 4% below 2019 levels. It dropped to a level of 64% below during the week of 6 April. Landlords are ""exiting the market"" Mr Shipside says, due to Covid-19 and the uncertainty over tenants being able to afford rent. Thinktank theResolution Foundationfound one in eight renters were struggling with housing costs as a result of coronavirus. ""They [landlords] are going to pick those with the best references and who can move in immediately. Those whose credit record is not the best tend to lose out,"" Mr Shipside said. More people bidding for fewer properties was almost certain to push up the prices of rented accommodation, he said. Estate agent Stephen Groves said appointments were taking longer as a result of the virus Estate agents, having closed for two months, are now reporting an increased workload to manage the backlog of people needing new homes. ""The number of new listings for sales has gone through the roof, but when it comes to rentals there is nowhere near enough stock,"" said Stephen Groves, who runs the Home estate agents in Greater Manchester. ""Days of working from nine to 5.30 have long gone. I was doing emails at 11 last night - everything just takes a lot longer,"" he said. While his company is offering virtual appointments to prospective tenants, the ability to offer house viewings has been restricted. Staff members have to wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during them and homes must be cleaned before and after the viewing. ""Where we could do between 20 and 30 viewing of a property in a day, we are now doing four where the home is still tenanted,"" he said. ""Understandably people don't want people coming to visit their homes because of the virus."" Paul and Poppy Carr of High Wycombe secured a new flat on the basis of a virtual viewing However, some who opted to sign an agreement on the strength of a virtual viewing have seen the benefit. Husband and wife Paul and Poppy Carr of High Wycombe needed to move out of their two-bedroomed apartment quickly but they could not go for any viewings in person during lockdown. They opted for a video tour of a new flat and negotiated a Â£200 reduction in their rent - partly because they noticed a de-humidifier in one room. ""I was really surprised by the quality of the virtual viewing,"" said Poppy, aged 25, a researcher who works in London. ""We could see that it had been recently renovated and they had already done a deep clean. ""I think we were lucky really because we got in there before demand boomed.""

"Floyd death homicide, official post-mortem saysGeorge Floyd, whose death sparked mass protests, suffered a cardiac arrest while being restrained.","George Floyd's death in Minneapolis sparked civil unrest across the country The death of George Floyd, which triggered widespread protests across the US, has been declared a homicide in an official post-mortem examination. The 46-year-old suffered a cardiac arrest while being restrained by Minneapolis police, the report found. It listed Mr Floyd's cause of death as ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression"". Meanwhile, President Donald Trump vowed to use the military to end the unrest. A video showing a white police officer continuing to kneel on Mr Floyd's neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans. Live updates from around the US 'Unacceptable' attacks on reporters at Floyd protests US protests: Separating fact from fiction online It has led to six consecutive days of protests around the United States and a level of civil unrest not seen in decades. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter and will appear in court next week. Three other police officers have been fired. This video can not be played Floyd's brother: 'That's not bringing him back' The official post-mortem examination of Mr Floyd by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office also recorded evidence of heart disease and recent drug use. It said he suffered the cardiac arrest ""while being restrained by a law enforcement officer"" on 25 May. The findings were released shortly after those of a private examination that was carried out by medical examiners hired by the Floyd family. This report said Mr Floyd died from asphyxia (lack of oxygen) due to a compression on his neck and also on his back. It also found the death was a homicide,a statement from the family's legal team said.,external ""The cause of death in my opinion is asphyxia, due to compression to the neck - which can interfere with oxygen going to the brain - and compression to the back, which interferes with breathing,"" Dr Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said at a news conference on Monday. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Floyd family, said: ""Beyond doubt he would be alive today if not for the pressure applied to his neck by officer Derek Chauvin and the strain on his body by two other officers."" He added: ""The ambulance was his hearse."" Also on Monday, during a brief televised address from the White House's Rose Garden,President Trump threatened to send in the military to end the protestsif cities and states failed to control them. Speaking as the sounds of a nearby protest could be heard in the background, Mr Trump said ""we are ending the riots and lawlessness"" which he blamed on ""professional anarchists"" and anti-fascist group ""Antifa"". President Trump has told state governors they must ""dominate"" protests ""I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets,"" Mr Trump said. The National Guard is the reserve military force that can be called on to intervene in domestic emergencies. About 16,000 of its troops have been deployed to deal with the unrest so far. Mr Trump added: ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary... then I'll deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" ""I want the organisers of this terror to be on notice that you'll face severe criminal penalties,"" he said. Earlier, President Trump told state governors they had been ""weak"" and had to get ""much tougher"" and utilise troops from the National Guard. ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again,"" Mr Trump said in a video conference call, according to US media. More than 75 cities have seen protests over what happened to George Floyd. Streets that only days ago were deserted because of the coronavirus pandemic have filled with demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. The case follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. This video can not be played The peaceful protests honouring George Floyd Protests kicked off for another evening on Monday and more than 40 cities have imposed or extended their curfews. Thousands of people marched in New York, and video footage on social media showed looting at major shops in Manhattan. Smaller protests took place in other cities including Los Angeles and Oakland. How are African-Americans treated by the law? Elsewhere, the chief of Louisville Police in Kentucky was fired after law enforcement shot into a crowd and killed the owner of a nearby business. Mayor Greg Fischer said officers and troops involved in the shooting failed to activate body cameras. ""This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,"" he said. On Sunday, mostly peaceful demonstrations once again gave way to violence in many cities, with clashes erupting between police and protesters. Many videos shared on social media from across the US appeared to show riot police responding disproportionately to demonstrators.Dozens of attacks targeting journalists have been reported.

""This concept can help our global sector to move as much as possible and, according to the medical advice, to carry the passenger in a safe and secure way,"" Dr Fang Liu, secretary-general of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), told BBC World News. She said restarting aviation was extremely important for the global economy and for social stability. The ICAO recommends wide-ranging coronavirus safety measures, including restricted access to toilets on flights.

growing discrimination against people suspected of being infected with
coronavirus. In some cases the stigma has become so
extreme that people are being threatened with violence. In the central city of
Beira, those infected with the virus have been threatened with lynching. Health
officials say this has led to a fall in the number of people going to clinics
to report flu-like symptoms and other illnesses. Health workers have been sent
into communities to try to convince people to seek medical help when needed. The hostility towards those suspected of having the virus has led the health
ministry to restrict the amount of information it releases about the disease,
including not disclosing locations where cases have been confirmed. Mozambique has reported more than 250 infections. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News For those living in the worldâs largest refugee camp in Bangladesh, it was news they were expecting, but dreading: a 71-year-old man became the first Rohingya refugee to die of Covid-19. He was one of at least 29 in the camps who had tested positive for the virus. For months the settlements have been in lockdown, with all but essential aid workers allowed to visit to limit potential spread. But even with precautions, social distancing in the densely populated areas, home to nearly 1 million refugees who fled genocide in neighbouring Myanmar, has been tough. So too, the ability to share public health information about Coronavirus with a Bangladeshi government ban on internet in the camps still in place, despite calls from the UN for it to be lifted. And even the most basic of resources â like soap and water to wash hands regularly â are in short supply. To cope with the outbreak, hundreds of isolation beds have been set up but healthcare facilities are basic. There are no ventilators in the camps for the most serious of patients. Theyâd have to be taken to the nearby town of Coxâs Bazar but even there resources are limited.

The country has been basking inrecord-breaking dry weatherin recent weeks - and suppliers are urging people to use water carefully to help prevent a shortage. Water UK, which represents water companies, said it had noticed ""truly incredible surges of demand"" - up 25% in some areas - as people spend more time at home. Reservoirs are still in a healthy state, they said, but some firms canât get enough water to the taps and pressure is dropping. âIt's things like paddling pools and sprinklers that are the biggest challenge,"" Water UK chief executive Christine McGourty told BBC News. ""So weâre just asking people to save a little bit of water and thatâll make a huge difference.â Long-term weather forecasts suggest more dry summer months to come.

But how close is too close? In the UK, some have called for the current 2m distance to be reduced in an effort to allow more people into restaurants and shops when they reopen. The World Health Organization's guidance - which is often cited by critics of the 2m rule - suggests people should stay only 1m apart. The rules vary by country: Which is the right distance? Our science editor David Shukman has beenfollowing the latest on the debate. Reality Check UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked whether he still thought - as he did in mid-May - that Britons would not be taking overseas holidays this year. He said that he was âmore optimistic than previouslyâ. As it stands, the UK government is still advising against non-essential international travel and from 8 June anybody arriving in the UK will have to isolate themselves for 14 days, including UK nationals. So it may well be that Britons will be holidaying in Britain this summer. If so, here are a few figures to bear in mind. Last August,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, UK residents made about 9.4 million visits overseas. In the same month, overseas residents made about 4.1 million visits to the UK. So popular UK destinations may get a bit crowded, even if foreign holidaymakers are not allowed in. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In response to criticism from the UK
Statistics Authority, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said improvement to the reporting of testing data is âconstantlyâ
being looked at. The government is no longer
reporting the number of people tested â there were problems with some apparent
double-counting and the fact that the figures never included the tests returned
from kits sent out by post. Mr Hancock said because the
testing system was expanded rapidly the counting of tests struggled to keep
pace. There is some truth to this. In the early days of the testing
regime, postal testing was not being used. But these questions will
not go away until the data is published and it is clear just how many people
are being tested rather than simply tests being provided. A nine-year-old Kenyan boy who designed a wooden hand-washing machine to help tackle the spread of coronavirus has told the BBC he is ""very happy"" after receiving a presidential award. ""I now have two machines and I want to make more,"" Stephen Wamukota said. They allow users to tip a bucket of water using a foot pedal to avoid touching surfaces and reduce infections. Stephen came up with the idea after learning on TV about ways to prevent catching the virus. Read more here. War-torn Yemen was already experiencing an acute humanitarian crisis The UNâs secretary-general has warned that there is a
ârace against timeâ to combat the coronavirus in Yemen, where a civil war
has already caused the worldâs largest humanitarian crisis. Reports indicated that mortality rates from Covid-19 in the second city of Aden were among the highest in the world,AntÃ³nio Guterres told a virtual pledging conference,external. âThat is just one sign of what lies ahead, if we do not
act now,â he added. Just half of Yemenâs health facilities are operational. There
are shortages of testing devices, oxygen, ambulances and protective
equipment. Many healthcare workers are among those who have been infected.
And 50% of the population do not have access to clean water to wash their
hands. Half of Yemenis do not have access to clean water Guterres said the UN and its partners urgently need $2.4bn (Â£1.9bn) in funding to cover their operations for the rest of the year. Otherwise, 30 out of 41 major UN programmes will have to close in the next few weeks in a country where 24 million people depend on aid. The UK has pledged Â£160m, which Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said would âmean the difference between life and death for thousands of Yemenisâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lockdown break-ups and job changes boost rentalsSupply of new properties for rent is not keeping up with demand, property giant Rightmove says.","Since estate agents were allowed to reopen, demand for rental homes has increased faster than in the sales market Lockdown break-ups, job losses and urgent relocations are thought to have led to a surge in the rental sector. Demand for lettings in Great Britain is up by 22% compared to last year, according to property giant Rightmove. Experts say the lifting of lockdown restrictions has released ""two months of pent-up tension"" in the market. The supply of new rents is not keeping up with demand, however, prompting fears the surge will push up costs and leave some struggling to find homes. According to data provided by Rightmove, demand for all kinds of property plunged during the height of the lockdown. The restrictions prevented house viewings, surveys and searches from taking place, while removal companies were also temporarily closed. People were urged to stay in their current homes during lockdown unless absolutely necessary. Evictions were put on hold until 25 June. Since estate agents were allowed to reopen on 13 May though, demand for rental homes has increased at a quicker rate than the sales market, according to Rightmove. Many people have been left with an ""immediate housing need"" as a result of the pandemic, housing expert Miles Shipside said. Chloe Arnold and her housemate DJ Branch are finding it difficult to find a new place in Bristol The sector is also coping with a backlog of people who have had to cancel planned moves during lockdown. Chloe Arnold and her housemate DJ Branch are two of hundreds searching for properties in Bristol, which has emerged as one of the most-searched-for places on Rightmove aftermoving home was allowed again. ""It's been really difficult if I'm honest,"" said Chloe, 25, who works in recruitment. ""A lot of the time landlords want couples."" The South West has seen the biggest surge in demand for new rental properties with a 34% increase compared to last year, according to Rightmove. It classed demand as the number of times website visitors clicked through to the details of a property listed online. ""One of the reasons it has been tough is because a lot of the houses aren't doing viewings,"" Chloe said. ""Obviously because of the social distancing, a lot of the places we are looking at, you have to decide whether you want it based on a virtual tour. ""It's so easy to miss things that way. In Bristol a lot of places have a problem with damp you aren't going to see on a video tour."" Former banker Renecia Thompson, 35, and her four-year-old daughter moved from Anguilla in the Caribbean to the West Midlands before Christmas. As she had only just received her National Insurance number by the time lockdown was imposed, she had been unable to find work. She was turned down by eight landlords because she was claiming Universal Credit and had to stay with a friend during lockdown. ""I was in competition with others who were in a better financial position than me,"" she said. ""Some landlords wouldn't even talk to me."" Renecia has recently been accepted for a house in Wolverhampton after putting out a plea for a property on the Gumtree website. Rightmove property expert Miles Shipside says the competition for lettings will likely push up rent Wednesday 27 May saw more than six million people visit the Rightmove website, its busiest day ever. ""They may need to move for a job,"" said Rightmove's Mr Shipside. ""In this environment we are in now, there is a need for people with specialist jobs to be in a certain place - just think about the Nightingale hospitals that have sprung up. ""Where some people have enjoyed lockdown, others' relationships haven't survived it and this has had knock-on consequences. ""There could be people who need to move because of job losses too. ""And working from home has left a lot of people looking for a change in surroundings. ""Effectively we have two months of pent-up demand that needs to be satisfied."" However, supply is struggling to match demand. The number of new rental listings on Rightmove is 4% below 2019 levels. It dropped to a level of 64% below during the week of 6 April. Landlords are ""exiting the market"" Mr Shipside says, due to Covid-19 and the uncertainty over tenants being able to afford rent. Thinktank theResolution Foundationfound one in eight renters were struggling with housing costs as a result of coronavirus. ""They [landlords] are going to pick those with the best references and who can move in immediately. Those whose credit record is not the best tend to lose out,"" Mr Shipside said. More people bidding for fewer properties was almost certain to push up the prices of rented accommodation, he said. Estate agent Stephen Groves said appointments were taking longer as a result of the virus Estate agents, having closed for two months, are now reporting an increased workload to manage the backlog of people needing new homes. ""The number of new listings for sales has gone through the roof, but when it comes to rentals there is nowhere near enough stock,"" said Stephen Groves, who runs the Home estate agents in Greater Manchester. ""Days of working from nine to 5.30 have long gone. I was doing emails at 11 last night - everything just takes a lot longer,"" he said. While his company is offering virtual appointments to prospective tenants, the ability to offer house viewings has been restricted. Staff members have to wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during them and homes must be cleaned before and after the viewing. ""Where we could do between 20 and 30 viewing of a property in a day, we are now doing four where the home is still tenanted,"" he said. ""Understandably people don't want people coming to visit their homes because of the virus."" Paul and Poppy Carr of High Wycombe secured a new flat on the basis of a virtual viewing However, some who opted to sign an agreement on the strength of a virtual viewing have seen the benefit. Husband and wife Paul and Poppy Carr of High Wycombe needed to move out of their two-bedroomed apartment quickly but they could not go for any viewings in person during lockdown. They opted for a video tour of a new flat and negotiated a Â£200 reduction in their rent - partly because they noticed a de-humidifier in one room. ""I was really surprised by the quality of the virtual viewing,"" said Poppy, aged 25, a researcher who works in London. ""We could see that it had been recently renovated and they had already done a deep clean. ""I think we were lucky really because we got in there before demand boomed.""

"Lottery winner hopes to realise boyhood dreamSimon Waddup, from Coventry, wins Â£1m in the Euromillions draw.Coventry & Warwickshire","Simon Waddup said he ""kept hearing this voice telling me to buy a lottery ticket"" before playing online An electrician who has been unable to work for a year through ill health has won Â£1m on the Euromillions lottery. Simon Waddup, 31, of Coventry, said he hoped the win meant he could realise his ""dream"" of buying and doing up old properties.
