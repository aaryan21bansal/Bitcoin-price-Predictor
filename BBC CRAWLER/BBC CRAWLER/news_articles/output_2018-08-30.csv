Manager spent Grenfell cash on Dubai trip,"Jenny McDonagh was ordered to surrender her passport and will be sentenced at a later date A council worker has admitted defrauding around Â£60,000 from the Grenfell Tower victim fund. Jenny McDonagh, 39, took cash meant for survivors of the tragedy and victims' grieving family members using pre-paid cards. The Kensington and Chelsea Council finance manager spent the funds on trips to Dubai and Los Angeles, expensive dinners and online gambling. McDonagh, described as a ""serial fraudster"", admitted fraud and theft. She obtained the money ""while being neither a survivor or bereaved family member"", Scotland Yard said. After the fire, McDonagh withdrew Â£62,000 over 10 months, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. The tower block fire in June 2017 killed 72 people Prosecutor Robert Simpson described her as a ""serial fraudster"" who ""lives beyond her means and gambles"". He said she used the stolen funds for a ""trip to Dubai, Los Angeles, meals in expensive restaurants, hair appointments and personal luxuries for herself"". He added: ""She spent quite a lot of money on online gambling. She spent Â£32,000, of which Â£16,000 was winnings and lost roughly Â£16,000 in online gambling."" McDonagh's marriage has since broken down, the court heard. Jenny McDonagh is one of several people to have been convicted of fraud offences relating to funds meant for Grenfell survivors McDonagh, of Abbey Wood, south-east London, pleaded guilty to two offences of fraud, one of theft and another of concealing criminal property. She was released on conditional bail with an electronic tag and will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court at a date to be set. Senior District Judge Emma Arbuthnot said ""custody is the obvious place to go"" and ordered a pre-sentence report. McDonagh was also ordered to quit her current job as finance officer at a mental health charity and inform the police before taking on any further work. Following her conviction a Kensington and Chelsea Council spokesman said the authority was ""shocked"" by the fraud and found McDonagh's actions ""unforgivable"". ""We take fraud very seriously and we have always taken action to root out Grenfell fraud wherever it takes place. ""On this occasion it was one of our own members of staff who managed to defraud the council by getting past our own systems and processes. This is both shocking and unforgivable. ""We discovered the fraud and took action straight away, including strengthening our internal processes. ""We apologise to the survivors and families for any distress this may cause.""

New asthma treatment set for wider use,"A new treatment for severe asthma is set to be made more widely available on the NHS in the UK by the end of 2018. The procedure, bronchial thermoplasty, ""melts"" away excess muscle tissue in the lungs using radio frequency, making breathing easier. Previously there were strict criteria about who was eligible to receive it. But theNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice),externalsays it can be offered more routinely, after it was proved to be safe and effective. Some people may still not be able to receive it because the final decision about whether to offer the procedure lies with local health bodies. Some 5.4 million people in the UK have asthma - but for more than 200,000 of them (3.7%) the asthma is so severe, it can be life-threatening. In fact, the most recent figures from Asthma UK show that 1,410 people died from asthma in 2016. However, this ""life-changing"" treatment will be used only if a patient's symptoms cannot be adequately controlled with drugs, and is only suitable for adults. Joe Farrington-Douglas, the charity's head of policy and external affairs, said: ""This debilitating form of asthma is resistant to regular treatments, meaning many have to cope with terrifying asthma symptoms, such as gasping for breath, as well repeated trips to Accident & Emergency. ""Until now, this treatment has only been available for specific patients at some specialist centres, but these new guidelines could mean more people with the condition could reap the benefits."" Coughing Wheezing Shortness of breath Chest tightness They might only happen when you react to a trigger, like pollen, dust, cigarette smoke, cold air or pets. Source:Asthma UK,external Severe asthma causes inflammation and constriction of the smooth muscle in the walls of the small tubes - the bronchi - impeding the passage of air through to the deep tissue of the lungs. Bronchial thermoplasty tackles this by reducing this muscle mass, thus decreasing the constriction of the bronchi that can take place during an asthma attack. As a result, patients experience fewer and less severe asthma attacks. The procedure takes place under sedation or general anaesthetic and involves a wire probe being inserted into the lungs. Diagram of bronchial thermoplasty Ten-second bursts of radio waves are sent along the airway wall, heating the lining of the lungs to 65C. Two further sessions will be needed, each three weeks apart. The estimated cost of the procedure per patient is thought to be between Â£7,099 and Â£7,257. Nice's programme director and clinical adviser, Prof Kevin Harris, said: ""This is a procedure which is innovative and it does work. ""Asthma is a common disease and the vast majority of patients won't require this treatment. ""But for people with severe asthma this procedure could be life-changing. ""The committee was convinced it was safe enough and works well enough for use with standard arrangements in the NHS.""

Actor GÃÂ©rard Depardieu accused of rape,"GÃ©rard Depardieu at the Cannes Film Festival in 2015 French actor GÃ©rard Depardieu has been accused of rape and sexual assault by a young actress, judicial sources say. He denies the allegations ""absolutely"", his lawyer told AFP news agency. The allegations against the 69-year-old were formally made to police by a 22-year-old French actress on Monday, French radio reports. Mr Depardieu is one of France's most recognisable actors, and has starred in films such as Cyrano de Bergerac and Jean de Florette. The alleged crimes occurred this month in one of Mr Depardieu's Paris residences, French media report. The unnamed actress made her statement to police in Lambesc, southern France, after which the case was passed to prosecutors in the capital. Mr Depardieu's accuser is an actress and author who knew the actor before the alleged crimes took place. The actress was ""devastated"" by the alleged attacks, her agent was quoted as saying by French digital news service BFMTV. Mr Depardieu's lawyer, HervÃ© Temime, said he was convinced his client would be exonerated of any blame by the end of the investigation. ""I had a long meeting with GÃ©rard Depardieu and I am absolutely convinced his innocence will be established,"" he told France Info radio. The actor, he said, was ""shaken"" by the allegations, which went against ""everything he is and respects"". Able to combine bearish physicality with emotional delicacy on screen, he has played in some 170 films, getting his big break in 1973 with Les Valseuses (Going Places). He won the best actor award for Cyrano at Cannes in 1990, and was nominated for an Oscar for the same role. Green Card, an English-language comedy made the same year, brought him further acclaim outside the French-speaking world. Off-screen, he made headlines in recent years for attacking French tax laws, moving to Belgium in protest and later developing close ties to Vladimir Putin's Russia.

Wonga collapses into administration,"Payday lender Wonga has announced its intention to go into administration after losing its battle to stay afloat. The company said in a statement that it had assessed all options and had decided that administration was the appropriate route. It had already stopped accepting new loan applications as it fought to stave off collapse. Its demise in the UK follows a surge in compensation claims amid a government clampdown on payday lenders. Grant Thornton will be acting as administrators. In a statement Wonga said: ""Customers can continue to use Wonga services to manage their existing loans but the UK business will not be accepting any new loan applications. Customers can find further information on the website. Unfortunately for you, the repayments will still have to be made. Although this will be overseen by the administrators - in the short-term at least - there is no practical difference in the way that these payments are made. A service will continue for anyone who needs help, and anyone struggling to repay can still get in touch, and can also contact debt charities such as Citizens Advice or StepChange for free advice. Read more answers to your questions here ""Wonga's overseas businesses continue to trade and are not part of this announcement."" The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said: ""The FCA will continue to supervise Wonga once it is in administration and is in close contact with the proposed administrators with regard to the fair treatment of customers. ""Customers should continue to make any outstanding payments in the normal way. All existing agreements remain in place and will not be affected by the proposed administration.  However, the firm is no longer able to issue new loans."" Wonga, which was the UK's biggest payday lender, had faced criticism for its high-cost, short-term loans, seen as targeting the vulnerable. James Ball was a Wonga customer Among those who used its services at its height was journalist James Ball, now aged 32. He said Wonga made it easy to get a loan when he was young and prone to overspending. But he said that it was also convenient for him to borrow when he was struggling with student debts and commuting costs among other bills. ""I am absolutely not looking for sympathy,"" he said. In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority found that Wonga's debt collection practices were unfair and ordered it to pay Â£2.6m to compensate 45,000 customers. Wonga: Where have all the borrowers gone? What's gone wrong with Wonga? Since then, payday loan companies have faced tougher rules and have their charges capped. This hit Wonga's profits hard. In 2016, it posted pre-tax losses of nearly Â£65m, despite claiming its business had been ""transformed"". It continued to face legacy complaints and was forced to seek a bailout from its backers in August amid a surge in claims. It was a huge fall from grace for Wonga, which in 2012 was touted to be exploring a US stock market flotation that would have valued it at more than $1bn (Â£770m). Wonga never considered itself to be a payday lender, preferring instead to describe itself as a maverick technology company that happened to sell loans. Its technology was groundbreaking, allowing the smartphone generation to choose how much they wanted to borrow with the slide of a thumb. That convenience, matched with a huge advertising campaign featuring amusing puppets and upbeat voiceovers, proved a hit. At the height of its success in 2013, Wonga had a million customers. But Mick McAteer, founder of the not-for-profit Financial Inclusion Centre, said this demand was a bubble: ""They were flogging [credit] and they created demand for it."" In other words, some borrowers simply did not need to borrow from a payday lender, but were attracted towards these high-cost, short-term loans anyway. Read Kevin's piece in full here The collapse spells the end of a rags to riches to rags story of a company that was vilified for its conduct when lending to people who could not afford to repay. The market has changed as a result of the FCA's crackdown, and thousands of former customers have sought compensation. Anyone awaiting compensation payments from Wonga is now likely to be in the queue for a payout from the sale of any assets. Many have said they will not mourn the loss of Wonga. Guy Anker, deputy editor of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: ""Payday loans are hideously expensive and morally questionable products - and many have been mis-sold to vulnerable customers. They should only be seen as a loan of absolute last resort. ""So to have one fewer payday loan lender - and Wonga was a biggie - is positive for consumers, but of course is very sad for the staff who will have lost their jobs."" Wonga: Will my debt be written off? Wonga: Where have all the borrowers gone?

Unmarried mother wins widow payments case,"This video can not be played Siobhan McLaughlin says her case was ""always about the rights of bereaved children"" An unmarried mother has won a landmark court case over which could allow her to claim a Widowed Parent's Allowance. Mother-of-four Siobhan McLaughlin, from County Antrim, lived with her partner for 23 years but never married, which meant she was not able to claim the benefit when he died. The UK's Supreme Court ruledthis was incompatible with human rights law,external. The ruling puts pressure on ministers to change the rules, potentially benefiting thousands of families. Ms McLaughlin (centre) with her children Billy and Rebecca Adams A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said it would consider the court's ruling carefully but said the ruling did not change the current eligibility rules for receiving bereavement benefits, which are paid only to people who are married or in a civil partnership. The Supreme Court cannot change the law but it puts pressure on the UK's legislatures to change the law and ensure that it is human rights compliant. Ms McLaughlin, 46, lived with her partner John Adams, who died in 2014, and they had four children together. She is now the sole provider for her family and works two jobs as a special needs classroom assistant and cleaner. Siobhan McLaughlin (centre) reacts to the judgment on Thursday Ms McLaughlin said the money provided by the WPA would have been useful to her family. Reacting to the news on Thursday, Ms McLaughlin described the judgment as ""just surreal"". ""It is just fantastic for all those children that have been recognised now,"" she said. ""It wasn't ever about me, it was always to do with the parent's allowance part of it."" When asked what it meant for people ""in her position"", Ms McLaughlin replied: ""Hopefully they will recognise that they are just as worthy as children born into wedlock."" John Adams had four children with Siobhan McLaughlin Laura Banks, Ms McLaughlin's solicitor, told the BBC that the decision will benefit ""thousands of children throughout the UK"". ""What Siobhan has said from day one is that it's unfair and it's wrong that her children should be treated any different than children whose parents are married,"" Ms Banks said. ""The Supreme Court have upheld that - it has actually said that not only is it unfair but it's unlawful."" She said the government will now be asked to act quickly ""so as many people can benefit from this as possible"". This video can not be played Thousands of children will benefit from the ruling, says Ms McLaughlin's solicitor Laura Banks The Child Bereavement Network estimated that every year, more than 2,000 families face the ""double hit of one parent dying, and the other parent realising that they and the children aren't eligible for bereavement benefits"". To be eligible for Widowed Parent's Allowance under the current law: You must be eligible for child benefit The deceased partner must have made sufficient National Insurance contributions You must have been married or been in a civil partnership Alison Penny, director of the Childhood Bereavement Network, said the organisation was ""delighted"" with the judgement. ""We pay tribute to Siobhan for having the courage to bring this test case and improve the situation for thousands of grieving children and their surviving parents"", Ms Penny said, in a joint statement issued by the Network, the Child Poverty Action Group and the National Children's Bureau. ""While she brought her case in Northern Ireland, it has implications for the rest of the UK where the wording of the eligibility criteria is the same."" BBC News Legal Correspondent, Clive Coleman The WPA can only be claimed by a surviving partner if that partner was either married to, or in a civil partnership with the deceased. The question at the heart of this case was whether that restriction unjustifiably discriminates against the surviving partner and/or their children, and breaches their human rights. The Supreme Court has decided that it does, and that has significant implications.  There are some 3.3 million co-habiting couples in the UK.  Around 1.2 million of them have children. Siobhan McLaughlin expressed relief after the Supreme Court judgement The purpose of the WPA is to help the children. Thursday's ruling will benefit those families where one co-habiting parent has died and the WPA has been refused, or where a parent dies in future and the surviving partner makes a claim. The Supreme Court cannot change the law but by saying that it is incompatible with the Human Rights Act, it is putting pressure on the UK's legislatures to change the law and ensure that it is human rights compliant. After Mr Adams' death, the County Antrim woman challenged the rule that parents must have married to be entitled to a widowed parent's allowance. Ms McLaughlin, from Armoy, won the original case but it was overturned by the Court of Appeal. In April 2018 the Supreme Court sat in Northern Ireland for the first time ever. Ms McLaughlin's case was the first case heard by the court in Northern Ireland.

Homebase future in doubt as creditors meet,"DIY retailer Homebase faces a make-or-break vote on its future on Friday as it teeters on the brink of collapse. The chain - where 70% of outlets are losing money - has proposed closing 42 stores and cutting rents on others as part of a rescue plan. But some landlords plan to vote against the deal, or Company Voluntary Arrangement, saying it penalises them. If it is not approved, owner Hilco Capital has said it is ""very likely"" Homebase will go into administration. The private equity firm, which bought Homebase for Â£1 in June, wants to revive the DIY chain under a three-year turnaround plan. DIY disaster ends as Homebase sold for Â£1 Homebase: The stores that will close This would see it bring back popular products, like soft furnishings, that were dropped by previous owners, the Australian conglomerate Wesfarmers. Hilco has also promised to pump Â£25m of capital and up to Â£116m of debt into the business - but only if creditors back the CVA. Alvarez and Marsal, the consultants managing the CVA process, say the rescue plan would be a ""lifeline"" for Homebase and benefit its landlords. But reports this week,externalclaimed some property owners, including M&G and Aberdeen Asset Management, were considering legal action against the chain. They feel the proposed rent reductions - of between 25% and 90% at 70 stores - are too steep. They could seek to block the plan or renegotiate terms, although other landlords are hopeful the CVA willthe revive the chain's fortunes,external. It comes amid growing anger about CVAs, which have been used to rescue struggling businesses such as House of Fraser, New Look and Carpetright. Landlords say the deals lead to a sudden loss of income while other creditors are often left untouched. But advocates say they protect jobs. Wesfarmers bought Homebase for Â£340m in 2016 but sold it on this year, booking a $1bn (Â£768m) loss. It blamed a series of ""self-induced"" blunders, including underestimating winter demand for a range of items from heaters to cleaning and storage, and dropping popular kitchen and bathroom ranges. Homebase, which has about 250 stores and 11,500 staff, now plans to bring back popular brands and concessions such as Laura Ashley and Habitat. Hilco has revived the fortunes of other retailers and is best known for rescuing music chain HMV from administration in 2013. However, the restructuring specialist also tried to rescue Allders and Allied Carpets, both of which later went into administration.

Plastic bag fee could double to 10p,"Paper bags can be used as an alternative to plastic The plastic bag fee in England could rise to 10p - with all shops having to charge, regardless of how big they are. Since October 2015, customers have had to pay at least 5p for each single-use bag - with all retailers employing more than 250 people made to take part in the scheme. But now it might be extended to all shops with the charge set at 10p, Prime Minister Theresa May has announced. The change is part of the government's plan to tackle plastic pollution. A consultation will be launched later this year, the government said. Currently, it is estimated that more than three billion bags are supplied by small and medium companies every year. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, smaller retailers already charge a minimum of 5p for plastic bags. Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go? Could this biodegradable bag cut pollution? Seven charts that sum up the plastic problem Mrs May said: ""We have taken huge strides to improve the environment, and the charge on plastic bags in supermarkets and big retailers has demonstrated the difference we can achieve by making small changes to our everyday habits. ""I want to leave a greener, healthier environment for future generations, but with plastic in the sea still set to treble we know we need to do more to better protect our oceans and eliminate this harmful waste."" Campaigners say single use plastic bags take 1,000 years to break down and can be extremely damaging to marine wildlife. The number of single-use plastic carrier bags handed out by supermarkets in England has drastically decreased. In 2014 - before the charge was introduced - the seven main retailers (Asda, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, the Co-Operative Group, Tesco and Waitrose) handed out the equivalent of 140 plastic bags per member of the population. In 2016-17, that fell to 24 bags, falling further to 19 bags in 2017-18. Since the fee was introduced, the number of disposable carrier bags given out by the seven biggest supermarket chains has decreased by 86% overall, according to official figures. In total, 13 billion plastic bags have been taken out of circulation in the past two years. The charge is not a tax, so the money does not go to the government. While retailers are given the choice on what to do with the money, they are expected to give it to good causes. Between April 2016 and 2017, 4.3p was donated to good causes for every 5p bag sold, according to the two-thirds of retailers who voluntarily gave information about where the money went. These retailers donated more than Â£58.5m to good causes in total in that time. This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic Up until now, it's just been the biggest retailers that have had to charge for single-use plastic bags in England. Smaller businesses have been allowed to charge if they want to, with the Association of Convenience Stores encouraging its members to introduce voluntary charging schemes where practical. Many of the seven major supermarkets have already stopped selling single-use carrier bags in their stores.Sainsbury's5p bags are thicker and stronger, so they are not considered to be single use, whileTescoonly sells 10p bags for life. Asdahas said it is phasing out single-use plastic bags by the end of the year, andMorrisonsstarted doing this in March. James Lowman, chief executive ofThe Association of Convenience Stores, said it had ""long campaigned for compulsory plastic bag charging to be extended to all businesses just as it is in Wales and Scotland"". About half of convenience stores already charged for bags voluntarily and most supported a universal charge, he said. The British Retail Consortiumsaid it was right for the levy to be mandatory and consistent for all shops but it questioned whether the rise to 10p would help. ""We think any further reduction will be marginal as there has been such a major reduction already,"" a spokesman said. Environmental campaign groupA Plastic Planetsaid increasing pressure on consumers was the wrong approach. Founder Sian Sutherland said: ""This levy increase unfairly targets consumers while major brands continue to force plastic upon them. The government needs to shift its focus on to them if it is to become a world leader in tackling the plastic problem."" Emma Priestland, plastic pollution campaigner atFriends of the Earth, said increasing charges had proved effective in the Irish Republic (where the levy is22 cents per bag,external), but added that the government also needed to take action against other sources of plastic, such as coffee cups and straws. Analysis by David Shukman, BBC News science editor The past few years have seen a blizzard of government announcements about plastic pollution - but it's always worth checking the small print. The fanfare may be about new measures that are actually coming into force - such as the 5p charge on carrier bags in supermarkets which has genuinely been a major success. Or it could herald the launch of a consultation about whether to introduce new measures - like the plan for a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles. Or the announcement may simply be declaring that there will in future be a consultation - as with the proposal for a doubling of the charge on bags to 10p and extending it to small stores. Thursday's press release says the PM ""confirms"" the consultation but adds that it won't be launched until later this year. And if it all happens, will it be worth it? The 5p charge in the ""big seven"" supermarkets has led to 13 billion fewer bags being in circulation, the kind of dramatic change seen in the Irish Republic which pioneered action in this area. Extending the charge to smaller shops could cut a further three billion - a welcome step but never massive. And campaigners point out that other countries are being far more radical about all forms of plastic waste. Kenya, where the announcement was made, is leading the world with jail sentences for anyone caught making or importing plastic bags; the time for Kenyan consultations on plastic has long past. The government has previously announced a ban on microbeads. It has already said it wants to ban the sale of plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds. There are plans too for a deposit return scheme for drinks bottles and cans, to encourage recycling. Could this 'biodegradable bag' cut plastic pollution?

New York renamed 'Jewtropolis' in map hack,"The renaming of New York City was an act of vandalism, said Snapchat, which is investigating the matter New York City was briefly renamed ""Jewtropolis"" in mapping software used by social media site Snapchat and others. The company called it an act of  ""vandalism"" and said it worked with its partner Mapbox to ""get this fixed immediately"". In a statement, Snap said the defacement was ""deeply offensive"". Mapbox called it an act of ""hate speech"" but added that the issue had been resolved ""within an hour"". ""Our team deleted and removed that information,""the firm said in a blogpost,external. It added that the ""malicious edit"" was made by an unnamed source that attempted ""several other hateful edits"" which were not successful. The firm explained that its AI system flags more than 7,000 map changes a day, which are sent for human review. A ""human error"" in the manual part of the review process led to the incident, it explained. Screenshots on social media  showed that other apps had also been affected. Snap Map allows users to discover content in specific locations, including sporting events and news. A screenshot of the vandalised map was shared with the Snapchat Support Twitter account. And Snap thanked the user who had shared it for alerting it to the problem. In a statement, Snap told BBC News: ""Snap Map, similar to other apps, relies on third-party mapping data from OpenStreetMap, which has been subject to vandalism. ""This defacement is deeply offensive and entirely contrary to our values. And we want to apologise to any members of our community who saw it."" OpenStreetMap has also issued a statement condemning the edit. It said the act had been carried out a month ago, but there had been a delay in processing the data involved, which had prevented the public from seeing the offensive phrase until now. ""There is ongoing work within the OpenStreetMap community to develop better quality assurance tools, to detect and deal with this sort of issue faster,"" it said. ""Unfortunately human error in their processing pipeline led to this incident.""

Celebgate hacker jailed over 2014 attack,"At the time, Jennifer Lawrence called the hack equivalent to a sex crime A man who hacked into the Apple iCloud accounts of Hollywood stars, including Jennifer Lawrence, has been sentenced to eight months in prison in the US. The notorious Celebgate hackresulted in nude photos and videos of Lawrence and other celebrities stolen and posted online. George Garofano was one of four people charged in the 2014 hacking scandal. Three others have already been sentenced to terms of between nine and 18 months in prison. Garofano, aged 26, had admitted accessing usernames and passwords by sending out emails in which he posed as a member of Apple's security team. Other victims included Kirsten Dunst and Kate Upton as well as ordinary members of the public. The prosecution wrote in a sentencing memo to the court: ""Mr Garofano's offence was a serious one. He illegally hacked into his victims' online accounts, invaded their privacy, and stole their personal information, including private and intimate photos. ""He did not engage in this conduct on just one occasion. He engaged in this conduct 240 times over the course of 18 months.""

No charges for 'slave auction' students,"The school, which has more than 1,300 pupils, was rated as inadequate by Ofsted after an inspection in July. No criminal action will be taken against two pupils understood to have chained a black student to a lamppost in a ""mock slave auction"". The Crown Prosecution Service said it had enough evidence to charge one of the boys but Avon and Somerset Police suggested a Community Resolution. It is used for less serious crimes and involved the boys admitting their part in what happened and apologising. The incident took place at Beechen Cliff School in Bath in January. In a statement, Avon and Somerset Police said they would continue to try to stamp out offences motivated by prejudice or hate. ""We take hate crime extremely seriously and recognise the devastating impact it can have on victims and their lives,"" it said. ""There's no room for this type of crime in Avon and Somerset."" The schoolwas rated as inadequate by Ofstedafter an inspection in July. Ofsted found staff had failed to report the case and that their response to it was ""insufficient and too slow"".

Mr Trump's clash with Mr Bernstein comes as fellow-Watergate reporter Bob Woodward is set to release a book next month detailing life inside the Trump White House. US man 'threatened to shoot' reporters Mr Bernstein co-wrote an article that had multiple anonymous sources claiming Cohen said the president was aware of the June 2016 meeting. That meeting involved Mr Trump's son, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. In the27 July article,external, CNN stated Mr Davis had declined to comment, and quoted multiple anonymous sources. The next day, the Washington Post also reported on the claims and cited Mr Davis as a source. On Monday, however, Mr Davis confirmed toBuzzfeed News,externalthat he was CNN's anonymous source and retracted his claims. ""I made a mistake,"" he said, adding that he should have been clearer to reporters that he could not personally verify the information he gave. When Mr Davis appeared on CNN with presenter Anderson Cooper, last week, he said ""the reporting of the story got mixed up"". CNN stands by its story.

Sport presenter charged over armed robbery,"Mr Pauwels has hosted football shows for Belgian and French TV One of Belgium's top football TV presenters has been charged with being an accomplice to an armed robbery, prosecutors have said. StÃ©phane Pauwels, who has hosted shows for Belgian and French TV, was arrested as a part of a major police probe. The 2017 robbery, described by media as a ""home invasion"", took place in the wealthy town of Lasne, near Brussels. The arrest is part of an investigation launched several months ago into armed robberies, burglaries and drug dealing. Five people are currently in custody as a result of it. Mr Pauwels, 50, was detained on Tuesday, and on Wednesday appeared before a judge who charged him and granted conditional bail. He is suspected of being an accomplice to ""armed robbery with violence, firearms, at night, as part of a gang, using a vehicle"". The presenter is said to have complained about his partner's former husband who was allegedly harassing them, according to Belgian media. He is said to have given the man's name to a colleague who then allegedly arranged for the raid to take place at the man's home, the reports say. The charge Mr Pauwels is facing does not indicate his presence during the raid or that he carried out any violent acts, his lawyers were quoted as saying on Thursday afternoon. Mr Pauwels is a presenter on Belgium's RTL-TVI channel - the country's leading private broadcaster - and is also known in France for hosting football programmes on several stations. Parent company RTL Belgium has suspended Mr Pauwels with immediate effect. Reaction on social media has been mixed, with some criticising Mr Pauwels while others have expressed their support for the presenter.

Gene-editing hope for muscular dystrophy,"Scientists have for the first time used gene-editing to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy in a large mammal, a significant step towards effective treatment for people with the disorder. The condition, which has no cure, leads to loss of muscle function and strength and ultimately an early death. But in a study on dogs, scientists were able to partially restore the key protein people with DMD cannot make. They hope in the future to test the technique in people. Green light for muscular dystrophy drug First gene-editing in human body attempt Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common fatal genetic disease in children and almost entirely affects boys and young men - about 2,500 of them in the UK have the condition. Children born with the degenerative disease have a genetic mutation that stops them producing dystrophin, a protein that is vital for muscle strength and function. The same disorder also occurs in many dog breeds. Using the Crispr gene-editing tool, scientists were able to restore dystrophin in four dogs that had the most common genetic mutation seen in DMD patients, by making a single strategic cut in the faulty DNA. This was done by injecting the dogs, who were one month old, with two harmless viruses that edited the genome of the dog in the cells of the muscles and heart. Gene-editing technique could transform future Within several weeks of the edit made in the dogs, the missing protein was restored in muscle tissue throughout the body, including a 92% correction in the heart and 58% in the diaphragm, the main muscle needed for breathing,according to the study in the journal Science,external. Scientists have estimated that a 15% or greater improvement is needed to significantly help patients. The study was a collaboration between the Royal Veterinary College, in London, and the UT Southwestern Medical Center, in the US. Dr Eric Olson, one of the authors, from UT Southwestern, said: ""Children with DMD often die either because their heart loses the strength to pump or their diaphragm becomes too weak to breathe. ""This encouraging level of dystrophin expression would hopefully prevent that from happening."" Richard Piercy, professor of comparative neuromuscular disease at the Royal Veterinary College, said: ""The ambition is to show that this is safe and effective in dogs and then move into humans trials. ""If that works, then the treatment could also apply to pet dogs that we see in our clinics - and that's what we hope for here at the college, as it's our goal to make animals better."" The Royal Veterinary College in London has dogs that have DMD Corrections of DMD mutations have been done in mice and human cells before. But this was the first time the technique was carried out in a large mammal. The proof-of-concept study raises hopes that Crispr can ultimately lead to more effective treatments for DMD. At the moment, few treatments are available for the condition, which causes a progressive loss of function in the body and eventually an early death, usually by patients' 20s or early 30s. The technique used in the study was for a genetic fault that affects about 13% of people with DMD. But experts say it could potentially be applied to the many other mutations those with the condition have. The lab will next conduct longer-term studies to measure whether the dystrophin levels remain stable and to ensure there are no adverse side-effects. Dr Olson hopes the next step beyond dogs is a clinical trial in humans. ""Our strategy is different from other therapeutic approaches for DMD because it edits the mutation that causes the disease and restores normal expression of the repaired dystrophin,"" said Dr Leonela Amoasii, lead author of the study. ""But we have more to do before we can use this clinically."" Independent experts said the study was ""promising"" and might one day be seen as ""ground-breaking"" but pointed out that there were some limitations, including the small group of dogs used. And while dystrophin production was increased, what impact this might have had on improvements in muscle function was not measured. Nevertheless, experts said the findings were an important step towards the use of gene editing for DMD. Darren Griffin, professor of genetics at the University of Kent, said: ""This work represents a small, but very significant step towards the use of gene editing for DMD. ""Any steps towards significant treatment regimes can only be good news. In the fullness of time, this paper may well be seen as one of the ground-breaking studies that led the way to effective treatment."" Dr Kate Adcock, director of research and innovation at the charity Muscular Dystrophy UK, said: ""The next step will be to conduct larger, longer-term studies to see if the gene editing approach does help to slow the progression of the condition and improve muscle strength. ""This won't be a cure - but that shouldn't obscure that this is a key step forward in proving the Crispr technology could work for Duchenne."" Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

Dentists say fines deterring poor patients,"The British Dental Association says a ""huge fall"" in people on low incomes going to the dentist in England is because they fear being wrongly fined when they claim for free treatment. The most recent annual figures show almost 370,000 fines for people accused of ""misclaiming"" for free dental care. But dentists say many of these are innocent confusions over paperwork and that many are overturned when challenged. The NHS says that anyone entitled to free care should be able to access it. Those claiming for free treatment include the elderly, those on benefits and people with learning difficulties. And the BDA says the system of fines, usually of Â£100, is creating a ""hostile environment"" for the vulnerable. Dentists have warned that simple errors in filling in a form can lead to fines being issued - and they say that these are making people afraid to seek dental care, even though they are exempt from charges. Dentist Charlotte Waite has raised concerns about people being wrongly fined The BDA says that this is driving a downturn in visits to the dentist by low-income people, falling by 23% over four years. This represents two million fewer treatments in 2017-18 compared with 2013-14. The number of fines increased more than tenfold across four years - from almost 34,000 to 365,000. The BDA says that when these fines are examined in appeals, a large majority of them are overturned. Go to the dentists and get fined Â£100 Your stories: 10 fines at the dentists... that weren't fine Dentists' leaders say they have ""grave concerns that patients are being put off from seeking treatment by the government's aggressive approach to fines"". ""This huge fall in NHS attendance amongst patients exempt from NHS charges is the logical outcome of failed government policy,"" the BDA's chairman of general dental practice, Henrik Overgaard-Nielsen, said. ""Ministers have created a hostile environment for vulnerable groups and those on low incomes who have a right to free dentistry. ""These patients, often with complex needs, require early intervention not the ever-present threat of fines,"" he said. Last year, dentists and patients contacted the BBC towarn of how the fining system was becoming a barrier to dental care. There were complaints from distressed families thatvulnerable people, such as those with dementia, cancer patients and people with multiple disabilities, could face finesas a result of simple errors or confusion over forms. Charlotte Waite, a senior dentist working in Loughborough, Leicestershire, told the BBC this was a problem appearing on a ""daily basis"". The fines for wrongful claims are intended to stop fraudsters and to make sure no-one who should pay for treatment is avoiding charges. The BDA says that Freedom of Information requests show that about 90% of fines are overturned when challenged - but this is rejected by the Department of Health, which says that only 2% are overturned on appeal, a figure in turn rejected by the BDA. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We want every child and adult to have access to free NHS dental care if they are eligible and we are looking at ways of simplifying the process for vulnerable people. ""But it is absolutely right that we recoup money from patients who incorrectly claim free services so it can be reinvested back into the NHS.""

Profile: Who is Frank Field?,"In a world of anonymous politicians who toe the party line, Frank Field has always stood out. Often described as a maverick or a ""free thinker"", he has never been afraid to challenge his party's leadership, most recently over Brexit. He campaigned to leave the EU and was one of a small band of Labour MPs to vote with the government when it was facing defeat over its Brexit legislation in July, to the frustration and anger of the party leadership and local activists in his Birkenhead constituency, where he has been the MP for 39 years. At 76, he remains one of the most high profile, and hyperactive, backbench MPs, chairing the work and pensions committee - something that might be under threat now that he has resigned the Labour Whip - and the all-party group on hunger and food poverty. Veteran MP Frank Field quits Labour whip Thinking of ways to eradicate poverty and improve the lives of the poor has been a lifelong passion for Mr Field, a man of deep Christian faith. Before entering politics, he made a name for himself as a director of the Child Poverty Action Group. Frank Field has been a lifelong anti-poverty campaigner Born in 1942 to Conservative-voting, working class parents, Mr Field attended a London grammar school and then Hull University, graduating with a degree in economics and politics. He initially wanted to become a trade union official but became a teacher instead, throwing himself in to Labour politics as a councillor in Hounslow, at the age of 24. He entered Parliament in 1979, the year Margaret Thatcher won power (Mr Field was one of the few Labour MPs to count the Iron Lady as a friend). Seen as being on the right of the Labour Party, he was an early champion of Tony Blair's efforts to ""modernise"" the party - and he fought efforts to deselect him by the Militant tendency in the early 1980s. Despite appearances, Mr Field did not get on with Harriet Harman Mr Blair was sufficiently impressed by his unorthodox approach to poverty reduction - with its emphasis on making work pay - to make him minister for welfare reform in his first government, in 1997, with a brief to ""think the unthinkable"". He was sacked a year later after doing just that - although it was a spectacular falling out with his boss, social security secretary Harriet Harman, that sealed his fate. Mr Field continued to campaign for the causes he cared about from the backbenches. In 2006, he was the first senior Labour MP to go public with concerns about the impact on communities of mass immigration, following Mr Blair's decision not to impose controls on migration from Poland and seven other new EU members. Ex-minister's immigration warning,external In 2010, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron made Mr Field his poverty tsar - his report stressed that improving the life chances of children under five was the key to reducing inequality in later life. Frank Field became an MP in 1979 He has been a fierce critic of Universal Credit, describing it as being as disastrous as the poll tax. ""Food banks in my constituency of Birkenhead alone will require an extra 15 tons of supplies just to cope with the increase in need resulting from people being left penniless by delays caused by the switch to Universal Credit,"" he saidin an article for the Daily Mail last year.,external He has also been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party - despite helping the veteran left winger get on to the ballot paper by nominating him. Explaining his motivation for nominating Mr Corbyn in 2015 - at a time when the leadership hopeful was struggling to get enough MPs' backing to be able enter the contest - in a letter to The Times, he said he wanted to force the other Labour leadership contenders to confront the reality of the government's austerity measures.

Guide: Labour anti-Semitism row,"The Campaign Against anti-Semitism stages a protest in 2018 The internal Labour row over anti-Semitism has dragged on for several years. Here's a guide to what's been going on. In October 2020, a report bythe UK's human rights watchdog found Labourto be responsible for ""unlawful"" acts of harassment and discrimination during Jeremy Corbyn's four-and a-half years as party leader. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) investigation identified serious failings in leadership and an inadequate process of handling anti-Semitism complaints. Its report said the party was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act: political interference in anti-Semitism complaints, failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints and harassment. In a statement, it said: ""The equality body's analysis points to a culture within the party which, at best, did not do enough to prevent anti-Semitism and, at worst, could be seen to accept it."" The commission served an unlawful act notice on the party, meaning it has to produce an action plan within six weeks, which is legally enforceable by the courts if not acted upon. The inquiry was launched in May 2019 after ""receiving a number of complaints about allegations of anti-Semitism in the party"". Responding to the report, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a day of shame for the Labour Party"" and apologised to the Jewish community. He said the party would implement all the report's recommendations in full and promised a ""culture change"" in Labour. He added: ""Under my leadership, zero-tolerance of anti-Semitism will mean precisely that. If you're anti-Semitic, you should be nowhere near this Party. And we'll make sure you're not. ""And if - after all the pain, all the grief, and all the evidence in this report, there are still those who think there's no problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, that it's all exaggerated, or a factional attack, then, frankly, you are part of the problem too. And you should be nowhere near the Labour Party either."" Sir Keir's predecessor as leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he did not accept all of the report's findings but expressed the hope that the recommendations would be ""swiftly implemented"". He said ""anyone claiming there is no anti-Semitism in the Labour Party is wrong"" but added that ""the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media"". Labour suspended Mr Corbyn from the party and removed the whip, meaning he would no longer be part of the Parliamentary Labour Party. In a statement, the party said: ""In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation."" Three weeks later, Labour's ruling body - the National Executive Committee (NEC) - decided to readmit Mr Corbyn as a party member. But this did not mean he would automatically be reinstated as a Labour MP, and Sir Keir decided not to restore the whip to his predecessor - meaning Mr Corbyn will continue to sit in the House of Commons as an independent. Sir Keir promised to keep the situation under review, but allies of Mr Corbyn have urged him to change his mind immediately, saying the former leader is being ""persecuted"". Bring back 'persecuted' Corbyn, allies demand Jewish people have faced prejudice and hostility for centuries. During World War II, six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis or their accomplices in what is known as the Holocaust. Modern-day anti-Semitism can take many forms including, but not limited to, conspiracy theories about Jewish control of the global financial system and the media, to attacks on synagogues, verbal abuse or hate speech and abusive memes on social media. In 2018, anti-Semitic hate incidents in the UK reached a record high,according to the Community Security Trust,external, which monitors them. In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopteda working definition of anti-Semitism,externalwhich described it as ""a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews"". The UK and a number of other IHRA members haveadopted or endorsed the working definition,external, as well as a series of accompanying ""contemporary"" examples of how anti-Semitism manifests itself in public life. These include Holocaust denial, denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination (through the existence of a State of Israel), and holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of that state. Labour got itself into trouble over the definition - as we'll explain later. Debates about anti-Semitism in Labour often involve Israel and the term ""Zionism"". In its modern sense, Zionism refers to support for Israel's existence and prosperity. It began as a political movement in Europe in the late 19th Century which sought to develop Jewish nationhood in the land known as Palestine - also known to Jews as the ancient Land of Israel. The movement evolved and eventually led to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Some say ""Zionist"" can be used as a coded attack on Jewish people, while others say the Israeli government and its supporters are deliberately confusing anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism to avoid criticism. Attitudes to Israel in the UK, and on the left in particular, are influenced by its troubled relationship with its Arab neighbours and its long conflict with the Palestinians. A 2016 report by the Home Affairs Committee of MPs backed the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism but said it should include an additional statement to maintain freedom of speech ""in the context of discourse about Israel and Palestine"". This, it said, should read ""it is not anti-Semitic to criticise the Israeli government without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent"" or to hold Israel ""to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest ant-Semitic intent"". Read more about the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism The anti-Semitism row was a constant backdrop to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership Anti-Semitism was generally not regarded as a big problem in the Labour Party before Jeremy Corbyn's election as leader in September 2015. Mr Corbyn and his allies on the left had spent decades campaigning for Palestinian statehood, in contrast with the more nuanced position taken by many of his predecessors. Under his leadership, there was an influx of new members, many of whom were vocal critics of Israel and who believed the UK, along with the US, should be tougher towards Israel, especially regarding its policies towards the Palestinians and its building of settlements in the occupied territories. As the balance of power within Labour changed after Mr Corbyn's election as leader, attention quickly focused on what activists and elected representatives were saying - and had said in the past - on social media and elsewhere about Israel and Jewish people. There were claims that anti-Semitic tropes were being widely propagated and a number of incidents attracted a great deal of attention. There were a string of high-profile suspensions over alleged anti-Semitic comments - and constant accusations, from Jewish groups and some of his own MPs, that Mr Corbyn and his team were failing to take the issue seriously enough. The row threatened to the tear the party apart, with several high-profile MPs walking out over abuse they received. Mr Corbyn repeatedly insisted that anti-Jewish hate would not be tolerated in the party, but critics said he was not doing enough to root out the problem. In April 2018, Jennie Formby, an ally of Mr Corbyn, took over as Labour's general secretary and set about tightening up the party's disciplinary procedures and recruiting more staff to deal with anti-Semitism cases. The full story of the controversies over Mr Corbyn's position on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party are set out below. But let's now look at efforts by the man elected to replace him as leader in March 2020, Sir Keir Starmer, to draw a line under the issue. When Sir Keir Starmer was elected Labour leader in April, he made tackling anti-Semitism a top priority, promising to ""tear out this poison by its roots"" in his acceptance speech. In a video conference with Jewish leaders, the new Labour leader and his deputy, Angela Rayner, said they would set up an independent complaints procedure and review all outstanding cases. This was welcomed by Jewish leaders, whosaid in a joint statementthat Sir Keir had ""achieved more in four days"" than Mr Corbyn did ""in four years"". Shortly afterwards, an internal report into the party's handling of anti-Semitism cases, written in the final month of Mr Corbyn's tenure, was leaked. The 860 page dossiersaid that factional hostilitytowards Mr Corbyn's leadership among senior party staff had led to a ""litany of mistakes"" that hindered the handling of anti-Semitism allegations. Opponents of Mr Corbyn claimed the report was leaked in an attempt to ""smear whistleblowers"", who had spoken to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation. But supporters of the former leader are incensed about alleged evidence that senior former staff members ""openly worked against the aims and objectives"" of the party leadership. The report included thousands of emails and private WhatsApp messages, by named individuals, which allegedly show hostility towards Mr Corbyn, party members and policies. Sir Keir has ordered an inquiry into the contents of the report and how it was leaked to the media, which is still ongoing. In July this year, the Labour Partyagreed to pay ""substantial"" damagesto seven former employees who spoke out about anti-Semitism, in a BBC Panorama programme. The party issued an unreserved apology in the High Court for making ""false and defamatory"" comments about the seven whistleblowers. Labour to report on anti-Semitism leak in July Labour names head of leaked report investigation Sir Keirsacked his shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey in June 2020, saying she had shared an article containing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Mrs Long-Bailey had retweeted an interview with actor and Labour supporter Maxine Peake, later saying she had not meant to endorse all aspects of the article. In the article, Ms Peake discussed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, saying: ""The tactics used by the police in America, kneeling on George Floyd's neck, that was learnt from seminars with Israeli secret services."" The Independent article also quoted the Israeli police denying Ms Peake's claim saying: ""There is no tactic or protocol that calls to put pressure on the neck or airway."" Ms Peake later tweeted that she had been ""inaccurate in my assumption of American police training and its sources"". Allegations of anti-Semitism against party members and supporters dogged Jeremy Corbyn's four-and-half years as Labour leader. Among those suspended by the party for alleged anti-Semitism were MP Naz Shah, the ex-London Mayor Ken Livingstone and MP Chris Williamson, an ally and friend of Mr Corbyn. Chris Williamson was one of a number of prominent figures to be suspended Ms Shah apologisedfor a string of comments on Facebook, including one suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States, although she was subsequently re-instated. She has since gone on to play a leading role in the fight against anti-Semitism in the party. Mr Livingstone quit the partyafter a long-running row over claims Adolf Hitler had once supported Zionism while Mr Williamson was stripped of his membership for saying the problem of anti-Semitism had been over-stated and Labourhad been ""too apologetic""over the issue. Mr Williamsonwas allowed back into the partyseveral months after his suspension, but wassuspended again two days later.pending further consideration of his future. In October 2019, he lost a High Court bid to be reinstated and was unable to stand for re-election as a Labour candidate in Derby North, He stood as an independent but lost his seat. In 2016, Jeremy Corbyn asked the barrister and human rights campaigner Shami Chakrabarti - who was appointed a Labour peer soon after her report was published - to look into the extent of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism within the party. The report concluded that while Labour was not ""overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism"", there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". It made a series of recommendations to tackle what it said was the ""clear evidence of ignorant attitudes"" within sections of the party. The report's launch was marred, though, by averbal confrontation which led to the expulsion of activist Marc Wadsworthfrom the party after he criticised a Jewish MP. The time it has taken to implement the Chakrabarti report has been criticised Labour's former general secretary Jennie Formbysaid she had strengthened and speeded up,externalthe party's disciplinary procedures, with more staff to handle investigations but Baroness Chakrabarti - then Labour's shadow attorney general - criticised the pace of progress. A 2016 Home Affairs Committee report said the leadership's lack of action ""risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally anti-Semitic"". In early 2019, Labour approachedformer Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who replaced Baroness Chakrabarti as the shadow attorney general, about leading a review into its complaints process, which critics said had become politicised. This, in turn, led to complaints from prominent Jewish MPs that he was too close to the party for any review to be independent. But in a politically damaging move, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced its own investigation into anti-Semitism in the party. It is only the second time the EHRC has investigated a political party - in 2010, it ordered the BNP to re-write its constitution to comply with race relation laws. A Labour spokesman rejected ""any suggestion that the party does not handle ant-Semitism complaints fairly and robustly, or that the party has acted unlawfully"". Labour 'not overrun by anti-Semitism' The party faced further criticism following a BBC Panorama calledIs Labour Anti-Semitic? The programme spoke to a number of party officials who alleged that senior Labour figures - namely Ms Formby and communications chief Seumas Milne, who stood down when Mr Corbyn departed -had interfered in the processof dealing with anti-Semitism complaints. The disputes team is supposed to operate independently from the party's political structures, including the leader's office. The whistleblowers also claimed they had faced a huge increase in anti-Semitism complaints since Mr Corbyn became leader in 2015. Seumas Milne and Jennie Formby were accused of interfering in Labour's disciplinary process Labour strenuously disputed the claims, insisting there was no interference and the former staff were ""disaffected"" individuals with ""personal and political axes to grind"". It also said the programme was ""heavily slanted and inaccurate"" - a suggestion Panorama has rejected. The party's then deputy leader, Tom Watson, saidhe ""deplored"" the official responseto the documentary, and other senior figures joined him tocall on the leadership to listen to the concerns it raised. MPs and peers are nowpushing for a fully independent complaints process. In July 2018, Labour adopted a new anti-Semitism code which critics, including Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs, said fell unacceptably short of the IHRA definition. Labour's version did not include a number of its examples of anti-Semitism, including: accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Following a consultation - and widespread criticism - Labour subsequently adopted the fullIHRA definition and examples,external, along with an accompanying statement that ""this will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians"". Critics have said the addition of a ""caveat"" undermines the IHRA definition - but Labour says it is intended to reassure members they can be critical of Israel without being anti-Semitic. Mr Corbyn proposed a longer additional statement - which would have allowed criticism of the foundation of the state of Israel as a racist endeavour - but this was not accepted by the party's ruling executive. Throughout his time as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn insisted there was no place in the party for anti-Semitism. Some of his supporters said the problem had been exaggerated and was being used as a stick to beat him by people who didn't like his leadership of the party or his views on the Middle East. The former Labour leader comes from a different political tradition than virtually every other post-war Labour leader, having campaigned for 40 years against Western imperialism and aggression. Mr Corbyn's opponents accused him of being too close to Hamas, a militant Islamist group, and Hezbollah, a Lebanese paramilitary group. Both groups are widely viewed in the West as terrorist organisations. He described representatives of Hamas as his ""friends"" after inviting them to a controversial meeting in Parliament in 2009. He later said he regretted his use of language, but insisted his motivation in talking to enemies of Israel was the promotion of peace in the Middle East. But his critics argued his views created the space for anti-Semitism to flourish in the party and he had condoned anti-Jewish prejudice through several of his own actions. Mr Corbyn faced criticism in August 2018 after a video emergedon the Daily Mail website,externalof a 2013 clip in which he said a group of British Zionists ""don't understand English irony"". Former chief rabbi Lord Sacks brandedthe comments ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's ""Rivers of Blood"" speech and accused the Labour leader of being an anti-Semite. Mr Corbyn said he had used the term ""Zionist"" in an ""accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people"". He added: ""I am now more careful with how I might use the term 'Zionist' because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews."" In August 2018, the then Labour leader also came under fire over his presence at a ceremony in Tunisia in 2014 which is said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich massacre, during which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by Palestinian militants and killed. The Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Mr Corbyn deserved ""unequivocal condemnation"" for laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the atrocity. Mr Corbyntweeted,externalthat Mr Netanyahu's claims about his ""actions and words are false"", adding: ""What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children."" Mr Corbyn said he had attended the event in Tunis as part of a wider event about the search for peace. Corbyn wreath row explained Earlier in August 2018, Jeremy Corbyn apologised over an event he hosted as a backbench MP in 2010 where a Holocaust survivor compared Israel to Nazism. Afterthe Times published details of the event,external, the then Labour leader said he had ""on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject"" and was sorry for the ""concerns and anxiety that this has caused"". Corbyn apologises over 2010 event Mr Corbyn apologised for not condemning an anti-Semitic mural in London In March 2018, Mr Corbyn was criticised for sending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. In a message sent via Facebook, he had appeared to question a decision to remove the artist's controversial work from a wall in east London. He later said he had not looked at it properly, calling it ""deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic"". The artist, called Mear One, denied this, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"". Following the row, Mr Corbyn said he was ""sincerely sorry for the pain"" caused and conceded there were ""pockets"" of anti-Semitism within the party. Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row Luciana Berger said she had become ashamed of the party she joined as a teenager Unease within Labour ranks in Parliament intensified in 2017 and 2018 amid concerns the leadership was not doing enough to defend Jewish MPs, such as Luciana Berger, who were themselves the targets of anti-Semitic abuse and death threats. In March 2018, scores of Labour MPs joined Jewish groups, including the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and other anti-racism campaigners to demand action in an unprecedented ""Enough is Enough"" rally outside Parliament. In a further sign of the breakdown in trust between Labour and the Jewish community, the Jewish Labour Movement considered severing its century-old affiliation to the party. While deciding to retain its ties, the organisation of 2,000 members did pass a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn and voted to describe the party as ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group Shadow cabinet clash over anti-Semitism In February 2019, nine MPs quit Labour, many of them citing the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism as their reason for leaving. Ms Berger, who had a police escort at the 2018 Labour Party conference, said she had come to the ""sickening conclusion"" that the party had become institutionally anti-Semitic and that she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Ms Berger's supporters, including then deputy leader Tom Watson, claimed she has been ""bullied out of her own party by racist thugs"". Among the other defectors, Joan Ryan claimed the party had ""become infected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism"" while Ian Austin blamed Mr Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"". Eight of the defectors joined the newly formed Independent Group, which became Change UK, but three, including Luciana Berger, went on to join the Liberal Democrats, and failed to get elected at the 2019 general election. The two that remained in Change UK lost their seats, while Gavin Shuker, who stood as an independent, also lost his seat. Joan Ryan and Ann Coffey decided not to stand for re-election. Ian Austin did not join The Independent Group and stood down at the 2019 general election, advising his constituents to vote Conservative to stop Jeremy Corbyn. In March 2018, the head of the Labour Party's disputes panel quit after it emerged she had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. Christine Shawcroft said she had not not been aware of the ""abhorrent"" Facebook post that had led to his suspension In July 2018, the UK's three main Jewish newspapers published the same front page, warning that a government led by Mr Corbyn would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"". Earlier that month the party brought disciplinary action against the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, after she reportedly called Mr Corbyn an ""anti-Semite"" and a ""racist"". Ms Hodge refused to apologise and the action was later dropped. Frank Field, the MP for Birkenhead since 1979, quit the party's group in Parliament in August 2018, saying the leadership had become ""a force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". He stood as an independent at the 2019 general election but lost his seat to the Labour candidate. In May 2019, a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee - Peter Willsman - was suspended afterLBC radio reported,externalhe had been recorded as saying that the Israeli embassy was ""almost certainly"" behind the anti-Semitism row. And Labour's successful candidate in the Peterborough by-election, Lisa Forbes, was engulfed in a row after it emerged she had liked a social media post suggesting Theresa May had a ""Zionist slave masters agenda"". She apologised and calls for her to be suspended were rejected but the controversy led to fresh ructions and claims racism had become ""institutionalised"" within the party. Correction 26 May 2021: An earlier version of this article reported that 30 members of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) had accepted the IHRA's working definition. This was not accurate at the time of writing and this line has been amended in the story. Update 25th June 2019: Although intended as a general guide, an earlier version of this article omitted some relevant information and it has since been updated. Correction 23rd July 2019:  An earlier version of this article inaccurately said that Labour has never confirmed the number of anti-Semitism cases it is investigating and this has been amended to confirm that the party did release figures for a 10 month period in 2018/19.

Belgian child-killer letter angers parents,"Dutroux has spent 22 years in jail for abduction, rape and murder An infamous child killer who abducted, raped and murdered girls in Belgium in the 1990s has enraged victims' families with a letter offering to answer their questions. Marc Dutroux was jailed in 1996 and has for years sought release from prison. Now his lawyer has written to the six families in an attempt to help ""heal their wounds, in some very modest way"". Several families have rejected the approach as a cynical move aimed at securing parole. Now 61, Dutroux was a seasoned criminal when he and his wife Michelle Martin were arrested for abduction and rape in 1986. Jailed in 1989, he was released on parole after just three years. In 1995 and 1996 he kidnapped six girls. He murdered two teenagers, An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, and two eight year olds, Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo, starved to death in his cellar. Two girls aged 12 and 14 survived. Giving evidence against him in court, Sabine Dardenne had asked him, ""Why didn't you kill me?"" Killer Dutroux asks to be freed Belgian justice on trial with Dutroux,external The Dutroux survivors,external Dutroux had claimed he was part of a paedophile network involving well-connected figures, and police incompetence in his case led to widespread accusations of a cover-up. When he grabbed a policeman's gun and briefly escaped from a court in 1998, two government ministers resigned. His ex-wife was given early release from prison in 2012. For the past week, there have been reports of a letter being sent to the victims' families, but it only reached them on Wednesday. Dutroux was finally arrested in 1996 Shared on Facebook by Julie Lejeune's father,external, the letter written by Dutroux lawyer Bruno Dayez talks of ""restorative justice"". While Dutroux himself promised he would not seek direct contact, he was ""ready to provide answers if you wanted to pose questions"". It was not a matter of creating controversy, or reopening wounds but of contributing, even in a very modest manner, towards healing them, the letter said. Belgian reports pointed out that Dutroux has to satisfy five criteria in order to secure parole, and three of them directly relate to the victims. The revulsion of the families was immediately clear. For Jean Lambrecks, father of Eefje, it was a ""big publicity stunt from a lawyer with lots of time and few clients"". He said the letter, written in French, was meaningless and had not even been translated into Dutch. ""After 23 years, it's time this circus just stops. We're not getting involved,"" Paul Marchal, An's father, told Belgian TV. Jean-Denis Lejeune denounced the letter as a sort of ""moral torture"". He had learned of its existence on 23 August, the anniversary of his daughter's funeral. Gino Russo, father of Melissa, said any idea of pardoning his daughter's killer was out of the question. ""I'll leave that to God,"" he told French TV. Her mother, Carine Russo, spoke of moral harassment. The lawyer representing one of the two girls who survived, Georges-Henri Beauthier, condemned the ""syrupy"" language of the letter and said he would rather keep this sort of debate confined to the courtroom rather than being aired in public.

Plastic bag fee could double to 10pAll shops in England would have to implement the charge under proposals announced by the PM.UKComments,"Paper bags can be used as an alternative to plastic The plastic bag fee in England could rise to 10p - with all shops having to charge, regardless of how big they are. Since October 2015, customers have had to pay at least 5p for each single-use bag - with all retailers employing more than 250 people made to take part in the scheme. But now it might be extended to all shops with the charge set at 10p, Prime Minister Theresa May has announced. The change is part of the government's plan to tackle plastic pollution. A consultation will be launched later this year, the government said. Currently, it is estimated that more than three billion bags are supplied by small and medium companies every year. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, smaller retailers already charge a minimum of 5p for plastic bags. Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go? Could this biodegradable bag cut pollution? Seven charts that sum up the plastic problem Mrs May said: ""We have taken huge strides to improve the environment, and the charge on plastic bags in supermarkets and big retailers has demonstrated the difference we can achieve by making small changes to our everyday habits. ""I want to leave a greener, healthier environment for future generations, but with plastic in the sea still set to treble we know we need to do more to better protect our oceans and eliminate this harmful waste."" Campaigners say single use plastic bags take 1,000 years to break down and can be extremely damaging to marine wildlife. The number of single-use plastic carrier bags handed out by supermarkets in England has drastically decreased. In 2014 - before the charge was introduced - the seven main retailers (Asda, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, the Co-Operative Group, Tesco and Waitrose) handed out the equivalent of 140 plastic bags per member of the population. In 2016-17, that fell to 24 bags, falling further to 19 bags in 2017-18. Since the fee was introduced, the number of disposable carrier bags given out by the seven biggest supermarket chains has decreased by 86% overall, according to official figures. In total, 13 billion plastic bags have been taken out of circulation in the past two years. The charge is not a tax, so the money does not go to the government. While retailers are given the choice on what to do with the money, they are expected to give it to good causes. Between April 2016 and 2017, 4.3p was donated to good causes for every 5p bag sold, according to the two-thirds of retailers who voluntarily gave information about where the money went. These retailers donated more than Â£58.5m to good causes in total in that time. This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic Up until now, it's just been the biggest retailers that have had to charge for single-use plastic bags in England. Smaller businesses have been allowed to charge if they want to, with the Association of Convenience Stores encouraging its members to introduce voluntary charging schemes where practical. Many of the seven major supermarkets have already stopped selling single-use carrier bags in their stores.Sainsbury's5p bags are thicker and stronger, so they are not considered to be single use, whileTescoonly sells 10p bags for life. Asdahas said it is phasing out single-use plastic bags by the end of the year, andMorrisonsstarted doing this in March. James Lowman, chief executive ofThe Association of Convenience Stores, said it had ""long campaigned for compulsory plastic bag charging to be extended to all businesses just as it is in Wales and Scotland"". About half of convenience stores already charged for bags voluntarily and most supported a universal charge, he said. The British Retail Consortiumsaid it was right for the levy to be mandatory and consistent for all shops but it questioned whether the rise to 10p would help. ""We think any further reduction will be marginal as there has been such a major reduction already,"" a spokesman said. Environmental campaign groupA Plastic Planetsaid increasing pressure on consumers was the wrong approach. Founder Sian Sutherland said: ""This levy increase unfairly targets consumers while major brands continue to force plastic upon them. The government needs to shift its focus on to them if it is to become a world leader in tackling the plastic problem."" Emma Priestland, plastic pollution campaigner atFriends of the Earth, said increasing charges had proved effective in the Irish Republic (where the levy is22 cents per bag,external), but added that the government also needed to take action against other sources of plastic, such as coffee cups and straws. Analysis by David Shukman, BBC News science editor The past few years have seen a blizzard of government announcements about plastic pollution - but it's always worth checking the small print. The fanfare may be about new measures that are actually coming into force - such as the 5p charge on carrier bags in supermarkets which has genuinely been a major success. Or it could herald the launch of a consultation about whether to introduce new measures - like the plan for a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles. Or the announcement may simply be declaring that there will in future be a consultation - as with the proposal for a doubling of the charge on bags to 10p and extending it to small stores. Thursday's press release says the PM ""confirms"" the consultation but adds that it won't be launched until later this year. And if it all happens, will it be worth it? The 5p charge in the ""big seven"" supermarkets has led to 13 billion fewer bags being in circulation, the kind of dramatic change seen in the Irish Republic which pioneered action in this area. Extending the charge to smaller shops could cut a further three billion - a welcome step but never massive. And campaigners point out that other countries are being far more radical about all forms of plastic waste. Kenya, where the announcement was made, is leading the world with jail sentences for anyone caught making or importing plastic bags; the time for Kenyan consultations on plastic has long past. The government has previously announced a ban on microbeads. It has already said it wants to ban the sale of plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds. There are plans too for a deposit return scheme for drinks bottles and cans, to encourage recycling. Could this 'biodegradable bag' cut plastic pollution?

No charges for 'slave auction' studentsTwo boys are understood to have chained a black student to a lamppost.,"The school, which has more than 1,300 pupils, was rated as inadequate by Ofsted after an inspection in July. No criminal action will be taken against two pupils understood to have chained a black student to a lamppost in a ""mock slave auction"". The Crown Prosecution Service said it had enough evidence to charge one of the boys but Avon and Somerset Police suggested a Community Resolution. It is used for less serious crimes and involved the boys admitting their part in what happened and apologising. The incident took place at Beechen Cliff School in Bath in January. In a statement, Avon and Somerset Police said they would continue to try to stamp out offences motivated by prejudice or hate. ""We take hate crime extremely seriously and recognise the devastating impact it can have on victims and their lives,"" it said. ""There's no room for this type of crime in Avon and Somerset."" The schoolwas rated as inadequate by Ofstedafter an inspection in July. Ofsted found staff had failed to report the case and that their response to it was ""insufficient and too slow"". The chair and deputy chair of the board of governors resigned last month. Head teacher Andrew Davies said an action plan has been put in place to raise standards at the school.

Ofcom has received more than 3,000 complaints about Wednesday's episode of Loose Women after Kim Woodburn walked off the show in tears. The former How Clean Is Your House? presenter was invited on the show to reconcile with Loose Women panellist Coleen Nolan. The pair had a public fall out when they both appeared on Celebrity Big Brother last year. The pair rowed again on Loose Women before Woodburn stormed off set. An Ofcom spokesperson said they had received 3,297 complaints: ""We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate."" A number of viewers accused the panel, which also included Linda Nolan, Janet Street-Porter and Linda Robson, of bullying Woodburn. Allow Twitter content?

ITV said in a statement: ""Kim agreed to come onto the panel today at the invitation of the producers on the understanding it was for a reconciliation with Coleen Nolan. ""Kim becoming upset was never the intention and the panel did endeavour to comfort her. ""She was offered counselling after the show, which she declined."" Street-Porter was dressed as a judge to mediate their conversation but it soon descended into accusations. Woodburn said she had been bullied by the other housemates on Celebrity Big Brother including Coleen Nolan, who she described as ""two-faced"". The presenter conceded that she had been ""two-faced"" because she said she had been trying to keep the peace. ""I didn't tell you how vile you are from day one. That's what I should have done,"" she told Woodburn. Woodburn became tearful as she explained that her time in the Big Brother house had reminded her of her terrible childhood. Woodburn said of Coleen Nolan: ""I'll never forget what the likes of her and others put me through. Never. It was bloody cruel."" Robson tried to comfort her but she batted her arm away after saying she had been a ""phoney"" when she had met her on the show previously. Coleen Nolan's sister and fellow panellist Linda Nolan told Woodburn she had ""no talent"" and only ever appears on TV because she is ""controversial"". The discussion ended when Coleen Nolan called Kim ""a horrible, self-centred, publicity-seeking witch"" and Woodburn responded by calling her ""trash"". Following Woodburn's sudden exit, Coleen Nolan told viewers: ""We have got members of our team with Kim backstage. ""We didn't intend for it to actually end like that, we were hoping, actually, genuinely hoping, for some kind of reconciliation, but that wasn't going to happen."" A spokeswoman for Woodburn told the Press Association that her client was invited on to Loose Women as she was told Nolan wanted to ""hold peace talks with her"". They said Woodburn was briefed and told Nolan would speak first and give her reasons for their row. ""She was told Coleen wanted to bury the hatchet. ""However when Kim walked on set, Coleen refused to speak first and made Kim do all the talking. ""This left Kim on the spot and out of her depth. ""This incident has left Kim incredibly upset and she feels disappointed with what happened."" A tweet from Coleen Nolan's official Twitter account defended the presenter, and retweeted supportive tweets. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Gauls' resistant to change - Macron,"Emmanuel Macron wants to loosen France's employment regulations President Emmanuel Macron has angered opponents by accusing French ""Gauls"" of being resistant to change. On a visit to Copenhagen, Mr Macron said his attempts to remodel labour laws were impeded because the French were not as open to reform as ""Lutheran"" Danes. Opposition politicians accused him of showing ""contempt"" for his own people. Mr Macron later rowed back slightly, saying his comments were meant to be humorous. The French leader came to power on a pledge to overhaul France's enormous labour code. He has long stated his ambition to move towards a more ""Nordic model"". His speech in Denmark was not the first time he has used a foreign visit to highlight what he sees as the resistance to those reforms. Last year, on a visit to Romania, Mr Macron said France was ""not a reformable country"", adding: ""Many have tried and failed, because the French hate reforms."" Weeks later, speaking in Greece,the French president angered critics by saying he would not cede ground to ""slackers"". Macron calls for Europe 'reconstruction' Macron: France's controversial man on the move EU needs migrant labour reform - Macron Mr Macron's latest comments came during a state visit to Denmark at an event attended by Queen Margrethe II. In his speech, he reiterated his admiration for the Danish ""flexicurity"" model, which combines a flexible labour market with generous welfare benefits. ""What is possible is linked to a culture, a people marked by their own history. These Lutheran [Danish] people, who have lived through the transformations of recent years, are not exactly Gauls who are resistant to change,"" he said. Opposition politicians quickly seized on his speech, with many criticising his reference to ""Gauls"" - the name given by the Romans to those who lived in the region that now includes France, Belgium and the Netherlands. ""By his words of confusing foolishness, #Macron in Denmark is not only very contemptuous against his own people, but also very ignorant about the Gauls who were formidable inventors,"" tweeted left-wing French MP Alexis CorbiÃ¨re. Drawing on the Asterix the Gaul books, leftist leader Olivier Besancenot compared the president to the unmusical village bard, Cacofonix. ""We'll end up tying him to a post so he stops his scornful music,"" he told French TV, inspiring a string of tweets on social media. Allow Twitter content?

Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally, tweeted: ""As usual, he shows contempt for the French while abroad. The 'Gauls' will be happy to respond to his arrogance and contempt."" Republican MP Fabien Di Filippo said the president had made ""a new insult to the French people"", adding: ""Emmanuel Macron has outdone himself in Denmark."" Amid a torrent of criticism on social media, Mr Macron sought to clarify his remarks on Thursday, saying they were ""humorous"". ""I love France and the French and I love in all its components. I love them, these Gallic tribes, I like what we are,"" he said during a visit to the Finnish capital, Helsinki. A government spokesman said Mr Macron had been referring to political parties when he spoke of resistant Gauls. Some French unions are resisting President Macron's attempts at labour market reform Mr Macron took office in May last year, still a political novice - never previously elected and little versed in the cut-and-thrust of French politics. His government promised to cut unemployment from 9.5% to 7% in five years, but Mr Macron admitted that he expected months of resistance to some of the proposed new employment laws. In September last year, union-organised protests took place in cities across France against proposed changes to labour laws. Many placards reflected Mr Macron's remarks about French workers, with messages such as ""too lazy to think up a slogan"" and ""slackers on the move"", which mocked the name of the president's centrist LREM party (Republic on the Move).

Wonga collapses into administrationThe payday lender's collapse follows a surge in compensation claims amid a government clampdown.Business,"Payday lender Wonga has announced its intention to go into administration after losing its battle to stay afloat. The company said in a statement that it had assessed all options and had decided that administration was the appropriate route. It had already stopped accepting new loan applications as it fought to stave off collapse. Its demise in the UK follows a surge in compensation claims amid a government clampdown on payday lenders. Grant Thornton will be acting as administrators. In a statement Wonga said: ""Customers can continue to use Wonga services to manage their existing loans but the UK business will not be accepting any new loan applications. Customers can find further information on the website. Unfortunately for you, the repayments will still have to be made. Although this will be overseen by the administrators - in the short-term at least - there is no practical difference in the way that these payments are made. A service will continue for anyone who needs help, and anyone struggling to repay can still get in touch, and can also contact debt charities such as Citizens Advice or StepChange for free advice. Read more answers to your questions here ""Wonga's overseas businesses continue to trade and are not part of this announcement."" The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said: ""The FCA will continue to supervise Wonga once it is in administration and is in close contact with the proposed administrators with regard to the fair treatment of customers. ""Customers should continue to make any outstanding payments in the normal way. All existing agreements remain in place and will not be affected by the proposed administration.  However, the firm is no longer able to issue new loans."" Wonga, which was the UK's biggest payday lender, had faced criticism for its high-cost, short-term loans, seen as targeting the vulnerable. James Ball was a Wonga customer Among those who used its services at its height was journalist James Ball, now aged 32. He said Wonga made it easy to get a loan when he was young and prone to overspending. But he said that it was also convenient for him to borrow when he was struggling with student debts and commuting costs among other bills. ""I am absolutely not looking for sympathy,"" he said. In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority found that Wonga's debt collection practices were unfair and ordered it to pay Â£2.6m to compensate 45,000 customers. Wonga: Where have all the borrowers gone? What's gone wrong with Wonga? Since then, payday loan companies have faced tougher rules and have their charges capped. This hit Wonga's profits hard. In 2016, it posted pre-tax losses of nearly Â£65m, despite claiming its business had been ""transformed"". It continued to face legacy complaints and was forced to seek a bailout from its backers in August amid a surge in claims. It was a huge fall from grace for Wonga, which in 2012 was touted to be exploring a US stock market flotation that would have valued it at more than $1bn (Â£770m). Wonga never considered itself to be a payday lender, preferring instead to describe itself as a maverick technology company that happened to sell loans. Its technology was groundbreaking, allowing the smartphone generation to choose how much they wanted to borrow with the slide of a thumb.

But Mick McAteer, founder of the not-for-profit Financial Inclusion Centre, said this demand was a bubble: ""They were flogging [credit] and they created demand for it.""

Read Kevin's piece in full here The collapse spells the end of a rags to riches to rags story of a company that was vilified for its conduct when lending to people who could not afford to repay. The market has changed as a result of the FCA's crackdown, and thousands of former customers have sought compensation. Anyone awaiting compensation payments from Wonga is now likely to be in the queue for a payout from the sale of any assets. Many have said they will not mourn the loss of Wonga. Guy Anker, deputy editor of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: ""Payday loans are hideously expensive and morally questionable products - and many have been mis-sold to vulnerable customers. They should only be seen as a loan of absolute last resort.

"Wonga no longer offering new loansThe payday lender says it is continuing to ""assess its options"" as it teeters on the brink of collapse.Business","Wonga's adverts featuring puppets were controversial and eventually cut Payday lender Wonga has said it is no longer accepting new loan applications as it teeters on the brink of collapse. The company said ina statement on its website,externalthat it was continuing to ""assess its options"" and existing customers could still use their services to manage their loans. It follows a surge in compensation claims against the firm amid a government clampdown on payday lenders. Reports say the firm has lined up Grant Thornton to act as administrators. Wonga, the UK's biggest payday lender, has faced criticism for its high-cost, short-term loans, seen as targeting the vulnerable. Wonga: Where have all the borrowers gone? What's gone wrong with Wonga? The company's statement said: 'While it continues to assess its options, Wonga has decided to stop taking loan applications. If you are an existing customer, you can continue to use our services to manage your loan.' Wonga has previously said it will make a decision about its future within weeks. The payday lender has addeda Q&A section,externalto its website with advice for existing customers. This includes advice that customers must still repay existing loans ""in line with your repayment agreement"". Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC Business Editor The average payday loan is Â£250. The interest Wonga receives on that is an average of Â£150. But the lender is facing a wave of compensation claims and the cost of processing each of them - whether the borrower's claim is up held or not - is Â£550. A year ago, 90% of all claims were ""organic"". That means the borrower initiated the claim him or herself. Only 10% came through claims management companies (CMCs). Those percentages have reversed with 90% now coming through CMCs leading to a big rise in absolute claim numbers. CMCs have taken to ""weaponising volume"" - as one industry insider told me: ""The lenders have to respond to each claim within 8 weeks. The CMCs know this and so wait till they have accumulated hundreds or even thousands of claims and drop them on the lender in one go and start the clock. ""Up against this pressure, the lenders are more likely to pay out as they don't have the time to sift through the merits of each case."" Read more from Simon here In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority found that Wonga's debt collection practices were unfair and ordered it to pay Â£2.6m to compensate 45,000 customers. Since then, payday loan companies have faced tougher rules and have had their charges capped. This has hit Wonga's profits hard and in 2016 it posted pre-tax losses of nearly Â£65m, despite claiming its business had been ""transformed"". It has continued to face legacy complaints and was forced to seek a bailout from its backers this month amid a surge in claims. It marks a huge fall from grace for Wonga, which in 2012 was touted to be exploring a US stock market flotation that would have valued it at more than $1bn (Â£770m). Analysis: Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter Wonga never considered itself to be a payday lender, preferring instead to describe itself as a maverick technology company that happened to sell loans.

Can Labour detoxify the anti-Semitism row?,"Labour has been riven by accusations of growing anti-Semitism for more than two years A bitter internal row about anti-Semitism has dominated media coverage of the Labour Party throughout the summer - and the leadership is keen to ensure it doesn't drown out the party's message at its annual conference next month. Moves are under way to try to detoxify the issue. But can it be done in a way that satisfies everybody? AsFrank Field resigned the Labour whip on Thursday, the inner core of Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) - the ""officers' group""- was preparing to meet to draw up the agenda for what could be a stormy gathering of the full NEC next Tuesday. That meeting is set to become the forum for deciding the party's position on tackling anti-Semitism. In July, Labour adopted a new code of conduct for its MPs and other elected representatives. Ex-chief rabbi condemns Corbyn comments A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Corbyn defends 'British Zionist' comments The new code incorporated theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of anti-Semitism,external, which has been adopted by many public bodies in the UK and around the world since it was agreed in 2016. But crucially, say critics of the Labour leadership's stance on this issue, it did not reproduce four of the 11 ""contemporary examples"" of anti-Semitism in public life, cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) as guiding its work. Labour sources maintained that most of the excluded examples were covered by the new code, but had simply been reworded to give them disciplinary force. For instance, the IHRA says that ""Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis""is an example of anti-Semitism. Labour's code says members should""resist""using Hitler or Nazi metaphors and that ""such language carries a strong risk of being prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"". There was an outcry that not every example had been adopted, not just from some Jewish groups but from many Labour MPs too. The Parliamentary Labour Party - its MPs - is due to be balloted on adopting the complete IHRA document, including all the examples, on 5 September, the day after the NEC meets. While open to further amendments to the new code of conduct, there is one IHRA example of anti-Semitism in particular which Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have been reluctant to adopt: ""Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, eg, by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour."" They say this would especially restrict the free speech of Palestinians - and the ability to discuss the circumstances around the foundation of the state of Israel. But with Unite's Len McCluskey and Jon Lansman of Momentum (who are usually allies of the Labour leader) now willing to adopt the IHRA examples in full, the Left is not solidly behind the initial position taken by their party leader. It also means there is now a majority on the NEC for full adoption of the IHRA document. Opponents of Jeremy Corbyn will portray this as a setback, and question why he didn't adopt the IHRA's examples earlier. Momentum founder Jon Lansman is among those in favour of adopting the IHRA definition in full But his supporters are likely to argue that he hasn't been defeated, as at July's NEC meeting it was agreed to continue to consult on Labour's code and that the party has simply changed tack in light of the consultations. Will this detoxify the issue? Well, that may depend on what accompanies the adoption of the IHRA examples. Back in July, the pro-Palestinian MP Richard Burden suggested at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party that it does indeed adopt the IHRA definition and examples in full - but that this, in his words, should be ""IHRA plus"" - the ""plus"" being a statement making clear that criticism of the Israeli government would still be legitimate. He suggested that the party take a similar tack to the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, which held an inquiry into anti-Semitism in 2016. It recommended the adoption of the IHRA definition and examples by all political parties, but with the following addendum: ""It is not anti-Semitic to criticise the government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent. It is not anti-Semitic to hold the Israeli government to the same standards as other liberal democracies, or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent."" It is possible the NEC will take this approach. But there are suggestions that more wide-ranging caveats could be added - effectively neutralising the effect of adopting the ""racist endeavour"" example of anti-Semitism. It is possible the IHRA examples sit alongside Labour's code of conduct rather than be formally integrated. And the NEC may make clear that the adoption of the IHRA examples would not lead to the retrospective disciplining of party members. Some supporters of the Labour leader want party members to have the final say Some Jewish groups which have been outspoken in their criticism of the Labour leadership would be far from satisfied with this outcome. Euan Philipps, from Labour Against Anti-Semitism, has got his retaliation in first. ""For the Labour Party to claim that it has re-adopted the IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism then the party would need to ensure that the definition has a functional place within the organisation's disciplinary process,"" he said in a statement. ""If it is watered down by caveats and addendums then the party cannot claim that it has been fully adopted. It is a false compromise."" So some caveats could severely weaken the IHRA antidote to this toxic political issue. But there is another possible, if unlikely, outcome next week. Labour sources say there is a ""three-month rule"" at the NEC, which means the party's ruling body cannot return to exactly the same subject for further debate during this period. I'm told at least some of those who oppose adopting all the IHRA examples are considering invoking this - trying to defer the whole issue until the Labour conference in late September. That, of course, would mean that an anti-Semitism row would almost certainly overshadow that event. It's hard to believe that the leadership would welcome this. Some NEC members tell me that as anti-Semitism will now formally be on the agenda it is inconceivable that it won't be discussed. Nonetheless, there could be a procedural wrangle next week before anything of substance is debated. A demonstration is being planned by the Camden Momentum group - which takes a quite different view from Momentum's founder and NEC member Jon Lansman - outside next week's meeting, highlighting differences on the Left over this issue. It doesn't want the NEC to endorse the full IHRA document - and wants any decision to be taken by Labour's rank and file members. Last week the Camden group passed the following motion: ""The members elected Jeremy Corbyn. The IHRA definition would return the party to the right which we voted down by a large majority - twice. Therefore, the members, not the NEC, nor the PLP, must decide whether or not to adopt the IHRA examples. WE DEMAND THAT THE DECISION BE PUT TO A VOTE OF ALL LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS'."" Also on the NEC agenda is a discussion of Labour's long-running Democracy Review. Rule changes arising from this review - for example, a further reduction in MPs' influence in nominating future leadership contenders - will be put to next month's Labour conference. But what isn't in the Democracy Review document could be more controversial than what is. The review hasn't called for the mandatory reselection of MPs. But some local constituency parties have been proposing rule changes to the way MPs and parliamentary candidates are selected - and it's likely these will be debated at Labour's conference. Row over Labour MP's 'democracy roadshow' The long march of Corbyn's Labour They are calling for ""open selections"" - in other words sitting MPs could be challenged by other party members between each scheduled general election. And it's possible that they could get the backing of the influential left-wing Momentum group for this controversial change. Momentum's current position is to reform the existing system of selecting candidates - where MPs aren't automatically challenged. But if Momentum decides to back open selections following a meeting of its leadership on Saturday, it's more likely the Labour conference will do likewise. I'm told there is strong grassroots pressure to do so. The influential Unite union's official policy is also to support the mandatory reselection of MPs. Labour former deputy leader Lord Hattersley has already warned that this could provoke a split. And very senior and current figures in the party are privately warning that while there may not be a huge split, the party could splinter - with a handful of MPs initially sitting as independents in protest. As politicians return to Westminster next week, Jeremy Corbyn will face the twin challenges of how to hold his party together and how to reach a consensus on tackling anti-Semitism.

Ex-officer jailed for killing black teenJordan Edwards' parents cried and hugged prosecutors after Roy Oliver was found guilty of murder.US & Canada,"Oliver said he had felt he ""had no other option than to use lethal force"" An ex-police officer has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for shooting dead an unarmed black teenager in Texas. Roy Oliver, who is white, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in Dallas in April 2017, killing 15-year-old Jordan Edwards. It is very rare for police officers to be convicted in shooting deaths. Oliver's lawyers say they intend to appeal against the verdict. Jordan's family say the jail sentence is too lenient. ""He can actually see life again after 15 years - and that's not enough because Jordan can't see life again,"" his stepmother, Charmaine Edwards, said. On the night of 29 April 2017, police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party in the suburb Balch Springs. Jordan's friends described him as a ""happy kid"" who was always smiling Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots, causing panic at the home as people fled. According to police documents, Oliver's partner, Tyler Gross, attempted to stop a car full of teenagers leaving the party. He walked up to the passenger door of the car and punched the window, breaking it. Oliver then fired several times into the car - shooting Jordan, who was in the front passenger seat, in the back of the head. Oliver said he believed the car was reversing ""aggressively"" towards his partner. However, bodycam footage showed that the car was actually driving away from police when the shots were fired. US police shootings: How many die each year? Why do US police keep killing black men? Officer Gross later told the court that he had not felt his life was in danger and had not felt the need to use his gun. Oliver was fired by police shortly after the shooting. A jury in Texas found Oliver guilty of murder on Tuesday, and on Wednesday night, after 12 hours of deliberation, they sentenced him to 15 years in jail. This means he could be eligible for parole after seven and a half years. Jordan's parents hugged prosecutors after the guilty verdict Prosecutors had argued for a sentence of at least 60 years. Jordan's family cried and hugged prosecutors after the guilty verdict. His father, Odell Edwards, said he was ""very happy... it's been a long time, hard year"". However, his stepmother said she would have preferred a longer sentence of 25 to 30 years. The lawyer for the Edwards family, Daryl Washington, said the verdict was significant for ""every African-American"" who was killed by police and has ""not gotten justice"". ""This case is not just about Jordan. It's about Tamir Rice. It's about Walter Scott. It's about Alton Sterling,"" he said, referencing three other black men or boys killed by US police. Defence lawyers have argued that Oliver had ""reacted properly"" and made a split second decision to protect his partner. They plan to appeal, saying there were ""significant errors"" in the trial. Oliver's wife said she was worried for their young son Oliver's mother Linda Oliver and wife Ingrid Llerena had asked the jury for a lighter sentence, describing him as a caring father to a young autistic son. However, his half-sister Wendy testified for the prosecution instead, saying ""Jordan didn't do anything to be shot"". After the verdict,Linda Oliver said she was ""just stunned"" by the verdict,external. ""I don't think the testimony supported it. I think what hurt him the most was that the other officer didn't think he was in danger,"" she told the New York Times, in tears. There have been several high-profile cases of black men - often unarmed - dying at the hands of US police in recent years. But police are rarely convicted over shootings that happen while they are on duty. This video can not be played Prayer vigil for teen killed by police According to criminologist Philip Stinson,there are about 1,000 incidents per year where an on-duty police officer shoots and kills someone,external. However, since 2005,only 33 police officers have been convicted over on-duty shootings,externalwhere someone was killed, he told NBC. The cases where US police have faced killing charges How often are US police killed on duty? Out of those cases,only six non-federal police officers were convicted of murder,external, and four of those convictions were overturned, AP news agency reports. Experts say thatjuries tend to give police officers the benefit of doubtand are reluctant to second-guess police decisions. However,observers say that Oliver's case may have been different,externalbecause video footage contradicted his version of events, and his partner said he did not feel threatened.

Dentists say fines deterring poor patientsDentists say a fear of unfair fines is causing a sharp fall in low-income families receiving treatment.Family & Education,"The British Dental Association says a ""huge fall"" in people on low incomes going to the dentist in England is because they fear being wrongly fined when they claim for free treatment. The most recent annual figures show almost 370,000 fines for people accused of ""misclaiming"" for free dental care. But dentists say many of these are innocent confusions over paperwork and that many are overturned when challenged. The NHS says that anyone entitled to free care should be able to access it. Those claiming for free treatment include the elderly, those on benefits and people with learning difficulties. And the BDA says the system of fines, usually of Â£100, is creating a ""hostile environment"" for the vulnerable. Dentists have warned that simple errors in filling in a form can lead to fines being issued - and they say that these are making people afraid to seek dental care, even though they are exempt from charges. Dentist Charlotte Waite has raised concerns about people being wrongly fined The BDA says that this is driving a downturn in visits to the dentist by low-income people, falling by 23% over four years. This represents two million fewer treatments in 2017-18 compared with 2013-14. The number of fines increased more than tenfold across four years - from almost 34,000 to 365,000. The BDA says that when these fines are examined in appeals, a large majority of them are overturned. Go to the dentists and get fined Â£100 Your stories: 10 fines at the dentists... that weren't fine Dentists' leaders say they have ""grave concerns that patients are being put off from seeking treatment by the government's aggressive approach to fines"". ""This huge fall in NHS attendance amongst patients exempt from NHS charges is the logical outcome of failed government policy,"" the BDA's chairman of general dental practice, Henrik Overgaard-Nielsen, said. ""Ministers have created a hostile environment for vulnerable groups and those on low incomes who have a right to free dentistry. ""These patients, often with complex needs, require early intervention not the ever-present threat of fines,"" he said. Last year, dentists and patients contacted the BBC towarn of how the fining system was becoming a barrier to dental care. There were complaints from distressed families thatvulnerable people, such as those with dementia, cancer patients and people with multiple disabilities, could face finesas a result of simple errors or confusion over forms. Charlotte Waite, a senior dentist working in Loughborough, Leicestershire, told the BBC this was a problem appearing on a ""daily basis"". The fines for wrongful claims are intended to stop fraudsters and to make sure no-one who should pay for treatment is avoiding charges. The BDA says that Freedom of Information requests show that about 90% of fines are overturned when challenged - but this is rejected by the Department of Health, which says that only 2% are overturned on appeal, a figure in turn rejected by the BDA. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We want every child and adult to have access to free NHS dental care if they are eligible and we are looking at ways of simplifying the process for vulnerable people. ""But it is absolutely right that we recoup money from patients who incorrectly claim free services so it can be reinvested back into the NHS.""

"Free skips to tackle fly-tippingClearing up illegally discarded waste cost more than ÃÂ£400,000 last year, a council says.Birmingham & Black Country","Fly-tipping cost Walsall Council Â£426,000 to clear up last year Skips could be placed on streets in a bid to tackle repeated fly-tipping, a council has announced. Last year, there were more than 4,000 reports of illegally discarded waste across Walsall, with 2,000 tonnes of rubbish removed from the borough. The local authority has now proposed,externalputting a skip in each of its 20 wards every Saturday. Clearing up fly-tipping cost the council more than Â£400,000 last year, bosses said. Residents told the BBC they were in favour of the move after branding the blight of fly-tipping ""disgusting"" and an ""absolute disgrace"". The council has also proposed increasing a cash reward for people whose information leads to successful fly-tipping prosecutions from Â£100 to Â£500.

She added: ""Having given residents the opportunity to do the right thing, we hope to see a reduction both in the number of fly-tipping incidents and also in the costs of collecting and disposing of the waste.""

Wonga no longer offering new loans,"Wonga's adverts featuring puppets were controversial and eventually cut Payday lender Wonga has said it is no longer accepting new loan applications as it teeters on the brink of collapse. The company said ina statement on its website,externalthat it was continuing to ""assess its options"" and existing customers could still use their services to manage their loans. It follows a surge in compensation claims against the firm amid a government clampdown on payday lenders. Reports say the firm has lined up Grant Thornton to act as administrators. Wonga, the UK's biggest payday lender, has faced criticism for its high-cost, short-term loans, seen as targeting the vulnerable. Wonga: Where have all the borrowers gone? What's gone wrong with Wonga? The company's statement said: 'While it continues to assess its options, Wonga has decided to stop taking loan applications. If you are an existing customer, you can continue to use our services to manage your loan.' Wonga has previously said it will make a decision about its future within weeks. The payday lender has addeda Q&A section,externalto its website with advice for existing customers. This includes advice that customers must still repay existing loans ""in line with your repayment agreement"". Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC Business Editor The average payday loan is Â£250. The interest Wonga receives on that is an average of Â£150. But the lender is facing a wave of compensation claims and the cost of processing each of them - whether the borrower's claim is up held or not - is Â£550. A year ago, 90% of all claims were ""organic"". That means the borrower initiated the claim him or herself. Only 10% came through claims management companies (CMCs). Those percentages have reversed with 90% now coming through CMCs leading to a big rise in absolute claim numbers. CMCs have taken to ""weaponising volume"" - as one industry insider told me: ""The lenders have to respond to each claim within 8 weeks. The CMCs know this and so wait till they have accumulated hundreds or even thousands of claims and drop them on the lender in one go and start the clock. ""Up against this pressure, the lenders are more likely to pay out as they don't have the time to sift through the merits of each case."" Read more from Simon here In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority found that Wonga's debt collection practices were unfair and ordered it to pay Â£2.6m to compensate 45,000 customers. Since then, payday loan companies have faced tougher rules and have had their charges capped. This has hit Wonga's profits hard and in 2016 it posted pre-tax losses of nearly Â£65m, despite claiming its business had been ""transformed"". It has continued to face legacy complaints and was forced to seek a bailout from its backers this month amid a surge in claims. It marks a huge fall from grace for Wonga, which in 2012 was touted to be exploring a US stock market flotation that would have valued it at more than $1bn (Â£770m). Analysis: Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter Wonga never considered itself to be a payday lender, preferring instead to describe itself as a maverick technology company that happened to sell loans. Its technology was groundbreaking, allowing the smartphone generation to choose how much they wanted to borrow with the slide of a thumb. That convenience, matched with a huge advertising campaign featuring amusing puppets and upbeat voiceovers, proved a hit. At the height of its success in 2013, Wonga had a million customers. But Mick McAteer, founder of the not-for-profit Financial Inclusion Centre, said this demand was a bubble: ""They were flogging [credit] and they created demand for it."" In other words, some borrowers simply did not need to borrow from a payday lender, but were attracted towards these high-cost, short-term loans anyway.

Panasonic to move Europe HQ out of UK,"Panasonic will move its European headquarters from the UK to Amsterdam in October as Brexit approaches. The aim is to avoid potential tax issues linked to the UK's decision to leave the EU, said Panasonic Europe's chief executive Laurent Abadie. In the run-up to March 2019, a number of multinational firms have said they plan to move jobs out of the UK. Several Japanese financial companies have said they intend to move their main EU bases away from London. Panasonic's decision was driven by a fear that Japan could start considering the UK a tax haven if it cuts corporate tax rates to attract business, Mr Abadie told the Nikkei Asian Review newspaper. If Panasonic ends up paying less tax in the UK, that could render it liable for a bigger tax bill in Japan. Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles At-a-glance: the UK's four Brexit options Mr Abadie told the Nikkei Asian Review that Panasonic had been considering the move for 15 months, because of Brexit-related concerns such as access to free flow of goods and people. Panasonic Europe later issued a statement confirming that it was transferring its regional headquarters from Bracknell in the UK to Amsterdam from 1 October. It said it was doing so for several reasons, including ""improved efficiency and cost competitiveness"". It said ""fewer than approximately 10"" people would be affected out of a staff of 30. ""No Panasonic UK business operations will be affected by the EU headquarters move,"" the statement added. In 2016,the UK government pledged to cut corporation taxto encourage businesses to continue investing in the UK after the Brexit referendum. Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016, but with less than a year to go,the UK and the EU are struggling to reach consensuson the terms of the exit. Japan is a major investor in the UK, where more than 800 Japanese companies employ more than 100,000 people. However, financial firms including Nomura, Sumitomo Mitsui and Daiwa have already said they will no longer maintain their EU headquarters in London.

"Work when you want, firm tells new staff","PwC hopes more flexibility will help it recruit ""better people"" Accountancy giant PwC has launched a scheme that allows some new recruits to work the hours they want. The Flexible Talent Network allows people to list their skills and preferred work pattern when they apply. PwC says the aim is to attract skilled people who don't want to be tied to traditional 9-to-5 hours. Flexible working patterns can include anything from shorter weekly working hours, to only working for a few months a year. PwC, which will match recruits to relevant projects rather than specific roles, hopes the move will give more diverse talent a route into the firm. When 'out of office' still means work Emails on commute 'should count as work' PwC, one of the so-called Big Four accountancy giants, said that it decided to embrace the gig economy after a study it carried out showed that almost 46% of 2,000 respondents prioritised flexible working hours and a good work-life balance the most when choosing a job. So far, more than 2,000 people have registered with the new network in the two weeks since the initiative was launched. Apart from the flexible working scheme, PwC is also recruiting for its six-month paid senior internship programme Back to Business, which is designed to help senior professionals to restart their career after an extended break. PwC's chief people officer, Laura Hinton, said: ""People assume that to work at a big firm they need to follow traditional working patterns - we want to make it clear that this isn't the case. In order to recruit the best people, we recognise that we need to offer greater flexibility, different working options and a route back in for those looking to restart their careers."" Offering flexible working was not only good for staff, but also good for business, the economy and ultimately society, she said. ""We're likely to see a rise in people transitioning in and out of work throughout their careers and those organisations who responsibly support their people to do this will ultimately gain a competitive advantage,"" Ms Hinton added. PwC said that it is looking for a wide variety of skills, as the projects it undertakes for clients are varied. Skills required range from qualified accountants with experience of auditing who can step in to support its permanent staff during busy periods, to people with experience in project management, digital and IT. For example, one Flexible Talent Network member was studying in London to become a financial analyst while raising two young children. PwC has employed her on a 100-day contract, where she worked for 10 days in November to familiarise herself with PwC's processes. She then returned to her home country, China, to visit family in December, returning in January to work the remaining 90 days for PwC during the ""busy season"". This employee is now focusing on her exams, and will return in October to start another 100-day contract with PwC.

Ex-officer jailed for killing black teenJordan Edwards' parents cried and hugged prosecutors after Roy Oliver was found guilty of murder.,"Oliver said he had felt he ""had no other option than to use lethal force"" An ex-police officer has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for shooting dead an unarmed black teenager in Texas. Roy Oliver, who is white, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in Dallas in April 2017, killing 15-year-old Jordan Edwards. It is very rare for police officers to be convicted in shooting deaths. Oliver's lawyers say they intend to appeal against the verdict. Jordan's family say the jail sentence is too lenient. ""He can actually see life again after 15 years - and that's not enough because Jordan can't see life again,"" his stepmother, Charmaine Edwards, said. On the night of 29 April 2017, police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party in the suburb Balch Springs. Jordan's friends described him as a ""happy kid"" who was always smiling Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots, causing panic at the home as people fled. According to police documents, Oliver's partner, Tyler Gross, attempted to stop a car full of teenagers leaving the party. He walked up to the passenger door of the car and punched the window, breaking it. Oliver then fired several times into the car - shooting Jordan, who was in the front passenger seat, in the back of the head. Oliver said he believed the car was reversing ""aggressively"" towards his partner. However, bodycam footage showed that the car was actually driving away from police when the shots were fired. US police shootings: How many die each year? Why do US police keep killing black men? Officer Gross later told the court that he had not felt his life was in danger and had not felt the need to use his gun. Oliver was fired by police shortly after the shooting. A jury in Texas found Oliver guilty of murder on Tuesday, and on Wednesday night, after 12 hours of deliberation, they sentenced him to 15 years in jail. This means he could be eligible for parole after seven and a half years. Jordan's parents hugged prosecutors after the guilty verdict Prosecutors had argued for a sentence of at least 60 years. Jordan's family cried and hugged prosecutors after the guilty verdict. His father, Odell Edwards, said he was ""very happy... it's been a long time, hard year"". However, his stepmother said she would have preferred a longer sentence of 25 to 30 years. The lawyer for the Edwards family, Daryl Washington, said the verdict was significant for ""every African-American"" who was killed by police and has ""not gotten justice"". ""This case is not just about Jordan. It's about Tamir Rice. It's about Walter Scott. It's about Alton Sterling,"" he said, referencing three other black men or boys killed by US police. Defence lawyers have argued that Oliver had ""reacted properly"" and made a split second decision to protect his partner. They plan to appeal, saying there were ""significant errors"" in the trial. Oliver's wife said she was worried for their young son Oliver's mother Linda Oliver and wife Ingrid Llerena had asked the jury for a lighter sentence, describing him as a caring father to a young autistic son. However, his half-sister Wendy testified for the prosecution instead, saying ""Jordan didn't do anything to be shot"". After the verdict,Linda Oliver said she was ""just stunned"" by the verdict,external. ""I don't think the testimony supported it. I think what hurt him the most was that the other officer didn't think he was in danger,"" she told the New York Times, in tears. There have been several high-profile cases of black men - often unarmed - dying at the hands of US police in recent years. But police are rarely convicted over shootings that happen while they are on duty. This video can not be played Prayer vigil for teen killed by police According to criminologist Philip Stinson,there are about 1,000 incidents per year where an on-duty police officer shoots and kills someone,external. However, since 2005,only 33 police officers have been convicted over on-duty shootings,externalwhere someone was killed, he told NBC. The cases where US police have faced killing charges How often are US police killed on duty? Out of those cases,only six non-federal police officers were convicted of murder,external, and four of those convictions were overturned, AP news agency reports. Experts say thatjuries tend to give police officers the benefit of doubtand are reluctant to second-guess police decisions. However,observers say that Oliver's case may have been different,externalbecause video footage contradicted his version of events, and his partner said he did not feel threatened.

"Belgian child-killer letter angers parentsMarc Dutroux, who abducted and murdered girls, has offered to answer the families' questions.Europe","Dutroux has spent 22 years in jail for abduction, rape and murder An infamous child killer who abducted, raped and murdered girls in Belgium in the 1990s has enraged victims' families with a letter offering to answer their questions. Marc Dutroux was jailed in 1996 and has for years sought release from prison. Now his lawyer has written to the six families in an attempt to help ""heal their wounds, in some very modest way"". Several families have rejected the approach as a cynical move aimed at securing parole. Now 61, Dutroux was a seasoned criminal when he and his wife Michelle Martin were arrested for abduction and rape in 1986. Jailed in 1989, he was released on parole after just three years. In 1995 and 1996 he kidnapped six girls. He murdered two teenagers, An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, and two eight year olds, Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo, starved to death in his cellar. Two girls aged 12 and 14 survived. Giving evidence against him in court, Sabine Dardenne had asked him, ""Why didn't you kill me?"" Killer Dutroux asks to be freed Belgian justice on trial with Dutroux,external The Dutroux survivors,external Dutroux had claimed he was part of a paedophile network involving well-connected figures, and police incompetence in his case led to widespread accusations of a cover-up. When he grabbed a policeman's gun and briefly escaped from a court in 1998, two government ministers resigned. His ex-wife was given early release from prison in 2012. For the past week, there have been reports of a letter being sent to the victims' families, but it only reached them on Wednesday. Dutroux was finally arrested in 1996 Shared on Facebook by Julie Lejeune's father,external, the letter written by Dutroux lawyer Bruno Dayez talks of ""restorative justice"". While Dutroux himself promised he would not seek direct contact, he was ""ready to provide answers if you wanted to pose questions"". It was not a matter of creating controversy, or reopening wounds but of contributing, even in a very modest manner, towards healing them, the letter said. Belgian reports pointed out that Dutroux has to satisfy five criteria in order to secure parole, and three of them directly relate to the victims. The revulsion of the families was immediately clear. For Jean Lambrecks, father of Eefje, it was a ""big publicity stunt from a lawyer with lots of time and few clients"". He said the letter, written in French, was meaningless and had not even been translated into Dutch. ""After 23 years, it's time this circus just stops. We're not getting involved,"" Paul Marchal, An's father, told Belgian TV. Jean-Denis Lejeune denounced the letter as a sort of ""moral torture"". He had learned of its existence on 23 August, the anniversary of his daughter's funeral. Gino Russo, father of Melissa, said any idea of pardoning his daughter's killer was out of the question. ""I'll leave that to God,"" he told French TV. Her mother, Carine Russo, spoke of moral harassment. The lawyer representing one of the two girls who survived, Georges-Henri Beauthier, condemned the ""syrupy"" language of the letter and said he would rather keep this sort of debate confined to the courtroom rather than being aired in public.

Ex-officer jailed for killing black teen,"Oliver said he had felt he ""had no other option than to use lethal force"" An ex-police officer has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for shooting dead an unarmed black teenager in Texas. Roy Oliver, who is white, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in Dallas in April 2017, killing 15-year-old Jordan Edwards. It is very rare for police officers to be convicted in shooting deaths. Oliver's lawyers say they intend to appeal against the verdict. Jordan's family say the jail sentence is too lenient. ""He can actually see life again after 15 years - and that's not enough because Jordan can't see life again,"" his stepmother, Charmaine Edwards, said. On the night of 29 April 2017, police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party in the suburb Balch Springs. Jordan's friends described him as a ""happy kid"" who was always smiling Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots, causing panic at the home as people fled. According to police documents, Oliver's partner, Tyler Gross, attempted to stop a car full of teenagers leaving the party. He walked up to the passenger door of the car and punched the window, breaking it. Oliver then fired several times into the car - shooting Jordan, who was in the front passenger seat, in the back of the head. Oliver said he believed the car was reversing ""aggressively"" towards his partner. However, bodycam footage showed that the car was actually driving away from police when the shots were fired. US police shootings: How many die each year? Why do US police keep killing black men? Officer Gross later told the court that he had not felt his life was in danger and had not felt the need to use his gun. Oliver was fired by police shortly after the shooting. A jury in Texas found Oliver guilty of murder on Tuesday, and on Wednesday night, after 12 hours of deliberation, they sentenced him to 15 years in jail. This means he could be eligible for parole after seven and a half years. Jordan's parents hugged prosecutors after the guilty verdict Prosecutors had argued for a sentence of at least 60 years. Jordan's family cried and hugged prosecutors after the guilty verdict. His father, Odell Edwards, said he was ""very happy... it's been a long time, hard year"". However, his stepmother said she would have preferred a longer sentence of 25 to 30 years. The lawyer for the Edwards family, Daryl Washington, said the verdict was significant for ""every African-American"" who was killed by police and has ""not gotten justice"". ""This case is not just about Jordan. It's about Tamir Rice. It's about Walter Scott. It's about Alton Sterling,"" he said, referencing three other black men or boys killed by US police. Defence lawyers have argued that Oliver had ""reacted properly"" and made a split second decision to protect his partner. They plan to appeal, saying there were ""significant errors"" in the trial. Oliver's wife said she was worried for their young son Oliver's mother Linda Oliver and wife Ingrid Llerena had asked the jury for a lighter sentence, describing him as a caring father to a young autistic son. However, his half-sister Wendy testified for the prosecution instead, saying ""Jordan didn't do anything to be shot"". After the verdict,Linda Oliver said she was ""just stunned"" by the verdict,external. ""I don't think the testimony supported it. I think what hurt him the most was that the other officer didn't think he was in danger,"" she told the New York Times, in tears. There have been several high-profile cases of black men - often unarmed - dying at the hands of US police in recent years. But police are rarely convicted over shootings that happen while they are on duty. This video can not be played Prayer vigil for teen killed by police According to criminologist Philip Stinson,there are about 1,000 incidents per year where an on-duty police officer shoots and kills someone,external. However, since 2005,only 33 police officers have been convicted over on-duty shootings,externalwhere someone was killed, he told NBC. The cases where US police have faced killing charges How often are US police killed on duty? Out of those cases,only six non-federal police officers were convicted of murder,external, and four of those convictions were overturned, AP news agency reports. Experts say thatjuries tend to give police officers the benefit of doubtand are reluctant to second-guess police decisions. However,observers say that Oliver's case may have been different,externalbecause video footage contradicted his version of events, and his partner said he did not feel threatened.

Free skips to tackle fly-tipping,"Fly-tipping cost Walsall Council Â£426,000 to clear up last year Skips could be placed on streets in a bid to tackle repeated fly-tipping, a council has announced. Last year, there were more than 4,000 reports of illegally discarded waste across Walsall, with 2,000 tonnes of rubbish removed from the borough. The local authority has now proposed,externalputting a skip in each of its 20 wards every Saturday. Clearing up fly-tipping cost the council more than Â£400,000 last year, bosses said. Residents told the BBC they were in favour of the move after branding the blight of fly-tipping ""disgusting"" and an ""absolute disgrace"". The council has also proposed increasing a cash reward for people whose information leads to successful fly-tipping prosecutions from Â£100 to Â£500. Other trials mooted include extending opening hours at council tips and introducing a free collection service for bulky household items. The council said dumped fridges and freezers were a 'real problem' Midlands live: Passengers evacuated as bus catches fire; Two-foot-long machete found down robber's trousers Councillor Louise Harrison said: ""We're planning to trial a number of initiatives to make it easier for our residents to legally dispose of their waste. ""But if they don't, our stance is one of zero tolerance."" She added: ""Having given residents the opportunity to do the right thing, we hope to see a reduction both in the number of fly-tipping incidents and also in the costs of collecting and disposing of the waste."" The council has faced a spate of dumping incidents in recent years,including when rubbish was filmed falling from a fly-tipper's van. The plans will be discussed at a cabinet meeting on 5 September.

On-the-run killer's conviction appeal,"This video can not be played Jack Shepherd told police he never asked if Charlotte Brown could swim A man found guilty of killing his date in a speedboat crash has appealed against his conviction, despite being on the run. Jack Shepherd was sentenced to six years in July for themanslaughter of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown. The Court of Appeal has confirmed Shepherd, who left the country prior to his trial, has lodged appeals against his conviction and sentence. Ms Brown's family said it was ""not fair"" Shepherd had not faced justice. An arrest warrant was issued following his conviction. Charlotte's mum, Roz Wickens, from Clacton, is continuing to appeal for Shepherd to give himself up. Charlotte Brown and Shepherd shared two bottles of wine at dinner before the speedboat crash The Met Police found out that Shepherd, of Paddington, would not appear at his trial three days before it was due to begin, although he was present at previous hearings. Despite being absent it came out during the trial that Shepherd was in regular contact with his legal team. Scotland Yard said it was following ""intelligence and leads to addresses and where he's last been seen and where he's known"". ""We work with a number of agencies, including the National Crime Agency, and we're open to worldwide inquiries,"" a spokesman said. The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error First date speedboat death man sentenced Shepherd's trial heard he had entertained up to 10 women on the vessel and had previously been warned by police about speeding on the river. He and Ms Brown had met online and went for a meal at the Shard where they drank two bottles of wine. They returned to Shepherd's houseboat in Hammersmith before going for a ride in the speedboat to the Houses of Parliament. The court was told the boat, which had numerous defects, was being driven ""at full throttle"" by Ms Brown, from Clacton, Essex, when it hit a submerged log or timber and capsized near Wandsworth Bridge. In court, the web designer's barrister, Stephen Vullo QC, said Shepherd was not trying to avoid justice but ""could not have faced the Brown family"". ""It's cowardice,"" he said. Mr Vullo also revealed his client married a childhood friend shortly after the crash, and has a two-year-old child, but the relationship has since broken down.

Sturgeon's 'huge sadness' as Salmond resigns,"Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond as SNP leader and first minister in 2014 Sexual misconduct claims against Alex Salmond must be treated in a manner that is fair to ""all parties concerned"", Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister said complaints could not simply be ""swept aside because of the identity of the person involved"". And she said the priority should be ensuring ""truth and justice prevail"". Mr Salmond, who strongly denies the allegations against him, quit the SNP on Wednesday evening. The former first minister is taking court action against the Scottish government over its handling of the complaints. Mr Salmond also launched a crowdfunding appeal to pay his legal costs, which surpassed its Â£50,000 target in a few hours but has been heavily criticised by opposition parties. How the story has played out online Resignation statement in full Salmond allegations: What do we know? Alex Salmond profile He has said he intends to apply to rejoin the SNP once he has had an opportunity to clear his name. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland on Thursday that the situation as a whole was ""incredibly difficult"" for her and the party she has led since Mr Salmond stood down in the wake of the 2014 independence referendum. But she said women had to be confident that their complaints would be ""treated seriously and fairly - and by fairly I mean fairly to all parties concerned"". This video can not be played First Minster Nicola Sturgeon says justice and truth must prevail Ms Sturgeon also said she wanted a culture where people are able to come forward with complaints regardless of ""how senior, how powerful, how well known or what the political allegiance is"" of the person involved. She added: ""Whatever any of us do and say in the context of this very high profile case, we must absolutely make sure we don't make it harder for or discourage women from coming forward in the future. I think that is an obligation on all of us right now."" Ms Sturgeon, who has described Mr Salmond as being her ""friend and mentor"" for the past 30 years, also urged people to wait for the legal process to conclude rather than creating ""some kind of media circus"".

Mr Salmond, who was Scottish first minister from 2007 to 2014, released a video on social media on Wednesday evening announcing his resignation from the SNP but has not been available for interview. He said he was quitting because he wanted to avoid potential divisions within the party, which has faced calls to suspend him. It follows allegations, which emerged last week, from two Scottish government staff members about Mr Salmond's behaviour when he was first minister. He has described the allegations, which are now being examined by Police Scotland, as ""patently ridiculous"". In his statement, Mr Salmond said: ""I did not come into politics to facilitate opposition attacks on the SNP and, with parliament returning next week, I have tendered my resignation to remove this line of opposition attack. ""Most of all, I am conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal division."" The Scottish Conservatives said Mr Salmond's crowdfunding appeal was ""astonishing"" as it meant Scotland ""now faces the incredible and unprecedented situation of its most famous former first minister appealing to SNP supporters for cash to take legal action against the government he used to run."" Scottish Labour MSP Rhoda Grant claimed Mr Salmond was ""sending a signal to those who have made the allegations that he has the upper hand"" and accused him of ""dragging Scotland into the gutter"". Labour's former first minister, Jack McConnell, is among those who have urged people to instead donate to charities which help victims of sexual assault and harassment. Ms Sturgeon, who retweeted funding appeals for Rape Crisis and Women's Aid on Thursday morning, said the crowdfunding appeal was a matter for Mr Salmond, who she said was ""perfectly entitled to take his own decisions at this stage"". Ms Sturgeon said Alex Salmond's contribution to the independence movement ""speaks for itself"" The Daily Record newspaper broke the news of the sexual misconduct allegations last Thursday. The paper says it has seen wording of one complaint which describes an incident alleged to have taken place at the first minister's official residence in Edinburgh, Bute House, in the first week of December 2013. The two women lodged complaints in January this year, just weeks after the Scottish government adopted a new complaints procedure in the light of wider concern about sexual harassment at Holyrood and Westminster. Does this resolve all the issues for the party? Of course it doesn't. There is an atmosphere of despair, a demeanour of despondency, around Team Sturgeon as they view the impact upon the party - it's a political problem for the SNP - and the cause of independence, which Mr Salmond believes he is partly ameliorating by stepping down while his court case is heard. But there are problems within government as well. It was Nicola Sturgeon who instigated the review of internal sexual conduct procedures within the Scottish government, the consequence of which would appear to be that a couple of complaints were raised in January following that review. It is personal for Nicola Sturgeon as well, as she acknowledges in the statement she issued last night - Alex Salmond has been her friend and mentor for 30 years. Mr Salmond claims that the subsequent investigation into the allegations against him by senior Scottish government civil servants was ""unfair and unjust"" - something Ms Sturgeon strongly denies. He said he had been given no opportunity to ""see and therefore to properly challenge the case against me"" and that he had ""not been allowed to see the evidence"". Mr Salmond has also claimed that someone within the Scottish government has ""flagrantly and repeatedly"" breached the confidential complaints process by leaking details to the Daily Record. In anarticle in the Times newspaper,external, the head of the FDA civil service trade union criticised Mr Salmond for singling out the Scottish government's most senior civil servant, Leslie Evans, for criticism.

Emails on commute 'should count as work',"The spread of mobile internet has turned the commute into an extension of the working day Commuters are so regularly using travel time for work emails that their journeys should be counted as part of the working day, researchers say. Wider access to wi-fi on trains and the spread of mobile phones has extended the working day, a study from the University of the West of England says. The study examined 5,000 rail passengers on commuter routes into London as wi-fi became more available. ""I am a busy mum and I rely on that time,"" one commuter told researchers. ""It's really important to my sanity that I can get work done on the train,"" she said, on the Aylesbury to London route. The study, to be presented at the Royal Geographical Society on Thursday, found that 54% of commuters using the train's wi-fi were sending work emails. Others were using their own mobile phone connections for work emails. Those on the way to work were catching up with emails sent ahead of the coming day - while those on the return journey were finishing off work not completed during regular working hours. Is it damaging for a work-life balance if people are expected to answer emails before and after work? ""It's dead time in a way, so what it allows me to do is finish stuff and not work in the evenings,"" said a commuter on the London to Birmingham route. The study examined the impact of free wi-fi being upgraded on the London to Birmingham and London to Aylesbury routes. It showed that as internet access improved it had the effective consequence of extending working hours, using laptops and mobile phones. Is it OK to paint your nails on a train? Rail fares: Commuters 'pay fifth of salary' on season ticket Commuting by solar-powered river bus For commuting parents, it was also seen as a ""transition"", where they switched roles from being part of a family to a working environment. There were other commuters who liked the ""buffer"" of being able to work when travelling. ""The majority of the time it's an option for me to, you know, clear the decks for the day, relax and put work behind me more than anything else,"" said a passenger on the London to Birmingham route. But the findings raise questions about the work-life balance - and whether it is healthy to stretch out the working day with people routinely answering emails beyond office hours. If the journey has become part of work, should it also be recognised as part of working hours? Should people be expected to check work emails outside of work? Researcher Dr Juliet Jain said smartphones and mobile internet access had caused a ""blurring of boundaries"" between work and home life - and this now applied to the journey to work. ""How do we count that time? Do workplace cultures need to change?"" she asked. Instead of technology giving people more flexibility over working, the study showed that people were working extra hours on top of their time in the office. ""There's a real challenge in deciding what constitutes work,"" said Dr Jain, from the university's Centre for Transport and Society. Counting the journey as work could ""ease commuter pressure on peak hours"" travel, she said, allowing more staggered travel times. But Dr Jain said it would also mean that employers would want ""more surveillance and accountability"" for how commuters were spending that time before arriving at their desks. Business leaders recognised the difficulties of setting boundaries around such work emails and mobile technology - and warned it could damage productivity if work became too pervasive. ""This increasing flexibility has the potential to radically shift the work-life balance for the better - but it also leaves open the door to stress and lower productivity,"" said Jamie Kerr, of the Institute of Directors. ""With the concept of clocking on and clocking off no longer straightforward, defining where leisure begins and work ends will be vital for both employers and individuals, as well as a complex task for regulators."" Matthew Percival, the CBI's head of employment, said: ""A common-sense approach is needed, giving individuals the tools to manage their work-life balance."" Is it OK to paint your nails on a train?

Suu Kyi 'should have resigned' on Rohingya,"The Rohingya are one of many ethnic minorities in Myanmar The outgoing UN human rights chief says Myanmar's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi should have resigned over the military's violent campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority last year. Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein told the BBC the Nobel Peace prize winner should have considered returning to house arrest rather than excusing the military. A new UN report says Myanmar's military should be investigated for genocide. Myanmar has rejected the report as one-sided. The army of the Buddhist-majority nation - which has been accused of systematic ethnic cleansing - haspreviously cleared itself of wrongdoing. The UN report, published on Monday, blamed Ms Suu Kyi, a long-term leader of the pro-democracy movement, for failing to prevent the violence. Will we ever see Myanmar's military leaders in the dock? What is genocide and why is the term so rarely used? Seeing through the official story in Myanmar ""She was in a position to do something,"" Mr Hussein said in an interview with the BBC's Imogen Foulkes. ""She could have stayed quiet - or even better, she could have resigned."" ""There was no need for her to be the spokesperson of the Burmese military. She didn't have to say this was an iceberg of misinformation. These were fabrications,"" he said. Ms Suu Ky, seen here in 2015, with Myanmar's commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing ""She could have said look, you know, I am prepared to be the nominal leader of the country but not under these conditions. ""Thank you very much, I will resign, I will go back into house arrest - I cannot be an adjunct accessory that others may think I am when it comes to these violations."" Between 1989 and 2010, Ms Suu Kyi, 73, spent about 16 years under house arrest by the military government. On Wednesday, the Nobel committee said Ms Suu Kyi could not be stripped of the Peace Prize she was awarded in 1991. While it is acknowledged that Ms Suu Kyi does not control the military,she has faced international pressure to condemn the army's alleged brutality. For decades, she was hailed as the heroine of the human rights community - most notably for enduring house arrest for her pro-democracy activism during a brutal military dictatorship. When communal violence broke out in 2012 and displaced more than 100,000 Rohingya people, Ms Suu Kyi sought to reassure the international community and pledged to ""abide by our commitment to human rights and democratic values"". Aung San Suu Kyi: Then and now What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis How Suu Kyi sees the Rohingya crisis ""Muslims have been targeted but Buddhists have also been subjected to violence,"" she told the BBC at the time. ""This fear is what is leading all the trouble."" She said that it was down to the government to bring an end to the violence, explaining: ""This is the result of our suffering under a dictatorial regime."" This video can not be played What has Aung San Suu Kyi said about Rohingya Muslims? In 2015, her National League for Democracy party won a landslide election victory and she became Myanmar's de-facto leader. As the Rohingya crisis continued, Ms Suu Kyi's comments on the situation tended to play it down or suggest that people were exaggerating the severity of the violence. The last time she spoke to the BBC in April 2017, she said: ""I don't think there is ethnic cleansing going on. I think ethnic cleansing is too strong an expression to use for what is happening."" Profile: Aung San Suu Kyi Could Aung San Suu Kyi face Rohingya genocide charges? The Rohingya crisis: Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Since an outbreak of violence started in August 2017, Ms Suu Kyi has missed several opportunities to speak publicly about the issue, including the UN General Assembly in New York last September. She later claimed the crisis was being distorted by a ""huge iceberg of misinformation"" - but then also said she felt ""deeply"" for the suffering of ""all people"" in the conflict. Myanmar, she said, was ""committed to a sustainable solution... for all communities in this state."" Imogen Foulkes, BBC Geneva correspondent Mr Zeid has been an outspoken critic of Ms Suu Kyi Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein is known for his bluntness and his comments on Aung San Suu Kyi were no exception. He bitterly criticised her attempts to excuse Myanmar's military. This week, UN investigators published evidence linking senior commanders to act of genocide. His harsh words are another indication that Aung San Suu Kyi may now go down in history not as a Nobel Peace prize winner and pro-democracy leader, but as a woman who failed to act in the face of unspeakable human rights violations. The Rohingya are a Muslim minority in Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship and considered illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh despite calling the Rakhine state home for generations.

Who are the Rohingya Muslims? What next for Myanmar after damning report? Thousands of people have died and more than 700,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since August 2017.

Shops ban sales to under-16s,"Retailers will ban the sale of energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre Sales of energy drinks to children under 16 have been banned in most major UK supermarkets, amid concerns about high levels of sugar and caffeine. Boots is also joining supermarkets such as Asda, Waitrose, Tesco and the Co-op in introducing the rule. Retailers will limit sale of energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to under-16s. Co-op said it recognised the ""growing concern about the consumption of energy drinks"" among children.

Boots is the first retailer to partake that is not a supermarket. The Co-op, Aldi and Lidl implemented the change on 1 March, while Morrisons, Waitrose, Asda and Boots put the rule in place on 5 March. A Boots spokesperson said: ""Helping our customers to live healthier lives has always been our core purpose. ""We have listened to the growing public concern about young people consuming these high sugar and highly-caffeinated drinks."" Although Tesco has announced its decision to follow, it will not implement the change until 26 March. The move follows calls by campaigners for a complete ban on energy drinks, and after MP Maria Caulfield asked Prime Minister Theresa May toconsider a UK-wide banearlier this year.

Drinks sold despite under-16s ban,"Most major retailers have been banned from selling high-caffeine energy drinks to under-16s since March High-caffeine canned energy drinks are being sold in supermarkets despite a ban, a BBC investigation has found. Sales of the drinks to children under 16 have been voluntarilybanned by most major UK stores since March. A teaching union has warned they are having a detrimental effect on both the health and the attention span of pupils But the British Soft Drinks Association said there is no more caffeine in most energy drinks than in a small cup of coffee. The new code is voluntary but whenBBC Timelinetook a 15-year-old girl round eight supermarkets, half allowed her to buy an energy drink. Jane Peckham, national officer at the NASUWT teaching union, said: ""The ever-increasing consumption of caffeine through energy drinks is a concern for long-term health. ""More and more studies are showing that can lead to diabetes, hyperactivity and other such conditions. ""I think it is something that we all need to pay attention to."" Anecdotally, Ms Peckham said she has heard of pupils consuming up to seven energy drinks a day. And she said it is a problem in both primary and secondary schools. The union is calling for a total ban on energy drinks in schools. Ms Peckham added: ""Research has shown that children who consume high levels of energy drinks are much more likely to develop future negative behaviours. ""It can lead to use of tobacco, binge drinking, possibly drug use and the energy drink is the starting point for that."" The limitations concern drinks which contain more than 150mg of caffeine per litre. Jen Peckham warned energy drinks can cause health problems Timeline took Annie, 15, round eight supermarkets in Glasgow and Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire, with mixed results. In one Glasgow store, she went to a self-service check out where the canned drink was flagged as a restricted item. Annie told the programme a staff member approved the sale without asking her for identification. She repeated the process in another and when asked by a member of staff when her birthday was, Annie replied: ""May"". He did not ask her age or for proof of her age before approving the sale. In two stores in Newton Mearns, Annie was not asked for identification. Annie after buying an energy drink without being challenged over her age Timeline also spoke to teenagers who consume energy drinks. Lennon, 14, is a keen footballer, runner and cyclist and enjoys both flat and fizzy energy drinks. He said: ""The sports drinks give you a boost but the other ones make you kind of hyper. ""Sometimes, if I'm angry, I take them because it calms me down."" The teenager admitted he has been refused energy drinks in supermarkets and has then asked an adult to buy them. He added: ""If energy drinks were banned I would feel frustrated, angry, upset and I would kind of lose my temper. ""I would just hope that when I am older I would get them again so for the rest of my life I could be happy."" Lennon, 14, consumes sports and fizzy energy drinks Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine at Glasgow University, said children should not be consuming energy drinks. He added: ""They were originally developed for optimal sport performance in high-functioning athletes, to replenish sugars and salts. ""The problem is that the word 'energy' is misleading - kids thinks that they'll be full of vitality after drinking it - but very few children are high-performing athletes so they don't need this additional sugar, salt, and caffeine."" Prof Sattar believes the biggest problem with the drinks is the high sugar content, which can lead to childhood obesity. He said: ""Energy drinks have the same or more sugar than fizzy drinks. ""This kind of refined sugar - as most research agrees - is not nutritious and nourishing, it causes damage to teeth, it causes obesity, which of course leads to heart disease, diabetes and cancer. ""Sports and energy drinks will have salt in them too, and high salt intake is a big factor in high blood pressure in children."" He said the picture concerning caffeine is less clear-cut. Prof Sattar added: ""Some research has suggested that high levels of it are physically bad for you, but many cases seem to be anecdotal. ""Either way, drinking too much energy drink will certainly cause agitation in kids, and impact their ability to sleep. ""Sleep deprivation has knock-on effects including weight gain, adverse diet, emotional distress etc."" The British Soft Drinks Association said it has no safety concerns. A statement on its website on whether energy drinks can be consumed by children, said: ""Whilst caffeine and energy drinks have been deemed safe by health authorities around the world, it is recommended that children consume less caffeine from all sources due to their lower body weight. ""The latest European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report was regarding caffeine intake from all products and confirmed that caffeine intake from energy drinks is negligible in children and less than 11% in adolescents. ""EFSA also confirmed that the main contributors to daily caffeine intake in all age groups are tea, coffee, chocolate and other non-alcoholic beverages.""

Dyson gears up for electric car testing,"An impression of Dyson's electric car test track at Hullavington in Wiltshire Dyson has unveiled plans for a 10-mile test track in Wiltshire where its new electric cars will be put through their paces. The track and other facilities are part of a plan tostart selling a ""radical"" electric car from 2021. The company best known for its vacuums and domestic appliances bought the disused airfield at Hullavington two years ago. Dyson has already renovated two hangars built in 1938 at the 517-acre site. That redevelopment has cost Â£84m and the next phase of the airfield's development would take Dyson's total investment to Â£200m. About 400 automotive staff are now based at Hullavington and a further three buildings will open in the coming months, offering an additional 15,000 sq m of testing space. Dyson to make electric cars 'Back our scientists' says Dyson Jim Rowan, chief executive of Dyson, predicted that Hullavington would soon become a ""world-class vehicle testing campus"". ""We are now firmly focused on the next stage of our automotive project strengthening our credentials as a global research and development organisation,"" he said. Sir James Dyson says his electric car will be ""radical"" Sir James Dyson, 71, is yet to reveal any details about his electric car and no prototype has been built. However, it is expected to be aimed at the upper end of the market, will have ""some"" driverless features and may not even look like a conventional vehicle,he told GQ magazine,externalearlier this month: ""What we're doing is quite radical."" The hints suggest Dyson's vehicle is more likely to rival Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla than the likes of Toyota or Volkswagen. It remains unclear where Dyson plans to build its electric car. About 300 workers are now based at Dyson's Hullavington facility The company, whose products cost as much as Â£500, came in for criticism in 2002 for its decision to move production of its vacuum cleaners from the UK to Malaysia at the cost of 560 jobs. Dyson, which made its 100 millionth machine last year, posted a 40% rise in turnover to Â£3.5bn as sales soared in Asia, whileprofits jumped by a third to a record Â£801m. It has more than 12,000 staff, including 4,500 engineers and scientists, with 4,800 employees in the UK. The company is based close to Hullavington at Malmesbury, where it has set up atraining institute for technology and engineering students. The R&D site was originally an RAF training station, first opened in 1937, and it played a significant part during World War II as a flight school and base for about 1,000 aircraft.

Prince Harry sings king's Hamilton line,"This video can not be played Prince Harry gets up with Hamilton cast The Duke of Sussex briefly burst into song at a charity performance of the hit musical Hamilton on Wednesday. Taking to the stage to thank the cast and crew, he sang a line from You'll Be Back - assuming the role of King George III, his sixth great-grandfather. But he cut the song after singing ""You say..."", telling the audience: ""That's definitely not going to happen"". Gesturing to the show's creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, Prince Harry added: ""He did try, but I said 'no'."" The duke was accompanied by his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, at the musical, which raised Â£300,000 for Sentebale, the HIV charity he co-founded in 2006. He thanked the audience for helping to ""raise a huge amount of money to change the lives of thousands of children in Botswana and Lesotho and through that work that we're going to be doing now, we will be able to stop the generational... hand-down of the stigma of HIV"". The royal couple posed with the cast and crew after the performance Hamilton tells the story of US founding father Alexander Hamilton, and features King George III in a scene-stealing comic role - peacocking around the stage as he expresses disbelief and frustration at America's battle for independence. Michael Jibson, who plays the role in the London production, was standing next to Prince Harry when he launched into his signature song, You'll Be Back. Posting a clip of the performance on Twitter, he joked: ""The moment I was upstaged"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Miranda told the audience how he had written King George's role during his honeymoon, adding: ""Smash cut to 2018 I'm sitting next to his sixth-great grandson"". He later told reporters ""you don't often get a direct descendent"" to watch a show set in the 18th Century. The duke and duchess of Sussex previously saw Hamilton earlier this year - while Meghan also watched the original Broadway production accompanied by actress Priyanka Chopra in 2016. On Wednesday, the newlyweds sat among the audience in the royal circle at London's Victoria Palace Theatre, and went onstage to share their appreciation with the cast after the show ended. Meghan told actors the energy on the night was ""palpable"", adding: ""It was so engaging, every moment of it."" Prince Harry said: ""That was absolutely incredible.""

Schools face 'severe' teacher shortage,"There are particular shortages of science teachers England's schools are facing a ""severe shortage"" of teachers, with bigger class sizes and more subjects taught by staff without a relevant degree, says the Education Policy Institute (EPI). The independent think tank says that as schools prepare to return after the summer break, the problems of teacher recruitment remain unresolved. The think tank says targeted pay increases could reduce shortages. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has made staff recruitment a top priority. Former education minister, David Laws, now chairman of the EPI, says the ""government faces a significant challenge to recruit enough teachers - particularly in subjects such as maths and sciences"". ""It must already be a concern that as little as half of GCSE maths teachers have a maths or sciences degree. This video can not be played I missed ""walking away from a days work and feeling like I'd made a difference"" says Eddie Willow a returning teacher tells Radio 4's World at One ""Of particular concern is the unequal access to subject-qualified teachers for more disadvantaged schools outside London,"" said Mr Laws. A report from the think tank warns that a lack of staff has already meant a worsening teacher-pupil ratio, rising from 15.5 pupils per teacher in 2010 to 17 in 2018. This year's pay deal saw some teachers getting a 3.5% increase There are particular problems for getting specialist teachers for maths and science, which the study says reflects the difficulty in recruiting graduates who could get better paid jobs in other careers. The report highlights the wealth gap in access to well-qualified staff, particularly outside the capital. In poorer areas outside London, 17% of physics teachers have a relevant degree - compared with 52% in affluent areas in the rest of the country. There are particular geographical cold spots, where schools are rated as least likely to have teachers in shortage subjects with a relevant degree: Portsmouth Hampshire Newham Barnsley Doncaster London and the south-east of England, and Bath, north-east Somerset, Rochdale and Darlington are among the areas with the highest levels of teachers with a degree in their specialist subject. Recruitment targets for teaching have been missed for five successive years - and the report calls for cash incentives to make teaching more attractive. It calls for ""salary supplements"" in subjects with shortages and says extra pay should be considered for areas which are ""hard to staff"". Report author Luke Sibieta said: ""There is strong evidence that these pressures can be alleviated by targeted salary supplements. ""Policy-makers have begun to consider this potential solution, yet so far proposals have been far too modest, and exclude many of the areas most in need. ""The government should therefore roll out a more ambitious scheme which offers incentives to teachers in a greater number of shortage subjects, covering more areas."" But Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, rejected the call for higher pay in some shortage subjects, saying ""it would mean other teachers were paid less than their colleagues, despite having similarly demanding workloads"". Instead Mr Barton said that thepay rise of 3.5% given to some school staffshould be given to all teachers. Recruitment targets for teaching have been missed for five years in a row Nansi Ellis, of the National Education Union, warned against ""sticking plaster"" responses and also rejected targeted pay incentives. She said that recruitment and retention were being damaged by the ""workload in schools and the punishing pressures of accountability"". John Blake of Now Teach, which encourages career changers to enter teaching, says ""some of this shortfall can be addressed through tapping into the many experienced professionals who are looking to embark on a career in teaching"". He said there were thousands of people over the age of 40 who could bring ""detailed knowledge of the subject matter"" as well as ""many years of professional experience"". Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said the government had to take the blame for the lack of teachers. ""Slashing"" teachers' pay meant that ""fewer people are training to join the profession, and teachers are leaving our schools in record numbers"", she said. Earlier this year, Education Secretary Damian Hinds told school leaders that tackling recruitment problems was a priority. He promised to cut teachers' workload to help make teaching a more attractive careerand to remove unnecessary bureaucracy or excessive accountability. The increase in teachers' pay - of up to 3.5% - received a mixed welcome. It was the biggest rise of recent years, but the Institute for Fiscal studies showed that 60% of staff would be getting below inflation pay settlements. ""The education secretary has been clear that there are no great schools without great teachers and his top priority is to make sure teaching remains an attractive and fulfilling profession,"" said a Department for Education spokeswoman. ""There are still more than 450,000 teachers in our classrooms - 11,900 more than in 2010 - and increasing numbers are returning to the profession. ""We recently announced a fully-funded pay rise for classroom teachers and we are working with school leaders and unions on a strategy to drive recruitment and boost retention of teachers and strip away unnecessary workload.""

Allardyce report 'in public interest',"Sam Allardyce won his only match as England manager, a 1-0 victory in Slovakia on 4 September 2016 An undercover investigation that led to Sam Allardyce's exit as England manager after 67 days was justified in the public interest, a report has found. Allardyceleft the England jobin 2016 after the Daily Telegraph said he told reporters posing as businessmen how to ""get around"" player transfer rules. The 63-year-old lodged 25 complaints about the story with the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso). Ipso found in the paper's favour on 22 of those points. Allardyce said that the level of subterfuge employed by the newspaper in its 'Football for Sale' investigation had been unjustified and that it had published its findings in an inaccurate and misleading way. The former West Ham, Blackburn and Everton manager also claimed that the Football Associationwas too hasty in deciding he had breached his contractand that ""entrapment won"". In a statement on Wednesday night, Allardyce said: ""Had the FA stuck to their word and waited to see the Telegraph's evidence (as they originally told me they would) they would have seen the allegations made against me were false. ""It was of course the allegations about third-party ownership (TPO) that the FA stated were the reasons for my leaving."" In response to the Ipso findings, the FA said it was not involved with the report, but added the ""position on Sam Allardyce has not changed. He apologised for his behaviour at the time and we reached a mutual agreement which both parties were happy with."" Ipso's complaints committee found that the Telegraph's coverage was ""generally accurate"" but that the paper had breached the Editors' Code on three specific points. Allardyce was being filmed as part ofa 10-month Telegraph investigation,externalthat separately unearthed evidence of bribery and corruption in British football. Of the three complaints upheld by Ipso, one related to a suggestion Allardyce had implied third parties could benefit from transfer fees, which was not true, and two wrongly implied Allardyce had offered to tell the Telegraph's reporters how to break ownership rules. The Telegraph published a correction on Thursday. However, Ipso ruled that the Telegraph's use of subterfuge was justified. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor Both sides in this dispute will hail this as a victory. The Daily Telegraph will see this ruling as a qualified vindication of its journalism, with its use of subterfuge and secret filming crucially backed by Ipso. Its complaints committee found the coverage was generally accurate, and the investigation was justified in the public interest. Ipso rejected the vast majority of the complaints against the newspaper. However, the fact that key inaccuracies in the paper's reporting have been identified, with Ipso concluding that the proposal set out by Sam Allardyce ""would not have resulted in the rules being broken"", means the former England manager can also claim to have won. Significantly, this could also have an impact on his threat of possible legal action for damages against the Football Association. In 2017, it was revealed that Allardyce was considering suing the governing body for the way it handled the fallout from his sacking as England manager in 2016. He has always maintained the FA was too hasty in deciding he had breached his Â£3m per year contract, and panicked in case subsequent articles by the newspaper further implicated him. That fear was unfounded however, and this ruling could strengthen Allardyce's resolve, and improve his chances of success if he decides to press ahead with legal action. In September 2016, Allardyce was filmed telling undercover reporters it was ""not a problem"" to bypass rules on third-party player ownership and claimed he knew of agents who were ""doing it all the time"". Third-party ownership - when someone other than the buying and selling club owns a stake in a player, typically an investor - has been banned by the Football Association and world football's governing body Fifa. It is a practice that has been described as a form of ""slavery"" by Michel Platini, the former president of European football's governing body Uefa. The Telegraph investigation claimed that a Â£400,000 deal was struck for Allardyce to represent the Far East organisation for which the reporters claimed to work, and to be a keynote speaker at events. Allardyce, though, stressed to the reporters he would first have to ""run that by"" his employers, the FA. Allardyce also made fun of predecessor Roy Hodgson's speech by referring to him as ""Woy"", as well as criticising Gary Neville, one of Hodgson's assistants, and making comments about FA president Prince William. He described another member of the Royal Family, Prince Harry, as a ""naughty boy"". The complaint made by Allardyce - along with Shane Moloney, described by the Telegraph as Allardyce's financial adviser, and his agent Mark Curtis - related to 15 articles published over six days, including news reports and comment pieces, which formed part of the newspaper's 10-month 'Football for Sale' campaign, which it described as an investigation into ""corruption in English football"". The complainants denied any prior wrongdoing which could have justified the subterfuge and said the publication of ""serious and false claims"" had grave consequences. However, the Daily Telegraph said the level of subterfuge - which included hidden cameras and microphones, and its reporters posing as businessmen from a fictitious company - had been essential to its investigation and that its actions were warranted and proportionate. The paper said that, in spring 2015, an individual, who the newspaper had considered to be a credible and reliable source, had made a number of serious allegations against football managers, including Allardyce, and these allegations were later repeated by other sources, justifying further investigation. In a statement, Allardyce said: ""I will consider my position in this regard with my lawyers but I hope Martin Glenn [FA chief executive] and Greg Clarke [FA chairman] reflect on the lack of leadership they showed - not for the first time or I expect the last."" ""Following a complaint made in November 2016 Ipso has now found (and stated that the Telegraph should make clear) that I did not suggest a model by which a third party could benefit from sharing in a player's transfer fees; did not brief reporters on breaking the rules; and did not enter negotiations to provide guidance on how to get around rules on TPO. ""Ipso also found that the articles made no accusation of corruption against me, and the Telegraph confirmed it made no such allegation."" This video can not be played Sam Allardyce: 67 days in 67 seconds ""On the major issues raised by Mr Allardyce, Ipso found for the Telegraph. It upheld our right to use subterfuge and secret filming, since there was a strong public interest in investigating and it was reasonable for the Telegraph to have believed that it could only obtain material evidence through subterfuge. ""Additionally, Ipso found that while it could not be demonstrated that Mr Allardyce had broken any Football Association rules, he appeared to show disregard for them and had spoken disrespectfully about them to people he had only just met. Further, although any intention of achieving any improper benefit was denied, he had explained a model that could reasonably be understood to result in a third party benefiting from a player's transfer from one team to another. ""Save for three inaccuracies, two of which were contained in two comment articles, Ipso found that the coverage of the investigation was not in breach of clause one of the code. The correction it has required the Telegraph to publish appears in our usual 'Corrections and Clarifications' spot today [Thursday].""

Panasonic to move Europe HQ out of UKThe Japanese electronics giant says the move to Amsterdam aims to avoid potential tax issues after Brexit.Business,"Panasonic will move its European headquarters from the UK to Amsterdam in October as Brexit approaches. The aim is to avoid potential tax issues linked to the UK's decision to leave the EU, said Panasonic Europe's chief executive Laurent Abadie. In the run-up to March 2019, a number of multinational firms have said they plan to move jobs out of the UK. Several Japanese financial companies have said they intend to move their main EU bases away from London. Panasonic's decision was driven by a fear that Japan could start considering the UK a tax haven if it cuts corporate tax rates to attract business, Mr Abadie told the Nikkei Asian Review newspaper. If Panasonic ends up paying less tax in the UK, that could render it liable for a bigger tax bill in Japan. Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles At-a-glance: the UK's four Brexit options Mr Abadie told the Nikkei Asian Review that Panasonic had been considering the move for 15 months, because of Brexit-related concerns such as access to free flow of goods and people. Panasonic Europe later issued a statement confirming that it was transferring its regional headquarters from Bracknell in the UK to Amsterdam from 1 October. It said it was doing so for several reasons, including ""improved efficiency and cost competitiveness"". It said ""fewer than approximately 10"" people would be affected out of a staff of 30. ""No Panasonic UK business operations will be affected by the EU headquarters move,"" the statement added. In 2016,the UK government pledged to cut corporation taxto encourage businesses to continue investing in the UK after the Brexit referendum. Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016, but with less than a year to go,the UK and the EU are struggling to reach consensuson the terms of the exit. Japan is a major investor in the UK, where more than 800 Japanese companies employ more than 100,000 people. However, financial firms including Nomura, Sumitomo Mitsui and Daiwa have already said they will no longer maintain their EU headquarters in London.

"Trump blames China for N Korea dilemmasIn a series of tweets, Mr Trump also said the US should not spend on war games with South Korea.Asia","'It's all China's fault' says Mr Trump US President Donald Trump has lashed out at China for undermining its work with North Korea, as criticism over progress on denuclearisation mounts. In a series of tweets he also said he saw no reason to resume the joint war games with South Korea that have angered North Korea. Days ago his own defence secretary said military exercises might continue. China has accused Mr Trump of ""shifting blame"" in his comments on its relations with North Korea. A summit between Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in June ended with a pledge from the North to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"".  Soon after Mr Trump announced there was ""no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea"". But since then many observers say North Korea is not moving fast enough to dismantle its nuclear or rocket sites. What are the US-South Korea war games? Mr Trump's tweets appear to place the blame for these challenges squarely on China, but he also goes on to praise his personal ties with the leaders of both North Korea and China. The confusing blend of criticism, praise and veiled threat comes as Washington faces mounting pressure to deliver results following those unprecedented talks. Problem solved - according to Mr Trump after his June summit with Kim Jong-un N Korea 'making missiles' despite US thaw Tears and joy as Korean families reunite Just days ago,Washington called off a trip to North Korea by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeowith the president arguing that insufficient progress had been made in dismantling the North's nuclear programme. In his latest comments on Twitter, Mr Trump says North Korea was ""under tremendous pressure from China because of our major trade disputes with the Chinese government"". Beijing is Pyongyang's only significant ally and is thought to have significant influence over its decisions. Beijing is also Washington's most powerful long-term strategic rival in the region. The US and China are locked in an increasingly tense trade battle and each side has imposed tariffs on one another's goods. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump has complained about the size of the US trade deficit with China and what Washington sees as other unfair trade practices. Despite his strong words, Mr Trump's latest tweet concluded with some optimism, saying the trade issue could be resolved by himself and China's ""great President Xi Jinping"". China has attacked Mr Trump's remarks as ""irresponsible"" and difficult to understand. ""To solve the problem, it should look at itself instead of shifting blame,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. China to respond 'resolutely' to US tariffs US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Why the US-China trade dispute has experts worried Since the June summit, North Korea has halted its missile tests, claimed to have dismantled a nuclear testing site and returned remains that are believed to be of US soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean War. ButMr Trump has called out Pyongyang for what he said was insufficient progresson their broad agreement on denuclearisation. A recent report by Vox suggests thatPyongyang is reluctant to proceed,externalbecause Mr Trump failed to live up to his alleged promise to Mr Kim that he would sign an official declaration to end the Korean War. Aftera UN report found that North Korea was continuing to work on its nuclear programme, the US urged the international community to maintain sanctions and economic pressure on Pyongyang. North Korea carried out a series of long-range missile tests in 2017 In his latest series of tweets, Mr Trump accused Beijing of providing North Korea with ""considerable aid"", suggesting China was softening the blow of sanctions. ""This is not helpful!"" Mr Trump said. The joint military exercises between Washington and Seoul have long angered Pyongyang. Following the summit in June, Mr Trump made what has widely been seen as a concession to Kim Jong-un and agreed to cancel the drills. In his latest tweets, US president insisted his personal relationship with Mr Kim remained ""a very good and warm one"" and that there was no reason to restart the ""war games"" with the South. But he added that if they did restart, the exercises would be ""bigger than ever"". US and South Korean troops practice a beach landing Mr Trump's tweets appear to contradict his defence secretary, who on Tuesday said the suspension of several joint exercises was a ""good faith measure"" and that ""we have no plans to suspend any more.""

Wonga: Where have all the borrowers gone?,"Katie was a student with a small maintenance loan, an occasional job, and a growing uneasiness about her finances. She went to a series of payday lenders - including the biggest, Wonga - to help her make ends meet. Instead, the high cost of this short-term credit just made matters worse. With little ability to repay and multiple loans, she should never have been considered for credit. She is now seeking compensation for the loans that crippled her. In turn, such claims are crippling the finances of Wonga and other players in the payday industry. Wonga is on the brink, saying it is considering ""all options"", seeking further investment as administrators stand poised if it goes under. But what of the millions of people who have turned to Wonga and similar lenders for a quick cash fix? Are they still borrowing and, if so, from whom? Wonga's adverts featuring puppets were controversial and eventually cut Wonga never considered itself to be a payday lender, preferring instead to describe itself as a maverick technology company that happened to sell loans. Its technology was groundbreaking, allowing the smartphone generation to choose how much they wanted to borrow with the slide of a thumb. That convenience, matched with a huge advertising campaign featuring amusing puppets and upbeat voiceovers, proved a hit. At the height of its success in 2013, Wonga had a million customers. But Mick McAteer, founder of the not-for-profit Financial Inclusion Centre, said this demand was a bubble: ""They were flogging [credit] and they created demand for it."" In other words, some borrowers simply did not need to borrow from a payday lender, but were attracted towards these high-cost, short-term loans anyway. Young and in the red: Personal debt in five charts What's gone wrong with Wonga? When should you start to worry about your debts? Then, according to the current management, Wonga ""lost its way"", one industry insider said its history became ""toxic"" and regulators stepped in to cut off the credit pipeline. Scandals, including letters from fake legal firms when chasing debts, and advancing a host of unsuitable loans, hit the Wonga brand and its popularity. Customer numbers fell from one million to 575,000. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), ruled that from January 2015 customers must face stricter affordability checks, set a price cap that slashed the typical interest rate, and said nobody should ever have to repay more than twice the amount borrowed. They also required every lender to go through an authorisation process. Mr McAteer said the effect was to restore a healthy balance in the credit market. ""The emphasis now is that the customer looks for credit, rather than the other way around,"" he said. Wonga adverts showed the type of people it hoped to attract as customers Wonga's management changed, it made a loss, and it attempted a reinvention. Out went the puppets, and in came TV adverts featuring ""hard-working dinner ladies and mums"". In 2015, its typical customer was male and aged between 20 and 35, but it suggested there was a broader market. It published an unusual estimate, claiming that its research suggested around 13 million people in the UK were ""cash and credit-constrained"" and under-served by mainstream financial services. Some people were starting to get a bit of a pay rise after years of squeezed wages, and employment levels continued to improve - allowing some to avoid any need to turn to short-term loans. Some managed to save enough for the rainy day fund. Credit card transfer deals were becoming increasingly attractive, allowing people to park debt for months or even years. Low interest rates meant borrowing from the mainstream financial institutions on the High Street was comparatively cheap. Many still fell into unauthorised overdrafts. Following the FCA crackdown, many payday lenders decided to leave the market and some collapsed. Those that remained shifted the focus of their products. Wonga moved to longer term, more flexible loans. According to its latest figures, customer numbers dropped to 220,000 by September 2017. But what about those ""credit-constrained customers"" - people who may have defaulted on loans, overdrafts and credit cards in the past, or have moved into the country with no credit history and so struggle to secure more credit from banks or building societies? Regulators have laid the pitch for not-for-profit credit unions to deliver to this group of people - but they do not have the capacity to serve them all. There is little evidence of a rise in the use of illegal loan sharks, although the FCA said some families desperate for money are beingtargeted by money lendershanding out cards at the school gates and outside food banks. For the majority, as hinted by the FCA's own research, loans are being provided closer to home. The regulator'sFinancial Lives,externalsurvey revealed that 3.6 million people (7% of UK adults) are borrowing from friends and family, or had done so in the previous 12 months. The highest proportion were aged 25 to 34, and more of them were women than men. That is more than the 3.1 million (6% of UK adults) who took out high-cost credit. Some people are going still going to short-term lenders, some with their family acting as guarantors. Debt charities say payday lenders remain an option, but are usually not the best option. All the while, they cannot shake the shadow of the past. They are facing a swarm of legacy complaints that cost time and money. Wonga was forced to seek a bailout from its backers this month amid a surge in claims. One senior industry source said that claims management companies had become a major problem for payday lenders after they shifted their focus from PPI. Some say many of these claims are vexatious, but lead to a complaint-handling fee anyway. Others feel a sense of injustice that the regulator allowed retrospective claims when loans had been transparent. Nick Baxter, from trade body the Professional Financial Claims Association, said it was ""a bit rich"" for payday lenders to blame claims companies for being ""the check and balance in the system"". One thing is for sure: rich is not a word many payday loan customers would use then - or now.

Trump blames China for N Korea dilemmas,"'It's all China's fault' says Mr Trump US President Donald Trump has lashed out at China for undermining its work with North Korea, as criticism over progress on denuclearisation mounts. In a series of tweets he also said he saw no reason to resume the joint war games with South Korea that have angered North Korea. Days ago his own defence secretary said military exercises might continue. China has accused Mr Trump of ""shifting blame"" in his comments on its relations with North Korea. A summit between Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in June ended with a pledge from the North to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"".  Soon after Mr Trump announced there was ""no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea"". But since then many observers say North Korea is not moving fast enough to dismantle its nuclear or rocket sites. What are the US-South Korea war games? Mr Trump's tweets appear to place the blame for these challenges squarely on China, but he also goes on to praise his personal ties with the leaders of both North Korea and China. The confusing blend of criticism, praise and veiled threat comes as Washington faces mounting pressure to deliver results following those unprecedented talks. Problem solved - according to Mr Trump after his June summit with Kim Jong-un N Korea 'making missiles' despite US thaw Tears and joy as Korean families reunite Just days ago,Washington called off a trip to North Korea by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeowith the president arguing that insufficient progress had been made in dismantling the North's nuclear programme. In his latest comments on Twitter, Mr Trump says North Korea was ""under tremendous pressure from China because of our major trade disputes with the Chinese government"". Beijing is Pyongyang's only significant ally and is thought to have significant influence over its decisions. Beijing is also Washington's most powerful long-term strategic rival in the region. The US and China are locked in an increasingly tense trade battle and each side has imposed tariffs on one another's goods. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump has complained about the size of the US trade deficit with China and what Washington sees as other unfair trade practices. Despite his strong words, Mr Trump's latest tweet concluded with some optimism, saying the trade issue could be resolved by himself and China's ""great President Xi Jinping"". China has attacked Mr Trump's remarks as ""irresponsible"" and difficult to understand. ""To solve the problem, it should look at itself instead of shifting blame,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. China to respond 'resolutely' to US tariffs US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Why the US-China trade dispute has experts worried Since the June summit, North Korea has halted its missile tests, claimed to have dismantled a nuclear testing site and returned remains that are believed to be of US soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean War. ButMr Trump has called out Pyongyang for what he said was insufficient progresson their broad agreement on denuclearisation. A recent report by Vox suggests thatPyongyang is reluctant to proceed,externalbecause Mr Trump failed to live up to his alleged promise to Mr Kim that he would sign an official declaration to end the Korean War. Aftera UN report found that North Korea was continuing to work on its nuclear programme, the US urged the international community to maintain sanctions and economic pressure on Pyongyang. North Korea carried out a series of long-range missile tests in 2017 In his latest series of tweets, Mr Trump accused Beijing of providing North Korea with ""considerable aid"", suggesting China was softening the blow of sanctions. ""This is not helpful!"" Mr Trump said. The joint military exercises between Washington and Seoul have long angered Pyongyang. Following the summit in June, Mr Trump made what has widely been seen as a concession to Kim Jong-un and agreed to cancel the drills. In his latest tweets, US president insisted his personal relationship with Mr Kim remained ""a very good and warm one"" and that there was no reason to restart the ""war games"" with the South. But he added that if they did restart, the exercises would be ""bigger than ever"". US and South Korean troops practice a beach landing Mr Trump's tweets appear to contradict his defence secretary, who on Tuesday said the suspension of several joint exercises was a ""good faith measure"" and that ""we have no plans to suspend any more."" Since the end of the Korean war, when Washington fought alongside Seoul against the North, the US has had troops stationed in South Korea. About 29,000 US soldiers are based in the South, under a security agreement reached after the war ended in 1953. Trump calls off Pompeo's North Korea trip What are the US-South Korea war games?

UK and Kenya to step up paedophilia fight,"Theresa May arrives at the State House to meet Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta Theresa May has announced a tie-up with the Kenyan authorities to help track down British paedophiles as she concludes her tour of Africa. The UK is to build a cyber centre in Nairobi to help Kenyan police stop child abuse images being shared online. It will also assist efforts to identify potential victims and access data from tech firms to catch offenders. Mrs May is the first British prime minister since Margaret Thatcher in 1988 to visit the country. She is meeting president Uhuru Kenyatta and seeing British soldiers who are training troops from Kenya and other African countries fightingIslamist militant group al-Shababin Somalia. At a joint press conference, the prime minister announced a wide-ranging new security pact between the two countries, including funding for enhanced airport security in the former British colony. May's mission to woo Africa after Brexit Who are al-Shabab? UK to step up military help to Nigeria PM seeks new jobs partnership with Africa The UK also offered support to Kenyan police in dealing with violence against girls and women, plus legal expertise on pursuing complex terror and organised crime cases. The cyber centre project,externalis linked to Kenya's existing anti-human trafficking and child protection unit, which was set up in 2016 with input from the UK's National Crime Agency. Mrs May held talks with the Kenyan president Uhura Kenyatta This unit has helped protect around 499 children since March 2016 and helped secure convictions of British paedophiles who have sexually abused children in Kenya. ""Online child exploitation is an abhorrent crime and we are determined to ensure there is no place to hide for predators who use the internet to share images of abuse across borders, too often with impunity,"" Mrs May said ahead of her arrival in the Kenyan capital. The prime minister is on the final leg of a three-country tour, which has seen her visit South Africa and Nigeria in an effort to maximise trade opportunities after the UK leaves the EU next year.

Mr May stressed that the UK was ""committed to a smooth transition that ensures continuing in our trading relationship with Kenya"" and that ""duty-free, quota-free"" access to British markets would continue. ""We are pursuing, of course, a good deal for trade with the EU once we have left the EU. But we will be looking to enhance our trade relationships around the rest of the world as well."" She also pledged that any assets acquired from corruption in Kenya and hidden in the UK, would be sent back: ""Today we signed an agreement to ensure that any proceeds of corruption that end up in the UK will be given back to the people of Kenya."" Shehas announced Â£4bnof extra financial support for African economies, linked to a refocusing of the UK's aid spending,while promising support to Nigeriato confront violent Islamist extremism and human trafficking. She also said she wanted the UK to overtake the US to become the G7's biggest investor in Africa by 2022 andstruck Britain's first post-Brexit trade pact,externalwith Mozambique and the Southern African Customs Union. Mrs May's trip finishes on Thursday with a state dinner hosted by Mr Kenyatta. He has told the BBC's Hardtalk programme that all public servants, including himself, will be audited to show the origin of their wealth. This video can not be played WATCH: Kenyatta wants legacy to be fight against corruption By BBC Africa business editor Larry Madowo Kenya re-exports some of its products to the EU through the UK and there are concerns that a hard Brexit might jeopardise that. Kenya's trade split between the UK and the rest of the EU ""is almost 50-50 and the country will have to strike a good deal with both the UK and the EU because it depends on both markets to sell its tea, fresh produce and other agricultural products,"" says economist Tony Watima. Kenya supplies more roses to the European Union than any other country and is the world's third largest exporter of cut flowers. The country sends 17% of its flowers sold in the EU to the UK. With 500,000 people supported by the flower industry, according to the Kenya Flower Council, every market is critical. But with direct flights from Nairobi to New York beginning in October, the country may be looking to tap into the larger US market for its goods.

Suu Kyi 'should have resigned' on RohingyaThe UN human rights chief criticised Myanmar's leader for the army's actions against Rohingya Muslims.Asia,"The Rohingya are one of many ethnic minorities in Myanmar The outgoing UN human rights chief says Myanmar's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi should have resigned over the military's violent campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority last year. Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein told the BBC the Nobel Peace prize winner should have considered returning to house arrest rather than excusing the military. A new UN report says Myanmar's military should be investigated for genocide. Myanmar has rejected the report as one-sided. The army of the Buddhist-majority nation - which has been accused of systematic ethnic cleansing - haspreviously cleared itself of wrongdoing. The UN report, published on Monday, blamed Ms Suu Kyi, a long-term leader of the pro-democracy movement, for failing to prevent the violence. Will we ever see Myanmar's military leaders in the dock? What is genocide and why is the term so rarely used? Seeing through the official story in Myanmar ""She was in a position to do something,"" Mr Hussein said in an interview with the BBC's Imogen Foulkes. ""She could have stayed quiet - or even better, she could have resigned."" ""There was no need for her to be the spokesperson of the Burmese military. She didn't have to say this was an iceberg of misinformation. These were fabrications,"" he said. Ms Suu Ky, seen here in 2015, with Myanmar's commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing ""She could have said look, you know, I am prepared to be the nominal leader of the country but not under these conditions. ""Thank you very much, I will resign, I will go back into house arrest - I cannot be an adjunct accessory that others may think I am when it comes to these violations."" Between 1989 and 2010, Ms Suu Kyi, 73, spent about 16 years under house arrest by the military government. On Wednesday, the Nobel committee said Ms Suu Kyi could not be stripped of the Peace Prize she was awarded in 1991. While it is acknowledged that Ms Suu Kyi does not control the military,she has faced international pressure to condemn the army's alleged brutality. For decades, she was hailed as the heroine of the human rights community - most notably for enduring house arrest for her pro-democracy activism during a brutal military dictatorship. When communal violence broke out in 2012 and displaced more than 100,000 Rohingya people, Ms Suu Kyi sought to reassure the international community and pledged to ""abide by our commitment to human rights and democratic values"". Aung San Suu Kyi: Then and now What you need to know about the Rohingya crisis How Suu Kyi sees the Rohingya crisis ""Muslims have been targeted but Buddhists have also been subjected to violence,"" she told the BBC at the time. ""This fear is what is leading all the trouble."" She said that it was down to the government to bring an end to the violence, explaining: ""This is the result of our suffering under a dictatorial regime."" This video can not be played What has Aung San Suu Kyi said about Rohingya Muslims? In 2015, her National League for Democracy party won a landslide election victory and she became Myanmar's de-facto leader. As the Rohingya crisis continued, Ms Suu Kyi's comments on the situation tended to play it down or suggest that people were exaggerating the severity of the violence. The last time she spoke to the BBC in April 2017, she said: ""I don't think there is ethnic cleansing going on. I think ethnic cleansing is too strong an expression to use for what is happening."" Profile: Aung San Suu Kyi Could Aung San Suu Kyi face Rohingya genocide charges? The Rohingya crisis: Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Since an outbreak of violence started in August 2017, Ms Suu Kyi has missed several opportunities to speak publicly about the issue, including the UN General Assembly in New York last September. She later claimed the crisis was being distorted by a ""huge iceberg of misinformation"" - but then also said she felt ""deeply"" for the suffering of ""all people"" in the conflict. Myanmar, she said, was ""committed to a sustainable solution... for all communities in this state."" Imogen Foulkes, BBC Geneva correspondent Mr Zeid has been an outspoken critic of Ms Suu Kyi Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein is known for his bluntness and his comments on Aung San Suu Kyi were no exception. He bitterly criticised her attempts to excuse Myanmar's military. This week, UN investigators published evidence linking senior commanders to act of genocide. His harsh words are another indication that Aung San Suu Kyi may now go down in history not as a Nobel Peace prize winner and pro-democracy leader, but as a woman who failed to act in the face of unspeakable human rights violations. The Rohingya are a Muslim minority in Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship and considered illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh despite calling the Rakhine state home for generations.

"Force 'failing' to check on sex offendersMerseyside Police ""requires real improvement"" to meet its duty to keep children safe, says a report.","Merseyside Police has 98 overdue visits to registered sex offenders High-risk sex offenders are not checked on enough by Merseyside Police and their locations are often unknown by officers, the police watchdog says. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said the force's sex offender unit, which is also responsible for child protection, was ""seriously overstretched"". The inspection of its child protection highlighted ""particular concern"" with 98 overdue visits to sex offenders. The force says it is addressing issues. The HMICFRS inspection, held in April and May, cited ""heavy workloads and poor communication"" as the reasons why the force was struggling to manage the threat posed by high-risk sex offenders. There are 2,256 registered sex offenders living in the region 1,769 are being managed within the community Of those, 277 were graded as high risk and six as very high risk Figures by HMICFRS The watchdog found the ratio of registered sex offenders to each manager was approximately 100:1 - double what it considers reasonable - and created ""potential additional risk"". Inspector Matt Parr said managers in the unit were ""too often... playing catch-up and couldn't prioritise preventative work"". He added that neighbourhood policing teams were often ""unaware of sex offenders living in their communities"". ""This area requires real improvement before I can be confident Merseyside Police is meeting its duty to keep children safe,"" he said. Other concerns highlighted in the report included that performance measures are currently based on the number of child protection incidents and cases, rather than outcomes for victims. Although Mr Parr said there was ""still plenty of room for improvement"" he said other areas showed good practice. ""The force carries out investigations to a good standard and uses police protection powers appropriately to safeguard children. ""I am reassured by Merseyside Police's recent efforts to do more to make sure every child is safe from harm, and I look forward to seeing its next steps."" Merseyside Police - which has a workforce of more than 5,700 serving a population of 1.4 million - has six weeks to respond with an action plan on the 19 recommendations for improvements before another inspection within six months. Assistant Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said: ""Protecting children, especially those who are most vulnerable, is one of the most important things we do... and we are determined to improve."" She said a self-assessment carried out by the force before the inspection identified the majority of issues highlighted in the report and work to address these issues was already underway. ""We recognise the importance of managing sex offenders appropriately and continually review our policies, processes and training given to staff."" She said the number of sex offenders had doubled since 2009 and that despite a 25% decrease in the number of police officers since 2011, the force had not cut any posts from the sex offender unit to deal with increasing work demand.

The HMICFRS inspection, held in April and May, cited ""heavy workloads and poor communication"" as the reasons why the force was struggling to manage the threat posed by high-risk sex offenders. There are 2,256 registered sex offenders living in the region 1,769 are being managed within the community Of those, 277 were graded as high risk and six as very high risk Figures by HMICFRS The watchdog found the ratio of registered sex offenders to each manager was approximately 100:1 - double what it considers reasonable - and created ""potential additional risk"". Inspector Matt Parr said managers in the unit were ""too often... playing catch-up and couldn't prioritise preventative work"". He added that neighbourhood policing teams were often ""unaware of sex offenders living in their communities"". ""This area requires real improvement before I can be confident Merseyside Police is meeting its duty to keep children safe,"" he said. Other concerns highlighted in the report included that performance measures are currently based on the number of child protection incidents and cases, rather than outcomes for victims. Although Mr Parr said there was ""still plenty of room for improvement"" he said other areas showed good practice. ""The force carries out investigations to a good standard and uses police protection powers appropriately to safeguard children. ""I am reassured by Merseyside Police's recent efforts to do more to make sure every child is safe from harm, and I look forward to seeing its next steps."" Merseyside Police - which has a workforce of more than 5,700 serving a population of 1.4 million - has six weeks to respond with an action plan on the 19 recommendations for improvements before another inspection within six months. Assistant Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said: ""Protecting children, especially those who are most vulnerable, is one of the most important things we do... and we are determined to improve."" She said a self-assessment carried out by the force before the inspection identified the majority of issues highlighted in the report and work to address these issues was already underway. ""We recognise the importance of managing sex offenders appropriately and continually review our policies, processes and training given to staff."" She said the number of sex offenders had doubled since 2009 and that despite a 25% decrease in the number of police officers since 2011, the force had not cut any posts from the sex offender unit to deal with increasing work demand.

Murray beaten in US Open second round,"Andy Murray was playing on Arthur Ashe Stadium for the first time since his 2016 quarter-final defeat by Kei Nishikori 2018 US Open Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:27 August-9 SeptemberCoverage:Live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website Andy Murray's return to Grand Slam tennis ended in a four-set defeat by Spanish 31st seed Fernando Verdasco in the US Open second round. The former British number one, playing his first Slam in 14 months, lost 7-5 2-6 6-4 6-4 in New York. In sweltering conditions, Murray, 31, battled hard but did not have enough to overcome the 34-year-old Verdasco. Compatriot Cameron Norrie lost 6-2 2-6 6-4 6-4 to Serbia's Dusan Lajovic as British singles representation ended. It's normal to have doubts over my tennis future - Murray 'Liar, liar, pants on fire' - Murray responds after Verdasco denies coaching claim It was only Murray's fifth tournament back since having hip surgery in January. The Scot looked exhausted at times during a physical encounter on a humid Arthur Ashe Stadium - a combination of the conditions as temperatures rose close to 100F (38C) and his lack of five-set matches since being sidelined through injury. Murray's limp between points - a regular sight in recent years - seemed to become heavier as the match wore on. ""It wasn't the most comfortable I felt on a tennis court. I got through it and fought right to the end,"" he said. Murray continued to show the dogged determination that helped him win three Grand Slam titles at the peak of his powers, pushing Verdasco to the limit before succumbing to a third match point in three hours and 23 minutes. Despite defeat, Murray felt he played some of his best tennis since returning to the ATP Tour in June. ""There were periods in the match where I played some really good stuff,"" he said. ""But there were some where I didn't - especially in the first set - and that was costly for me."" Del Potro powers into third round Day four preview: former champions in action Murray, now ranked 382nd in the world and unseeded, had the fortune of avoiding a high-ranked opponent in the first round, battling back to beat 448th-ranked James Duckworth - the Australian also on the road to recovery after long-term injury - in three sets on Monday. That pitted him against two-time US Open quarter-finalist Verdasco, who Murray said he expected to test his movement - and the Spaniard did exactly that. The pair traded four break points in the opening seven games, Murray missing a set point at 5-4 when Verdasco rescued it with an ace out wide. That proved pivotal as Verdasco grabbed the momentum to break in the next game and hold out for the early advantage. ""I hit a lot of mistakes when I was up in that set. I feel like I should have won the first set and didn't,"" said Murray. Murray was undeterred, however, breaking for 3-1 in the second set as Verdasco's service game began to unravel. The pair exchanged breaks again as Murray moved 4-2 ahead before the Spaniard produced a double fault on set point to allow the former world number one to level. Verdasco upped his service game in the third set, landing 71% of his first serves to break twice and ensure the match would go to four sets at least. Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Both players disappeared off Ashe at the end of the third set after Verdasco took the 10-minute extreme heat break which was again implemented by US Open officials. When Murray returned to court, he complained Verdasco was talking to his team in the locker room - which is against the rules. ""When I came out of the shower, his coach and one of the Spanish doubles players was in there chatting to him, and you're not allowed to speak to your coach. I went and told the supervisor,"" Murray said. ""I'm not blaming Fernando and his team. They probably weren't aware that that was the rules. They certainly weren't trying to break any rules. ""It shouldn't be for the player that's competing against him to have to go to the supervisor."" However, Verdasco denied he was talking to his coach, saying he was only there to go to the toilet. ""I was in the ice bath with Marcos Baghdatis and his coach,"" Verdasco said. ""I don't want to say that Andy lied, but I didn't talk one word with my coach or any one member of my team. ""I know exactly the rule and I don't want to be the one breaking it."" Murray posted his reaction to Verdasco's comments on social media After the heat break, a composed Verdasco controlled the fourth set and headed towards victory after breaking for 4-3. That was until an 11-minute final game when the Spaniard combusted with a third-round match against Argentine third seedJuan Martin del Potroin sight. His previously reliable serve disappeared as he coughed up five break points, produced two double faults and hit some wild shots in a dramatic final game. Verdasco also furiously complained after being given a time violation before eventually ending Murray's resistance with a 104mph second serve - his fastest of the match - which forced Murray long on the third match point. ""At the end when my back was against the wall, I came up with some good tennis to make it close and interesting and almost got myself back into it,"" Murray said. ""But there were too many ups and downs for my liking."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller These three hours and 23 minutes reminded us exactly what we have been missing. Murray offered flair, heart and resilience, mixed in with a familiar dose of confrontation and a long-running one way 'conversation' with his coach Jamie Delgado. Even when seemingly running out of gas in the fourth set, he still managed to create five break back points in a final game which lasted over 12 minutes. Unsurprisingly, so soon in his comeback, Murray's unforced error count was higher than he would wish for. But in the early stages especially, he played as close to the baseline as possible, and significantly inside it when Verdasco lined up a second serve. It has been an encouraging US Open, but Murray knows there is still a long road ahead. Cameron Norrie beat Jordan Thompson in his opening match on Monday British number two Cameron Norrie's bid to reach the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time came to an end only moments after Murray's defeat. The 23-year-old world number 67, who has enjoyed a rapid rise up the rankings since turning professional in spring 2017, was not helped by his 58 unforced errors against Lajovic. His match mirrored Murray's as he fought back from a set down to take the second before failing to take his chances in the next two sets - managing to convert just three of his 14 break points in a match lasting almost three hours. Norrie was also penalised a first serve for returning late from the 10-minute heat break after the third set. The unhappy Briton told the umpire he had been assured by officials he had enough time. Defeat for Norrie and Murray means there are no Britons left in the men's or women's singles after Kyle Edmund, Johanna Konta and Heather Watson were knocked out in the first round. Meanwhile, in the men's doubles British brothers Ken and Neal Skupski were beaten 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-5) by Radu Albot and Malek Jaziri.

Drinks sold to under-16s despite ban,"Most major retailers have been banned from selling high-caffeine energy drinks to under-16s since March High-caffeine canned energy drinks are being sold in supermarkets despite a ban, a BBC investigation has found. Sales of the drinks to children under 16 have been voluntarilybanned by most major UK stores since March. A teaching union has warned they are having a detrimental effect on both the health and the attention span of pupils But the British Soft Drinks Association said there is no more caffeine in most energy drinks than in a small cup of coffee. The new code is voluntary but whenBBC Timelinetook a 15-year-old girl round eight supermarkets, half allowed her to buy an energy drink. Jane Peckham, national officer at the NASUWT teaching union, said: ""The ever-increasing consumption of caffeine through energy drinks is a concern for long-term health. ""More and more studies are showing that can lead to diabetes, hyperactivity and other such conditions. ""I think it is something that we all need to pay attention to."" Anecdotally, Ms Peckham said she has heard of pupils consuming up to seven energy drinks a day. And she said it is a problem in both primary and secondary schools. The union is calling for a total ban on energy drinks in schools. Ms Peckham added: ""Research has shown that children who consume high levels of energy drinks are much more likely to develop future negative behaviours. ""It can lead to use of tobacco, binge drinking, possibly drug use and the energy drink is the starting point for that."" The limitations concern drinks which contain more than 150mg of caffeine per litre. Jen Peckham warned energy drinks can cause health problems Timeline took Annie, 15, round eight supermarkets in Glasgow and Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire, with mixed results. In one Glasgow store, she went to a self-service check out where the canned drink was flagged as a restricted item. Annie told the programme a staff member approved the sale without asking her for identification. She repeated the process in another and when asked by a member of staff when her birthday was, Annie replied: ""May"". He did not ask her age or for proof of her age before approving the sale. In two stores in Newton Mearns, Annie was not asked for identification. Annie after buying an energy drink without being challenged over her age Timeline also spoke to teenagers who consume energy drinks. Lennon, 14, is a keen footballer, runner and cyclist and enjoys both flat and fizzy energy drinks. He said: ""The sports drinks give you a boost but the other ones make you kind of hyper. ""Sometimes, if I'm angry, I take them because it calms me down."" The teenager admitted he has been refused energy drinks in supermarkets and has then asked an adult to buy them. He added: ""If energy drinks were banned I would feel frustrated, angry, upset and I would kind of lose my temper. ""I would just hope that when I am older I would get them again so for the rest of my life I could be happy."" Lennon, 14, consumes sports and fizzy energy drinks Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine at Glasgow University, said children should not be consuming energy drinks. He added: ""They were originally developed for optimal sport performance in high-functioning athletes, to replenish sugars and salts. ""The problem is that the word 'energy' is misleading - kids thinks that they'll be full of vitality after drinking it - but very few children are high-performing athletes so they don't need this additional sugar, salt, and caffeine."" Prof Sattar believes the biggest problem with the drinks is the high sugar content, which can lead to childhood obesity. He said: ""Energy drinks have the same or more sugar than fizzy drinks. ""This kind of refined sugar - as most research agrees - is not nutritious and nourishing, it causes damage to teeth, it causes obesity, which of course leads to heart disease, diabetes and cancer. ""Sports and energy drinks will have salt in them too, and high salt intake is a big factor in high blood pressure in children."" He said the picture concerning caffeine is less clear-cut. Prof Sattar added: ""Some research has suggested that high levels of it are physically bad for you, but many cases seem to be anecdotal. ""Either way, drinking too much energy drink will certainly cause agitation in kids, and impact their ability to sleep. ""Sleep deprivation has knock-on effects including weight gain, adverse diet, emotional distress etc."" The British Soft Drinks Association said it has no safety concerns. A statement on its website on whether energy drinks can be consumed by children, said: ""Whilst caffeine and energy drinks have been deemed safe by health authorities around the world, it is recommended that children consume less caffeine from all sources due to their lower body weight. ""The latest European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report was regarding caffeine intake from all products and confirmed that caffeine intake from energy drinks is negligible in children and less than 11% in adolescents. ""EFSA also confirmed that the main contributors to daily caffeine intake in all age groups are tea, coffee, chocolate and other non-alcoholic beverages.""

Ex-SNP leader Salmond resigns from party,"Former SNP leader Alex Salmond has resigned from the party amid allegations of sexual misconduct. In a statement he said he wanted to avoid internal division within the SNP, which has faced calls to suspend him. He has denied any wrongdoing, and said he intended to apply to rejoin once he had an opportunity to clear his name. It emerged last week that two Scottish government staff members had lodged complaints in January about his behaviour when he was first minister. Resignation statement in full Alex Salmond profile Mr Salmond has described the allegations as ""patently ridiculous"" - and has also criticised the complaints procedure which he claims is ""unjust"". On Tuesday he formally began legal action against the Scottish government in the Court of Session over its handling of the misconduct allegations. In a statement released on social media, Mr Salmond said he had been a member of the SNP for 45 years, 20 of them as party leader and seven as first minister. He continued: ""I truly love the SNP and the wider independence movement in Scotland. They have been the defining commitment of my life. But today I have written to the National Secretary of the party resigning my membership."" Ms Sturgeon said Alex Salmond had been her ""friend and mentor"" for nearly 30 years Mr Salmond indicated that his resignation was to avoid potential divisions within the party, as his successor Nicola Sturgeon faced opposition calls to suspend his SNP membership. He stated:  ""I did not come into politics to facilitate opposition attacks on the SNP and, with Parliament returning next week, I have tendered my resignation to remove this line of opposition attack. ""Most of all, I am conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal division."" The current SNP leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she ""felt a huge sadness about the whole situation"". Ina statement on Twitter,,externalshe said the decision was Alex Salmond's alone, and she understood why he had chosen to separate ""the current questions he is facing from the day to day business of the SNP and the ongoing campaign for independence"". She continued: ""The hard fact remains that two complaints were received by the Scottish government that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet."" Salmond begins legal action against Scottish government Sturgeon: Salmond complaints 'could not be ignored' Salmond denies sexual misconduct claims The Daily Record newspaper broke the news of the sexual misconduct allegations last Thursday. The paper claims to have seen the wording of one complaint which describes an incident alleged to have taken place at the first minister's official residence in Edinburgh, Bute House, in the first week of December 2013. The two women lodged complaints in January this year, just weeks after the Scottish government adopted a new complaints procedure in the light of wider concern about sexual harassment at Holyrood and Westminster. Mr Salmond has hosted a show on the controversial RT station since last November Mr Salmond claims that the subsequent investigation into the allegations against him by senior Scottish government civil servants was ""unfair and unjust"". He said he had been given no opportunity to ""see and therefore to properly challenge the case against me"" and that he had ""not been allowed to see the evidence"". Mr Salmond has also claimed that someone within the Scottish government has ""flagrantly and repeatedly"" breached the confidential complaints process by leaking details to the Daily Record. He is now seeking a judicial review of the new complaints procedure and has launched a crowdfunding appeal to fund his legal action. Leader of Scottish National Party 1990-2000 and 2004-2014 First Minister of Scotland 2007 - 2014 Stood down after Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom The Scottish government has insisted the complaints process has been ""entirely confidential throughout"" and has said it will defend its position vigorously in the courts. The complaints against Mr Salmond have also been passed to Police Scotland which has said it is assessing the information. Mr Salmond was Scottish first minister and SNP leader until September 2014 when he resigned following the ""No"" vote in the Scottish independence referendum. He returned to frontline politics when he was elected as the SNP MP for Gordon in 2015 and became the party's foreign affairs spokesman at Westminster before losing the seat in the snap general election two years later. Since then he has faced heavy criticism for hosting the Alex Salmond Show on Russian broadcaster RT, which has been described as a propaganda channel for the Kremlin - a claim Mr Salmond has denied.

Resignation statement in full,"Mr Salmond said he intended to apply to rejoin the SNP once he had an opportunity to clear his name Alex Salmond, Scotland's former first minister and ex-SNP leader,has resignedfrom the party following sexual misconduct claims, which he denies. He announced he was quitting in a video posted on social media on Wednesday evening. Here is his statement in full: ""I have been a member of the Scottish National Party for 45 years, 20 of them as party leader and seven as First Minister of Scotland. ""I hope I have done the party and the broader cause of independence some service. ""Apart from a political spat back in the 1980s, that has been a period of continuous membership. I truly love the SNP and the wider independence movement in Scotland. ""They have been the defining commitment of my life. But today I have written to the National Secretary of the party resigning my membership. ""I read carefully Nicola Sturgeon's statement on Sunday and watched her television interview of a couple of days ago. She made it clear that the SNP have never received a single complaint about my personal conduct in my many decades of membership. ""And the Scottish Government have confirmed that they did not have any such complaint before this January, more than three years after I left office as first minister. ""That is the record of 30 years of public service. ""So let me be clear again. I refute these two complaints of harassment and I absolutely reject any suggestion of criminality. ""I believe that all such issues must be treated seriously, confidentially and through a fair process. In this case confidentiality has been broken greatly to my detriment and in a way which puts at serious risk the anonymity of both complainants. ""It urgently needs to be established who breached that duty of confidence and why. ""It seems obvious that Nicola feels under pressure from other political parties to suspend me from SNP membership, given recent party precedents. ""For my part I have always thought it a very poor idea to suspend any party member on the basis of complaints and allegations. Innocent until proven guilty is central to our concept of justice.

""Most of all I am conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal division. ""In my letter to the National Secretary I state that it is my absolute intention to reapply for SNP membership just as soon as I have had the opportunity to clear my name. I hope that is by the end of this year. ""In the meantime I would urge no one else to relinquish their SNP membership. ""My entire focus for the next few weeks is preparing for Judicial Review, against the Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government, the initial stages of which began yesterday. ""My intention is to secure fairness because that is necessary to clear my name. I am enormously grateful for the messages of support and encouragement I have received, including from people of other political persuasions. ""I can assure them all that I will keep on going. ""The costs of a Judicial Review in the highest court in the land are huge. Many have asked how they can help directly. Therefore I have established a crowd-funder to assist with costs. ""All sums received will contribute exclusively to progressing the Judicial Review and any money left over will be used to support good causes in Scotland and beyond. ""Finally, I will continue to serve the independence movement in whatever role and whatever capacity I can. ""It is a rare thing to be devoted to a cause more important than any individual, it is a precious thing to cherish it and my intention now - as it has always been -is to protect and sustain that cause.""

Salmond denies misconduct claims,"Mr Salmond was first minister of Scotland between 2007 and 2014 The former Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, has described sexual misconduct allegations against him as ""patently ridiculous"". The claims date back to December 2013, when Mr Salmond was still in office, according to theDaily Record.,external In a statement, he said he was taking the Scottish government to court to challenge the complaints procedure which had been activated against him. The Scottish government said it would ""defend its position vigorously"".

The headline from the statement is extraordinary enough - he is going to take the Scottish government to court, which given that he used to head that government is a remarkable development. But it's even more extraordinary when you consider the reasons why. Mr Salmond has decided to challenge the Scottish government's complaints procedure after two people, according to Mr Salmond, lodged complaints against him. He also says that he intends to give media interviews, perhaps as early as today. Responding to his statement, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""We can confirm that Alex Salmond has initiated legal proceedings against the Scottish government and as a result we are restricted in what we can say. ""However, the Scottish government will defend its position vigorously. As a matter of principle and integrity, it is vital that any allegations of harassment are treated seriously and investigated thoroughly, regardless of the identity of the party involved."" Mr Salmond was elected as the SNP MP for Gordon in 2015 before losing the seat in the snap general election two years later. He has faced heavy criticism for hosting the Alex Salmond Show on Russian broadcaster RT, which has been described as a propaganda channel for the Kremlin - a claim Mr Salmond has denied.

Emails commuting 'should count as work',"The spread of mobile internet has turned the commute into an extension of the working day Commuters are so regularly using travel time for work emails that their journeys should be counted as part of the working day, researchers say. Wider access to wi-fi on trains and the spread of mobile phones has extended the working day, a study from the University of the West of England says. The study examined 5,000 rail passengers on commuter routes into London as wi-fi became more available. ""I am a busy mum and I rely on that time,"" one commuter told researchers. ""It's really important to my sanity that I can get work done on the train,"" she said, on the Aylesbury to London route. The study, to be presented at the Royal Geographical Society on Thursday, found that 54% of commuters using the train's wi-fi were sending work emails. Others were using their own mobile phone connections for work emails. Those on the way to work were catching up with emails sent ahead of the coming day - while those on the return journey were finishing off work not completed during regular working hours. Is it damaging for a work-life balance if people are expected to answer emails before and after work? ""It's dead time in a way, so what it allows me to do is finish stuff and not work in the evenings,"" said a commuter on the London to Birmingham route. The study examined the impact of free wi-fi being upgraded on the London to Birmingham and London to Aylesbury routes. It showed that as internet access improved it had the effective consequence of extending working hours, using laptops and mobile phones. Is it OK to paint your nails on a train? Rail fares: Commuters 'pay fifth of salary' on season ticket Commuting by solar-powered river bus For commuting parents, it was also seen as a ""transition"", where they switched roles from being part of a family to a working environment. There were other commuters who liked the ""buffer"" of being able to work when travelling. ""The majority of the time it's an option for me to, you know, clear the decks for the day, relax and put work behind me more than anything else,"" said a passenger on the London to Birmingham route. But the findings raise questions about the work-life balance - and whether it is healthy to stretch out the working day with people routinely answering emails beyond office hours. If the journey has become part of work, should it also be recognised as part of working hours? Should people be expected to check work emails outside of work? Researcher Dr Juliet Jain said smartphones and mobile internet access had caused a ""blurring of boundaries"" between work and home life - and this now applied to the journey to work. ""How do we count that time? Do workplace cultures need to change?"" she asked. Instead of technology giving people more flexibility over working, the study showed that people were working extra hours on top of their time in the office. ""There's a real challenge in deciding what constitutes work,"" said Dr Jain, from the university's Centre for Transport and Society. Counting the journey as work could ""ease commuter pressure on peak hours"" travel, she said, allowing more staggered travel times. But Dr Jain said it would also mean that employers would want ""more surveillance and accountability"" for how commuters were spending that time before arriving at their desks. Business leaders recognised the difficulties of setting boundaries around such work emails and mobile technology - and warned it could damage productivity if work became too pervasive. ""This increasing flexibility has the potential to radically shift the work-life balance for the better - but it also leaves open the door to stress and lower productivity,"" said Jamie Kerr, of the Institute of Directors. ""With the concept of clocking on and clocking off no longer straightforward, defining where leisure begins and work ends will be vital for both employers and individuals, as well as a complex task for regulators."" Matthew Percival, the CBI's head of employment, said: ""A common-sense approach is needed, giving individuals the tools to manage their work-life balance."" Is it OK to paint your nails on a train?
