Online students would still face full tuition fees,"Universities have warned of financial collapse if some institutions cannot recruit enough students this year University students in England will still have to pay full tuition fees even if their courses are taught online in the autumn, the government has said. ""We don't believe students will be entitled to reimbursement if the quality is there,"" universities minister Michelle Donelan said. But the university sector's request for a Â£2bn bail-out has been rejected. Universities had warned of financial danger from a reduction in overseas students because of coronavirus. University campuses have been closed by the pandemic - and there is uncertainty for students whether there will be in-person teaching in the autumn or whether courses will be taught fully or partly online. The universities minister said no formal decision had been taken on the next academic year, but if courses are taught online and ""students are really getting the quality, and they're getting a course which is fit for purpose"", they would not get a discount on fees. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? ""Universities are still continuing with their overheads and their expenses during this time, and it's no fault of their own,"" she said. If students were not getting adequate teaching online, she said there were processes for them to complain. Jake, an accountancy student in Leeds, told the BBC that charging full fees for online courses was so unfair that it made him want to drop out. ""There has clearly been no consideration of students with this decision. I pay tuition fees to go to my university in person, to be taught at my university in person, to access the facilities of the university - libraries, societies, sports facilities - in person. ""Expecting students to pay full fees for a service that they aren't receiving is frankly insulting,"" he said. Rose, an international student from India studying in Manchester, said getting lessons online was not an adequate alternative - and regretted paying so much for her course. ""It's been a nightmare. First of all we had two strikes which lasted three to four weeks at a time and now this. ""I paid Â£19,000 for my course. We're not a rich family. That's all the money my family have. I feel so guilty for using it all up for this."" Isobel, another student in Manchester, contacted the BBC to say: ""There has been no talk about a refund for the lack of lectures. ""I am finding it difficult not being able to access libraries, and ask questions. Yes, I know you can email stuff to lecturers but they're swamped."" An unimpressed student, Livi, posted on Twitter: ""So by September I'll have lost almost Â£3,000 to rent a house I'm not even living in, and tuition fees will still be max even if it's online - something about this seems unfair."" Tom Kendall, a member of the UK Youth Parliament, said: ""If we have to stay home and complete online lectures what about the students who are less fortunate and don't have a laptop or access to wi-fi?"" As well as weighing up whether they want to study online, applicants will be waiting for information on how a reopened campus might function, in terms of social distancing, social activities and student accommodation. The National Union of Students has highlighted how difficult it can be for current students to study online, with some struggling with a lack of computer equipment and broadband access and not having enough space in which to work. What would a university experience be like with social distancing? A study from the Sutton Trust suggests some applicants are reconsidering their university plans, in a year group that has already seen exams cancelled and replaced by estimated grades. There is a ""huge degree of worry and uncertainty,"" says trust founder, Sir Peter Lampl. There are particular financial worries for universities about an expected drop in overseas students, who pay a higher level of fees. Last month, Universities UK called for at least Â£2bn inemergency funding, saying that otherwise some institutions could go bust. Ms Donelan has announced measures to stabilise university finances, but without the extra cash requested. To help with cash flow, Â£2.6bn of tuition fee income and Â£100m of research funding will be brought forward and universities will be able to access the Treasury's support for businesses disrupted by coronavirus, worth another Â£700m. ""Should providers require further support the government will continue to review their financial circumstances,"" said the universities minister. There will also be more flexibility in the clearing system, which matches applicants to empty places after results are issued. Universities have been worried about ""volatility"" in applications and that some universities could be so short of recruits they would be financially unviable. Students angry at having to pay rent on empty rooms Universities warn of going bust without emergency funds University admissions could face student number controls To stop such fluctuations, there will be controls on student numbers, designed to stop some universities adding many more students, while others could be be left with too few. The higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, said it would impose financial penalties on universities using pressure selling tactics ""to increase student intake beyond normal levels"". The Russell Group of leading universities said the ""big remaining challenge"" was funding for research. ""Universities face significant shortfalls in international students and other sources of income that we need to underpin vital work that otherwise goes under-funded,"" said chief executive, Tim Bradshaw. Universities UK said the stability measures were a recognition of the important part universities would play in the ""recovery of the economy and communities"" in the wake of the pandemic and the ""severe financial storm"" it had created. The universities body has said that in the forthcoming weeks current students and applicants will be given a clearer idea of arrangements for opening in the autumn.

Treasury rolls out small business loans,"Big UK banks received around 100,000 applications in a single day for a new loan scheme for small businesses. The Bounce Back Loans scheme went live on Monday, with Barclays seeing 200 applications in the first minute and Lloyds 5,000 within three hours. It offers loans up to Â£50,000 and is designed to be simpler and quicker than the existing Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). Barclays said its first bounce back loans will be awarded within 24 hours. CBILS offer loans of up to Â£5m and are available for companies with a turnover of less than Â£45m. However, the loans have come in for criticism by some businesses, especially smaller ones. Banks can often apply their usual lending criteria, which makes it harder for smaller enterprises to qualify while locked down. On Thursday, the number of CBILS loans agreed was 8,638, down from more than 9,000 the previous week. Of 52,807 loans applied for, almost 28,000 have still to be approved. Banks have been criticised for delays in handing out loans but have blamed the heavy workload, the need to complete the necessary credit checks and a shortage of staff. The government insists the new bounce back loans will be easier to apply for. However, UK Finance, which represents banks, emphasised that firms should ""think very carefully before taking on new debt"". Of the UK's largest banks, Lloyds Banking Group said it received the most with 17,000 applications so far, while HSBC received 12,830 and 10,000 applied to NatWest. Barclays said it was ready to approve 6,000. Barclays denied its online system failed, but said that some customers may have to wait. ""Due to the extremely high level of demand, some customers will see availability later on today,"" it said. There are about 5.8 million firms in the UK with fewer than 50 staff While the loans are aimed at smaller businesses and sole traders, with Â£2,000 to Â£50,000 on offer, there is no limit on the size of business that can apply. To qualify, a firm must have been trading on 1 March this year and not have been in financial difficulty. In other words, the loans are not intended to bail out failing businesses. While these are early days, business leaders have been generally positive about the bounce-back scheme. It ""offers real hope"" for small firms, says Mike Cherry, head of the Federation of Small Businesses. Empty High Streets have become symbolic of the crisis facing small traders Businesses should apply through the bank with which they have a business account. The Treasury says funds should then be available ""within days"". Borrowers answer seven questions on an online form including information about turnover, tax details, bank account and how the lockdown and Covid-19 has impacted your business. Applicants do not have to provide security and personal guarantees. Ten banks have been accredited to provide the loans. However, the expectation is that because of the simplicity of the process, banks will transfer the money far quicker than CBIL loans. The lockdown hit just as Rachel Sweet's one-year-old business was entering its busiest trading period. She also had expansion plans. The bounce-back loans could prove a lifeline, she says, and her application has already gone in, via HSBC. Bath-based Sweet Drinks sells, promotes and organises tastings based on produce from the West Country. With the summer season and big outdoor events approaching, ""we were thinking about taking the business to the next level"". She estimates she lost 60% of her business when lockdown effectively closed the events season. Rachel says: ""Given all the hurdles and rejections we were reading about with the business interruption scheme, we decided to wait a little. ""This new scheme looks much more suitable for us. We've got enough money to cover our costs for a while,"" she said. ""We had hoped sales over the next few months would generate enough money to launch a new website and a mail order business."" Six months ago she was thinking of taking out a big bank loan to fund expansion, financing that would have come with a hefty interest rate. That could have made the current situation worse. The stress levels are high, she says. ""But luckily I'm a glass-half-full person, so I'm staying positive and just trying to do my best given the business environment."" The loan application took no time at all, requiring some basic business details, she says. ""It was a very straightforward process. I hope to hear by the end of the week. Fingers crossed."" The government will cover the cost of fees and interest for the first year. Businesses will only begin repaying the loan after 12 months. All lenders will charge a flat rate of 2.5% and the loans will last up to six years. This bounce-back rate is likely to be lower than most CBILS as they are less risky. The government is guaranteeing 100% of the loan from lenders if the firm defaults. With CBILS, the guarantee is 80% of the money. Both the Treasury and banks are keen to emphasise that they are loans that need to be repaid. The tax authorities have promised close inspection of all loans given. Chancellor Rishi Sunak came under strong pressure to introduce loans that were 100% government-backed You can still apply for one of these new loans. You can switch your CBILS application to a bounce back one if it was under Â£50,000. Or, if you already have a CBIL you can convert it, the Treasury says. Applicants do not have to stay with existing lenders. The major High Street banks are currently offering the bulk of the loans, although accreditation could be expanded to include other specialist small business backers and financial firms. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, told the BBC the affordability checks would ""be lighter"", but firms should still ""think very carefully about their ability to repay the loan"". Despite the government guarantee, banks are required to first chase firms for money if they do not repay the loan. That means seizing assets and pursuing business owners through the courts. Mr Jones said: ""These are loans, not grants, so if a business is already indebted and taking on further debt, they should think carefully before making an application."" The British Chambers of Commerce has said that about 30% of its members say they cannot afford to take on more debt.

Two charged with murder of NHS worker,"David Gomoh graduated with a marketing degree from Southbank University Two teenagers have been charged with murdering an NHS worker who was stabbed to death days after his father died with coronavirus. David Gomoh, 24, was attacked after leaving his home in Newham, east London, on 26 April. Muhammad Jalloh, 18, of Stratford, Newham, and a boy, 16, from Telford, Shropshire, are charged with murder. They are also charged with conspiracy to cause GBH and are due to appear at Thames Magistrates' Court on Monday. Police said a post-mortem examination found Southbank University graduate Mr Gomoh was stabbed in the chest and abdomen. Mr Gomoh, whose mother is a nurse, worked for the NHS helping to supply staff with essential equipment. The Met said he was killed just days before the funeral of his father, who died after contracting Covid-19.

What travel may look like,"Possible ways of distancing people at beaches could include separating bathers with plexiglass Sun loungers separated by plexiglass. Blood tests and sanitiser spray-downs before flights. These might sound extreme, but they are real measures some in the travel industry are looking at to keep holidaymakers feeling safe and comfortable in a post-lockdown world. It's too early to say when international travel might restart again - Argentina, for example, has extended flight bans until September and a UK minister has said he won't be booking a summer holiday anytime soon. But what will overseas trips look like when they're able to be taken again? Here's what you might expect. Many airports, including in London, have already introduced measures to cater for essential travellers based on government guidelines - so they might sound familiar. These include between one and two-metre distancing at all times (excluding people who live together), hand sanitisers distributed throughout the airport and efforts to spread passengers more evenly across terminals. In the US, the Transport Security Administration (TSA) says travellers should wash their hands for 20 seconds - in accordance with official guidelines - before and after the security screening process. But, at Hong Kong International Airport, testing is under way on a full-body disinfectant device. This, the airport says, can sanitise users within 40 seconds, using sprays that kill bacteria and viruses on skin and clothing. Hong Kong International Airport is testing a ""full-body disinfection"" device The airport is also trialling autonomous cleaning robots that move around killing microbes by zapping them with ultraviolet light. Similarrobots have been tested in makeshift hospital rooms. Airports that have electronic check-in kiosks are encouraging passengers to use them where possible to avoid unnecessary interaction. Most will display posters that explain guidance measures and instructions throughout their buildings. James Thornton, chief executive of Intrepid travel group, says the process of passing through airports is likely to take longer because of stricter checks. ""Just as taking out liquids and devices before going through machines has become the norm, so too will new social distancing guidelines,"" he says, adding: ""It's possible we'll see the introduction of an immunity passport."" Earlier this year, several airports announced they were introducing ""thermal detection screening"" in efforts to prevent the further spread of the virus overseas. However, the procedure divided experts on its effectiveness, as some people are said to be asymptomatic, and many airports will not be introducing it. Some have gone further, though, with Emirates offering passengers rapid Covid-19 blood tests prior to boarding at Dubai airport terminals. Emirates says the tests produce results within 10 minutes. As you take your seat, you'll have to picture the usual smiles from the flight attendants, who will most likely be wearing masks. You might choose to smile back, but you'll probably be wearing one, too - as more and more countries recommend their use. Your mind, meanwhile, should be at ease in the knowledge that most major airlines will have stepped up their cleaning and sanitation procedures, leaving your tray table, seat rest and safety belt suitably disinfected. The cabin of a domestic US Delta flight between Minneapolis and Baltimore on 25 April 2020 If you've booked your flight with Korean Air, don't be alarmed if people appear in the aisle wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE), as the airline says it plans to issue cabin crew with gowns, gloves and eye masks. This might be as good a time as any to appreciate that you won't be sharing either of your armrests, as most airlines have said that flights will not be fully booked and middle seats will be kept empty (at least to begin with). How will airlines get flying again? 12 ways coronavirus could change the way we live An airline pilot for Tui, who asked to be named only as Christian, said that while spreading passengers on a plane made sense in respect of distancing guidelines, it could prove ""hugely prohibitive"" and costly. ""Losing a third of seats means either that airlines fly at a loss, or we go back to the good old days when a Paris to Nice return ticket used to cost Â£1,000 (â¬1,145; $1,245) in today's money."" Christian says countries that rely heavily on tourism are already contacting operators. ""I believe that we will see a small restart of flights to selected destinations towards the end of the season."" How does an Italian beach holiday sound? Well, you could find yourself weaving between tall sheets of plexiglass used to separate sun loungers as you look for a shady spot in the sand. ""I've seen drawings,"" says Ulf Sonntag of the Institute for Tourism Research in Northern Europe, ""they are seriously considering this as an idea in Italy."" Mr Sonntag says European destinations are also looking at ways to manage guests at hotels, including only permitting every other hotel to open, or every other room within a building to be occupied. ""If the central aim is social distancing, then they have to work with that. It's not looking like pools can open at Mediterranean resorts,"" he adds. While restaurants are looking at spreading tables more sparsely, one Portuguese hotel chain, Vila Gale, said it had been ""stocking up on hand sanitisers"" and ""drawing up a la carte menus to replace buffets"". Nikolaos Sipsas, a professor of medicine in Athens, agrees that buffet meals are a big risk, along with pools, bars and beaches. ""I see Greek beaches being sparsely populated, in other words there will be bathers, but they won't be close to each other. We will not see the phenomenon of organised beaches with towels right next to each other,"" he says. I don't want a voucher, what are the rules? Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Other European countries have been discussing ""tourist corridors"" to connect areas and member states least affected by Covid-19. Croatia, for example, has already said that it may provide tourists from the Czech Republic and Slovakia with special access to its beaches this summer. You might not have enjoyed the sound of that hypothetical overseas holiday. And you're probably not alone. The fact is, more holidays in future are likely to be taken at home. ""People are likely to be travelling less internationally, what used to be called a staycation will change, and could become the norm,"" Andy Rutherford, founder of UK-based tour operator Fresh Eyes, says. In the wake of the global pandemic, ship cruises, ski holidays and long-haul flights could lose their appeal, especially as the focus returns to green technology and ways to tackle the climate crisis, Mr Rutherford says. ""Our commitment to travel must be based on mutual respect, solidarity and responsibility."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VISUAL GUIDE:Tracking the global outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Mr Sonntag agrees the pandemic may result in a change of habits: ""Domestic travel might make people realise that you don't always need to travel so far."" A recent survey by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) found that 60% of people questioned would wait for two months before booking flights after the coronavirus is contained - 40% said they would wait for at least six months. Boeing, which has cut 10% of its global workforce in response to Covid-19, has said it does not expect air travel to return to 2019 levels until at least 2023.

Work times 'could be staggered' as lockdown eases,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps said restrictions for those entering the UK were being considered. Businesses could be asked to stagger employees' working hours when the coronavirus lockdown eases, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shapps told the BBC that the move would help to prevent crowded commutes. He said more buses and trains would run but he hoped to encourage cycling and walking. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said a ""staged"" easing would mean measures could be reintroduced to tackle ""localised"" outbreaks. The government is expected to announce the next steps in its response to the epidemic next Sunday. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Gove said consultations are under way with employers, trade unions and public health experts to ensure that people return to work in the ""safest possible"" environments and understand official guidance. Call for 'carefully phased' lifting of lockdown What travel may look like ahead of a virus vaccine Lockdown breakers: 'We got a dirty look and packed it in' Business groups and unions received draft government guidelines on Sunday, and have until 21:00 BST to respond. Mr Gove stressed that the UK's approach would not be ""flicking a switch and going... back to the old normal"". ""A phased approach is one which allows us to monitor the impact that those changes are having on public health,"" he said. ""And - if necessary, in a specific and localised way - that means that we can pause or even reintroduce those restrictions that might be required in order to deal with localised outbreaks."" It comes asbusinesses called for a ""carefully phased"" plan for lifting lockdown restrictionsto be set out immediately, as many say they need weeks to prepare for resuming operations. Rail bosses said last month thatsocial-distancing of any kind would be ""extraordinarily difficult"" to manageand police, and could reduce the capacity of an individual train by between 70% and 90%. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Earlier, Mr Shapps told the Andrew Marr Show that the government was looking at a range of options for people to travel to work, including encouraging what he described as a ""massive expansion"" in interest in ""active travel"" such as cycling or walking. ""There are a series of different things that we can do including staggering work times, working with businesses and organisations to do that,"" he said. He also said he was working with train companies and unions on maintaining social distancing rules on platforms and at bus stops. Hand sanitiser could also be made available and one-way systems for passengers introduced, he told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday. The number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK stands at 28,446 - an increase of 315 on Saturday's figure. The government saidonly 76,500 coronavirus tests were carried out on Saturday, falling short of its daily target of 100,000. Mr Gove said the dip in the number of tests was due to the fact that fewer people were at work over the weekend. Dr Elisabetta Groppelli, a lecturer in global health at St George's, University of London, said that 76,500 was still a ""fantastic number"" and that the UK was ""becoming comparable"" to countries with similar population sizes. ""What is important is that the UK has steadily increased the number of tests that have been performed,"" she said. Mr Shapps said with testing now available to all staff and residents, infection rates were now falling in care homes as well as other parts of the community. Is social distancing on trains here to stay? Coronavirus testing falls short of daily target For that reason, he said he hoped the country would avoid care homes transmitting the virus back into the rest of society. Asked whether fewer people would have died if testing capacity had been greater sooner, he said: ""Yes. If we had had 100,000 test capacity before this thing started and the knowledge that we now have retrospectively I'm sure many things could be different."" But he said that although the UK has a big pharmaceuticals industry, it does not have a testing industry like Germany's, making it more difficult to increase test numbers. Defending the decision not to close airports or introduce screening for international arrivals earlier in the pandemic, Mr Shapps said the advice was that a ""complete lockdown of the borders"" might only have delayed the virus by three to five days. ""We had millions of people abroad who needed to return home,"" he said. But he said that now the infection rate was falling to a more manageable level, plans for screening and quarantining people travelling to the UK from abroad were ""a serious point under consideration"". Representative body Airlines UK said a 14-day quarantine period would ""effectively kill air travel"". Chief executive Tim Alderslade said it would be a ""blunt tool measure"" that would ""completely shut off the UK from the rest of the world when other countries are opening up their economies"" and the UK should be leading the way on common standards such as health screening, which would enable the sector to restart.

The Jamaican dream that ended in murder," By Steve Walker   Additional reporting: Nesta McGregor and Nick DavisIn April 2018, I received a 30-second phone call that changed my life forever.It was evening and I had returned home from the gym to a series of missed calls - my sister Jackie, my sister Claudette, my brother Dave, my brother George in the US.And I thought for a moment, ‘Who was missing - who had not called?’My brother Delroy.“We’ve had some bad news,” Jackie told me when we eventually spoke.“Delroy’s been murdered.”I couldn’t take it in. A thousand and one thoughts went through my mind. Who would kill Delroy. And why?   Rio Nuevo St Mary, half an hour’s drive from Kingston, Jamaica’s capital city, is a quiet cliff-side neighbourhood overlooking the azure waters of the Caribbean Sea. It is characterised by a mix of new-build villas painted in tropical pastel tones, some almost palatial in size, and half-built houses - their owners likely on budget waiting for further funds to come along. Empty plots of land offer the promise of a custom-built home for prospective retirees looking for peace and quiet, and views that take in either the sea, or the cool hills that roll down to meet it. Or both if you’re lucky. This part of the parish of St Mary on the north of the island has for years been a haven for “returning residents” - the legal name for people coming back to Jamaica after living away “in farin”, such as the US, Canada or the UK. Delroy was one of them. His house was what the family described as a one in million home - a Spanish-style villa with balconies outside each bedroom offering uninterrupted views of the ocean. Outside my brother's house A carpenter by trade, Delroy was renovating the house. In the garden, he had planted fruit trees - mango and banana - and the beginnings of a vegetable patch. The phrase “Living the Dream” was created for Delroy. At the age of 63, after decades working in the UK, my brother had saved enough to be able to retire back in the country of his birth. But If it wasn’t for that house, my brother would most likely be alive today.  Delroy left Jamaica at the age of 10 with my mum and dad and two other siblings. That was 1961, and they became part of what is known as the Windrush Generation. Croydon, in south-east London, became their adopted home. But the flame of Jamaica continued to burn brightly for the family - especially for Delroy. We always said he left Jamaica but Jamaica never left him. He loved to recount stories of his early life there - the food, swimming in the cool sea, helping my grandfather on his small farm holding. Delroy was a practical man. He finished his education, trained as a carpenter and went into the building trade. And he was generous with his time. For some of the jobs that he did, he wouldn’t want to take money, he’d say, “Just spend it on this person, or send it to Jamaica.” For a while, he became a fundraiser for a charity based in the Midlands, dedicated to helping children in need in the West Indies. And he found other ways to help people in Jamaica. Delroy was a hoarder - he wouldn’t let us throw anything away if he thought it could be reused. Every couple of years or so, he would collect it all and send it to Jamaica, where it could be shared with family or wider community. And most years, he would find a way to go to the island for a period of time. In 2005, Delroy and I - along with six of our siblings - took part in a TV documentary about families exploring their roots. For the documentary, 200 members of the extended family scattered across the UK, US and Canada gathered in Jamaica. Delroy was one of the relatives who featured. It makes unsettling viewing now. He stands out, looking younger than his years, wearing bright African clothes. He just smiled and smiled throughout the trip back to his motherland. It was this and subsequent trips that made him decide to make it his home. After the phone call from my Jackie, I knew that I would need to go to Jamaica as soon as I could. The Jamaican police were liaising with family in London, but it became evident to me during the initial part of the investigation that there were aspects that I didn’t feel were being conducted adequately. For example, I’m a technical operator with the BBC, and had told my brother to install CCTV cameras around his property for added security. But it seemed to me that evidence from the cameras wasn’t being collected quickly enough. Standing at the gate of Delroy’s house, I was immediately struck by the beauty of its surroundings. But I knew that behind the wooden front door I would be confronted with the full horror of Delroy’s last moments. We had been told by investigators that it was a vicious attack and that my brother had been stabbed multiple times. And here, in front of us, was the scene exactly as it had been left that night. In the Jamaican system, there aren’t any professional clean up companies that are sent to deal with crime scenes - that’s left to the family. Upturned furniture; a smashed window; a bloodied boot mark; blood on the ceiling, walls, floor - soaked into one of the rugs. It all pointed to one thing - that my brother had fought hard for his life. Looking around the house, my first thought was that the motive appeared not to have been robbery. My brother was an avid photographer, and his expensive cameras hadn’t been taken. Items such as his laptop, desktop computer and mobile phone were still there. In the days after our arrival on the island, there was a lot of confusion. I felt that there were elements of the case that had been carried out too quickly. This didn’t fill me with confidence. I asked a contact on the island - a former police officer with good working knowledge of these types of cases - how long we had before police resources would get diverted away. He said that it would likely be just four-to-six weeks. Just three weeks after Delroy, a couple from Manchester, England, were also murdered. That year, a total of eight British returnees were killed, and at least three more returnees from the US and Canada. Radio 4 - Jamaica: A Brother's Story A few weeks after my brother was stabbed to death, police arrested two men. They had been employed by Delroy to carry out work on his house. But they have been in custody for almost two years, and there is still no date for a trial. For some families that I have spoken to, or learnt about, who over the years have had loved ones killed after they returned to Jamaica, there have been no arrests. Delroy’s death set me on a journey to find out why so many returnees in Jamaica were being targeted and what was being done about it. I don’t want to stop people going back to pursue their own dreams - it is undoubtedly a beautiful country with amazing people -  but I thought that by highlighting what I saw as an under-reported issue, I might be able to bring about something lasting from my brother’s death. During the 1980s and 90s, thousands of Windrush Generation that arrived in the UK between the late 40s and early 70s returned to Jamaica. The authorities estimate that up to 10,000 people a year returned from Britain, the US and Canada during those years. The government sees the diaspora population, which is far bigger than the island’s population, as key to Jamaica’s economic development, not only in remittances but also in direct foreign investment and an inflow of human labour. The numbers of returnees has declined to just a few thousand now. This could be because there is less migration out of Jamaica. But could it also have something to do with the number of returnees who have been murdered? Claude Parchmore, a British-Jamaican I know in London, has been going back and forth to the island for a number of years. But he says the media coverage, and information circulating on social media about the potential dangers to returnees, has led his children to put pressure on him not to settle there permanently. I have heard similar concerns from many within the British-Jamaican community. It’s difficult to get figures for the total number of returnees that have been killed, but one Caribbean-based organisation estimates that more than 85 British nationals have been killed on the island in the past two decades. Jamaica’s problem with violence is well documented. According to the latest figures from the United Nations, Jamaica has the second highest murder rate in the world. With a population of just over 2.8m people, there are more than a 1,000 murders a year. That’s nearly 50 times the murder rate in the UK. For its part, the Jamaican police has long been seen as underpaid, poorly trained, understaffed and lacking in resources. This is something that the UK Home Office highlighted in its2018 country report. “In addition, corruption and impunity for abuses committed by the police has led to mistrust amongst citizens,” it added. But the report also stated that since 2009, the government has been taking steps to counter some of those problems, with a strategy of crime prevention and community safety. The journey that began with my brother’s death has raised many questions about migration, identity and belonging. Are returnees being seen as soft targets because they are coming home relatively wealthy after working for decades abroad. And what is that notion of “home”? It’s something I discussed with Leroy Logan, who runs the Jamaica diaspora crime intervention and prevention taskforce in the UK. Logan, a former Scotland Yard superintendent who spent some of his early years in Jamaica, is primarily focused on solutions to Jamaica’s wider crime issue. The government’s 2030 vision, he explains, is to make Jamaica more secure and more enjoyable. But he did have advice for returnees. He says much of the issue comes down to how people understand the idea of creating home in a place they left many decades ago. If you still think of it as “home” after all this time, ask yourself if the same people you grew up with are still there, he advised. Sometimes you go back to an area and it’s changed so much. Don’t go back to a place you haven’t visited much and try to immerse yourself without understanding of the notion of the haves and the have-nots, he warned. And don’t isolate yourself from the community by building a big house on top of the hill - contribute to it instead. Be sensitive - don’t start showing off your relative wealth. Integrate slowly and don’t go as far as to think you are suddenly part of the community after all these years, because you’re not. You will most likely be seen as a foreigner. In terms of the people around you - choose them wisely, he said, particularly people you may ask to do work for you. To start employing people who aren’t recommended could put you at risk. It all seemed like good, simple advice to me. But what is the government, itself, doing to communicate this? During the investigation of my brother’s case in 2018, my sisters and I met Jamaican Police Commissioner Major General Antony Anderson. We suggested at the time that the authorities should place more emphasis on the welfare, safety and wellbeing of returning residents. Later that year, Anderson came to the UK to speak to the diaspora in London, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham, and said the authorities were taking on board concerns about safety. And I brought it up with subsequent meetings with the Jamaican High Commission in London - why if returnees were so important to the country, was safety not given equal weight to other advice, such as what to do with your finances and how to conduct a relocation.  In February this year, I returned to Jamaica to explore some of the deeper questions that emerged after Delroy’s death. I travelled with BBC reporter Nesta McGregor - whose family also has origins in Jamaica. We wanted to ask if there is a disconnect between returnees’ views of their own relationship with their birthplace and the reality. We hadn’t been in Jamaica long before the problems for returnees were evident. Dwight, our taxi driver from the airport, pointed out that the road we were travelling on was once a crime hot spot. “People working at the airport used to tip them (criminals) off – for example who was carrying large sums of cash. What cars they got in. That type of thing,” Dwight told us. “They’d then wait along this stretch here and rob the incoming travellers.” The Jamaican Constabulary Force has since addressed the problem by creating a special unit whose sole job is to guard this stretch of land. “That’s not unique to Jamaica. Anywhere where you have the ‘haves and have nots’, people will do what they need to survive,” Dwight said. The conversation also revealed that Dwight worked for one of the largest private security firms in Jamaica – a sector that was growing rapidly. Later that evening, Nesta and I visited a local bar in Kingston. It was good to be back in Jamaica - to smell the spicy seasoned meat and listen to the soft reggae music. It reminded me of why Delroy had decided to settle here for good. We struck up a conversation with two locals - Mark, a music producer, and Sash, who works in administration. The pair gave us an insight into why returning residents may be a target. Mark told us that there’s a certain level of envy because anyone who goes overseas is automatically seen as wealthy. He said that leaving the island is a big endeavour - it’s almost a guarantee that your life and that of your family will improve. So for people who know they’ll never leave, never get a chance to do the same, that’s where the envy comes from, he said. Sash agrees there is a lot of jealousy. She says that if you are able to go overseas, whether or not you actually do have a lot of money, in the eyes of a regular Jamaican you will be regarded as wealthy. As you drive around Jamaica, it is evident that security is a major concern, regardless of the affluence of the area. Protecting what you have seems to be a common theme – however little. Although my brother had installed a steel gate and security cameras, he didn’t want bars on his windows - he told me he hadn’t come to Jamaica to live in a prison. But it is worth emphasising that many returnees live here without any problems. Added to that are the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the island to enjoy major attractions such as the Dunns River Falls and the Bob Marley Museum - and experience a trouble-free stay.  One night, we arranged to meet a group of residents who had returned from the UK a while back, in Trelawny. They explained that the community centre we were in had been built by returnees keen to have a place where they could integrate with the locals - get to know them properly. Over games of dominoes they told us their stories. All of them spoke glowingly about their experiences of returning. But some did highlight the importance of having the right security measures in place. Yvette, who spent 45 years in England, believes that many of the killings of returning residents are not random. “It’s not like people are just going up to them and killing them,” she said. “It’s often someone they know. When you come from London we have been taught to be very trusting of neighbours, so we bring that mentality over here.” But she stressed that she wasn’t worried that anything would happen to her. Joyce, who had returned in 1998 after 40 years in the UK, said she hadn’t been expecting people to welcome her “back with open arms as a Jamaican”. “We were received as foreigners,” she said. Maybe her positive experience had something to do with the fact that her expectations of homecoming were more realistic than many other people's. The issue of belonging is an interesting one. Are returning residents Jamaican or British? Does it matter? It was a question that arose after Delroy’s murder when we asked for help from the British consulate. Delroy held both British and Jamaican citizenship and when the family came to a meeting in 2018 at the consulate, we were told that he wasn’t British - or British enough - so they couldn’t support us in the same way they would have done if he was a British national. That was a shock. On this second visit, I arranged another meeting to clarify this point. And one thing that was agreed was that my brother was British and should have been classed as that. They confirmed that in the case of murder that British identification should override everything. There were other small things that I think the consulate could have done to help us after the murder. For example, keeping in touch with the police on the island required a local SIM card for our mobile phones. But getting one requires the equivalent of a National Insurance number. That was difficult since I didn’t live or work in Jamaica. This slowed down the process of getting information because the police were reluctant to make expensive calls to a UK number. But now, as a direct result of my brother’s case, the embassy has agreed to provide British visitors who find themselves in the middle of an emergency with local SIM cards. It’s a small change but one that is massive when you’re dealing with a world of other problems. The last stop on my journey is to visit Acting Assistant Police Commissioner Fitz Bailey. I asked him about the judicial process and why there was still no trial date for the two men arrested for my brother’s murder. Fitz Bailey explained that a new judiciary minister has been appointed to deal with the country’s extensive backlog of cases. He told me that at the time of Delroy’s murder, there was a significant number of robberies against returning residents. As a result a special unit had been set up by the high command to look after returnees. Each commander should identify returning residents in their local areas and regularly check in with them. And he told me that the government’s “Welcome Home” booklet for returning residents has been adapted in recent years in response to the number of deaths. Where it used to focus on telling returning residents the practicalities of moving, it now focuses on security and staying safe on the island. For example, he says a returnee can now contact the police for a recommendation if they need work doing on their property, and the officers will consult a database of reputable workers. He admitted that nationwide, the force was 4,000 officers short but that they were trying to recruit more. But he had this message for returning residents unsure about whether to return to the island. “I still maintain that Jamaica is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Whilst we have concerns, I don’t think the concerns that we have are different to those of any other nation. So I would say Jamaica is still a safe place and your contribution to the development of this country is necessary.” Returning to the UK, I feel reassured that the police have promised to look at my brother’s case. And I know that even though Delroy is no longer with us, he has achieved what many people never managed to do. And that was to live his dream - albeit for a short time.

What happened to my brother?," By Steve Walker   Additional reporting: Nesta McGregor and Nick DavisIn April 2018, I received a 30-second phone call that changed my life forever.It was evening and I had returned home from the gym to a series of missed calls - my sister Jackie, my sister Claudette, my brother Dave, my brother George in the US.And I thought for a moment, ‘Who was missing - who had not called?’My brother Delroy.“We’ve had some bad news,” Jackie told me when we eventually spoke.“Delroy’s been murdered.”I couldn’t take it in.

So for people who know they’ll never leave, never get a chance to do the same, that’s where the envy comes from, he said. Sash agrees there is a lot of jealousy. She says that if you are able to go overseas, whether or not you actually do have a lot of money, in the eyes of a regular Jamaican you will be regarded as wealthy. As you drive around Jamaica, it is evident that security is a major concern, regardless of the affluence of the area. Protecting what you have seems to be a common theme – however little. Although my brother had installed a steel gate and security cameras, he didn’t want bars on his windows - he told me he hadn’t come to Jamaica to live in a prison. But it is worth emphasising that many returnees live here without any problems. Added to that are the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the island to enjoy major attractions such as the Dunns River Falls and the Bob Marley Museum - and experience a trouble-free stay.  One night, we arranged to meet a group of residents who had returned from the UK a while back, in Trelawny. They explained that the community centre we were in had been built by returnees keen to have a place where they could integrate with the locals - get to know them properly. Over games of dominoes they told us their stories. All of them spoke glowingly about their experiences of returning. But some did highlight the importance of having the right security measures in place. Yvette, who spent 45 years in England, believes that many of the killings of returning residents are not random. “It’s not like people are just going up to them and killing them,” she said. “It’s often someone they know. When you come from London we have been taught to be very trusting of neighbours, so we bring that mentality over here.” But she stressed that she wasn’t worried that anything would happen to her. Joyce, who had returned in 1998 after 40 years in the UK, said she hadn’t been expecting people to welcome her “back with open arms as a Jamaican”. “We were received as foreigners,” she said. Maybe her positive experience had something to do with the fact that her expectations of homecoming were more realistic than many other people's. The issue of belonging is an interesting one. Are returning residents Jamaican or British? Does it matter? It was a question that arose after Delroy’s murder when we asked for help from the British consulate. Delroy held both British and Jamaican citizenship and when the family came to a meeting in 2018 at the consulate, we were told that he wasn’t British - or British enough - so they couldn’t support us in the same way they would have done if he was a British national. That was a shock. On this second visit, I arranged another meeting to clarify this point. And one thing that was agreed was that my brother was British and should have been classed as that. They confirmed that in the case of murder that British identification should override everything. There were other small things that I think the consulate could have done to help us after the murder. For example, keeping in touch with the police on the island required a local SIM card for our mobile phones. But getting one requires the equivalent of a National Insurance number. That was difficult since I didn’t live or work in Jamaica. This slowed down the process of getting information because the police were reluctant to make expensive calls to a UK number. But now, as a direct result of my brother’s case, the embassy has agreed to provide British visitors who find themselves in the middle of an emergency with local SIM cards. It’s a small change but one that is massive when you’re dealing with a world of other problems. The last stop on my journey is to visit Acting Assistant Police Commissioner Fitz Bailey. I asked him about the judicial process and why there was still no trial date for the two men arrested for my brother’s murder. Fitz Bailey explained that a new judiciary minister has been appointed to deal with the country’s extensive backlog of cases. He told me that at the time of Delroy’s murder, there was a significant number of robberies against returning residents. As a result a special unit had been set up by the high command to look after returnees. Each commander should identify returning residents in their local areas and regularly check in with them. And he told me that the government’s “Welcome Home” booklet for returning residents has been adapted in recent years in response to the number of deaths. Where it used to focus on telling returning residents the practicalities of moving, it now focuses on security and staying safe on the island. For example, he says a returnee can now contact the police for a recommendation if they need work doing on their property, and the officers will consult a database of reputable workers. He admitted that nationwide, the force was 4,000 officers short but that they were trying to recruit more. But he had this message for returning residents unsure about whether to return to the island. “I still maintain that Jamaica is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Whilst we have concerns, I don’t think the concerns that we have are different to those of any other nation. So I would say Jamaica is still a safe place and your contribution to the development of this country is necessary.” Returning to the UK, I feel reassured that the police have promised to look at my brother’s case. And I know that even though Delroy is no longer with us, he has achieved what many people never managed to do. And that was to live his dream - albeit for a short time.

Schools would need about three weeks to prepare for a phased return, according to First Minister Mark Drakeford. But his mention of June in an interview with Andrew Marr  has caused confusion according to a teaching union.

She said the weaknesses of the current ""just in time"" delivery system had been exposed by the crisis. We'll be back with the latest on the outbreak in the morning. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organisation (WHO) says some people are testing positive more than once for coronavirus - but it doesn't mean they have been reinfected.

Former AM Owen John Thomas with his sons Rhodri and Rhys The former Plaid Cymru AM Owen John Thomas lives in a care home in Cardiff. His son Rhys ab Owen has written for theBBC's Welsh language online service Cymru Fywabout the difficulties he has faced in keeping in touch with his father since lockdown. Mr ab Owen is also critical of the Welsh Government's approach to testing in care homes prior to yesterday's announcement that it would be extended to all residents and staff at homes where someone has coronavirus. He says it should have acted sooner. Welsh Government minister Jeremy Miles told BBC Politics Wales that the testing policy has ""a very clear purpose... to reduce the harm from Covid and to enable those people that we need back at work to get back to work"". ""And that's supported by advice from scientists and medical advice and also our growing understanding of how it operates... and some of those are fine judgements, and when the advice changes, the policy changes and that's what we've done in the last few days, to extend testing further in our care homes."" This video can not be played Rachel Jones, who works at Ty Mair care home in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, made a video diary forBBC
Politics Walesshowing how they are coping with coronavirus. At one point more than a third of its elderly residents were isolating with symptoms of Covid-19, and five residents have died with it. Ms Jones says a number of staff have also tested positive for coronavirus and, after recovering, have returned ""to put themselves through it all again"". She says people working in care homes are used to dealing with death, but she says coronavirus is ""horrible"". However, she adds that staff at Ty Mair hold celebrations when a resident recovers from coronavirus, as they want to ""celebrate everything that we can"" during the crisis. A further 14 people in Wales have died with coronavirus, making a total of 983, Public Health Wales (PHW) said on Sunday. Only people who have been positively tested - not just suspected of having Covid-19 - are counted and it only includes some deaths in care homes, those notified by health boards. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)registered 1,016 deaths by 25 April. That is because the ONS includes deaths at home, in care homes and in hospices, not just hospitals. MP Alex Davies Jones has urged people to give blood to the NHS. The health service saw a 15% drop in the number of people giving blood at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, it has been reported. The Pontypridd MP said donations were urgently needed across Pontypridd and Rhondda Cynon Taff and that travelling to give blood was considered essential travel. ""I would encourage you to go along and donate,"" she said on Facebook. Plaid Cymru AM Delyth Jewell has called for coronavirus testing and tracing to be rolled out across all Wales' care homes. The call comes after Welsh Government minister Jeremy Miles defended testing policy on the BBCâs Sunday Politics Wales. Yesterday the Welsh Government announced it will test residents and staff in all care homes where someone has coronavirus. Tests will also be carried out in homes of 50 residents or more regardless of whether someone there has symptoms or not. Prof Mark Bellis, director of policy at Public Health Wales said its own recentsurvey,externalabout people's wellbeing showed despite social distancing, many were ""talking more than they usually would to family and friends and people in their communities"". ""However, even though we are keeping in touch, nearly one in five people are worried a lot about their mental health and wellbeing, which indicates there is still more support needed,â he said. Mr Bellis said the findings would be used to help understand and to provide better support for people's health, such as its campaign,How

back to school. But this has caused confusion,
according to teaching union, NAHT Cymru. ""At no point has June been
mentioned in talks between Welsh Government and trade unions,"" it said. Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: ""We would caution against fixing a date in stone at this stage, and to make sure the conditions are right first of all."" Speaking to BBC Wales after the Marr programme, Mr Drakeford said he was using June as an example: ""If we make the decision to return next week then the return to school will be in June.""

Work times 'could be staggered' as lockdown easesTransport Secretary Grant Shapps says it could help maintain social distancing on public transport.,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps said restrictions for those entering the UK were being considered. Businesses could be asked to stagger employees' working hours when the coronavirus lockdown eases, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shapps told the BBC that the move would help to prevent crowded commutes. He said more buses and trains would run but he hoped to encourage cycling and walking. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said a ""staged"" easing would mean measures could be reintroduced to tackle ""localised"" outbreaks. The government is expected to announce the next steps in its response to the epidemic next Sunday. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Gove said consultations are under way with employers, trade unions and public health experts to ensure that people return to work in the ""safest possible"" environments and understand official guidance. Call for 'carefully phased' lifting of lockdown What travel may look like ahead of a virus vaccine Lockdown breakers: 'We got a dirty look and packed it in' Business groups and unions received draft government guidelines on Sunday, and have until 21:00 BST to respond. Mr Gove stressed that the UK's approach would not be ""flicking a switch and going... back to the old normal"". ""A phased approach is one which allows us to monitor the impact that those changes are having on public health,"" he said. ""And - if necessary, in a specific and localised way - that means that we can pause or even reintroduce those restrictions that might be required in order to deal with localised outbreaks."" It comes asbusinesses called for a ""carefully phased"" plan for lifting lockdown restrictionsto be set out immediately, as many say they need weeks to prepare for resuming operations. Rail bosses said last month thatsocial-distancing of any kind would be ""extraordinarily difficult"" to manageand police, and could reduce the capacity of an individual train by between 70% and 90%. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Earlier, Mr Shapps told the Andrew Marr Show that the government was looking at a range of options for people to travel to work, including encouraging what he described as a ""massive expansion"" in interest in ""active travel"" such as cycling or walking. ""There are a series of different things that we can do including staggering work times, working with businesses and organisations to do that,"" he said. He also said he was working with train companies and unions on maintaining social distancing rules on platforms and at bus stops. Hand sanitiser could also be made available and one-way systems for passengers introduced, he told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday. The number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK stands at 28,446 - an increase of 315 on Saturday's figure. The government saidonly 76,500 coronavirus tests were carried out on Saturday, falling short of its daily target of 100,000. Mr Gove said the dip in the number of tests was due to the fact that fewer people were at work over the weekend. Dr Elisabetta Groppelli, a lecturer in global health at St George's, University of London, said that 76,500 was still a ""fantastic number"" and that the UK was ""becoming comparable"" to countries with similar population sizes. ""What is important is that the UK has steadily increased the number of tests that have been performed,"" she said. Mr Shapps said with testing now available to all staff and residents, infection rates were now falling in care homes as well as other parts of the community. Is social distancing on trains here to stay? Coronavirus testing falls short of daily target For that reason, he said he hoped the country would avoid care homes transmitting the virus back into the rest of society. Asked whether fewer people would have died if testing capacity had been greater sooner, he said: ""Yes. If we had had 100,000 test capacity before this thing started and the knowledge that we now have retrospectively I'm sure many things could be different."" But he said that although the UK has a big pharmaceuticals industry, it does not have a testing industry like Germany's, making it more difficult to increase test numbers. Defending the decision not to close airports or introduce screening for international arrivals earlier in the pandemic, Mr Shapps said the advice was that a ""complete lockdown of the borders"" might only have delayed the virus by three to five days. ""We had millions of people abroad who needed to return home,"" he said. But he said that now the infection rate was falling to a more manageable level, plans for screening and quarantining people travelling to the UK from abroad were ""a serious point under consideration"". Representative body Airlines UK said a 14-day quarantine period would ""effectively kill air travel"". Chief executive Tim Alderslade said it would be a ""blunt tool measure"" that would ""completely shut off the UK from the rest of the world when other countries are opening up their economies"" and the UK should be leading the way on common standards such as health screening, which would enable the sector to restart.

McDonald's seeks rent cut from UK landlords,"McDonald's has closed all its outlets in the UK McDonald's is in talks with some of its landlords in the UK about cutting rent payments as the fast food chain prepares to reopen some of its sites. Businesses face their next quarterly rent bill on 24 June when they are due to pay for the next three months. McDonald's said it has paid in full for the current quarter. However, it said that ""given the unprecedented situation"", it was in talks with landlords about how they could ""offer support"" on rent. McDonald's has closed all its outlets in the UK because of the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesman for the company said: ""We have opened dialogue with some of our landlords to discuss how they might offer support on rent and service charges for a short period due to our restaurants not trading."" Coronavirus: Shopping centre giant threatens brands over rent Coronavirus: Pub sector faces 'bloodbath' over rents McDonald's plans to reopen 15 outlets in the UK for delivery only services on 13 May. Other food chains such as Burger King and Yo! Sushi did not pay rent to landlords in the UK when it fell due in March. The government hasimplemented some measuresto help businesses who are struggling to pay their rent. But shopping centre-owner Intu said recently that it was considering legal action against some big brands who have money but are ""not engaging"" in rent negotiations. Intu, which owns Manchester's Trafford Centre and the Lakeside in Essex, declined to name the brands. In April, the British Retail Consortium and the British Property Federation both wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak seeking more support for shops and landlords. McDonald's plans to reopen some UK sites in May for delivery-only orders They want the government to support a ""furloughed space grant scheme"" where businesses would pay some rent, landlords would agree to a reduction and the state would make-up the shortfall. A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""We recognise the current challenges facing commercial landlords and the significant impact recent changes are having on their business models. We also recognise that many landlords are working closely with tenants to find solutions that work for both parties."" ""Our package of support for businesses currently includes our new bounce back loans, which provide quick and easy support for eligible companies that is interest-free for the first 12 months, our job retention scheme and other measures such as protecting commercial tenants from eviction."" Last week, McDonald's revealed that the coronavirus outbreak had sent first quarter like-for-like sales down 3.4%. It said around three quarters of its outlets across the world remained opened and were serving people via drive-throughs, delivery or takeaway services. But the UK is among a few of its markets where it has temporarily closed all of its sites. Others include France, Italy and Spain.

Warren Buffett sells off shares in US airlinesThe billionaire investor says he doesn't see any remaining upside in the airline industry.US & Canada,"Warren Buffett made the announcement at the firm's virtual annual shareholders' meeting Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says his company Berkshire Hathaway has sold all of its shares in the four largest US airlines. Speaking at the annual shareholders' meeting, Mr Buffett said ""the world has changed"" because of the coronavirus. He then said he had been wrong to invest in the airline industry. Mr Buffett's comments came just hours after Berkshire Hathaway announced a record $50bn (Â£40bn) net first quarter loss, Reuters news agency reports. The conglomerate had an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines, 10% of American Airlines, 10% of Southwest Airlines, and 9% of United Airlines, according to its annual report and company filings. The firm began investing in the four airlines in 2016, after avoiding the aviation industry for years. Mr Buffett told the meeting, which was held virtually: ""We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss. ""We will not fund a company that... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future."" The US travel industry has almost collapsed because of the coronavirus pandemic The US travel industry has almost collapsed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with airlines cutting hundreds of thousands of flights and taking thousands of planes out of service. Mr Buffett said he had been considering investing in additional airlines before the pandemic hit. ""It is a blow to have, essentially, your demand dry up,"" he said. ""It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country."" What travel may look like ahead of a virus vaccine How will airlines get flying again? Germany dashes tourism sector's hopes on lockdown In a statement, Delta said it was aware of the sale and has ""tremendous respect for Mr Buffett and the Berkshire team"".

'Covid toe' and other rashes puzzle doctors,"""Covid toe"" is a rash that can look like chilblains Five rashes, including Covid toe, are affecting some hospital patients diagnosed with Covid-19, a small study by Spanish doctors has found. The rashes tended to appear in younger people and lasted several days. It is not uncommon for a rash to be a symptom of a virus, such as the spots that indicate chicken pox. But the researchers said they were surprised to see so many varieties of rash with Covid-19. Rashes are not currently included in thelist of symptoms of the illness. There have been many reports about ""Covid toe"" - a rash appearing on Covid patients' feet even in the absence of other symptoms - but lead researcher Dr Ignacio Garcia-Doval said the most common form of rash in the study was maculopapules - small, flat and raised red bumps that tend to appear on the torso. ""It is strange to see several different rashes - and some of them are quite specific,"" Dr Garcia-Doval told the BBC. ""It usually appears later on, after the respiratory manifestation of the disease - so it's not good for diagnosing patients,"" he added. The most commonly seen rash in the study affected nearly half of the patients All the patients in the study were already in hospital and had respiratory symptoms. The peer-reviewed paper waspublished this week in the British Journal of Dermatology,external. All dermatologists in Spain were asked to share details of Covid patients they had seen who had developed rashes in the previous two weeks. There were 375 in total. The five rashes were: Asymmetrical, chilblain-like lesions around the hands and feet, which could be itchy or painful. Generally found in younger patients, lasted on average 12 days, appeared later on in the course of the disease, and were associated with mild infections. Accounted for 19% of cases. Outbreaks of small blisters, often itchy, found on the trunk and limbs. These were found in middle-aged patients, lasted around 10 days, and appeared before other symptoms. (9%) Pink or white raised areas of skin that looked liked nettle rash, and often itchy. Mostly on the body but sometimes on the palms of the hands. (19%) Maculopapules - small, flat and raised red bumps. These accounted for 47% of cases. They lasted around seven days and appeared at the same time as other symptoms but tended to be seen in patients with more severe infections. Livedo (also known as necrosis) was present in 6% of cases. The skin looked blotchy red or blue, with a net-like pattern. It's a sign of poor blood circulation. This appeared in older patients with severe illness. However, the researchers stressed that rashes can have many causes, and it can be difficult to differentiate between them without medical expertise. ""The relevance of this study is not so much in helping people self-diagnose, but rather to help build our wider understanding of how the infection can affect people,"" said Dr Ruth Murphy, president of the British Association of Dermatologists. Dr Michael Head at the University of Southampton said that rashes were a well-known side effect of many viral infections, including pneumonia. ""With Covid-19, rashes and skin ulcers have been noted in a few per cent of hospitalised patients. We don't yet know the extent of these links, or precisely why this inflammation occurs in some patients but not others.""

Warren Buffett sells off shares in US airlines,"Warren Buffett made the announcement at the firm's virtual annual shareholders' meeting Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says his company Berkshire Hathaway has sold all of its shares in the four largest US airlines. Speaking at the annual shareholders' meeting, Mr Buffett said ""the world has changed"" because of the coronavirus. He then said he had been wrong to invest in the airline industry. Mr Buffett's comments came just hours after Berkshire Hathaway announced a record $50bn (Â£40bn) net first quarter loss, Reuters news agency reports. The conglomerate had an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines, 10% of American Airlines, 10% of Southwest Airlines, and 9% of United Airlines, according to its annual report and company filings. The firm began investing in the four airlines in 2016, after avoiding the aviation industry for years. Mr Buffett told the meeting, which was held virtually: ""We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss. ""We will not fund a company that... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future."" The US travel industry has almost collapsed because of the coronavirus pandemic The US travel industry has almost collapsed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with airlines cutting hundreds of thousands of flights and taking thousands of planes out of service. Mr Buffett said he had been considering investing in additional airlines before the pandemic hit. ""It is a blow to have, essentially, your demand dry up,"" he said. ""It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country."" What travel may look like ahead of a virus vaccine How will airlines get flying again? Germany dashes tourism sector's hopes on lockdown In a statement, Delta said it was aware of the sale and has ""tremendous respect for Mr Buffett and the Berkshire team"". The airline added that it remains ""confident"" in its strengths. What travel may look like ahead of a virus vaccine How will airlines get flying again?

The story of my brother's murder," By Steve Walker   Additional reporting: Nesta McGregor and Nick DavisIn April 2018, I received a 30-second phone call that changed my life forever.It was evening and I had returned home from the gym to a series of missed calls - my sister Jackie, my sister Claudette, my brother Dave, my brother George in the US.And I thought for a moment, ‘Who was missing - who had not called?’My brother Delroy.“We’ve had some bad news,” Jackie told me when we eventually spoke.“Delroy’s been murdered.”I couldn’t take it in. A thousand and one thoughts went through my mind. Who would kill Delroy. And why?   Rio Nuevo St Mary, half an hour’s drive from Kingston, Jamaica’s capital city, is a quiet cliff-side neighbourhood overlooking the azure waters of the Caribbean Sea. It is characterised by a mix of new-build villas painted in tropical pastel tones, some almost palatial in size, and half-built houses - their owners likely on budget waiting for further funds to come along. Empty plots of land offer the promise of a custom-built home for prospective retirees looking for peace and quiet, and views that take in either the sea, or the cool hills that roll down to meet it. Or both if you’re lucky. This part of the parish of St Mary on the north of the island has for years been a haven for “returning residents” - the legal name for people coming back to Jamaica after living away “in farin”, such as the US, Canada or the UK. Delroy was one of them. His house was what the family described as a one in million home - a Spanish-style villa with balconies outside each bedroom offering uninterrupted views of the ocean. Outside my brother's house A carpenter by trade, Delroy was renovating the house. In the garden, he had planted fruit trees - mango and banana - and the beginnings of a vegetable patch. The phrase “Living the Dream” was created for Delroy. At the age of 63, after decades working in the UK, my brother had saved enough to be able to retire back in the country of his birth. But If it wasn’t for that house, my brother would most likely be alive today.  Delroy left Jamaica at the age of 10 with my mum and dad and two other siblings. That was 1961, and they became part of what is known as the Windrush Generation. Croydon, in south-east London, became their adopted home. But the flame of Jamaica continued to burn brightly for the family - especially for Delroy. We always said he left Jamaica but Jamaica never left him. He loved to recount stories of his early life there - the food, swimming in the cool sea, helping my grandfather on his small farm holding. Delroy was a practical man. He finished his education, trained as a carpenter and went into the building trade. And he was generous with his time. For some of the jobs that he did, he wouldn’t want to take money, he’d say, “Just spend it on this person, or send it to Jamaica.” For a while, he became a fundraiser for a charity based in the Midlands, dedicated to helping children in need in the West Indies. And he found other ways to help people in Jamaica. Delroy was a hoarder - he wouldn’t let us throw anything away if he thought it could be reused. Every couple of years or so, he would collect it all and send it to Jamaica, where it could be shared with family or wider community. And most years, he would find a way to go to the island for a period of time. In 2005, Delroy and I - along with six of our siblings - took part in a TV documentary about families exploring their roots. For the documentary, 200 members of the extended family scattered across the UK, US and Canada gathered in Jamaica. Delroy was one of the relatives who featured. It makes unsettling viewing now. He stands out, looking younger than his years, wearing bright African clothes. He just smiled and smiled throughout the trip back to his motherland. It was this and subsequent trips that made him decide to make it his home. After the phone call from my Jackie, I knew that I would need to go to Jamaica as soon as I could. The Jamaican police were liaising with family in London, but it became evident to me during the initial part of the investigation that there were aspects that I didn’t feel were being conducted adequately. For example, I’m a technical operator with the BBC, and had told my brother to install CCTV cameras around his property for added security. But it seemed to me that evidence from the cameras wasn’t being collected quickly enough. Standing at the gate of Delroy’s house, I was immediately struck by the beauty of its surroundings. But I knew that behind the wooden front door I would be confronted with the full horror of Delroy’s last moments. We had been told by investigators that it was a vicious attack and that my brother had been stabbed multiple times. And here, in front of us, was the scene exactly as it had been left that night. In the Jamaican system, there aren’t any professional clean up companies that are sent to deal with crime scenes - that’s left to the family. Upturned furniture; a smashed window; a bloodied boot mark; blood on the ceiling, walls, floor - soaked into one of the rugs. It all pointed to one thing - that my brother had fought hard for his life. Looking around the house, my first thought was that the motive appeared not to have been robbery. My brother was an avid photographer, and his expensive cameras hadn’t been taken. Items such as his laptop, desktop computer and mobile phone were still there. In the days after our arrival on the island, there was a lot of confusion. I felt that there were elements of the case that had been carried out too quickly. This didn’t fill me with confidence. I asked a contact on the island - a former police officer with good working knowledge of these types of cases - how long we had before police resources would get diverted away. He said that it would likely be just four-to-six weeks. Just three weeks after Delroy, a couple from Manchester, England, were also murdered. That year, a total of eight British returnees were killed, and at least three more returnees from the US and Canada. Radio 4 - Jamaica: A Brother's Story A few weeks after my brother was stabbed to death, police arrested two men. They had been employed by Delroy to carry out work on his house. But they have been in custody for almost two years, and there is still no date for a trial. For some families that I have spoken to, or learnt about, who over the years have had loved ones killed after they returned to Jamaica, there have been no arrests. Delroy’s death set me on a journey to find out why so many returnees in Jamaica were being targeted and what was being done about it. I don’t want to stop people going back to pursue their own dreams - it is undoubtedly a beautiful country with amazing people -  but I thought that by highlighting what I saw as an under-reported issue, I might be able to bring about something lasting from my brother’s death. During the 1980s and 90s, thousands of Windrush Generation that arrived in the UK between the late 40s and early 70s returned to Jamaica. The authorities estimate that up to 10,000 people a year returned from Britain, the US and Canada during those years. The government sees the diaspora population, which is far bigger than the island’s population, as key to Jamaica’s economic development, not only in remittances but also in direct foreign investment and an inflow of human labour. The numbers of returnees has declined to just a few thousand now. This could be because there is less migration out of Jamaica. But could it also have something to do with the number of returnees who have been murdered? Claude Parchmore, a British-Jamaican I know in London, has been going back and forth to the island for a number of years. But he says the media coverage, and information circulating on social media about the potential dangers to returnees, has led his children to put pressure on him not to settle there permanently. I have heard similar concerns from many within the British-Jamaican community. It’s difficult to get figures for the total number of returnees that have been killed, but one Caribbean-based organisation estimates that more than 85 British nationals have been killed on the island in the past two decades. Jamaica’s problem with violence is well documented. According to the latest figures from the United Nations, Jamaica has the second highest murder rate in the world. With a population of just over 2.8m people, there are more than a 1,000 murders a year. That’s nearly 50 times the murder rate in the UK. For its part, the Jamaican police has long been seen as underpaid, poorly trained, understaffed and lacking in resources. This is something that the UK Home Office highlighted in its2018 country report. “In addition, corruption and impunity for abuses committed by the police has led to mistrust amongst citizens,” it added. But the report also stated that since 2009, the government has been taking steps to counter some of those problems, with a strategy of crime prevention and community safety. The journey that began with my brother’s death has raised many questions about migration, identity and belonging. Are returnees being seen as soft targets because they are coming home relatively wealthy after working for decades abroad. And what is that notion of “home”? It’s something I discussed with Leroy Logan, who runs the Jamaica diaspora crime intervention and prevention taskforce in the UK. Logan, a former Scotland Yard superintendent who spent some of his early years in Jamaica, is primarily focused on solutions to Jamaica’s wider crime issue. The government’s 2030 vision, he explains, is to make Jamaica more secure and more enjoyable. But he did have advice for returnees. He says much of the issue comes down to how people understand the idea of creating home in a place they left many decades ago. If you still think of it as “home” after all this time, ask yourself if the same people you grew up with are still there, he advised. Sometimes you go back to an area and it’s changed so much. Don’t go back to a place you haven’t visited much and try to immerse yourself without understanding of the notion of the haves and the have-nots, he warned. And don’t isolate yourself from the community by building a big house on top of the hill - contribute to it instead. Be sensitive - don’t start showing off your relative wealth. Integrate slowly and don’t go as far as to think you are suddenly part of the community after all these years, because you’re not. You will most likely be seen as a foreigner. In terms of the people around you - choose them wisely, he said, particularly people you may ask to do work for you. To start employing people who aren’t recommended could put you at risk. It all seemed like good, simple advice to me. But what is the government, itself, doing to communicate this? During the investigation of my brother’s case in 2018, my sisters and I met Jamaican Police Commissioner Major General Antony Anderson. We suggested at the time that the authorities should place more emphasis on the welfare, safety and wellbeing of returning residents. Later that year, Anderson came to the UK to speak to the diaspora in London, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham, and said the authorities were taking on board concerns about safety. And I brought it up with subsequent meetings with the Jamaican High Commission in London - why if returnees were so important to the country, was safety not given equal weight to other advice, such as what to do with your finances and how to conduct a relocation.  In February this year, I returned to Jamaica to explore some of the deeper questions that emerged after Delroy’s death. I travelled with BBC reporter Nesta McGregor - whose family also has origins in Jamaica. We wanted to ask if there is a disconnect between returnees’ views of their own relationship with their birthplace and the reality. We hadn’t been in Jamaica long before the problems for returnees were evident. Dwight, our taxi driver from the airport, pointed out that the road we were travelling on was once a crime hot spot. “People working at the airport used to tip them (criminals) off – for example who was carrying large sums of cash. What cars they got in. That type of thing,” Dwight told us. “They’d then wait along this stretch here and rob the incoming travellers.” The Jamaican Constabulary Force has since addressed the problem by creating a special unit whose sole job is to guard this stretch of land. “That’s not unique to Jamaica. Anywhere where you have the ‘haves and have nots’, people will do what they need to survive,” Dwight said. The conversation also revealed that Dwight worked for one of the largest private security firms in Jamaica – a sector that was growing rapidly. Later that evening, Nesta and I visited a local bar in Kingston. It was good to be back in Jamaica - to smell the spicy seasoned meat and listen to the soft reggae music. It reminded me of why Delroy had decided to settle here for good. We struck up a conversation with two locals - Mark, a music producer, and Sash, who works in administration. The pair gave us an insight into why returning residents may be a target. Mark told us that there’s a certain level of envy because anyone who goes overseas is automatically seen as wealthy. He said that leaving the island is a big endeavour - it’s almost a guarantee that your life and that of your family will improve. So for people who know they’ll never leave, never get a chance to do the same, that’s where the envy comes from, he said. Sash agrees there is a lot of jealousy. She says that if you are able to go overseas, whether or not you actually do have a lot of money, in the eyes of a regular Jamaican you will be regarded as wealthy. As you drive around Jamaica, it is evident that security is a major concern, regardless of the affluence of the area. Protecting what you have seems to be a common theme – however little. Although my brother had installed a steel gate and security cameras, he didn’t want bars on his windows - he told me he hadn’t come to Jamaica to live in a prison. But it is worth emphasising that many returnees live here without any problems. Added to that are the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the island to enjoy major attractions such as the Dunns River Falls and the Bob Marley Museum - and experience a trouble-free stay.  One night, we arranged to meet a group of residents who had returned from the UK a while back, in Trelawny. They explained that the community centre we were in had been built by returnees keen to have a place where they could integrate with the locals - get to know them properly. Over games of dominoes they told us their stories. All of them spoke glowingly about their experiences of returning. But some did highlight the importance of having the right security measures in place. Yvette, who spent 45 years in England, believes that many of the killings of returning residents are not random. “It’s not like people are just going up to them and killing them,” she said. “It’s often someone they know. When you come from London we have been taught to be very trusting of neighbours, so we bring that mentality over here.” But she stressed that she wasn’t worried that anything would happen to her. Joyce, who had returned in 1998 after 40 years in the UK, said she hadn’t been expecting people to welcome her “back with open arms as a Jamaican”. “We were received as foreigners,” she said. Maybe her positive experience had something to do with the fact that her expectations of homecoming were more realistic than many other people's. The issue of belonging is an interesting one. Are returning residents Jamaican or British? Does it matter? It was a question that arose after Delroy’s murder when we asked for help from the British consulate. Delroy held both British and Jamaican citizenship and when the family came to a meeting in 2018 at the consulate, we were told that he wasn’t British - or British enough - so they couldn’t support us in the same way they would have done if he was a British national. That was a shock. On this second visit, I arranged another meeting to clarify this point. And one thing that was agreed was that my brother was British and should have been classed as that. They confirmed that in the case of murder that British identification should override everything. There were other small things that I think the consulate could have done to help us after the murder. For example, keeping in touch with the police on the island required a local SIM card for our mobile phones. But getting one requires the equivalent of a National Insurance number. That was difficult since I didn’t live or work in Jamaica. This slowed down the process of getting information because the police were reluctant to make expensive calls to a UK number. But now, as a direct result of my brother’s case, the embassy has agreed to provide British visitors who find themselves in the middle of an emergency with local SIM cards. It’s a small change but one that is massive when you’re dealing with a world of other problems. The last stop on my journey is to visit Acting Assistant Police Commissioner Fitz Bailey. I asked him about the judicial process and why there was still no trial date for the two men arrested for my brother’s murder. Fitz Bailey explained that a new judiciary minister has been appointed to deal with the country’s extensive backlog of cases. He told me that at the time of Delroy’s murder, there was a significant number of robberies against returning residents. As a result a special unit had been set up by the high command to look after returnees. Each commander should identify returning residents in their local areas and regularly check in with them. And he told me that the government’s “Welcome Home” booklet for returning residents has been adapted in recent years in response to the number of deaths. Where it used to focus on telling returning residents the practicalities of moving, it now focuses on security and staying safe on the island. For example, he says a returnee can now contact the police for a recommendation if they need work doing on their property, and the officers will consult a database of reputable workers. He admitted that nationwide, the force was 4,000 officers short but that they were trying to recruit more. But he had this message for returning residents unsure about whether to return to the island. “I still maintain that Jamaica is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Whilst we have concerns, I don’t think the concerns that we have are different to those of any other nation. So I would say Jamaica is still a safe place and your contribution to the development of this country is necessary.” Returning to the UK, I feel reassured that the police have promised to look at my brother’s case. And I know that even though Delroy is no longer with us, he has achieved what many people never managed to do. And that was to live his dream - albeit for a short time.

""There's birds singing in our towns, in our villages, and in the countryside and we can hear it because we don't have much traffic, and we don't have much aircraft going over."" A further 327 people with coronavirus have died in England, bringing the total number of confirmed hospital deaths in the country to 21,180. The museum that celebrates the life of the father of the vaccine, Dr Edward Jenner, has issued a cash appeal as it strives to survive. The charity which runs the museum - at the Gloucestershire scientist's former home - says it might not get through the year without it. The house in Berkeley is where Dr Jenner, who died in 1823, carried out pioneering research which eventually led to the creation of the worldâs first vaccination against diseases and eradicated smallpox. His ground-breaking research is being used centuries later to help find a coronavirus vaccine. Last year, the museumavoided closure after a Â£20,000 fundraising campaign. But on its website, the charity now says: âWe do not know how long we will need to remain closed for, but every passing day without income puts the museumâs future at risk. ""We know that times are hard for everyone at the moment, but we want to provide a beacon of hope through these uncertain circumstances."" A usually peaceful corner of the Kent countryside became a hive of activity on Saturday as a full-blown land and air police search took hold. Armed officers shattered the lockdown calm in the village of Ightham afterreports of a big cat apparently on the loose. But, as they arrived at the address they were scrambled to, they were met by an 85-year-old sculptor called Juliet Simpson. And very soon the penny dropped. Mrs Simpson's life-size model of a tiger, rather than the real thing, was what had sparked the alert. ""I took them down to the sculpture where they all had a good laugh and took a lot of photographs,"" she told BBC Radio Kent. And it seems this isn't the first time ""a tiger"" has caught police unawares asthis Robert Hall story from Hampshire in 2011 also explains. Local Democracy Reporting Service All coronavirus patients in Bristol should be treated exclusively at the city's Nightingale hospital to free up the main hospitals, opposition councillors say. Bristol City Council's Lib Dem group claims patients are avoiding appointments fearing they would contract the virus. Leader Gary Hopkins, said: ""They are massively handicapped in trying to deal with the backlog, with operating theatres turned over to Covid-19 and many patients frightened to come into hospital because of Covid-19 fears. ""Covid-19 is highly dangerous and infectious, and hospital staff are hard pushed enough without dealing with the dangers of internal cross infection."" The Bristol Nightingale will be used for patients from across Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Somerset as well as Bristol. NHS Nightingale Hospital Bristol chief officer Marie-Noelle Orzel said: ""Capacity still exists in hospitals throughout the Severn network region to care for patients with coronavirus, as well as other patients who may need urgent and emergency treatment, with the Nightingale Bristol standing ready if and when needed. ""A degree of flexibility has been built into the planning so that as the clinical picture and patient requirements evolve, the hospital will be able to adapt accordingly."" Â© 2025 BBC.

In a rare joint statement, the leaders of the US Congress have declined a White House offer of 1,000 rapid Covid-19 tests for lawmakers. Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Saturday they were grateful for the offer, but âCongress wants to keep directing resources to the frontline facilities where they can do the most good the most quicklyâ.

With concerts cancelled due to social distancing measures around the world, musicians are exploring new ways to reach out and connect. Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti has assembled a team of musicians to offer three weeks of free music classes online. The former BBC Young Musician of the Year winner has already offered online music classes through her own Benedetti Foundation. But the lockdown made her wonder whether they could reach an even wider audience on social media platforms, and nearly 800 people have signed up so far to teach or play. Read more here.

A video filmed at a protest in Sacramento in California on Friday shows protesters without face coverings shouting directly in the faces of police officers, who are also not wearing masks. The video is one of the most shocking to emerge from a significant number of protests in the US against the ongoing coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Others have showed armed protesters occupying state government buildings. In the Sacramento video, protesters are seen violently pushing up against a line of police officers while chanting and holding signs. The demonstrations have varied in size, from a handful of individuals with signs to thousands rallying outside state capitol buildings. Many protesters have worn Trump hats or other paraphernalia. White House taskforce expert Dr Deborah Birx told Fox News on Sunday that a recent protest of hundreds in Michigan, including some armed individuals, was âdevastatingly worrisomeâ. âWe need to protect each other at the same time weâre voicing our discontent,"" Dr Birx said. Despite the vocal and headline-grabbing protests, most Americans support the lockdown measures, according to data fromPew Research Center,external. A study last month found 66% were more concerned that states would lift restrictions too quickly, including most moderate and liberal-leaning members of Trumpâs Republicans. But 53% of more conservative Republicans expressed concerns that restrictions would not be eased quickly enough. It comes just days aftergun-toting lockdown protesters rallied inside Michigan state capitol building. See here for more background on the US lockdown protests.  This video can not be played What is contact tracing and how does it work? Millions of people in the UK will soon be asked to track their movements to limit the spread of coronavirus, by downloading an app in a few weeks. If a user develops coronavirus symptoms, they can let the app inform the NHS. Their disclosure may trigger an anonymous alert to other users with whom they recently had significant contact, asking those people to go into quarantine or be tested. The NHSX, the digital development arm of the health service, said the information gathered will only ever be used for health and research purposes, and that the app can be deleted at any time. But not everyone is happy with the government and third parties being given access to people's data. Civil rights group Liberty said the government must take the risks seriously, and should not make installing the app a condition to leaving the lockdown or returning to work. With warmer weather approaching, many Americans have been eager to get out of their homes. A number of cities have ordered residents to wear masks in public spaces where social distancing is not possible, even as some states, like Texas, begin to ease their Covid-19 restrictions. In New York City, which saw its warmest day of the year this weekend, police were also out in parks to enforce safety measures. Many people in New York headed to parks, which remain open Beaches in Texas reopened to visitors on 1 May but some activities are not allowed Despite social distancing measures being in place, crowds gathered in Washington to watch a flyover by the US Navy's Blue Angels and Air Force Thunderbirds Theatres in London and New York will struggle to reopen before
next year, according to one of the world's leading producers. âWe will be back but we need time to get back and if we donât
hear in a few weeks, I think the truth is we wonât be able to come back until
early next year. Thatâs my fear,â Sir Cameron Mackintosh told BBC Radio 2. Speaking on the Michael Ball Show, the producer of hit shows including Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera said it could take
four to five months after social distancing rules have been relaxed for major
shows to reopen. ""It looks like London and Broadway are going to be the last
to go back,"" he said. ""Each big musical has about 200 people working in that
building. Itâs why live theatre is like no other and an exhilarating experience.
We want the audience and the actors to feel safe."" Naomi Grimly, Global Affairs Correspondent Social distancing advice is not being heeded in places like markets Yemen's health system is in a state of collapse - leaving it unlikely to be able to cope with an outbreak of coronavirus. Dr Shalal Hasel is a hardworking official from the Department of Epidemiological Surveillance in the Yemeni province of Lahj. Usually his job focuses on dealing with outbreaks of cholera but now he's working round the clock to make sure Yemen is preparing properly for Covid-19. Although - at 30 - he's young and energetic, he's already sounding despondent. ""You'll know about the deteriorating health situation in Yemen - especially after conflict and war. Hospitals here are limited and not equipped to receive coronavirus cases."" Yemen currently has only 208 ventilators; another 417 are supposed to be on their way. It's a long way short of the many thousands being gathered or manufactured by developed countries. See here for more on Yemen's coronavirus battle. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the governors of neighbouring New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware have announced a regional purchasing consortium to identify equipment and suppliers together, instead of competing against each other. Rhode Island and Massachusetts are also to be part of the new coalition. Cuomo said New York state will now require all hospitals to have a 90-day stockpile of all personal protective equipment. Other key points: The trends in the UK death rate, it's variation across different areas of the country and the increase, and then dip, in testing are clearly shown here. Overall, the number of deaths per day has continued to fall overall, as the country remains in lockdown. Here, the huge rise in testing capability, and then the fall-off in the number of tests in these first few days of May, is evident. While this chart shows how the highest number of UK deaths have occurred in London, followed by the Midlands. And how the number of those who have died is greater than that in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A significant drop or weekend anomaly? Helen BriggsBBC science and health journalist Test, track and trace is the strategy that could help to ease the UK's lockdown and return the country to some kind of ânew normalâ. Hopes rest on the UKâs huge expansion of testing, with the
government exceeding its target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. Three days on and there has been âa dipâ, with figures put at 76,496 for
the 24 hours up to 09:00 BST on Sunday. When quizzed on this at the daily press briefing earlier, Michael Gove said one might expect over a weekend, with fewer people going to work, âa dip in the
amount of testing that might occurâ. The figures include both tests processed through official
labs and tests sent to homes or other sites. The tests to be conducted at home
or at satellite centres are counted
before the recipient has provided and returned their sample to the lab, with
thousands of home kits distributed by Amazon and the Royal Mail on behalf of
the government. This has raised
questions over whether counting a test put in the post is the same as a conducted test which has results. Only time will tell
if the dip today is a weekend anomaly or something more significant. Grace is a buzzcut-wearing, tattooed 26-year-old with an underlying illness. Like many other young people in the UK, she is deemed extremely vulnerable and has been asked to ""shield"" for 12 weeks to protect her from contracting Covid-19.

City Manager Norman McNickle said a number of local business staff were âthreatened with physical violence and showered with verbal abuseâ on 1 May - within three hours of the ruleâs enactment. In one case, someone threatened staff with a firearm. McNickle said those with objections mistakenly believed the requirement was unconstitutional. But it was just a show of ""respect and kindness to others"" he said. The city government still recommends wearing a mask but it is no longer mandatory.

Bethany BellNews Correspondent People walk through the old town in Salzburg The President of the Austrian Medical Association, Thomas Szekeres, has appealed to Austrians to be careful, following the easing of some of the country's lockdown restrictions. In a statement, he said he was concerned by pictures of long queues outside some shops on Saturday. He urged Austrians to continue to observe strict hygiene measures, including wearing face masks, washing hands and keeping their distance. ""We have achieved a great deal in recent weeks,"" he said, ""but we must not undo the successes of this first stage.â All shops have now re-opened in Austria and people no longer need a reason to leave home, although home working is still encouraged and people are asked to keep at least a metre apart.

When asked about that assessment live on the show, Pompeo reversed course, saying he agreed with the intelligence analysis and had âno reason to doubtâ its accuracy.

Doctors 'buy their own PPE or rely on donations',"Nearly two-thirds of doctors told the survey they are not well protected during the pandemic Almost half of doctors in England might be buying their own protective equipment or are relying on donations, according to a survey by the British Medical Association (BMA). The survey of more than 16,000 doctors also found that 65% feel they are only partly or not at all protected on the front line of the coronavirus crisis. One said the situation is ""an outrage for all staff"". The government said it is ""working round the clock"" to deliver equipment. The survey found that 48% of doctors reported having bought personal protective equipment (PPE) directly for themselves or their department, or had received donations from a charity or local firm. ""At the moment we're at the mercy of donations or purchasing them,"" Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA council, told BBC Breakfast. ""That doesn't give you security and it hasn't met the government's own commitment and promise that it will be protecting its workforce."" UK failed to stockpile crucial protective kit NHS doctor 'overwhelmed' by response to visor plea Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags He said the survey showed supplies were improving but that they had not reached a point where all staff could be assured they would be adequately protected from infection. GPs appear to be more affected by PPE shortages: 55% of family doctors said they had to source their own equipment, compared with 38% of hospital doctors. Dr Helen Kirby-Blount is a GP at Riverside Health Partnership in Retford, Nottinghamshire. She told BBC News that the partnership has not received any PPE from the government since early March. She said staff have resorted to buying their own PPE online, and are otherwise dependant on donations, including goggles and visors made by local schools. Costs continue to rise, and there is no guarantee that staff will be refunded for equipment they have bought themselves. Where practical, Dr Kirby-Blount said staff are are re-using equipment, but had so far avoided re-using aprons, gloves or surgical masks. ""We are not comfortable re-using masks,"" she said. ""We would not normally do so in any other type of situation."" About five of her staff have frequent contact with patients who may have coronavirus, including patients in care homes and those referred by the 111 phone service. Dr Kirby-Blount said ""the best PPE"" is reserved for high-risk occasions. She estimates current mask supplies will run out in 1-2 weeks. Dr Kirby-Blount believes the situation is only likely to get worse as restrictions are lifted. ""We are not expecting coronavirus to go away anytime soon,"" she says. ""Our biggest fear is what is going to happen next autumn when it will be impossible to know who has coronavirus and who has the normal types of winter bugs. Everyone will have to wear PPE."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOW A VIRUS SPREADS:An explanation LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Almost a third of doctors told the survey that they had not spoken out about PPE, staff shortages, testing or drug shortages because they did not think any action would be taken if they did. In a statement, the government said it was ""working around the clock to ensure PPE is delivered"" to healthcare staff and said that it had supplied more than a billion items since the outbreak began. On Sunday, a plane carrying ten million pairs of surgical gloves arrived from Malaysia, the latest delivery of protective equipment as the NHS tries to meet demand. Ensuring adequate protective equipment would be needed before lockdown restrictions are eased, the BMA said, as it will mean resuming normal NHS services, with greater numbers of non-coronavirus patients.

Why millions will soon be using coronavirus appsMillions in the UK will soon be asked to download an app that helps to limit coronavirus spreading.,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

Parents of Daniel Pearl launch appeal in Pakistan,"Pearl went missing in Karachi in 2002 while researching extremism The parents of murdered US journalist Daniel Pearl have filed an appeal with Pakistan's Supreme Court to reverse a ruling overturning the convictions of four men in the case. Pearl was kidnapped and beheaded in 2002 while investigating Islamist militants in Karachi, Pakistan. Last month a court in Karachi overturned the death sentence of the man convicted of masterminding the killing, and acquitted three others. The ruling was widely condemned. Pearl was the Wall Street Journal's Asia bureau chief when he was abducted and killed. A graphic video of his killing was sent to the US consulate a month later. In a video statement, his father Judea Pearl said: ""We have filed an appeal of this decision to the Pakistan Supreme Court. ""We are standing up for justice not only for our son, but for all our dear friends in Pakistan so they can live in a society free of violence and terror and raise their children in peace and harmony."" Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh seen here surrounded by Pakistani police in 2002 Their petition adds to one already filed by prosecutors. The accused mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is being held at Guantanamo Bay detention centre, has said he personally beheaded Pearl. Mohammed told US interrogators he killed the journalist with his ""blessed right hand"", according to the Pentagon. The confession was made under torture and Mohammed - whose trial date for the 11 September 2001 attacks has been set for next year - has not been charged with Pearl's murder. Pakistan cuts sentence over US journalist murder No release for man acquitted of Daniel Pearl murder Shortly after their acquittal the four men - including the convicted mastermind Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh - were re-arrested. They will be held for at least three months as the appeals play out. Sheikh's death sentence had been reduced to seven years in prison for kidnapping. The Committee to Protect Journalists voiced its support for the appeal, and said that releasing the four men in the case ""would only add to the threats facing journalists in Pakistan and deepen Pakistan's reputation as a haven for terrorists"". Pearl went missing in January 2002. He had been researching links between Islamist militant activity in Karachi and Richard Reid, who tried to blow up a passenger plane using bombs hidden in his shoes. According to prosecutors, Sheikh lured him to a meeting with an Islamic cleric. The two had built up a relationship discussing concerns about their wives, who were both pregnant at the time. Almost a month later, a video showing the 38-year-old's beheading was sent to the US consulate in Karachi. Pearl's son, Adam, was born in May 2002. Sheikh was convicted of Pearl's murder in July 2002 by an anti-terrorism court, and has been on death row since. Sheikh was born in London in 1973, where he attended public school before going on to study at the London School of Economics. He did not graduate, failing to return after driving aid to conflict-wracked Bosnia after his first year. He was arrested for involvement in the kidnapping of four tourists - three British and one American - in Delhi in 1994. Sheikh was released from prison as part of demands by militants who hijacked a plane in 1999. According to news agency Reuters, police in India later accused him of transferring money to one of the militants who flew a plane into the World Trade Center on 9/11.

Officer who 'struck and kicked boy' suspended,"This video can not be played IOPC investigates officer's 'excessive force' A police officer has been suspended after allegedly using ""unnecessary force"" when detaining a teenage boy. Footage shared widely on social media shows a West Midlands Police officer appearing to ""strike and kick"" the 15-year-old, the police watchdog said. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating the ""altercation"" in an alleyway in Newtown, Birmingham, on 21 April. The force said the officer, who has not been identified, has been suspended. In a statement, the force said the boy ""had been seen acting suspiciously"" and was told he would be searched under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The watchdog said it understood the boy's mother had made a formal complaint about the officer's actions. The IOPC said: ""Footage of the incident has been shared on social media that shows a police officer involved in an altercation with the boy, who he is seen to strike and kick."" The officer allegedly used excessive force against another member of the public in a separate incident, the watchdog said. Regional director Derrick Campbell said: ""We are aware that the footage circulated on social and other media has caused significant public concern. ""We will be carefully examining the circumstances of the incident and the officer's use of force."" The Independent Office for Police Conduct has confirmed it is investigating West Midlands Police said: ""We have suspended one of our officers following two complaints received about his conduct. ""A complaint was received after the officer stopped a teenager on 21 April in Melbourne Avenue, Newtown. ""In the ensuing incident it is alleged that the officer used unnecessary force in striking and kicking the young person."" The force said the second complaint relates to an incident on 20 April in Frederick Road, Aston, where two officers stopped a man they suspected was on a stolen bicycle. ""The man was detained and it's alleged the officer assaulted the man before he was released with no further action,"" the force said.
