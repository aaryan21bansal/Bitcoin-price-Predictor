MSPs back new Scottish independence referendumThe Scottish Parliament votes 64 to 54 to back Nicola Sturgeon's call for a new vote on independence.,"Nicola Sturgeon wants a referendum to be held in the second half of 2020 MSPs have backed calls for a new referendum on Scottish independence in a vote at Holyrood. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants to hold a new poll later this year, and wants UK ministers to agree to this. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasrejected her call for a transfer of powers, saying the 2014 vote was a ""once in a generation"" event. MSPs voted by 64 to 54 to agree that circumstances have changed since then, and that ""a referendum should be held"". The vote is not binding on the UK government, and Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told BBC Scotland that its position was ""not remotely"" changed by it. Ms Sturgeon is due to make a speech on Friday setting out the ""next steps"" in the ""campaign to secure Scotland's future as an independent nation"". Could Scotland still become independent? Indyref2: What does 'once in a generation' mean? Look back on the independence debate on Holyrood Live The Scottish government wants to hold a new referendum in the second half of 2020, pointing to Brexit as a ""material change in circumstances"". Ms Sturgeonformally requested a transfer of powers- similar to that which underpinned the 2014 referendum - after the SNP won 48 of Scotland's 59 seats in December's general election. Mr Johnson replied that he could ""not agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums"". MSPs voted to back the government motion by 64 votes to 54 In Wednesday's debate, Ms Sturgeon said MSPs should ""endorse a fundamental democratic principle - that this country has the right to choose its own future"". She put forward a motion for debate saying a referendum should be held, and calling on the UK government to agree to this happening ""on a date and in a manner determined by the Scottish Parliament"". The SNP leader said Scotland being taken out of the EU despite a 62% Remain vote north of the border was an ""affront to democracy"", adding: ""Having our future imposed on us by a UK government which is utterly contemptuous of our views simply isn't good enough."" She said there was an ""overwhelming"" democratic case for a new vote, and said the ""anti-democratic position of the opposition parties"" was because they were afraid of putting the question to the public. This was backed by Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who said the divergence between Scots voting to remain in the UK in 2014 and to remain in the EU in 2016 needed to be settled. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said he was ""not surprised"" by the vote, given the pro-independence majority at Holyrood, but said ""the position remains the same"". He told BBC Scotland: ""A generation, as was in their independence white paper, has not passed. We're leaving the EU on Friday and we need to focus on the common fisheries policy, our coastal communities, our trade deals, all the good things we can do rather than another year of referendums, rancour and division."" This is tricky ground for Nicola Sturgeon. She yearns for independence, as do her party members and the wider Yes movement. But she is aware of the practical obstacles in the path, not least the refusal of the UK government to grant the power to hold a statutory referendum. Yes, she could go to court to challenge that position - but would be unlikely to win. Yes, she could consider an unofficial referendum but fears it would be a gesture to be dismissed. However, she needs to keep the independence movement motivated, particularly within her own party ranks. Hence, the speech planned for Friday at a party rally. To repeat a point I have made more than once, Nicola Sturgeon does not want simply to hold a referendum. She wants to win one. A real one. Read more from Brian here In the chamber, Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the whole debate was really being held for the benefit of independence campaigners, with Ms Sturgeon being ""afraid to tell hard truths"" to her supporters. He said the first minister was pursuing an ""obsession at the expense of the country's real and pressing priorities"", saying the government should instead be focused on issues like education and crime. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said that ""the people of Scotland don't want another independence referendum any time soon"". He said ""nobody in this chamber really believes there will be a referendum this year"", and said Ms Sturgeon was ""using this parliament to speak to her own party, and she is not even telling them the truth"". Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie also said the debate was ""for different factions of the SNP"" rather than the country at large, arguing that ""people are sick fed up"" of constitutional division.

"Britons will not fly home from Wuhan on ThursdayThe Foreign Office says it is ""working urgently to organise a flight to the UK as soon as possible"".UK","A flight to bring about 200 British nationals back to the UK from coronavirus-hit Wuhan is unable to take off as planned on Thursday. It is understood relevant permissions from Chinese officials have not yet come through. Downing Street said it was ""working with Chinese authorities so the flight can take off as soon as possible"". The virus has caused at least 170 deaths,spreading to every Chinese regionand at least 15 other countries. The flight from Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged, had been expected to arrive on Thursday morning. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said when the passengers do return, they are due to land at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and be transported to former NHS staff accommodation in the north west of England. They will be put in ""supported isolation"" for 14 days with ""all necessary medical attention"", a Downing Street spokesman said. A small team of military medics is flying out to Wuhan to accompany passengers on the repatriation flight, the Ministry of Defence said. World 'must be on alert' over China virus - WHO Britons warned against travel to mainland China Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Passengers catch last BA flights amid virus fears In a separate development, British Airways said it had extended its cancellation of services to mainland China until 29 February, following Foreign Office guidance against ""all but essential travel"" to the country. Britons waiting for the UK government's repatriation flight said they had been told it had been put back ""provisionally"" to Friday. Several UK citizens said they faced a stark choice as family members with Chinese citizenship were not being permitted to travel by local authorities. Matt Raw lives in Wuhan with his mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, and his wife, who helps care for her. He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that his wife had been prevented from flying so the whole family was staying. Matt Raw has chosen to stay in Wuhan because his wife has been prevented from travelling He said they were also concerned about the risks of flying, having seen reports that three Japanese people on evacuation flights were found to have the virus. Adam Bridgeman said he would stay in Wuhan if his wife and one-month-old son were not allowed to fly with him. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that remaining in Wuhan with a newborn was ""a tough situation"" as they were ""not willing to take the risk"" of bringing him to hospital for routine treatment such as vaccinations. Jeff Siddle, from Northumberland, told the BBC his family faced a ""terrible dilemma"" after he and his nine-year-old daughter were told they could fly back - but not his Chinese wife, who has a permanent residency visa for the UK. This video can not be played Jeff Siddle's wife will have to stay behind in Wuhan when he leaves with their daughter As it stands, Mr Siddle's wife is not travelling back to the UK with him. ""I think there's still negotiations to get that changed, but the official line is still that she can't fly,"" he said. Chinese health authorities said there were 7,711 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country as of Wednesday night. The Foreign Office said a number of other countries' flights had also been unable to take off as planned. Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from Wuhan, with Japan, the US and the EU among those repatriating their citizens. Some 200 Japanese nationals have been flown from Wuhan and have landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Roughly 200 Americans - including workers from the local US consulate - have also left Wuhan on an evacuation flight. However, a number of UK citizens in China said local authorities had prevented members of their families from leaving because they held Chinese passports. Another UK citizen due to be flown out of Wuhan said she wastold to leave behind her three-year-old son because he has a Chinese passport. Natalie Francis works as a teacher in Wuhan Natalie Francis, originally from York, said: ""I literally had no words when I got the call."" The Foreign Office said its priority was to keep British nationals and their families together. The World Health Organization (WHO) will decide later whether the virus constitutes a global health emergency. It is a basic question, but the answer is elusive. It is far too simplistic to take the 170 deaths and the 7,711 cases and come up with a death rate of 2%. We are in the middle of the outbreak and thousands of those patients are still being treated. We don't know if they will live or die, so they can't be used in these calculations. We also don't know how many mild and undetected cases are out there. Also, the deadliness of the new virus is only one component of its threat. Flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, not because it is super-deadly, but because it is able to infect so many people. Professor Sian Griffiths said the ""shared response across the world"" to the new coronavirus was more effective than during the 2003 SARS outbreak, which she examined in an official inquiry. She told BBC Breakfast that world governments were ""taking everything very seriously in an attempt to contain the virus"", deploying greater resources and offering clear public health messages.

British lecturer Yvonne Griffiths, who is currently in a hotel in Wuhan, said she was told in the early hours of Wednesday morning that there would be a flight from Wuhan airport to the UK. ""We have to be there six to seven hours before the flight leaves, and we would have a screening from some health people here in Wuhan, and if we are not showing any symptoms then we'll be able to board that plane,"" she said. ""If we were to be suffering temperature or any other symptoms, breathing problems, then there seems to be a possibility of quarantining at this end."" By Francesca Gillett, BBC News reporter, at Heathrow Airport Daniel Maloney and his children returned from China to go to his parent's house in Scarborough Passengers on BA's last flight from Beijing walked into Heathrow Airport's arrival lounge shortly after 15.30 GMT. Some were wearing masks, others said they had just taken them off. Nearly everyone on the flight had been wearing one, passengers said - and staff at Beijing airport had carried out temperature checks. Teacher Daniel Maloney, 50, is originally from Scarborough but lives in a village north of Beijing. He came back to the UK with his two children. His village is in lockdown, he said, showing a WhatsApp group where villagers shared concerns about how to access supplies. Schools are shut at least until 17 February. ""There's only so many jigsaws we can do,"" he said. He had been stockpiling food and hired a driver to take the family to the airport early this morning. ""The motorways were empty and there were about 20 people at the airport,"" he said. Mr Maloney has already booked a doctors appointment for his children back in the UK for later this week. Also on the plane was Edinburgh University student James Marmol, from London, who has had to cut short his year studying abroad at Beijing's Peking University. ""I was kind of surprised there wasn't as many checks as I thought,"" said Mr Marmol of the BA flight.

The ""whole world needs to be on alert"" to fight the virus, the head of the World Health Organization Health Emergencies Programme has said.

In the UK, the Department of Health said on Wednesday that 130 people had been given the all-clear for the virus. Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, with Japan, the US and the EU among those repatriating their citizens.

The new coronavirus, which can cause severe acute respiratory infection, is a particular risk for elderly people and those with pre-existing illnesses. How are coronavirus patients treated? Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? The sharp rise in cases is in part attributed to increased awareness, monitoring and testing in recent days. The virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan. There is no specific cure or vaccine. It is a basic question, but the answer is elusive. It is far too simplistic to take the 130 deaths and the 6,000 cases and come up with a death rate of 2%. We are in the middle of the outbreak and thousands of those patients are still being treated.

Passengers catch last BA flights amid virus fears This video can not be played Like others who've been in Hubei province, the BBC's Stephen McDonell is staying away from the office for two weeks The number of deaths from the virus has risen to 132 in China, Chinese authorities said on Wednesday. The ""whole world needs to be on alert"" to fight the virus, the head of the World Health Organization Health Emergencies Programme has said. Dr Michael Ryan praised China's response to the outbreak and said the ""chains of transmission can still be interrupted"". The WHO will meet on Thursday to discuss whether the virus constitutes a global health emergency. This video can not be played Road blocks and ghost towns: Inside the province where the virus originated Four cases have been confirmed in Germany, making it the second European country to report cases, after France. The United Arab Emirates has also confirmed its first cases of the virus in a family who recently returned to the UAE from Wuhan. In the UK, the Department of Health said on Wednesday that 130 people had been given the all-clear for the virus. Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, with Japan, the US and the EU among those repatriating their citizens. Australia plans to quarantine its evacuees on Christmas Island, 2,000km (1,200 miles) from the mainland.  132Deaths 5,974Confirmed cases 9,239Suspected cases 16Other countries with confirmed cases An expert from China's National Health Commission said it could take 10 more days for the outbreak to peak. The new coronavirus, which can cause severe acute respiratory infection, is a particular risk for elderly people and those with pre-existing illnesses. How are coronavirus patients treated? Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? The sharp rise in cases is in part attributed to increased awareness, monitoring and testing in recent days. The virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan. There is no specific cure or vaccine. It is a basic question, but the answer is elusive. It is far too simplistic to take the 130 deaths and the 6,000 cases and come up with a death rate of 2%. We are in the middle of the outbreak and thousands of those patients are still being treated. We don't know if they will live or die, so they can't be used in these calculations. We also don't know how many mild and undetected cases are out there. Also, the deadliness of the new virus is only one component of its threat. 'Flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, not because it is super-deadly, but because it is able to infect so many people.

MSPs back new Scottish independence referendum,"Nicola Sturgeon wants a referendum to be held in the second half of 2020 MSPs have backed calls for a new referendum on Scottish independence in a vote at Holyrood. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants to hold a new poll later this year, and wants UK ministers to agree to this. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasrejected her call for a transfer of powers, saying the 2014 vote was a ""once in a generation"" event. MSPs voted by 64 to 54 to agree that circumstances have changed since then, and that ""a referendum should be held"". The vote is not binding on the UK government, and Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told BBC Scotland that its position was ""not remotely"" changed by it. Ms Sturgeon is due to make a speech on Friday setting out the ""next steps"" in the ""campaign to secure Scotland's future as an independent nation"". Could Scotland still become independent? Indyref2: What does 'once in a generation' mean? Look back on the independence debate on Holyrood Live The Scottish government wants to hold a new referendum in the second half of 2020, pointing to Brexit as a ""material change in circumstances"". Ms Sturgeonformally requested a transfer of powers- similar to that which underpinned the 2014 referendum - after the SNP won 48 of Scotland's 59 seats in December's general election. Mr Johnson replied that he could ""not agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums"". MSPs voted to back the government motion by 64 votes to 54 In Wednesday's debate, Ms Sturgeon said MSPs should ""endorse a fundamental democratic principle - that this country has the right to choose its own future"". She put forward a motion for debate saying a referendum should be held, and calling on the UK government to agree to this happening ""on a date and in a manner determined by the Scottish Parliament"". The SNP leader said Scotland being taken out of the EU despite a 62% Remain vote north of the border was an ""affront to democracy"", adding: ""Having our future imposed on us by a UK government which is utterly contemptuous of our views simply isn't good enough."" She said there was an ""overwhelming"" democratic case for a new vote, and said the ""anti-democratic position of the opposition parties"" was because they were afraid of putting the question to the public. This was backed by Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who said the divergence between Scots voting to remain in the UK in 2014 and to remain in the EU in 2016 needed to be settled. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said he was ""not surprised"" by the vote, given the pro-independence majority at Holyrood, but said ""the position remains the same"". He told BBC Scotland: ""A generation, as was in their independence white paper, has not passed. We're leaving the EU on Friday and we need to focus on the common fisheries policy, our coastal communities, our trade deals, all the good things we can do rather than another year of referendums, rancour and division."" This is tricky ground for Nicola Sturgeon. She yearns for independence, as do her party members and the wider Yes movement. But she is aware of the practical obstacles in the path, not least the refusal of the UK government to grant the power to hold a statutory referendum. Yes, she could go to court to challenge that position - but would be unlikely to win. Yes, she could consider an unofficial referendum but fears it would be a gesture to be dismissed. However, she needs to keep the independence movement motivated, particularly within her own party ranks. Hence, the speech planned for Friday at a party rally. To repeat a point I have made more than once, Nicola Sturgeon does not want simply to hold a referendum. She wants to win one. A real one. Read more from Brian here In the chamber, Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the whole debate was really being held for the benefit of independence campaigners, with Ms Sturgeon being ""afraid to tell hard truths"" to her supporters. He said the first minister was pursuing an ""obsession at the expense of the country's real and pressing priorities"", saying the government should instead be focused on issues like education and crime. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said that ""the people of Scotland don't want another independence referendum any time soon"". He said ""nobody in this chamber really believes there will be a referendum this year"", and said Ms Sturgeon was ""using this parliament to speak to her own party, and she is not even telling them the truth"". Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie also said the debate was ""for different factions of the SNP"" rather than the country at large, arguing that ""people are sick fed up"" of constitutional division.

Norton Motorcycles goes into administration,"Norton bikes are used in the Isle of Man TT to this day The famous British motorbike company Norton Motorcycles has gone into administration. The Leicestershire firm was reportedly struggling to pay a tax bill and faced a winding-up order. Founded in 1898, Norton is one of the last remaining British motorcycle brands and best known for its involvement in motorsport. The administration puts about 100 jobs at its Castle Donington factory in question. Lee Causer, of administrators BDO, said: ""We are taking all necessary steps to ensure that customers, staff and suppliers are supported through the administration process. ""Our job is to determine and execute the most appropriate strategy as swiftly as possible to protect creditors' interests, bearing in mind the need to minimise distress for all parties."" A 1962 Norton 650 SS Founded in Birmingham, Norton began making motorbikes in 1902 and soon became associated with races such as the Isle of Man TT. Among its most famous models are the Dominator and the Commando, while its Norton Interpol was used by UK police in the 1980s. Vintage models are now considered collectors' items. Its bikes have also featured in hit films such as the James Bond movie Spectre and the Che Guevara memoir, The Motorcycle Diaries. Norton Motorcycles' 122 years of speed Norton fell into financial difficulties in 2008 but was rescued by entrepreneur and property developer Stuart Garner who revived the business. Mr Garner said last May that the firm was performing strongly and planned to open a new factory. However, this January hetold local newspaper Birmingham Live,externalthat Norton owed tax authorities Â£300,000 and could be liquidated if it was not given more time to pay. Two other of Mr Garner's companies are also in administration, including his 42-bedroom Priest House Hotel in Castle Donington.

Man found starved to death after benefits stopped,"Errol Graham had a history of depression which included an overdose Relatives of a man who starved to death after his benefits were stopped have said the system is ""not fit for purpose"". Errol Graham, 57, weighed four-and-a-half stone (30kg) when his body was found by bailiffs who broke into his Nottingham council flat to evict him. An inquest found his loss of income was likely to have ""caused huge distress"". His daughter-in-law Alison Turner said it was ""heartbreaking... it's horrific for someone to die like that."" The case was raised in the Commons by Debbie Abrahams MP, where she called for an independent inquiry into cases where people had died after Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) reviews of their care. Mr Graham's last contact with officials was when approached about rent arrears The inquest into Mr Graham's death in June 2018 heard he'd had a history of depression. His GP and the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust agreed to have him sectioned in 2015, but he returned home to Pine View flats, Radford after a matter of days. After this he was rarely seen, missing several GP appointments and refusing approaches from mental health teams. Mr Graham also ignored repeated contact from the DWP and his employment and support allowance (ESA) was stopped in August 2017. This also affected his housing benefit, which ceased on 10 October. The last official contact was with housing provider Nottingham City Homes, which heard him shouting and punching a door during a visit in February 2018. PC Emily Dunn told the inquest there were no signs Mr Graham had been injured but he ""looked very thin"". She added there was no food in the property, other than a couple of tins of fish in the cupboard which were five years out of date. What is universal credit? Benefits officials' apology over death Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The flat had no gas and probably no electricity, the inquest heard, with ""significant mail"" by the front door. The medical cause of death was recorded as starvation. Assistant coroner Dr Elizabeth Didcock said: ""The sudden loss of all income, and the threat of eviction that followed from it, will have caused huge distress and worry, and significant financial hardship. ""It is likely that this loss of income, and housing, were the final and devastating stressors, that had a significant effect on his mental health. ""The safety net that should surround vulnerable people like Errol in our society had holes within it."" MP Debbie Abrahams said the treatment of some claimants was a ""serious concern"" Miss Turner told the BBC: ""It is heartbreaking, horrific, for someone to die like that. The failure he suffered, he didn't deserve it. ""It is shocking. The system is not fit for purpose. ""He was without money for six to eight months. ""Errol could not physically bring himself to talk to strangers or ask for that level of help and if he hadn't have lost it he would still be here today."" Sophie Corlett, from mental health charity Mind, said: ""It is the most vulnerable who we hear are slipping through the net. ""This gentleman and many people have lifelong conditions that are unlikely to change and yet they are recalled again and again for face to face assessments which people find very challenging."" The DWP said it was establishing a serious case panel to review its work. A spokesman added: ""This is a tragic, complex case and our sympathies are with Mr Graham's family.""

Boeing reports its first loss in two decades,"Boeing has reported its first annual loss in more than two decades as the 737 Max crisis continues to hit the firm. The planemaker was forced to ground the aircraft, which had been its best seller, in March last year after two deadly crashes that killed 346 people. Now it has said that it expects the bill for the grounding to surpass $18bn (Â£13.8bn). That has hurt the firm's finances, pushing it to a $636m loss for 2019. Sales were worse than expected in the final three months of last year when the planemaker booked $17.9bn in revenues. That was much lower than $21.7bn that had been expected by analysts. Boeing: US regulator 'pleased' with 737 progress Boeing delays 737 Max return date to July ""We recognize we have a lot of work to do,"" said Boeing's newly-appointed boss David Calhoun. He replaced Dennis Muilenburg who was fired late last year following his handling of the crisis at the company. ""We are focused on returning the 737 Max to service safely and restoring the long-standing trust that the Boeing brand represents with the flying public,"" said Mr Calhoun. = David Calhoun (L) in 2004 has replaced Dennis Muilenburg as chief executive Samira Hussain, BBC business reporter, New York This was not necessarily the best first earnings report for the newly appointed chief executive of Boeing. There were some eye-catching headlines: more than $18bn in costs associated with the Max crisis; it's first loss in more than two decades; plummeting sales. Boss Dan Calhoun's primary focus is to first get the planes back in the air quickly and safely, making fixes, giving pilots extra training and convincing regulators. But he also needs to re-establish broader confidence in Boeing planes - and that will be far more difficult. Yes, Boeing has been in communication with its airline customers about when the jets may be airworthy again. But how do you convince the public that the aircraft responsible for 346 deaths, countless investigations and billions of dollars in fixes is safe to board? The cost of 737 Max crisis was thought to have reached around $9bn but Wednesday's announcement suggests the final bill could be more than double that. The return to service of the 737 Max has been repeatedly delayed. And last week, Boeing said it did not expect the fleet to return to the skies before the summer. Boeing has been working on fixes to try to get the 737 Max planes back up and running. And in an interview with CNBC, Mr Calhoun said he expected the firm would meet deadlines set by regulators. Meanwhile, he said that - despite the two fatal crashes - he did not plan to rebrand the 737 Max. The company had a total backlog in orders worth $464.4bn. Boeing's share price climbed on Wednesday, soaring by more than 4%.

European Parliament approves Brexit agreement,"This video can not be played Tears, hugs and Auld Lang Syne in EU Parliament Members of the European Parliament have overwhelmingly backed the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. MEPs ratified the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by 621 votes to 49 following an emotional debate in Brussels. After the vote, MEPs marked the UK's exit by singing Auld Lang Syne. Several British MEPs said they hoped the UK would return one day although Eurosceptics, including the Brexit Party's Nigel Farage, used their final speeches to tear into the EU. The UK is due to leave the bloc at 23:00 GMT on Friday. Ratification of thewithdrawal agreement, agreed by the UK and EU in October, was not in doubt after it easily cleared its committee stage last week. As it happened: An emotional send-off for Britain New Scottish MEP sworn in - for four days Tears and relief as the UK's MEPs bid goodbye Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit Signing the letter confirming the EU's consent, the Parliament's president, David Sassoli, said the two sides must heed the words of the late Labour MP Jo Cox when approaching their future relationship and recognise ""there is more that unites us than divides us."" ""You are leaving the EU but you will always be part of Europeâ¦It is very hard to say goodbye. That is why, like my colleagues, I will say arrivederci."" This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""We will never be far"" Wednesday's session saw those on either side of the Brexit debate, including the UK's 73 MEPs, celebrate or lament the end of British EU membership. Some MEPs marked the occasion with songs - others wore ""always united"" scarves. The Parliament's Brexit spokesman, Guy Verhofstadt, said it was ""sad to see a country leaving that has twice given its blood to liberate Europe"". He added that British MEPs had brought ""wit, charm, and intelligence"" as well as ""stubbornness"", and would be missed. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said ratification of the withdrawal deal was ""only a first step"" towards a new partnership between the EU and the UK. The two should ""join forces"" in areas such as climate change, she said, and seek a close partnership following the UK's exit on Friday. ""We will always love you and we will not be far,"" she told the UK in closing. The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also wished the UK well, saying the bloc would approach talks on the future relationship with ""patience"" and ""objectivity"" while defending its members' interests. This video can not be played Green MEP: ""One day I will be back"" This video can not be played The MEP's last sitting in the European Parliament On the other side, though, Conservative MEP and prominent Eurosceptic Daniel Hannan said opinion in Britain turned against the bloc when it became clear ""the aspiration was to have the EU as a quasi-state"". ""If at any stage Britain had been able to have a trade-only relationship that would have been enough,"" he went on, but added: ""You are losing a bad tenant and gaining a good neighbour."" Mr Farage - who has been campaigning for the UK's exit since before he was first elected to the Brussels Parliament in 1999 - used his final speech to excoriate the EU. ""I want Brexit to start a debate right across Europe - what do we want from Europe?"" he said, arguing that ""trade, friendship, co-operation and reciprocity"" between nations could be achieved without ""all of these institutions and all of this power"". He and his fellow Brexit Party MEPs waved Union flags before walking out of the chamber en masse. The S&D coalition in the European Parliament put up a sign aimed at departing British MEPs - ""au revoir"" literally meaning ""goodbye until we meet again"" A tearful Molly Scott Cato was applauded and hugged by her colleagues after she spoke of her ""grief and regret"" at Brexit and the hope she would return to the European Parliament ""one day"". ""While now is not the time to campaign to rejoin the EU, we must keep the dream alive,"" the Green Party MEP said. Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts said the EU must learn lessons from the UK's decision to leave. He said the bloc had to ""regain the hearts and minds of European citizens"" by focusing on what it could do for the many, not the few. Some MEPs wore ""half-and-half scarves"" to mark the UK's final day Earlier, the S&D coalition, which houses Labour's 10 MEPs, displayed a sign aimed at departing British members, which read: ""It's not goodbye, it's au revoir."" On Tuesday evening, several MEPs in the Green group also held a ceremony to mark the UK's departure. While Brexit Party MEPs spoke of their joy and relief at leaving, others shared messages of sadness on social media as they prepared to vote for the last time. The Green Party's Alexandra Phillips tweeted: ""I'm devastated to be leaving the best job in the world. I get to make real change every day while being surrounded by 27 different languages and cultures."" Liberal Democrats shared pictures of gifts from the pro-European Renew Europe group.

After the UK leaves, there will be an 11-month transition period in which the two sides hope to negotiate their future economic relationship. Trade talks are expected to begin in earnest in early March. The European Parliament will also get a say in ratifying any future trade deal. The UK has insisted talks should not extend beyond 31 December 2020 when atransition period- which will see the UK follow EU rules - comes to an end. President Sassoli told CNN on Tuesday that the timetable for a deal was tight. He said the UK's exit would be ""painful"" for the bloc but building a new partnership based upon friendly co-operation and mutual interests was now essential.

Pompeo urges UK to 'relook' at Huawei decision,"Mike Pompeo urged the UK to prioritise its security interests when dealing with Chinese firm Huawei on his visit to the UK in May last year US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged the UK to reconsider allowing Huawei to have a role in its 5G system, ahead of talks with Boris Johnson. He told reporters the UK had a chance to ""relook"" at the decision, stressing the US needed to be sure its allies had ""trusted"" information networks. The US believes the Chinese firm's equipment poses a spying risk. But Culture Secretary Baroness Morgan said it ""in no way"" affects the ability of the UK to share classified data. Ahead of his meeting with the PM, Mr Pompeo held talks with his UK counterpart, Dominic Raab, on Wednesday evening. The Foreign Office said Mr Raab reiterated his ""disappointment"" at the US decision toreject an extradition request for Anne Sacoolas- the diplomat's wide suspected of causing the death of Harry Dunn by dangerous driving. Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash in Northamptonshire in August, which led to suspect Ms Sacoolas leaving for the US under diplomatic immunity. What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Huawei set for limited role in UK 5G networks How UK's Huawei decision affects rest of the world Dominic Raab ""emphasised the importance of delivering justice for Harry Dunn and his family"" to Mike Pompeo, the Foreign Office said The US had repeatedly warned that giving Huawei a role in 5G could allow the Chinese government a ""back door"" into the telecoms network through which they could carry out espionage or cyber attacks. Ahead of his arrival in London, Mr Pompeo told reporters the US wanted to ""work with"" the UK following the National Security Council's decision to give Huawei a role in spite of those warnings. This video can not be played Baroness Morgan: UK has ""got the expertise"" in Huawei ""We were urging them (the UK) to make a decision that was different than the one they made and we'll have a conversation about how to proceed,"" he said. ""There is also a chance for the UK to relook at this as implementation moves forward, and then it's important for everyone to know there is also real work being done by lots of private companies inside the US and in Europe to make sure that there are true competitors to Huawei."" He added: ""We will make sure that when American information passes across a network we are confident that that network is a trusted one."" The UK has insisted the firm will be barred from sensitive locations, such as nuclear sites and military bases and its share of the market will be capped at 35%. Baroness Morgan also told BBC Breakfast the UK had expertise is mitigating risks when using Huawei's technology, as it was already part of existing 4G networks - unlike in the US. She said: ""We want to see the roll-out of 5G... for the growth of our economy and productivity, but in making this decision, we have been very clear we will not compromise on national security. This video can not be played How will the Huawei 5G deal affect me? ""We obviously had a number of conversations with the US [who] have made their views clear. But we have got that expertise, we have had that oversight of Huawei... which gives our agencies the ability to give the assurance that having them involved in the periphery of the network does not present the security challenge I think others have worried about."" The UK's decision also faced a criticism from some senior Conservative MPs after Mr Raab made a statement about it in the Commons. Tom Tugendhat, former chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, tweeted that the government's ""statement leaves many concerns and does not close the UK's networks to a frequently malign international actor"". But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace downplayed such concerns, telling the BBC the UK should not be ""paranoid"" that the decision would lead to ""Big Brother from China watching us"". Asked about how the US might react Mr Wallace said: ""I don't know how they'll react... they've made their concerns clear. ""We understand that - we respect that, we've given them lots of assurances that the intelligence they share and how they share it."" A series of US congressional figures called on the UK to reconsider, saying the decision could be an obstacle to a post-Brexit trade deal between the US and UK, as well as raising questions over security co-operation. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, called for a ""thorough review"" of intelligence sharing with the UK. ""I fear London has freed itself from Brussels only to cede sovereignty to Beijing,"" he said. The decision gave China a foothold to carry out ""pervasive espionage"" on the UK and gave it ""increased economic and political leverage"", he said. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who is one of the president's most committed defenders, said he was ""very concerned"" and urged the UK to think again. ""This decision has the potential to jeopardise US-UK intelligence sharing agreements and could greatly complicate a US-UK free trade agreement,""he tweeted,external.

European ParliamentBrussels European Parliament President David Maria Sassoli signs the letter confirming the European Parliament's consent to the withdrawal agreement European ParliamentBrussels Speaking after the vote, European Parliament President David Sassoli says MEPs are ""deeply saddened"" to see the UK leave the EU. Paying tribute to the departing UK members, he says: ""We truly appreciate all the work you have done over the last few years"". ""You are leaving the European Union, but you will still be part of Europe"". Quoting Labour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered during the Brexit campaign, he adds: ""We have a lot more in common that what divides us."" European ParliamentBrussels The European Parliament has voted to ratify the Brexit
withdrawal agreement by 621 votes to 49, with 13 abstentions. European ParliamentBrussels Continuing, Michel Barnier says the EU will ""firmly defend"" its interests during the next stage of negotiations on the future relationship after Brexit. He thanks British MEPs who have contributed to the ""European project"" down the years. Switching into English, he say he will like to wish the UK well. European ParliamentBrussels Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier now speaks. He says the debate was a ""moving"" one. ""I am very touched,"" he adds. ""We continue to regret the decision [of the UK to leave the EU] but we respect it,"" he says. He argues that the withdrawal agreement ensures the UK leaves the EU in ""an orderly fashion"". He says seeking to protect EU citizens from uncertainty has ""always been our priority"". Boris Johnson is to address the nation at 2200 GMT on Friday, on his Facebook page. The PM told viewers of his latest Facebook question time about his plans for celebrating Brexit night  in a way that is ""respectful of the scale of the event"" and as a ""moment for all of us to come together in a spirit of confidence"". The UK, of course, formally leaves at 23:00 GMT. European ParliamentBrussels Labour's Theresa Griffin calls Brexit a ""political tragedy"" that will ""diminish our country's standing in the world"". She says she will ""continue to believe"" the country would be better off as an EU member, and will ""keep the faith that one day we can come back"". Liberal Democrat MEP Judith Bunting says the withdrawal agreement is a ""bad deal for Britain"" that will worsen rights for workers. She adds she will ""not be blackmailed by Boris Johnson"" into supporting the Brexit agreement. European ParliamentBrussels ""I give you my word the Scottish government will continue to protect the interests of all EU citizens who have chosen to make Scotland their home,"" says SNP MEP Aileen McLeod. She says she hopes the European Parliament will welcome Scotland back if, one day, the country becomes independent and opts to re-join. ""I hope very much you will leave a light on for Scotland,"" she adds. European ParliamentBrussels Liberal Democrat MEP Luisa Porritt says she will be voting against the withdrawal agreement later, calling Brexit a ""regressive, reckless right-wing project"". She says while the UK's exit is now inevitable, she doesn't believe it will be permanent. ""See you soon, dear friends,"" she concludes in French. European ParliamentBrussels There's a tearful intervention from Green MEP Molly Scott Cato, who says the UK's departure is a matter of ""grief and regret"". She calls for compassion to be shown to EU citizens, and the revival of friendship and twinning arrangements which ""thrived"" in the decades before the UK joined the EU. She says now is not the time to start a campaign for the UK to rejoin, but adds: ""We must keep the dream alive, especially for young people."" She says she hopes one day the UK returns ""to the heart of Europe"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I think one of the problems in the past, certainly before
the referendum, is that individuals were often treated as though they were just
interchangeable units of economic production, rather than people being given a
sense of dignity and a sense of pride and having their attachment, both to
their country and to where they grew up recognised,"" he told Laura Kuenssberg. ""In the past one of the
stories that we've told is, people need to get up and get on, to get on their
bike. ""One of the things that we're going to try to do is to demonstrate that
you do not need to leave the community that you love, in order to be happy and
successful. ""And, of course, part of that is economics, but part of it also is a
different approach to valuing people, a different political approach."" You might remember it was then Conservative Employment Secretary Norman Tebbit who spoke in 1981 of how his how his father ""got on his bike and looked for work"" during the Depression - rather than expecting work to come to him. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg has been speaking to Michael Gove - the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, also considered to be one of the most important ministers in the cabinet. It's a wide-ranging interview, touching on Brexit, the Conservative Party and the future of the country among many other topics. On the latter, he says: We've got to change the geography of this country. ""We've
got to make sure that some of the things which drive productivity growth in
other parts of the country - that's investment in infrastructure and investment
in skills - is at the heart of everything that the government does. ""But there's something broader than that as well. ""When you've got an electoral coalition like the one that Boris has assembled,
then it's partly about making sure that people feel a sense of belonging, a
sense of pride in their community, alongside pride in their country."" European ParliamentBrussels Labour MEP Richard Corbett says he will be voting against the withdrawal agreement, arguing it is ""bad for Britain and bad for Europe"". ""They said it would be good for Britain and the economy - the opposite is true,"" he says. ""That is why the British public voted 52% for parties demanding a second referendum in the general election. ""Brexit does not have the wholehearted consent of the British people."" He predicts that the UK will return to the EU, arguing that young people are opposed to Brexit. European ParliamentBrussels In his final speech as an MEP, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says the moment of Brexit at 23.00 GMT on Friday will mark a ""point of no return"". âOnce weâve left, we're never coming back,"" he says. He adds that he hopes Brexit will mean ""the end of this project"". ""What we've proved is the British are too big to bully."" At the end of his speech, the Brexit Party delegation wave miniature union flags and cheer, prompting a rebuke from Irish MEP Mairead McGuinness, who is chairing the debate. However Mr Farage responds ""that's it, it's all over, finished,"" before leaving the chamber. European ParliamentBrussels Veteran Conservative Euroscpetic MEP Daniel Hannan, who was elected to the assembly in 1999, says the 1992 Maastricht Treaty was a turning point in British EU membership. He adds that a ""parting of ways"" became ""inevitable"" after David Cameron's renegotiation of British membership ahead of the 2016 referendum. He says the EU, however, is ""losing a bad tenant, but gaining a good neighbour"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Seriously ill wait more than hour for ambulanceHeart attack and stroke patients are among those facing long delays for crews to arrive, BBC finds.HealthComments","Heart attack, stroke and burns victims are among the seriously ill and injured patients waiting over an hour for an ambulance to arrive in England and Wales, a BBC investigation shows. The delays for these 999 calls - meant to be reached in 18 minutes on average - put lives at risk, experts say. The problems affect one in 16 ""emergency"" cases in England - with significant delays reported in Wales. NHS bosses blamed rising demand and delays handing over patients at A&E. Many ambulance services have increased staffing - only to find the extra resource largely being swallowed up by the rise in delays faced by crews queuing outside hospitals. This has meant they have had to prioritise the most serious ""immediately life-threatening"" cases, such as cardiac arrests. But these represent just a small proportion of the high-priority 999 calls. Some of the longest waits for the next most serious level of calls, including those having fits as well as heart attack, stroke and burns victims, exceeded five hours. This video can not be played Mark Mitchell says his partner Derrin died while waiting for an ambulance Derrin Cozart, 55, was at home in Northumberland on his own last year when he collapsed. He came to and rang 999. That was the last time anyone spoke to him. It was over an hour before an ambulance crew arrived. By the time they did, he was dead. He had suffered a gastrointestinal haemorrhage, which causes internal bleeding. Thirty minutes after his call the ambulance service had rung back, but could not get hold of him. It took another 48 minutes for paramedics to reach him - two crews had to be diverted while they were on their way. His partner, Mark Mitchell, was out of the country on business at the time. ""It was devastating. I've been left wondering if the ambulance had got there more quickly he may have survived. ""We just don't know - and that's heartbreaking."" The North East Ambulance Service said a full investigation was being carried out into the case. This video can not be played Waiting for ambulances: ""The system is beyond a joke"" The BBC investigation, which used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain data, has also uncovered other worrying cases. These include 70-year-old Dave Jones, from Shropshire, who waited more than two hours for paramedics to arrive after suffering a heart attack. His daughter, Rebecca Jones, said they were ""frantic with worry"" while they waited for the ambulance. ""We called back several times to check he had not been forgotten. The NHS is just so stretched - the staff are doing the best they can in impossible circumstances."" In a joint statement, the hospital and ambulance trust apologised for the delays. Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, said patients were being ""let down badly at their moment of greatest need"" and getting a quick response could be ""a matter of life or death"". She said the delays were ""undoubtedly"" related to the sustained underfunding of the NHS. Mark MacDonald, of the Stroke Association, described the findings as ""alarming"", saying a quick assessment and transfer to hospital for brain scans was vital if a patient was going to make a good recovery. ""When stroke strikes, part of your brain shuts down. And so does a part of you. Around two million neurons are lost every minute that a stroke is untreated."" The BBC asked for long waits for the two highest priority groups of 999 calls - the immediately life-threatening category ones and the emergency category two cases - from the start of 2018 when a new system of measuring response times came in. Two of England's 10 ambulance services - the West Midlands and East of England - refused to provide the information. Long waits for immediately life-threatening cases were unusual - just one in 270 cases took longer than 30 minutes to reach. That works out at less than 40 a week. But the records for category two call logs showed long waits for these emergencies were much more common. The data showed there were 385,000 waits of over an hour from January 2018 to September 2019 out of just over six million incidents responded to. That works out at more than 4,000 a week on average - or one in 16 calls. East Midlands Ambulance Service had the greatest number of long delays - one in eight calls took over an hour. Director of operations Ben Holdaway said crews were often facing long waits at A&E to hand over patients which means they ""haven't been able to get back on the road quickly"". ""Every part of the system wants to tackle these issues, but it's clear we need more staff and beds and well-functioning social care."" In Wales there were more than 1,000 cases a week on average - nearly a quarter of callouts - although their second-tier emergency calls category is a little broader than England's and includes less urgent cases like diabetes complications which could account for some of the long waits. Lee Brooks, from the Welsh Ambulance Service, accepted that some patients were waiting too long, describing it as as ""frustrating for staff as it is for patients"". Ministers are in the process of setting up a taskforce to tackle the delays. Comparable data was not available in Scotland or Northern Ireland. NHS national ambulance adviser Anthony Marsh said: ""It is not easy to reach everyone as quickly as we would all like. All our staff are working flat out."" The Department of Health and Social Care in England said the government was increasing funding for the health service and had set aside a dedicated pot to invest in ambulance services. It also said it was investing in the workforce - from September student paramedics will be entitled to a Â£5,000-a-year grant to support them during their studies.

Man found starved to death after benefits stoppedErrol Graham weighed four-and-a-half stone when bailiffs found his body in his council flat.Nottingham,"Errol Graham had a history of depression which included an overdose Relatives of a man who starved to death after his benefits were stopped have said the system is ""not fit for purpose"". Errol Graham, 57, weighed four-and-a-half stone (30kg) when his body was found by bailiffs who broke into his Nottingham council flat to evict him. An inquest found his loss of income was likely to have ""caused huge distress"". His daughter-in-law Alison Turner said it was ""heartbreaking... it's horrific for someone to die like that."" The case was raised in the Commons by Debbie Abrahams MP, where she called for an independent inquiry into cases where people had died after Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) reviews of their care. Mr Graham's last contact with officials was when approached about rent arrears The inquest into Mr Graham's death in June 2018 heard he'd had a history of depression. His GP and the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust agreed to have him sectioned in 2015, but he returned home to Pine View flats, Radford after a matter of days. After this he was rarely seen, missing several GP appointments and refusing approaches from mental health teams. Mr Graham also ignored repeated contact from the DWP and his employment and support allowance (ESA) was stopped in August 2017. This also affected his housing benefit, which ceased on 10 October. The last official contact was with housing provider Nottingham City Homes, which heard him shouting and punching a door during a visit in February 2018. PC Emily Dunn told the inquest there were no signs Mr Graham had been injured but he ""looked very thin"". She added there was no food in the property, other than a couple of tins of fish in the cupboard which were five years out of date. What is universal credit? Benefits officials' apology over death Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The flat had no gas and probably no electricity, the inquest heard, with ""significant mail"" by the front door. The medical cause of death was recorded as starvation. Assistant coroner Dr Elizabeth Didcock said: ""The sudden loss of all income, and the threat of eviction that followed from it, will have caused huge distress and worry, and significant financial hardship. ""It is likely that this loss of income, and housing, were the final and devastating stressors, that had a significant effect on his mental health. ""The safety net that should surround vulnerable people like Errol in our society had holes within it."" MP Debbie Abrahams said the treatment of some claimants was a ""serious concern"" Miss Turner told the BBC: ""It is heartbreaking, horrific, for someone to die like that. The failure he suffered, he didn't deserve it. ""It is shocking. The system is not fit for purpose. ""He was without money for six to eight months. ""Errol could not physically bring himself to talk to strangers or ask for that level of help and if he hadn't have lost it he would still be here today."" Sophie Corlett, from mental health charity Mind, said: ""It is the most vulnerable who we hear are slipping through the net. ""This gentleman and many people have lifelong conditions that are unlikely to change and yet they are recalled again and again for face to face assessments which people find very challenging."" The DWP said it was establishing a serious case panel to review its work. A spokesman added: ""This is a tragic, complex case and our sympathies are with Mr Graham's family.""

MSPs to back new independence referendum,"Nicola Sturgeon wants a referendum to be held in the second half of 2020 MSPs have backed calls for a new referendum on Scottish independence in a vote at Holyrood. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants to hold a new poll later this year, and wants UK ministers to agree to this. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasrejected her call for a transfer of powers, saying the 2014 vote was a ""once in a generation"" event. MSPs voted by 64 to 54 to agree that circumstances have changed since then, and that ""a referendum should be held"". The vote is not binding on the UK government, and Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told BBC Scotland that its position was ""not remotely"" changed by it. Ms Sturgeon is due to make a speech on Friday setting out the ""next steps"" in the ""campaign to secure Scotland's future as an independent nation"". Could Scotland still become independent? Indyref2: What does 'once in a generation' mean? Look back on the independence debate on Holyrood Live The Scottish government wants to hold a new referendum in the second half of 2020, pointing to Brexit as a ""material change in circumstances"". Ms Sturgeonformally requested a transfer of powers- similar to that which underpinned the 2014 referendum - after the SNP won 48 of Scotland's 59 seats in December's general election. Mr Johnson replied that he could ""not agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums"". MSPs voted to back the government motion by 64 votes to 54 In Wednesday's debate, Ms Sturgeon said MSPs should ""endorse a fundamental democratic principle - that this country has the right to choose its own future"". She put forward a motion for debate saying a referendum should be held, and calling on the UK government to agree to this happening ""on a date and in a manner determined by the Scottish Parliament"". The SNP leader said Scotland being taken out of the EU despite a 62% Remain vote north of the border was an ""affront to democracy"", adding: ""Having our future imposed on us by a UK government which is utterly contemptuous of our views simply isn't good enough."" She said there was an ""overwhelming"" democratic case for a new vote, and said the ""anti-democratic position of the opposition parties"" was because they were afraid of putting the question to the public. This was backed by Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who said the divergence between Scots voting to remain in the UK in 2014 and to remain in the EU in 2016 needed to be settled. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said he was ""not surprised"" by the vote, given the pro-independence majority at Holyrood, but said ""the position remains the same"". He told BBC Scotland: ""A generation, as was in their independence white paper, has not passed. We're leaving the EU on Friday and we need to focus on the common fisheries policy, our coastal communities, our trade deals, all the good things we can do rather than another year of referendums, rancour and division."" This is tricky ground for Nicola Sturgeon. She yearns for independence, as do her party members and the wider Yes movement. But she is aware of the practical obstacles in the path, not least the refusal of the UK government to grant the power to hold a statutory referendum. Yes, she could go to court to challenge that position - but would be unlikely to win. Yes, she could consider an unofficial referendum but fears it would be a gesture to be dismissed. However, she needs to keep the independence movement motivated, particularly within her own party ranks. Hence, the speech planned for Friday at a party rally. To repeat a point I have made more than once, Nicola Sturgeon does not want simply to hold a referendum. She wants to win one. A real one. Read more from Brian here In the chamber, Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the whole debate was really being held for the benefit of independence campaigners, with Ms Sturgeon being ""afraid to tell hard truths"" to her supporters. He said the first minister was pursuing an ""obsession at the expense of the country's real and pressing priorities"", saying the government should instead be focused on issues like education and crime. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said that ""the people of Scotland don't want another independence referendum any time soon"". He said ""nobody in this chamber really believes there will be a referendum this year"", and said Ms Sturgeon was ""using this parliament to speak to her own party, and she is not even telling them the truth"". Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie also said the debate was ""for different factions of the SNP"" rather than the country at large, arguing that ""people are sick fed up"" of constitutional division.

His daughter, Rebecca Jones, said they were ""frantic with worry"" while they waited for the ambulance. ""We called back several times to check he had not been forgotten. The NHS is just so stretched - the staff are doing the best they can in impossible circumstances."" In a joint statement, the hospital and ambulance trust apologised for the delays. Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, said patients were being ""let down badly at their moment of greatest need"" and getting a quick response could be ""a matter of life or death"". She said the delays were ""undoubtedly"" related to the sustained underfunding of the NHS. Mark MacDonald, of the Stroke Association, described the findings as ""alarming"", saying a quick assessment and transfer to hospital for brain scans was vital if a patient was going to make a good recovery. ""When stroke strikes, part of your brain shuts down. And so does a part of you. Around two million neurons are lost every minute that a stroke is untreated."" The BBC asked for long waits for the two highest priority groups of 999 calls - the immediately life-threatening category ones and the emergency category two cases - from the start of 2018 when a new system of measuring response times came in. Two of England's 10 ambulance services - the West Midlands and East of England - refused to provide the information. Long waits for immediately life-threatening cases were unusual - just one in 270 cases took longer than 30 minutes to reach. That works out at less than 40 a week. But the records for category two call logs showed long waits for these emergencies were much more common. The data showed there were 385,000 waits of over an hour from January 2018 to September 2019 out of just over six million incidents responded to. That works out at more than 4,000 a week on average - or one in 16 calls. East Midlands Ambulance Service had the greatest number of long delays - one in eight calls took over an hour. Director of operations Ben Holdaway said crews were often facing long waits at A&E to hand over patients which means they ""haven't been able to get back on the road quickly"". ""Every part of the system wants to tackle these issues, but it's clear we need more staff and beds and well-functioning social care."" In Wales there were more than 1,000 cases a week on average - nearly a quarter of callouts - although their second-tier emergency calls category is a little broader than England's and includes less urgent cases like diabetes complications which could account for some of the long waits. Lee Brooks, from the Welsh Ambulance Service, accepted that some patients were waiting too long, describing it as as ""frustrating for staff as it is for patients"". Ministers are in the process of setting up a taskforce to tackle the delays. Comparable data was not available in Scotland or Northern Ireland. NHS national ambulance adviser Anthony Marsh said: ""It is not easy to reach everyone as quickly as we would all like. All our staff are working flat out."" The Department of Health and Social Care in England said the government was increasing funding for the health service and had set aside a dedicated pot to invest in ambulance services. It also said it was investing in the workforce - from September student paramedics will be entitled to a Â£5,000-a-year grant to support them during their studies.

European Parliament saying farewell to UK,"This video can not be played Tears, hugs and Auld Lang Syne in EU Parliament Members of the European Parliament have overwhelmingly backed the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. MEPs ratified the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by 621 votes to 49 following an emotional debate in Brussels. After the vote, MEPs marked the UK's exit by singing Auld Lang Syne. Several British MEPs said they hoped the UK would return one day although Eurosceptics, including the Brexit Party's Nigel Farage, used their final speeches to tear into the EU. The UK is due to leave the bloc at 23:00 GMT on Friday.

Two new MoT lifts going into operation,"Most MoT tests for cars and light vehicles in Northern Ireland have been suspended with immediate effect Two new MoT lifts are to go into operation in Northern Ireland, possibly as early as Wednesday. They had already been purchased from the same company that provided NI's other 55 lifts. Most MoT tests for cars and light vehicles in Northern Ireland have been suspended with immediate effect. It followed aninspection of vehicle lifts in NI's MoT centres that detected ""signs of cracking""in 48 out of 55 lifts. Q&A: MoT shambles As of Tuesday, more than 7,000 MoT tests had been cancelled. Speaking on Wednesday, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said the two new lifts - one in Belfast and one in Newbuildings in Londonderry - ""will allow us to increase capacity, get to those priority motorists and start to address the backlog"". She said the lifts would be independently assessed before being put into operation in Belfast and Newbuildings. Ms Mallon said she was also conscious that people with four-year-old vehicles were concerned that their cars may be clamped if they are not taxed. ""DVA is not responsible for clamping vehicles, it is the DVLA which is a separate agency,"" she said. ""But my department has been in close contact with them, we are making it clear that no-one should be penalised for a situation not of their making - very close to the position and assurances that we were able to obtain from the Association of British Insurers."" Nichola Mallon said the new lifts would help the DVA prioritise taxis and four-year-old cars The minister said that car dealerships were also being affected by the MoT problems, as they were trying to sell four-year-old cars. ""I have said to DVA officials that I want the car dealers to be expedited and prioritised in terms of getting brand new appointments,"" she said. This video can not be played Sales lost because of MoT test cancellations, says Belfast dealer ""They should be getting proactively contacted by DVA, they should be getting appointments. ""Now that we've got these two new lifts in operation I've said that they must be used to prioritise taxis and four-year-old vehicles and that includes our car dealers."" One Belfast car dealer, Martin Hamill, said sales were already being lost. ""They just turned round and said they wouldn't be happy to take the car until it was MoT'd, so I think they're going to go out and buy another car maybe with an MoT on it or maybe a newer car,"" he said. Meanwhile police in Northern Ireland have set out their position on the MoT cancellations. In their statement, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said: ""Driving without vehicle tax is not prosecuted by PSNI and is the remit of DVLA. The BBC obtained a picture of a crack in a lift at one of the vehicle test centres in Northern Ireland ""Where a police officer detects a vehicle without tax and it is outside of the 14-day grace period provided in the legislation, a referral is made to the DVLA. ""Given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MoT certificate, providing the vehicle is in a roadworthy condition, officers would be encouraged to exercise discretion."" MoT exemption certificates lasting four months will be issued so motorists are able to drive. However, these cannot be issued for four-year-old cars or taxis. This is because four-year-old cars have never been through an MoT test before, meaning they do not have a certificate to extend, while taxis are covered by different legislation. An assembly member has called for emergency legislation to be brought in to address the MoT ""crisis"". As of Tuesday, more than 7,000 MoT tests had been cancelled Roy Beggs said legislation should be considered to extend the period in which cars do not need to be have MoTs. Mr Beggs, a member of the assembly's infrastructure committee, said he had put this to Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon. ""We have to remember there's a crisis coming in four months time,"" he said. ""In four months time we'll suddenly have twice as many as cars which will become due for MoT - those which are due at that time and those that are presently due."" Mr Beggs said at the minute cars that could be 10 years old were being exempted ""I would have thought four-year-old cars would be much, much safer, much newer and built to a much higher standard and there would be a lesser risk,"" he said. ""We need to investigate all options."" The infrastructure minister, Ms Mallon, said two reviews will be conducted to determine what went wrong and how to fix it. Allow Twitter content?

Tests on heavy goods vehicles and buses will continue. Daniel Donnelly, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said many small firms depended on their vehicles. ""It's absolutely key that clarity is brought soon,"" he said. Paul Duffy, chief executive of the Driver Vehicle Agency, said each of the 55 lifts could cost Â£30,000 to Â£40,000 to replace. He said an insurance inspector who examined some of the repaired lifts on Monday was not satisfied with the work. As a result, the agency was not comfortable that the rest of the lifts were safe to use, he said. Mr Duffy said it was too early to say whether the lifts could be repaired or would have to be replaced, but there was a possibility they may need to be replaced. UK companies who manufacture MoT lifts told me the cost to replace each one could be in and around Â£30,000 to Â£40,000 because of the specifications required for testing in Northern Ireland. The average manufacturing time for each lift can be anything from five to 10 weeks. Depending on the capacity of the company they could make some simultaneously, but you are still talking a number of months to fulfil such an order. One firm told me they could fulfil the order in four months if they pushed themselves - but that's because they already have 15 in stock. So that length of time plus a contract of this size and scale would inevitably be put out to tender by the department and that process could take some time. We don't know if the lifts will be replaced but it gives you a sense of the timescale and cost the department would be facing. Ms Mallon said she has asked her permanent secretary to commission two separate reviews, which she will oversee. The first investigation will focus on ""the precise timeline and to understand who knew what and when and all actions taken"". The DVA has said it is too early to say whether vehicle lifts could be repaired or would have to be replaced She said the review will be carried out independently by auditors from outside the Department for Infrastructure. Thousands of MoTs had already been cancelledafter the cracks in lifts were detected. The suspension was announced on Monday night. Motorists have also raised concerns about insurance cover if they are unable to get MoT certificates. On Tuesday, AXA insurance said: ""We are aware of the of the ongoing issues at MOT test centres in NI and that our customers may be concerned about their insurance cover. ""AXA can confirm that until this situation is resolved, it will not be a requirement for AXA customers to have a valid MOT certificate, as long as all other policy conditions are met"". Meanwhile, on Wednesday evening,the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) in the Republic of Ireland suspended the use of vehicle lifts used in its testing centres. The NCTS said it was ""recently made aware of a defect with a similar make and model"" to its lifts. Customers areadvised to continue to book and turn up for tests. They will be completed without the under-body inspection, which will be conducted when checks have been made on the lifts.,external Thousands of MoTs cancelled over cracked lifts Faults found on 48 out of 55 lifts in MOT centres Irish car test service to carry out checks on lifts Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Northern rail franchise: 'The actual service is atrocious',"Buckshaw Parkway station opened in 2011 Northern rail passengers have faced chaos since May 2018 when new timetables were introduced.  A decision is expected later from the government on whether the firm willlose its franchiseover ""unacceptable delays"". BBC Radio 5 Live has been speaking to people in Buckshaw Village, near Chorley in Lancashire. It's a place that didn't exist 20 years ago, but which relies on Northern. Buckshaw was built on land which was formerly one of Britain's largest munitions sites, Chorley's Royal Ordnance Factory. More than 4,000 people now live there, and many of its residents commute into Preston and Manchester during the day. The village was designed to be sustainable, and cycle lanes and public transport were integrated into the building plans. A new train station, Buckshaw Parkway, opened in 2011. Ian Smith, 47, is a civil servant who lives in Buckshaw Village. He takes the early train every morning to Manchester Victoria. Ian says he loves Buckshaw and its ""fantastic facilities"", but says the train service into Manchester is ""lacking"". ""We're running old trains,"" he says, ""and for the money that you pay for a ticket to go to Manchester, I think the actual service is atrocious."" For Ian, the main issue is the late running of trains, which delays him arriving at work. He says the information on platforms and apps is incorrect. ""It puts you in a negative mood before you start your day,"" he says. Stacey says having to make up time at work is tricky Stacey Worthington lives in nearby Chorley, but commutes out of Buckshaw Village to Manchester where she works in banking. She takes the early train to avoid the rush hour and allow herself to get back in time to pick her children up from school. ""The past two years have not been great,"" she says, ""I get a half six train and you just turn up and it's cancelled. Next one's 10 past seven so immediately then I'm 40 minutes late for work."" ""It's been better recently with newer trains and more carriages."" Stacey has a young family and says having to make up the time at work is tricky: ""If the train's late or it's cancelled, I'm knackered. So I've got to then start trying to get after-school care, which instantly costs me Â£20."" ""I'm paying Â£1,900 a year for a season ticket from Buckshaw to Manchester. You might get a seat, you might not. You might get a train, you might not."" Alexandra Evans says rail firms don't understand the impact late trains can have Alexandra Evans, 38, lives in Buckshaw and is the regional manager for an international telecoms company. She travels a lot with work and her husband works locally - primarily for childcare reasons as Alexandra never knows if her train will get her back in time. She estimates about 90% of journeys she takes are delayed. ""You have the anxiety of getting to the train station, finding a car parking space, finding a seatâ¦ and then walking into the station. ""I'll be honest the first thing I do in the morning is walk to the board to see if my train is actually on time. ""They don't understand the impact on somebody's work day and the stress that's caused before you even start work."" Paula Murray, 34, is the manager of the village nursery. She lives nearby but has to be on hand to stay late if any parents are delayed getting home. The nursery opens early to allow people to get to work but it's pick-up that's a problem, because people often don't have family living nearby. She said: ""Last night when someone was late, we just stayed as long as we needed to really... it can have a massive effect. ""We've had [staff] in the years before who've missed driving lessons, meals with family."" Paula is a mum herself and nearly missed a parents' evening because another parent was late picking up their child: ""It can have a massive, massive knock-on effect."" Sam Holt says the commute is a ""nightmare"" For Sam Holt, 44, there's a ""feeling of dread"" about his commute from Buckshaw Village. He runs a music and DJ management company and goes in to Manchester three times a week. ""It's a nightmare,"" he says, ""You can't rely on the information."" Sam says when a train arrives on time ""there's almost a collective clapping on the platform because it's like, hey, it got here!"" He says he now sometimes allows an hour extra to get home, ""that's a decent chunk of your day if you add that up across a working year. That's a lot of time"". John Quinton-Barber says firms such as his are paying the cost of ""our dysfunctional railway"" The unreliability has a knock-on effect for business owners. John Quinton-Barber, 49, owns a PR agency in Manchester city centre with about 30 staff. He's put everyone on flexitime, allowing his workers to start from home or clock on later in the day, because he couldn't rely on people arriving on time due to the late running trains. He says the policy's been a huge success. ""I don't want my colleagues being worried that their train is delayed and they have to get in a certain time. I see every day a message from one of my colleagues 'I'm going to be 10/15 minutes late, because Northern haven't arrived or because there's issues with the trains.' ""As an employer, we are taking the heat because of our dysfunctional railway."" He feels frustrated having ""to pick up the pieces of a broken Network Rail network in the north"". A Northern spokesperson said: ""Our customers deserve the best possible rail service and we are working hard, alongside our partners, to improve industry performance. ""We have delivered on our commitment to increase the number of train servicesâ¦ and yet there has been no real increase in track capacity since 2016, which has led to more congested railways across the North. Infrastructure issues and the additional congestion have taken their toll on punctuality. ""Arriva and Northern remain fully committed to delivering the transformation of the North's railways and improving customers' experience. ""We are delivering the biggest transformation of local rail for a generation, with 62 of our 101 new trains now in service. This is part of a Â£600m investment in improving customers' experience; we are also continuing to invest in better stations, better offers for customers and more recruitment.""

Train driver 'embarrassed' to work for Northern,"Northern has come under fire for aging trains and chaotic timetables A train driver employed by troubled rail operator Northern has said he is ""embarrassed"" to work for such a ""dire"" and ""deteriorating"" service. The driver, who does not wish to be identified, said the ""crowd control"" of angry passengers was now a routine part of his job. He said: ""The quality of the railways we are involved in running is poor and it is demoralising."" Northern said it was ""working hard"" to improve standards. Passengers have endured a series of chaotic periods since the firm introducednew timetables in May 2018. Earlier in January the government warned itcould lose its franchiseover the ""unacceptable"" delays and cancellations. Widespread delays and cancellations have plagued Northern passengers for two years The driver told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Things have definitely deteriorated. It's really demoralising to work for such a shoddy outfit. ""We wear scruffy, tatty uniforms that, you know, we have to practically beg to get replacements for when they're worn out. ""And we come to work on a railway that the company doesn't care for."" He added: ""I think the region deserves better. Anybody who's been a passenger down south and up north can tell you the glaring differences."" The driver said crammed carriages were not just a problem for passengers but for staff also, who can struggle to manage the backlog of commuters. ""We get people knocking on the window complaining to us. We feel like we have to help the guards in managing crowd control,"" he said. Northern has said it is committed to improving services Responding to the driver's comments, a spokesman for Northern said the operator was ""delivering the biggest transformation of local rail for a generation"" as part of a Â£600m investment. He said the firm now operated 2,000 more weekly services than at the start of its franchise.

Historic Brexit vote due in European Parliament,"This video can not be played Tears, hugs and Auld Lang Syne in EU Parliament Members of the European Parliament have overwhelmingly backed the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. MEPs ratified the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by 621 votes to 49 following an emotional debate in Brussels. After the vote, MEPs marked the UK's exit by singing Auld Lang Syne. Several British MEPs said they hoped the UK would return one day although Eurosceptics, including the Brexit Party's Nigel Farage, used their final speeches to tear into the EU. The UK is due to leave the bloc at 23:00 GMT on Friday. Ratification of thewithdrawal agreement, agreed by the UK and EU in October, was not in doubt after it easily cleared its committee stage last week. As it happened: An emotional send-off for Britain New Scottish MEP sworn in - for four days Tears and relief as the UK's MEPs bid goodbye Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit Signing the letter confirming the EU's consent, the Parliament's president, David Sassoli, said the two sides must heed the words of the late Labour MP Jo Cox when approaching their future relationship and recognise ""there is more that unites us than divides us."" ""You are leaving the EU but you will always be part of Europeâ¦It is very hard to say goodbye. That is why, like my colleagues, I will say arrivederci."" This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""We will never be far"" Wednesday's session saw those on either side of the Brexit debate, including the UK's 73 MEPs, celebrate or lament the end of British EU membership. Some MEPs marked the occasion with songs - others wore ""always united"" scarves. The Parliament's Brexit spokesman, Guy Verhofstadt, said it was ""sad to see a country leaving that has twice given its blood to liberate Europe"". He added that British MEPs had brought ""wit, charm, and intelligence"" as well as ""stubbornness"", and would be missed. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said ratification of the withdrawal deal was ""only a first step"" towards a new partnership between the EU and the UK. The two should ""join forces"" in areas such as climate change, she said, and seek a close partnership following the UK's exit on Friday. ""We will always love you and we will not be far,"" she told the UK in closing. The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also wished the UK well, saying the bloc would approach talks on the future relationship with ""patience"" and ""objectivity"" while defending its members' interests. This video can not be played Green MEP: ""One day I will be back"" This video can not be played The MEP's last sitting in the European Parliament On the other side, though, Conservative MEP and prominent Eurosceptic Daniel Hannan said opinion in Britain turned against the bloc when it became clear ""the aspiration was to have the EU as a quasi-state"". ""If at any stage Britain had been able to have a trade-only relationship that would have been enough,"" he went on, but added: ""You are losing a bad tenant and gaining a good neighbour."" Mr Farage - who has been campaigning for the UK's exit since before he was first elected to the Brussels Parliament in 1999 - used his final speech to excoriate the EU. ""I want Brexit to start a debate right across Europe - what do we want from Europe?"" he said, arguing that ""trade, friendship, co-operation and reciprocity"" between nations could be achieved without ""all of these institutions and all of this power"". He and his fellow Brexit Party MEPs waved Union flags before walking out of the chamber en masse. The S&D coalition in the European Parliament put up a sign aimed at departing British MEPs - ""au revoir"" literally meaning ""goodbye until we meet again"" A tearful Molly Scott Cato was applauded and hugged by her colleagues after she spoke of her ""grief and regret"" at Brexit and the hope she would return to the European Parliament ""one day"". ""While now is not the time to campaign to rejoin the EU, we must keep the dream alive,"" the Green Party MEP said. Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts said the EU must learn lessons from the UK's decision to leave. He said the bloc had to ""regain the hearts and minds of European citizens"" by focusing on what it could do for the many, not the few. Some MEPs wore ""half-and-half scarves"" to mark the UK's final day Earlier, the S&D coalition, which houses Labour's 10 MEPs, displayed a sign aimed at departing British members, which read: ""It's not goodbye, it's au revoir."" On Tuesday evening, several MEPs in the Green group also held a ceremony to mark the UK's departure. While Brexit Party MEPs spoke of their joy and relief at leaving, others shared messages of sadness on social media as they prepared to vote for the last time. The Green Party's Alexandra Phillips tweeted: ""I'm devastated to be leaving the best job in the world. I get to make real change every day while being surrounded by 27 different languages and cultures."" Liberal Democrats shared pictures of gifts from the pro-European Renew Europe group.

After the UK leaves, there will be an 11-month transition period in which the two sides hope to negotiate their future economic relationship. Trade talks are expected to begin in earnest in early March. The European Parliament will also get a say in ratifying any future trade deal. The UK has insisted talks should not extend beyond 31 December 2020 when atransition period- which will see the UK follow EU rules - comes to an end. President Sassoli told CNN on Tuesday that the timetable for a deal was tight. He said the UK's exit would be ""painful"" for the bloc but building a new partnership based upon friendly co-operation and mutual interests was now essential.

StubHub told to clean up ticket sales,"The UK's competition watchdog has warned StubHub that it could face court action if it does not make changes to its website. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it is ""concerned"" that StubHub is not warning customers buying resale tickets that they could be turned away at some venues. The CMA said the ticket resale firm,externalcould be breaking consumer law. StubHub told the regulator that it will make further changes to its website. Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, said that the firm had previously committed to mend its online booking service following another investigation. However, the CMA has identified new issues with the ticket sellers' website. It is concerned that StubHub has been: Failing to warn people that tickets may not get them into venues that don't accept resales Pressuring customers about ticket availability, potentially using inaccurate data Failing to let people know exactly where they will sit in a venue Failing to ensure the full addresses of business vendors are displayed Dr Coscelli said it was ""unacceptable that we have now found these concerns. ""We have demanded swift action to resolve these problems."" StubHub said that it complied with everything that the CMA requested after its 2018 investigation into online ticket resales. StubHub executive Wayne Grierson said: ""We have always collaborated closely with regulators in the interests of our fans, and will continue to do so."" He added that StubHub was working quickly to resolve any ""remaining valid concerns"" the CMA held over information on its website. The CMA also said that if the changes made don't go far enough it will consider taking court action. Last year, the regulator ruled that hotel booking websiteshad to review they way they rank and display rooms, over ""pressure-selling"" concerns. Consumer group Which? later found that hotel booking websites' ""only 1 room left on our site"" claims still failed to give an accurate picture of availability. A separate investigation is underway by the CMA, looking into Viagogo's purchase of StubHub. Viagogo said in 2019 it was buying rival tickets firm StubHub from eBay, which bought the company for $310m (Â£238m) in 2007. The CMA is considering whether or not the deal will lead to a ""substantial lessening of competition"" in ticket selling. Viagogo was previously ordered by the courtsto tell buyers which seats they will get and if there is a risk they could be turned away at the door.

'Carriages were so full I couldn't move my feet',"Delayed Northern services at Manchester Victoria Rail passengers at Manchester Victoria Station said they could not agree more that something drastic needed doing to improve Northern's services. Their comments come as Transport Secretary Grant Shappssaid he was ""not prepared"" to toleratethe commuter line operator's poor performance. Office of Rail and Road figures show just 56% of Northern trains arrived at stations within a minute of the stated time on the timetable in the 12 months to 7 December. That compares to an average across Britain of 65%. Every passenger - including those who did not want to be identified or photographed - said they had suffered from a bad experience with Northern. Mr Shapps has said he had taken steps that could lead to Northern being stripped of its franchise. But passengers said they feared whether any successor to Northern could be better. Stuart Smith had to get off a train because there was no driver Stuart Smith, 79. from Salford, said he would be ""very happy to see the end of Northern"". He said his worst experience was boarding a packed rush hour train from Manchester to Leeds, only to be told it would be delayed for 20 minutes. ""Next thing we heard there was no driver,"" he said. ""And then finally it was cancelled."" Mr Smith, who eventually arrived home late via Bradford, added: ""I just hope the new company can run services on time - how hard can that be?"" Olivia Cherry said she recently suffered three cancellations for a 15-minute journey Olivia Cherry, 23, from Cambridge, recalled the ""terrible"" experience of Northern when she studied at Manchester. She added she had recently been trying to travel from Wigan to Euxton, in Lancashire, and suffered three cancellations for a journey ""of about 15 minutes"". ""We are not asking a lot - just trains that run regularly and on time,"" she said. Karen Chisholm, 51, from Essex, said the unreliability of the rail service had had an impact on business meetings. ""You are always having to explain to your boss why you are late,"" she said. ""I am fortunate my boss understands the situation. I also travelled to London on Virgin and they were hardly ever late so it can be done. Northern seem to be quick to blame the staff. ""I hope a new franchise will have the resources because otherwise I will have to keep explaining why I am late. "" Ayesha Lohar commutes by car to work because she cannot risk journey delays Ayesha Lohar, 40, from Blackburn said she believed public ownership would be the best long-term solution. ""I travelled from Blackburn to Manchester in a carriage so crammed you couldn't move your feet. ""As long as firms put profit before passengers they are always going to be squeezing as many people into fewer carriages."" She added: ""I drive to work in Blackpool from Blackburn because I cannot risk the delay.""

"Pompeo urges UK to 'relook' at Huawei decisionThe secretary of state says he wants to ""have a conversation"" after US warnings went unheeded.UK Politics","Mike Pompeo urged the UK to prioritise its security interests when dealing with Chinese firm Huawei on his visit to the UK in May last year US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged the UK to reconsider allowing Huawei to have a role in its 5G system, ahead of talks with Boris Johnson. He told reporters the UK had a chance to ""relook"" at the decision, stressing the US needed to be sure its allies had ""trusted"" information networks. The US believes the Chinese firm's equipment poses a spying risk. But Culture Secretary Baroness Morgan said it ""in no way"" affects the ability of the UK to share classified data. Ahead of his meeting with the PM, Mr Pompeo held talks with his UK counterpart, Dominic Raab, on Wednesday evening. The Foreign Office said Mr Raab reiterated his ""disappointment"" at the US decision toreject an extradition request for Anne Sacoolas- the diplomat's wide suspected of causing the death of Harry Dunn by dangerous driving. Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash in Northamptonshire in August, which led to suspect Ms Sacoolas leaving for the US under diplomatic immunity. What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Huawei set for limited role in UK 5G networks How UK's Huawei decision affects rest of the world Dominic Raab ""emphasised the importance of delivering justice for Harry Dunn and his family"" to Mike Pompeo, the Foreign Office said The US had repeatedly warned that giving Huawei a role in 5G could allow the Chinese government a ""back door"" into the telecoms network through which they could carry out espionage or cyber attacks. Ahead of his arrival in London, Mr Pompeo told reporters the US wanted to ""work with"" the UK following the National Security Council's decision to give Huawei a role in spite of those warnings. This video can not be played Baroness Morgan: UK has ""got the expertise"" in Huawei ""We were urging them (the UK) to make a decision that was different than the one they made and we'll have a conversation about how to proceed,"" he said. ""There is also a chance for the UK to relook at this as implementation moves forward, and then it's important for everyone to know there is also real work being done by lots of private companies inside the US and in Europe to make sure that there are true competitors to Huawei."" He added: ""We will make sure that when American information passes across a network we are confident that that network is a trusted one."" The UK has insisted the firm will be barred from sensitive locations, such as nuclear sites and military bases and its share of the market will be capped at 35%. Baroness Morgan also told BBC Breakfast the UK had expertise is mitigating risks when using Huawei's technology, as it was already part of existing 4G networks - unlike in the US. She said: ""We want to see the roll-out of 5G... for the growth of our economy and productivity, but in making this decision, we have been very clear we will not compromise on national security. This video can not be played How will the Huawei 5G deal affect me? ""We obviously had a number of conversations with the US [who] have made their views clear. But we have got that expertise, we have had that oversight of Huawei... which gives our agencies the ability to give the assurance that having them involved in the periphery of the network does not present the security challenge I think others have worried about."" The UK's decision also faced a criticism from some senior Conservative MPs after Mr Raab made a statement about it in the Commons. Tom Tugendhat, former chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, tweeted that the government's ""statement leaves many concerns and does not close the UK's networks to a frequently malign international actor"". But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace downplayed such concerns, telling the BBC the UK should not be ""paranoid"" that the decision would lead to ""Big Brother from China watching us"". Asked about how the US might react Mr Wallace said: ""I don't know how they'll react... they've made their concerns clear. ""We understand that - we respect that, we've given them lots of assurances that the intelligence they share and how they share it."" A series of US congressional figures called on the UK to reconsider, saying the decision could be an obstacle to a post-Brexit trade deal between the US and UK, as well as raising questions over security co-operation. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, called for a ""thorough review"" of intelligence sharing with the UK. ""I fear London has freed itself from Brussels only to cede sovereignty to Beijing,"" he said. The decision gave China a foothold to carry out ""pervasive espionage"" on the UK and gave it ""increased economic and political leverage"", he said. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who is one of the president's most committed defenders, said he was ""very concerned"" and urged the UK to think again. ""This decision has the potential to jeopardise US-UK intelligence sharing agreements and could greatly complicate a US-UK free trade agreement,""he tweeted,external.

MSPs to back new independence referendumThe Scottish government is to ask MSPs to support its call for an independence referendum later this year.Scotland politics,"Nicola Sturgeon wants a referendum to be held in the second half of 2020 MSPs have backed calls for a new referendum on Scottish independence in a vote at Holyrood. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants to hold a new poll later this year, and wants UK ministers to agree to this. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasrejected her call for a transfer of powers, saying the 2014 vote was a ""once in a generation"" event. MSPs voted by 64 to 54 to agree that circumstances have changed since then, and that ""a referendum should be held"". The vote is not binding on the UK government, and Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told BBC Scotland that its position was ""not remotely"" changed by it. Ms Sturgeon is due to make a speech on Friday setting out the ""next steps"" in the ""campaign to secure Scotland's future as an independent nation"". Could Scotland still become independent? Indyref2: What does 'once in a generation' mean? Look back on the independence debate on Holyrood Live The Scottish government wants to hold a new referendum in the second half of 2020, pointing to Brexit as a ""material change in circumstances"". Ms Sturgeonformally requested a transfer of powers- similar to that which underpinned the 2014 referendum - after the SNP won 48 of Scotland's 59 seats in December's general election. Mr Johnson replied that he could ""not agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums"". MSPs voted to back the government motion by 64 votes to 54 In Wednesday's debate, Ms Sturgeon said MSPs should ""endorse a fundamental democratic principle - that this country has the right to choose its own future"". She put forward a motion for debate saying a referendum should be held, and calling on the UK government to agree to this happening ""on a date and in a manner determined by the Scottish Parliament"". The SNP leader said Scotland being taken out of the EU despite a 62% Remain vote north of the border was an ""affront to democracy"", adding: ""Having our future imposed on us by a UK government which is utterly contemptuous of our views simply isn't good enough."" She said there was an ""overwhelming"" democratic case for a new vote, and said the ""anti-democratic position of the opposition parties"" was because they were afraid of putting the question to the public. This was backed by Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who said the divergence between Scots voting to remain in the UK in 2014 and to remain in the EU in 2016 needed to be settled. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said he was ""not surprised"" by the vote, given the pro-independence majority at Holyrood, but said ""the position remains the same"". He told BBC Scotland: ""A generation, as was in their independence white paper, has not passed. We're leaving the EU on Friday and we need to focus on the common fisheries policy, our coastal communities, our trade deals, all the good things we can do rather than another year of referendums, rancour and division."" This is tricky ground for Nicola Sturgeon. She yearns for independence, as do her party members and the wider Yes movement. But she is aware of the practical obstacles in the path, not least the refusal of the UK government to grant the power to hold a statutory referendum. Yes, she could go to court to challenge that position - but would be unlikely to win. Yes, she could consider an unofficial referendum but fears it would be a gesture to be dismissed. However, she needs to keep the independence movement motivated, particularly within her own party ranks. Hence, the speech planned for Friday at a party rally. To repeat a point I have made more than once, Nicola Sturgeon does not want simply to hold a referendum. She wants to win one. A real one. Read more from Brian here In the chamber, Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the whole debate was really being held for the benefit of independence campaigners, with Ms Sturgeon being ""afraid to tell hard truths"" to her supporters. He said the first minister was pursuing an ""obsession at the expense of the country's real and pressing priorities"", saying the government should instead be focused on issues like education and crime. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said that ""the people of Scotland don't want another independence referendum any time soon"". He said ""nobody in this chamber really believes there will be a referendum this year"", and said Ms Sturgeon was ""using this parliament to speak to her own party, and she is not even telling them the truth"".

OAP's Â£20k savings in gravy tub rescued from dump,"This video can not be played Tony Scanlon and Kenny McAdam said they were delighted to find the large sum of money Recycling centre workers spent two hours hunting through rubbish to find old gravy tins containing a pensioner's Â£20,000 life savings. The cash was accidentally dumped at Dalmoak Recycling Centre in Dunbartonshire by the woman's family, who were clearing out her home. When they realised their mistake, the brother and sister returned to ask for help to trace the missing money. Council workers Tony Scanlon and Kenny McAdam took on the messy job. As first reported inThe Daily Record,external, the pair stepped up to the challenge after a man and woman arrived at the recycling centre near Renton in a panic. ""They explained they had dumped something they shouldn't have dumped,"" Tony explained. ""They said it was money and it was in Bisto containers."" Tony Scanlon and Kenny McAdam saved the day for a local family It is believed the money belonged to a woman in her 80s. Her daughter had cleaned her kitchen while she was out, throwing away old dishes, pots and pans. She knew nothing about what was in the tins until her mother returned and told her it was her life savings. Kenny added: ""I remembered the lady because the bag was heavy and I had told her to leave her bags there in front of the skip. ""She asked where they could have gone and I told her they could either have been crushed in the compactor or have been put in this container."" A stroke of luck meant that one of the yard's two compactors was out of service and so the rubbish bags had been piled up in a skip and crushed with a digger. Tony remembered throwing the heavy bags into the container. So the pair decided there was only one thing for it. ""We moved the skip to the back of the yard to keep people away and started going through it,"" said Tony. ""We pulled the bags out, put them in the digger, moved them. ""Eventually after an hour-and-a half we found the heavy bags. We burst one of the bags open and found one of the Bisto tubs."" The almost-full rubbish container was close to being sent to be emptied at landfill Twenty minutes later Kenny found the other four tubs in another bag. He said: ""It was amazing. Tony said the lady started crying. I shook the brother's hand. It was a great feeling. ""It really was a frantic couple of hours. We did our very best to retrieve the money. At the end of the day Tony and I saved the day for an old pensioner and it made us feel good."" It turned out that had the family returned any later, the tins could have been on their way to landfill. But luckily it was a happy ending. Kenny said: ""I'd like to think that anybody else would have done what Tony and I did. I'm happy and my wee pal's happy."" It turns out the pair are no strangers to saving the day.

Northern rail to be put into public ownership,"This video can not be played Overcrowding on trains has been one of many issues facing Northern passengers Troubled rail company Northern is to be brought under government control. The decision, which will see the firm's franchise stripped from operator Arriva Rail North from 1 March, was taken following years of major disruption. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said passengers had ""lost trust in the north's rail network"". Arriva said it ""understood the government's decision"", but problems had been largely due to ""external factors"" such as rail infrastructure. Northern passengers have faced rail chaos ever since new timetables were introduced in May 2018, and punctuality and reliability problems have continued to blight the network. This video can not be played Passengers outside Leeds train station respond to finding out Northern being nationalised Mr Shapps said: ""People across the north deserve better, their communities deserve better and I am determined to achieve that."" The move means services will be operated by an arms-length government-owned company. 'Good riddance' to Northern rail What will happen to Northern rail tickets? German-based Arriva had been due to run Northern until March 2025. But Mr Shapps revealed in October he had requested a proposal from Northern to outline its plans to improve services,after ""unacceptable"" delays and cancellations. The Department for Transport then had to consider whether to hand a new, short-term contract to Arriva, or to nationalise services by putting the government-controlled Operator of Last Resort (OLR) in charge. Frustrated rail users let their feelings be known at Manchester Piccadilly in 2018 The company has faced a range of problems in recent years, includingwidespread cancellations and delaysfollowing the introduction of new timetables. It also faced challenges due to infrastructure projects,strike actionand an ageing fleet of trains. Its continued poor performance earned it the nickname 'Northern Fail' from frustrated passengers. Recent figures from Office of Rail and Road revealed how just56% of Northern trains arrived at stations within a minute of the stated time on the timetablein the 12 months to 7 December. That compares to an average across Britain of 65%. Northern said external factors had made the company's plan for the network ""undeliverable"". These included prolonged industrial action by the RMT, and delayed and cancelled infrastructure projects. More than half of delays on the entire UK rail network were down to problems with the infrastructure, like signalling. Government-owned firm Network Railwas put on a warning earlier this monthfor its poor service on routes in the North West and Midlands. This video can not be played Hayley Camfield says overcrowding causes major problems for disabled passengers Northern services will transfer from Arriva Rail North to Northern Trains Limited, a newly formed subsidiary of the Department for Transport's OLR. OLR is a public company, staffed by experienced train managers, which reports directly to the government. It already manages the London North Eastern Railway (LNER) franchise after rail services on the East Coast Main Line werebrought back under government control in May 2018. However, this was only supposed to last for two years. Sam Barnes said she was in support of the government takeover For many people who have faced repeated delays travelling on Northern trains, the news has been welcomed. ""Good riddance,"" said Sam Barnes, 56, from Todmorden, West Yorkshire. ""My brother-in-law is a train driver on London routes and when he finishes his shift it takes him ages to get home on Northern as they are always delayed."" Read more on how Northern passengers have reacted. Mr Shapps described the move as ""a new beginning for Northern"" but he sounded a note of caution for those expecting immediate dramatic improvements. ""Northern's network is huge and complex, some of the things which are wrong are not going to be quick or easy to put right,"" he said. The much-maligned Pacer trains must still be replaced and Mr Shapps said new technology would be rolled out to identify overcrowding issues. He also revealed plans to extend platforms at 30 stations on the Northern network to allow for longer trains. The new government-owned company will be asked to prepare a plan in the first 100 days ""to make sure we leave no stone unturned in improving this franchise for passengers"". This is an uncomfortable moment for the government. In the end, nationalising this vast commuter network was its only option. An agreement to change Arriva's contract and keep the firm on board wasn't possible because a commercially, and politically, palatable deal couldn't be found. What the government wants on Northern is a new performance-related train contract, like existing ones for Merseyrail and the London Overground, which put less risk on the train company. As one rail boss described it, this type of system will be very similar to a nationalised railway, but private companies will still have a role to play. Northern's failure is in large part down to ancient infrastructure which struggles to cope with the high volume of trains and passengers at peak times. Put simply, there is no silver bullet for improving our railways. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and his Liverpool City Region counterpart Steve Rotheram described the news as a ""victory"" for passengers. In a joint statement, they called on the government to ""commit to investing in much-needed rail infrastructure and work with leaders across the north to deliver the vision and funding needed to build the modern transport network that the people of our region deserve"". Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA transport union, welcomed the decision but said the government must understand ""franchising of our railways, while stuffing the mouths of shareholders with gold, has completely failed"". Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union ASLEF, also warned ""there won't be an immediate improvement"". ""[This is] because many of the systemic failures at Northern - the late delivery of new rolling stock, the cancellation by the Conservative government of infrastructure upgrades, trying to run a service with too few drivers - cannot be remedied overnight,"" he said. Northern passengers have faced two years of rail chaos ever since new timetables were introduced in May 2018 Chris Burchell, Arriva's UK managing director, said he recognised ""overall service improvements have not come quickly enough"". ""For that, we wholeheartedly apologise,"" he said. He also thanked staff for working ""tirelessly over the last four years"". ""I am confident that as a result of the determination and hard work of the Northern rail team, they have helped set strong foundations for future improvement on the network."" While the name of the operator will change on 1 March, branding on the trains will remain the same and staff will keep their jobs. Over the next few weeks, services will continue to run and customers should continue to buy tickets in the usual way, Northern Trains Limited said. Tickets purchased for journeys using multiple train companies will still be valid, a spokesperson added. Further announcements will be made when the transfer is complete on 1 March.

"Starbucks closes 2,000 outlets","Starbucks has closed half of its outlets in China to protect its staff and support government efforts to contain the coronavirus. The coffee shop chain warned that the rapidly expanding infection is likely to affect its financial performance. Starbucks has almost 4,300 outlets in China, making it the company's largest market outside the US. The number of deaths from the virus has risen to more than 130 and almost 6,000 confirmed infections. Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson said the firm was ""navigating a very dynamic situation"". The firm told Wall Street analysts that it had been planning to upgrade its annual profit forecasts after a better-than-expected first quarter performance but decided against changing its projections due to the virus. Apple 'closely monitoring' coronavirus Facebook tells staff to avoid China Companies tell Chinese workers 'stay at home' Starbucks opened its first Chinese store in Beijing in January 1999. Chinese sales account for about 10% of Starbucks' global revenue, making the country its most important global growth engine. The move highlights the major challenges facing global corporations from the spread of the deadly virus. Apple boss Tim Cook has said his company is ""closely monitoring"" the coronavirus outbreak, which has clouded its forecast for the upcoming quarter. The technology giant has limited travel and reduced store hours in China, while its suppliers' factories remain closed longer than expected. Earlier this week Facebook became the first big US firm to tell staff to avoid travelling to China. The social media giant said it was acting ""out of an abundance of caution"" to protect its employees. Other global companies have introduced travel restrictions and car makers are taking staff out of the country. Toyota said on Wednesday that its production plants in China will stay closed until 9 February, in response to the coronavirus. The Japanese car maker said the closures were in line with transport lockdowns imposed by Chinese authorities and as the company assesses its supply chain. Toyota has plants in the northern city of Tianjin and the southern province of Guangdong. Foreigners evacuated from China virus epicentre Coronavirus: How worried should we be? China coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Hundreds of foreign nationals have been evacuated from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. Flights have left the city with Japanese and US citizens while the European Commission said it would help repatriate European nationals after a request from France. At the same time companies in China have advised staff to work from home in an attempt to slow the spread of the deadly virus. Businesses are also offering workers longer holidays, as well as telling employees returning from the most affected areas to stay away from work.

People cry out 'stay strong',"Keeping spirits up in virus-hit Wuhan As the number of coronavirus infections continues to grow, millions of people have gone into lockdown in Wuhan - the centre of the outbreak - to try to stop the virus spreading. But in this time of isolation some people are determined to raise each others' spirits. The deadly outbreak comes as China celebrates one of the most important dates in its calendar  - Lunar New Year. Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving all rolled into one - typically a time filled with lots of cheer. For many, it's the only chance in a year they have to meet up with their family and exchange gifts of food and money. In Wuhan people have been encouraged to stay home to minimise the spread of the virus. But residents in a block of flats found a small way to cheer each other up. Videos circulating on social media show people shouting ""Wuhan jiayou"" out of their windows- roughly translated to ""Stay strong Wuhan"" or ""Keep on going Wuhan"". This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city The phrase is echoed across the block and residents can be heard cheering in the background. Add oil! The Chinese expression keeping people going Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? China coronavirus: A visual guide Coronavirus: How worried should we be? It's also a cheer that's being repeated online. On social media site Weibo, the phrase ""Wuhan jiayou"" has been trending. Many across different parts of the country are posting the phrase in solidarity with Wuhan - where the majority of deaths as a result of the virus have occurred. ""We will get through this. Wuhan jiayou, the whole country is supporting you,"" said one comment on Weibo. More than one hundred people - mostly in Wuhan - have now died as a result of the outbreak which has spread across China and internationally. Though there is plenty of fear and anger at the authorities on social media in China, state media has been highlighting kind acts and stories of residents banding together in Wuhan. One new restaurant owner in Wuhan spent the Lunar New Year festival packing food for medical workers in the city, according to state news outlet Changjiang Daily. Li Bo had opened a restaurant in the city just a month ago. He sold his car and borrowed money in order to raise the funds for it. But before the 36-year-old could properly get his business started, the outbreak kicked in - leaving the streets of the city empty and his restaurant deserted. ""I panicked. I lay at home worrying about how I was going to repay the loan,"" he told Changjiang Daily. ""But then I saw [news] about how the medical staff in hospitals were struggling and I felt like it was time for me act. I wanted to do my part, no matter how insignificant."" According to a report by news site Beijing News, some hospitals in Wuhan have experienced food shortages. Two residents living in Wuhan had previously told the BBC that people in the city have been trying to stockpile food. Li Bo is packing 200 lunch boxes for medical workers at a local hospital Li Bo along with his chef spent days buying ingredients and cooking enough food to fit into 200 boxes. He told the news outlet on 26 January that he was in the process of finding enough boxes to pack the food into, adding that the meals would eventually be delivered to medical staff in Wuhan's Xiehe Hospital. ""I wanted to do my best to [make sure] the medical staff eat hot meals. I hope they get the nutrition they need and that will boost their immunity,"" he told the paper, adding that he plans to continue the food deliveries for as long as he can. ""I hope the city we love gets better soon."" Fears of the coronavirus have seen thousands across the country flocking to buy face masks - triggering a mask shortage in some places. Masks have become such a valuable commodity that many on Weibo have joked that they would rather receive face masks instead of the typical monetary gifts given out during Lunar New Year. One villager in Changde, a neighbouring province of Hubei where Wuhan is located, decided he would donate almost 15,000 face masks, according to news outlet the Xiaoxiang Morning Herald. Hao Jin had last year worked in a mask production factory. He eventually resigned from the job but the company could not afford to pay him his salary. He was instead given 15,000 masks - worth 20,000 yuan (Â£2,207; $2,883) as a form of compensation. He brought the masks home and forgot about them until he heard news of the mask shortage. ""I thought I would donate the masks I have to those in need, I hope they can be of more use and value to others,"" he said. He kept a handful of the masks for his family, and distributed some to those in his village before donating the rest to people in his county.

"Mrs Brown beats Gervais and Fleabag at the NTAsThe sitcom wins for a fifth year, while Ant and Dec, Jesy Nelson and Michael Palin are also honoured.Entertainment & ArtsComments","Mrs Brown's Boys has beaten Fleabag and After Life to win a fifth comedy prize at the National Television Awards. The awards, voted for by the British public, saw Jesy Nelson, Peaky Blinders and Sir Michael Palin all collect prizes. Ant and Dec, meanwhile, enjoyed their 19th straight NTA success as best presenters. New awards host David Walliams also won one, which he went up to collect in his underpants. National Television Awards: Red carpet in pictures How Mrs Brown's Boys became a critic-proof hit How America fell in love with Fleabag There were wins for the usual suspects Strictly Come Dancing, This Morning and Emmerdale too during the event at London's O2 Arena. Phoebe Waller-Bridge's dark comedy, Fleabag, won big at the recent Emmys, Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards, but the show was overlooked on Tuesday night in favour of Brendan O'Carroll's Saturday night sitcom, Mrs Brown's Boys. Ricky Gervais' After Life - a similarly dark comedy about a suicidal journalist who has just lost his wife to cancer - also missed out. But after thanking his family, O'Carroll was quick to praise the Netflix-produced show as ""one of the best things I've ever seen"", drawing a wave of gratitude and a smile from Gervais in the crowd. Ricky Gervais and the cast of After Life Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge was not in attendance at the NTAs Gervais previously poked fun at popular sitcoms with laughter tracks, innuendo and catchphrases in his show Extras, yet after nine years Mrs Brown's Boys continues to be a huge draw. In 2018 its Christmas special brought in 6.8 million viewers, making it the most-watched programme of the day. ""Comedy is hard, it's not easy,"" declared the Irish writer, actor and comedian. Derry Girls and Sex Education found that to their cost, missing out in the comedy stakes at this year's awards, where Ant and Dec won their 19th successive presenting award despite having not hosted their own show, Saturday Night Takeaway, in 2019. The nation's favourite double act admitted the ceremony was getting more tense for them as the years went by. ""We had our chat on the way in about this being the year we don't win it - then you go and do this again,"" joked Ant. The pair enjoyed a second win of the night with best entertainment programme I'm a Celebrity..., which they present, and dedicated the award to those affected by the bushfires in Australia, where the programme is filmed. David Walliams - who took over proceedings from usual host Dermot O'Leary - made his opening speech from raised up high on a wire. David Walliams is lifted off the ground in rehearsal The show began with a VT of him playing a strange version of himself, appearing before even stranger versions of The X Factor judges, who were also played by the host himself. Later on, sitting bare-legged on Dec's lap, he leapt up to receive his own award for best TV Judge, for his work on Britain's Got Talent. ""When I die, which I will, they will show this clip on the news - me in my pants,"" quipped Walliams. An emotional Jesy Nelson won the award for best factual programme for Odd One Out, her documentary about cyber bullying. ""I'm so sorry, this is so overwhelming. I'm such a baby,"" declared the Little Mix star. The feature was inspired by her experiences of online trolling when she first rose to fame as a youngster with the band on The X Factor. ""I want to thank every single person that was in the documentary for being so brave and courageous to tell their own story to the world,"" she added. ""I don't think we ever expected for this to have such an impact and I'm just so grateful that such a negative experience in my life turned into such a positive one."" Jesy Nelson: Online trolls made me want to die Little Mix star praised for 'inspiring' documentary Sir Michael Palin received a special recognition award and used the platform to pay tribute to ""someone who taught me more about television than anyone else"" - his fellow Monty Python star Terry Jones, whodied last week aged 77. ""He had a skill in being very ruthless but also being charming at the same time"" said Sir Michael.

Earlier on Tuesday, Caroline Flack, who stepped down from the ITV2 show following an assault charge, made a return to social media to wish the cast and crew of the dating show the best of luck. Host Walliams brought weary groans from the crowd with jokes about Flack, and actor Lawrence Fox. Good Morning Britain show host Piers Morgan boycotted the awards this year because, he said, ""the same people always win"" and (like a stopped clock twice a day) he wasn't wrong; Emmerdale won best soap for a fourth straight year, and This Morning and Strictly Come Dancing won awards for a 10th and fifth year in a row respectively. Holly Willoughby praised her co-host Phillip Schofield - ""this silver haired man with a heart of gold"". Strictly host Tess Daly, meanwhile, paid tribute to her late former showbiz colleague Bruce Forsyth, whose name now adorns one of the awards. ""Brucewasshow business and his memory lives on,"" she said. Claudia Winkleman, who replaced him as her on-screen partner said they would celebrate the win with ""crisps and tequila"". In between the awards, The Pet Shop Boys debuted a new song called Monkey Business, backed by a cast of colourfully dressed dancers. Peaky Blinders picked up two gongs; best drama again and best drama performance for Cillian Murphy - though you might know him better as the gangster Thomas Shelby. The popular historical drama miniseries Chernobyl gained the plaudits for best new drama. And the award for best serial drama performance went to Katie McGlynn for her portrayal of Sinead Tinker in Coronation Street. ""That was nerve-wrecking trying to get up them steps in this dress,"" McGlynn laughed. She thanked the soap's bosses for ""trusting me with this huge story line"" and dedicated the award to her late granddad, who had encouraged her to put herself forward for it. He died just a month before her first audition on the show. Fellow fictional Weatherfield resident Peter Ash won the trophy for best newcomer. Finally, Gavin and Stacey was given a special ""Impact"" award and writer/actor Ruth Jones said it ""wasn't easy bringing the show"" back after a decade for the recent Christmas special. The episode became the UK's most-watched scripted TV programme of the entire 2010s, with days to spare. Jones admitted that she wished co-writer and now US-dweller James Corden ""was here to share this"". ""He and I have been on a journey that has lasted over 15 years."" Slipping into character and a thick Welsh accent for a second, Jones, or Nessa rather, delivered a pointed message to audience member and alleged former flame Sir Tom Jones. ""I don't know what you're laughing at Tom, you never writes, you never phones... ""There's still a lot of electricity between me and Tom and don't you knows it,"" she added.

Pompeo flies to UK for talks amid US Huawei concern,"Mike Pompeo urged the UK to prioritise its security interests when dealing with Chinese firm Huawei on his visit to the UK in May last year US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged the UK to reconsider allowing Huawei to have a role in its 5G system, ahead of talks with Boris Johnson. He told reporters the UK had a chance to ""relook"" at the decision, stressing the US needed to be sure its allies had ""trusted"" information networks. The US believes the Chinese firm's equipment poses a spying risk. But Culture Secretary Baroness Morgan said it ""in no way"" affects the ability of the UK to share classified data. Ahead of his meeting with the PM, Mr Pompeo held talks with his UK counterpart, Dominic Raab, on Wednesday evening. The Foreign Office said Mr Raab reiterated his ""disappointment"" at the US decision toreject an extradition request for Anne Sacoolas- the diplomat's wide suspected of causing the death of Harry Dunn by dangerous driving. Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash in Northamptonshire in August, which led to suspect Ms Sacoolas leaving for the US under diplomatic immunity. What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Huawei set for limited role in UK 5G networks How UK's Huawei decision affects rest of the world Dominic Raab ""emphasised the importance of delivering justice for Harry Dunn and his family"" to Mike Pompeo, the Foreign Office said The US had repeatedly warned that giving Huawei a role in 5G could allow the Chinese government a ""back door"" into the telecoms network through which they could carry out espionage or cyber attacks. Ahead of his arrival in London, Mr Pompeo told reporters the US wanted to ""work with"" the UK following the National Security Council's decision to give Huawei a role in spite of those warnings. This video can not be played Baroness Morgan: UK has ""got the expertise"" in Huawei ""We were urging them (the UK) to make a decision that was different than the one they made and we'll have a conversation about how to proceed,"" he said. ""There is also a chance for the UK to relook at this as implementation moves forward, and then it's important for everyone to know there is also real work being done by lots of private companies inside the US and in Europe to make sure that there are true competitors to Huawei."" He added: ""We will make sure that when American information passes across a network we are confident that that network is a trusted one."" The UK has insisted the firm will be barred from sensitive locations, such as nuclear sites and military bases and its share of the market will be capped at 35%. Baroness Morgan also told BBC Breakfast the UK had expertise is mitigating risks when using Huawei's technology, as it was already part of existing 4G networks - unlike in the US. She said: ""We want to see the roll-out of 5G... for the growth of our economy and productivity, but in making this decision, we have been very clear we will not compromise on national security.

But we have got that expertise, we have had that oversight of Huawei... which gives our agencies the ability to give the assurance that having them involved in the periphery of the network does not present the security challenge I think others have worried about."" The UK's decision also faced a criticism from some senior Conservative MPs after Mr Raab made a statement about it in the Commons. Tom Tugendhat, former chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, tweeted that the government's ""statement leaves many concerns and does not close the UK's networks to a frequently malign international actor"". But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace downplayed such concerns, telling the BBC the UK should not be ""paranoid"" that the decision would lead to ""Big Brother from China watching us"". Asked about how the US might react Mr Wallace said: ""I don't know how they'll react... they've made their concerns clear. ""We understand that - we respect that, we've given them lots of assurances that the intelligence they share and how they share it."" A series of US congressional figures called on the UK to reconsider, saying the decision could be an obstacle to a post-Brexit trade deal between the US and UK, as well as raising questions over security co-operation. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, called for a ""thorough review"" of intelligence sharing with the UK. ""I fear London has freed itself from Brussels only to cede sovereignty to Beijing,"" he said. The decision gave China a foothold to carry out ""pervasive espionage"" on the UK and gave it ""increased economic and political leverage"", he said. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who is one of the president's most committed defenders, said he was ""very concerned"" and urged the UK to think again. ""This decision has the potential to jeopardise US-UK intelligence sharing agreements and could greatly complicate a US-UK free trade agreement,""he tweeted,external.

"Breaking|Breaking newsNorthern rail to be put into public ownershipTroubled rail firm Northern is to be brought under government control from 1 March, after months of disruptionEngland","This video can not be played Overcrowding on trains has been one of many issues facing Northern passengers Troubled rail company Northern is to be brought under government control. The decision, which will see the firm's franchise stripped from operator Arriva Rail North from 1 March, was taken following years of major disruption. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said passengers had ""lost trust in the north's rail network"". Arriva said it ""understood the government's decision"", but problems had been largely due to ""external factors"" such as rail infrastructure. Northern passengers have faced rail chaos ever since new timetables were introduced in May 2018, and punctuality and reliability problems have continued to blight the network. This video can not be played Passengers outside Leeds train station respond to finding out Northern being nationalised Mr Shapps said: ""People across the north deserve better, their communities deserve better and I am determined to achieve that."" The move means services will be operated by an arms-length government-owned company. 'Good riddance' to Northern rail What will happen to Northern rail tickets? German-based Arriva had been due to run Northern until March 2025. But Mr Shapps revealed in October he had requested a proposal from Northern to outline its plans to improve services,after ""unacceptable"" delays and cancellations. The Department for Transport then had to consider whether to hand a new, short-term contract to Arriva, or to nationalise services by putting the government-controlled Operator of Last Resort (OLR) in charge. Frustrated rail users let their feelings be known at Manchester Piccadilly in 2018 The company has faced a range of problems in recent years, includingwidespread cancellations and delaysfollowing the introduction of new timetables. It also faced challenges due to infrastructure projects,strike actionand an ageing fleet of trains. Its continued poor performance earned it the nickname 'Northern Fail' from frustrated passengers. Recent figures from Office of Rail and Road revealed how just56% of Northern trains arrived at stations within a minute of the stated time on the timetablein the 12 months to 7 December. That compares to an average across Britain of 65%. Northern said external factors had made the company's plan for the network ""undeliverable"". These included prolonged industrial action by the RMT, and delayed and cancelled infrastructure projects. More than half of delays on the entire UK rail network were down to problems with the infrastructure, like signalling. Government-owned firm Network Railwas put on a warning earlier this monthfor its poor service on routes in the North West and Midlands. This video can not be played Hayley Camfield says overcrowding causes major problems for disabled passengers Northern services will transfer from Arriva Rail North to Northern Trains Limited, a newly formed subsidiary of the Department for Transport's OLR. OLR is a public company, staffed by experienced train managers, which reports directly to the government. It already manages the London North Eastern Railway (LNER) franchise after rail services on the East Coast Main Line werebrought back under government control in May 2018. However, this was only supposed to last for two years. Sam Barnes said she was in support of the government takeover For many people who have faced repeated delays travelling on Northern trains, the news has been welcomed. ""Good riddance,"" said Sam Barnes, 56, from Todmorden, West Yorkshire. ""My brother-in-law is a train driver on London routes and when he finishes his shift it takes him ages to get home on Northern as they are always delayed."" Read more on how Northern passengers have reacted. Mr Shapps described the move as ""a new beginning for Northern"" but he sounded a note of caution for those expecting immediate dramatic improvements. ""Northern's network is huge and complex, some of the things which are wrong are not going to be quick or easy to put right,"" he said. The much-maligned Pacer trains must still be replaced and Mr Shapps said new technology would be rolled out to identify overcrowding issues. He also revealed plans to extend platforms at 30 stations on the Northern network to allow for longer trains. The new government-owned company will be asked to prepare a plan in the first 100 days ""to make sure we leave no stone unturned in improving this franchise for passengers"". This is an uncomfortable moment for the government. In the end, nationalising this vast commuter network was its only option. An agreement to change Arriva's contract and keep the firm on board wasn't possible because a commercially, and politically, palatable deal couldn't be found. What the government wants on Northern is a new performance-related train contract, like existing ones for Merseyrail and the London Overground, which put less risk on the train company. As one rail boss described it, this type of system will be very similar to a nationalised railway, but private companies will still have a role to play. Northern's failure is in large part down to ancient infrastructure which struggles to cope with the high volume of trains and passengers at peak times. Put simply, there is no silver bullet for improving our railways. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and his Liverpool City Region counterpart Steve Rotheram described the news as a ""victory"" for passengers. In a joint statement, they called on the government to ""commit to investing in much-needed rail infrastructure and work with leaders across the north to deliver the vision and funding needed to build the modern transport network that the people of our region deserve"". Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA transport union, welcomed the decision but said the government must understand ""franchising of our railways, while stuffing the mouths of shareholders with gold, has completely failed"". Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union ASLEF, also warned ""there won't be an immediate improvement"". ""[This is] because many of the systemic failures at Northern - the late delivery of new rolling stock, the cancellation by the Conservative government of infrastructure upgrades, trying to run a service with too few drivers - cannot be remedied overnight,"" he said. Northern passengers have faced two years of rail chaos ever since new timetables were introduced in May 2018 Chris Burchell, Arriva's UK managing director, said he recognised ""overall service improvements have not come quickly enough"". ""For that, we wholeheartedly apologise,"" he said. He also thanked staff for working ""tirelessly over the last four years"". ""I am confident that as a result of the determination and hard work of the Northern rail team, they have helped set strong foundations for future improvement on the network."" While the name of the operator will change on 1 March, branding on the trains will remain the same and staff will keep their jobs. Over the next few weeks, services will continue to run and customers should continue to buy tickets in the usual way, Northern Trains Limited said. Tickets purchased for journeys using multiple train companies will still be valid, a spokesperson added. Further announcements will be made when the transfer is complete on 1 March.

Two new MoT lifts going into operationThe equipment had already been purchased from the same company that provided NI's other 55 lifts.,"Most MoT tests for cars and light vehicles in Northern Ireland have been suspended with immediate effect Two new MoT lifts are to go into operation in Northern Ireland, possibly as early as Wednesday. They had already been purchased from the same company that provided NI's other 55 lifts. Most MoT tests for cars and light vehicles in Northern Ireland have been suspended with immediate effect. It followed aninspection of vehicle lifts in NI's MoT centres that detected ""signs of cracking""in 48 out of 55 lifts. Q&A: MoT shambles As of Tuesday, more than 7,000 MoT tests had been cancelled. Speaking on Wednesday, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said the two new lifts - one in Belfast and one in Newbuildings in Londonderry - ""will allow us to increase capacity, get to those priority motorists and start to address the backlog"". She said the lifts would be independently assessed before being put into operation in Belfast and Newbuildings. Ms Mallon said she was also conscious that people with four-year-old vehicles were concerned that their cars may be clamped if they are not taxed. ""DVA is not responsible for clamping vehicles, it is the DVLA which is a separate agency,"" she said. ""But my department has been in close contact with them, we are making it clear that no-one should be penalised for a situation not of their making - very close to the position and assurances that we were able to obtain from the Association of British Insurers."" Nichola Mallon said the new lifts would help the DVA prioritise taxis and four-year-old cars The minister said that car dealerships were also being affected by the MoT problems, as they were trying to sell four-year-old cars. ""I have said to DVA officials that I want the car dealers to be expedited and prioritised in terms of getting brand new appointments,"" she said. This video can not be played Sales lost because of MoT test cancellations, says Belfast dealer ""They should be getting proactively contacted by DVA, they should be getting appointments. ""Now that we've got these two new lifts in operation I've said that they must be used to prioritise taxis and four-year-old vehicles and that includes our car dealers."" One Belfast car dealer, Martin Hamill, said sales were already being lost. ""They just turned round and said they wouldn't be happy to take the car until it was MoT'd, so I think they're going to go out and buy another car maybe with an MoT on it or maybe a newer car,"" he said. Meanwhile police in Northern Ireland have set out their position on the MoT cancellations. In their statement, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said: ""Driving without vehicle tax is not prosecuted by PSNI and is the remit of DVLA. The BBC obtained a picture of a crack in a lift at one of the vehicle test centres in Northern Ireland ""Where a police officer detects a vehicle without tax and it is outside of the 14-day grace period provided in the legislation, a referral is made to the DVLA. ""Given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MoT certificate, providing the vehicle is in a roadworthy condition, officers would be encouraged to exercise discretion."" MoT exemption certificates lasting four months will be issued so motorists are able to drive. However, these cannot be issued for four-year-old cars or taxis. This is because four-year-old cars have never been through an MoT test before, meaning they do not have a certificate to extend, while taxis are covered by different legislation. An assembly member has called for emergency legislation to be brought in to address the MoT ""crisis"". As of Tuesday, more than 7,000 MoT tests had been cancelled Roy Beggs said legislation should be considered to extend the period in which cars do not need to be have MoTs. Mr Beggs, a member of the assembly's infrastructure committee, said he had put this to Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon. ""We have to remember there's a crisis coming in four months time,"" he said. ""In four months time we'll suddenly have twice as many as cars which will become due for MoT - those which are due at that time and those that are presently due."" Mr Beggs said at the minute cars that could be 10 years old were being exempted ""I would have thought four-year-old cars would be much, much safer, much newer and built to a much higher standard and there would be a lesser risk,"" he said. ""We need to investigate all options."" The infrastructure minister, Ms Mallon, said two reviews will be conducted to determine what went wrong and how to fix it. Allow Twitter content?

Tests on heavy goods vehicles and buses will continue. Daniel Donnelly, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said many small firms depended on their vehicles. ""It's absolutely key that clarity is brought soon,"" he said. Paul Duffy, chief executive of the Driver Vehicle Agency, said each of the 55 lifts could cost Â£30,000 to Â£40,000 to replace. He said an insurance inspector who examined some of the repaired lifts on Monday was not satisfied with the work. As a result, the agency was not comfortable that the rest of the lifts were safe to use, he said. Mr Duffy said it was too early to say whether the lifts could be repaired or would have to be replaced, but there was a possibility they may need to be replaced. UK companies who manufacture MoT lifts told me the cost to replace each one could be in and around Â£30,000 to Â£40,000 because of the specifications required for testing in Northern Ireland. The average manufacturing time for each lift can be anything from five to 10 weeks. Depending on the capacity of the company they could make some simultaneously, but you are still talking a number of months to fulfil such an order. One firm told me they could fulfil the order in four months if they pushed themselves - but that's because they already have 15 in stock. So that length of time plus a contract of this size and scale would inevitably be put out to tender by the department and that process could take some time. We don't know if the lifts will be replaced but it gives you a sense of the timescale and cost the department would be facing. Ms Mallon said she has asked her permanent secretary to commission two separate reviews, which she will oversee. The first investigation will focus on ""the precise timeline and to understand who knew what and when and all actions taken"". The DVA has said it is too early to say whether vehicle lifts could be repaired or would have to be replaced She said the review will be carried out independently by auditors from outside the Department for Infrastructure. Thousands of MoTs had already been cancelledafter the cracks in lifts were detected. The suspension was announced on Monday night. Motorists have also raised concerns about insurance cover if they are unable to get MoT certificates. On Tuesday, AXA insurance said: ""We are aware of the of the ongoing issues at MOT test centres in NI and that our customers may be concerned about their insurance cover. ""AXA can confirm that until this situation is resolved, it will not be a requirement for AXA customers to have a valid MOT certificate, as long as all other policy conditions are met"". Meanwhile, on Wednesday evening,the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) in the Republic of Ireland suspended the use of vehicle lifts used in its testing centres. The NCTS said it was ""recently made aware of a defect with a similar make and model"" to its lifts. Customers areadvised to continue to book and turn up for tests. They will be completed without the under-body inspection, which will be conducted when checks have been made on the lifts.,external Thousands of MoTs cancelled over cracked lifts Faults found on 48 out of 55 lifts in MOT centres Irish car test service to carry out checks on lifts Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

A series of US congressional figures called on the UK to reconsider, saying the decision could be an obstacle to a post-Brexit trade deal between the US and UK, as well as raising questions over security co-operation. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, called for a ""thorough review"" of intelligence sharing with the UK. ""I fear London has freed itself from Brussels only to cede sovereignty to Beijing,"" he said. The decision gave China a foothold to carry out ""pervasive espionage"" on the UK and gave it ""increased economic and political leverage"", he said. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who is one of the president's most committed defenders, said he was ""very concerned"" and urged the UK to think again. ""This decision has the potential to jeopardise US-UK intelligence sharing agreements and could greatly complicate a US-UK free trade agreement,""he tweeted,external.

StubHub told to clean up ticket salesThe Competition and Markets Authority has told ticket resale firm StubHub to make website changes.,"The UK's competition watchdog has warned StubHub that it could face court action if it does not make changes to its website. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it is ""concerned"" that StubHub is not warning customers buying resale tickets that they could be turned away at some venues. The CMA said the ticket resale firm,externalcould be breaking consumer law. StubHub told the regulator that it will make further changes to its website. Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, said that the firm had previously committed to mend its online booking service following another investigation. However, the CMA has identified new issues with the ticket sellers' website. It is concerned that StubHub has been: Failing to warn people that tickets may not get them into venues that don't accept resales Pressuring customers about ticket availability, potentially using inaccurate data Failing to let people know exactly where they will sit in a venue Failing to ensure the full addresses of business vendors are displayed Dr Coscelli said it was ""unacceptable that we have now found these concerns. ""We have demanded swift action to resolve these problems."" StubHub said that it complied with everything that the CMA requested after its 2018 investigation into online ticket resales. StubHub executive Wayne Grierson said: ""We have always collaborated closely with regulators in the interests of our fans, and will continue to do so."" He added that StubHub was working quickly to resolve any ""remaining valid concerns"" the CMA held over information on its website. The CMA also said that if the changes made don't go far enough it will consider taking court action. Last year, the regulator ruled that hotel booking websiteshad to review they way they rank and display rooms, over ""pressure-selling"" concerns. Consumer group Which? later found that hotel booking websites' ""only 1 room left on our site"" claims still failed to give an accurate picture of availability. A separate investigation is underway by the CMA, looking into Viagogo's purchase of StubHub. Viagogo said in 2019 it was buying rival tickets firm StubHub from eBay, which bought the company for $310m (Â£238m) in 2007. The CMA is considering whether or not the deal will lead to a ""substantial lessening of competition"" in ticket selling. Viagogo was previously ordered by the courtsto tell buyers which seats they will get and if there is a risk they could be turned away at the door.

""I think one of the problems in the past, certainly before
the referendum, is that individuals were often treated as though they were just
interchangeable units of economic production, rather than people being given a
sense of dignity and a sense of pride and having their attachment, both to
their country and to where they grew up recognised,"" he told Laura Kuenssberg. ""In the past one of the

you do not need to leave the community that you love, in order to be happy and
successful. ""And, of course, part of that is economics, but part of it also is a
different approach to valuing people, a different political approach."" You might remember it was then Conservative Employment Secretary Norman Tebbit who spoke in 1981 of how his how his father ""got on his bike and looked for work"" during the Depression - rather than expecting work to come to him. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg has been speaking to Michael Gove - the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, also considered to be one of the most important ministers in the cabinet.

got to make sure that some of the things which drive productivity growth in

'Breakthrough' coronavirus copy grown in Australia,"The new coronavirus has been grown outside China for the first time Scientists in Australia have become the first to recreate the new coronavirus outside of China in what they have called a ""significant breakthrough"". The discovery will be shared with the World Health Organization (WHO) in the hope it may help efforts to diagnose and treat the virus. Scientists in China have also recreated the virus and shared its genome sequence, but not the virus itself. The outbreak has killed 132 people in China and infected close to 6,000. There are at least 47 cases confirmed in 16 other countries, including in Thailand, France, the US and Australia. No deaths have been reported outside China. Island quarantine plan as foreigners evacuated China coronavirus: Your questions answered How misinformation about the virus is spreading online Researchers at a specialist lab in Melbourne, Australia, said they were able to grow a copy of the virus from an infected patient. The sample was sent to them last Friday. ""We've planned for an incident like this for many, many years and that's really why we were able to get an answer so quickly,"" said Dr Mike Catton of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. Doctors said the copy could be used as ""control material"" for testing and ""will be a game changer for diagnosis"". That could involve an early-diagnosis test which could detect the virus in people who have not displayed symptoms. How are coronavirus patients treated? Chinese authorities have said the virus - like a normal flu - is able to spread during its incubation period. But the WHO has said it remains unclear whether it is contagious before symptoms appear. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? ""An antibody test will enable us to retrospectively test suspected patients so we can gather a more accurate picture of how widespread the virus is, and consequently, among other things, the true mortality rate,"" said Dr Catton. ""It will also assist in the assessment of effectiveness of trial vaccines."" According to the WHO, the incubation period can range from two to 10 days. In recent days, the number of virus cases in China has jumped rapidly, despite authorities scrambling to contain its spread. Chinese authorities have taken extensive action to effectively lock down Wuhan in Hubei province, where the virus originated, and surrounding cities.

She says now is not the time to start a campaign for the UK to rejoin, but adds: ""We must keep the dream alive, especially for young people."" She says she hopes one day the UK returns ""to the heart of Europe"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I think one of the problems in the past, certainly before
the referendum, is that individuals were often treated as though they were just
interchangeable units of economic production, rather than people being given a
sense of dignity and a sense of pride and having their attachment, both to
their country and to where they grew up recognised,"" he told Laura Kuenssberg. ""In the past one of the
stories that we've told is, people need to get up and get on, to get on their
bike. ""One of the things that we're going to try to do is to demonstrate that
you do not need to leave the community that you love, in order to be happy and
successful. ""And, of course, part of that is economics, but part of it also is a
different approach to valuing people, a different political approach."" You might remember it was then Conservative Employment Secretary Norman Tebbit who spoke in 1981 of how his how his father ""got on his bike and looked for work"" during the Depression - rather than expecting work to come to him. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg has been speaking to Michael Gove - the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, also considered to be one of the most important ministers in the cabinet. It's a wide-ranging interview, touching on Brexit, the Conservative Party and the future of the country among many other topics. On the latter, he says: We've got to change the geography of this country. ""We've
got to make sure that some of the things which drive productivity growth in
other parts of the country - that's investment in infrastructure and investment
in skills - is at the heart of everything that the government does. ""But there's something broader than that as well. ""When you've got an electoral coalition like the one that Boris has assembled,
then it's partly about making sure that people feel a sense of belonging, a
sense of pride in their community, alongside pride in their country."" European ParliamentBrussels Labour MEP Richard Corbett says he will be voting against the withdrawal agreement, arguing it is ""bad for Britain and bad for Europe"". ""They said it would be good for Britain and the economy - the opposite is true,"" he says. ""That is why the British public voted 52% for parties demanding a second referendum in the general election. ""Brexit does not have the wholehearted consent of the British people."" He predicts that the UK will return to the EU, arguing that young people are opposed to Brexit. European ParliamentBrussels In his final speech as an MEP, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says the moment of Brexit at 23.00 GMT on Friday will mark a ""point of no return"". âOnce weâve left, we're never coming back,"" he says. He adds that he hopes Brexit will mean ""the end of this project"". ""What we've proved is the British are too big to bully."" At the end of his speech, the Brexit Party delegation wave miniature union flags and cheer, prompting a rebuke from Irish MEP Mairead McGuinness, who is chairing the debate. However Mr Farage responds ""that's it, it's all over, finished,"" before leaving the chamber. European ParliamentBrussels Veteran Conservative Euroscpetic MEP Daniel Hannan, who was elected to the assembly in 1999, says the 1992 Maastricht Treaty was a turning point in British EU membership. He adds that a ""parting of ways"" became ""inevitable"" after David Cameron's renegotiation of British membership ahead of the 2016 referendum. He says the EU, however, is ""losing a bad tenant, but gaining a good neighbour"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Historic Brexit vote due in European ParliamentMEPs are set to back the terms of the UK's departure from the EU in a landmark session in Brussels.UK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played Tears, hugs and Auld Lang Syne in EU Parliament Members of the European Parliament have overwhelmingly backed the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. MEPs ratified the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by 621 votes to 49 following an emotional debate in Brussels. After the vote, MEPs marked the UK's exit by singing Auld Lang Syne. Several British MEPs said they hoped the UK would return one day although Eurosceptics, including the Brexit Party's Nigel Farage, used their final speeches to tear into the EU. The UK is due to leave the bloc at 23:00 GMT on Friday. Ratification of thewithdrawal agreement, agreed by the UK and EU in October, was not in doubt after it easily cleared its committee stage last week. As it happened: An emotional send-off for Britain New Scottish MEP sworn in - for four days Tears and relief as the UK's MEPs bid goodbye Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit Signing the letter confirming the EU's consent, the Parliament's president, David Sassoli, said the two sides must heed the words of the late Labour MP Jo Cox when approaching their future relationship and recognise ""there is more that unites us than divides us."" ""You are leaving the EU but you will always be part of Europeâ¦It is very hard to say goodbye. That is why, like my colleagues, I will say arrivederci."" This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""We will never be far"" Wednesday's session saw those on either side of the Brexit debate, including the UK's 73 MEPs, celebrate or lament the end of British EU membership. Some MEPs marked the occasion with songs - others wore ""always united"" scarves. The Parliament's Brexit spokesman, Guy Verhofstadt, said it was ""sad to see a country leaving that has twice given its blood to liberate Europe"". He added that British MEPs had brought ""wit, charm, and intelligence"" as well as ""stubbornness"", and would be missed. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said ratification of the withdrawal deal was ""only a first step"" towards a new partnership between the EU and the UK. The two should ""join forces"" in areas such as climate change, she said, and seek a close partnership following the UK's exit on Friday. ""We will always love you and we will not be far,"" she told the UK in closing. The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also wished the UK well, saying the bloc would approach talks on the future relationship with ""patience"" and ""objectivity"" while defending its members' interests. This video can not be played Green MEP: ""One day I will be back"" This video can not be played The MEP's last sitting in the European Parliament On the other side, though, Conservative MEP and prominent Eurosceptic Daniel Hannan said opinion in Britain turned against the bloc when it became clear ""the aspiration was to have the EU as a quasi-state"". ""If at any stage Britain had been able to have a trade-only relationship that would have been enough,"" he went on, but added: ""You are losing a bad tenant and gaining a good neighbour."" Mr Farage - who has been campaigning for the UK's exit since before he was first elected to the Brussels Parliament in 1999 - used his final speech to excoriate the EU. ""I want Brexit to start a debate right across Europe - what do we want from Europe?"" he said, arguing that ""trade, friendship, co-operation and reciprocity"" between nations could be achieved without ""all of these institutions and all of this power"". He and his fellow Brexit Party MEPs waved Union flags before walking out of the chamber en masse. The S&D coalition in the European Parliament put up a sign aimed at departing British MEPs - ""au revoir"" literally meaning ""goodbye until we meet again"" A tearful Molly Scott Cato was applauded and hugged by her colleagues after she spoke of her ""grief and regret"" at Brexit and the hope she would return to the European Parliament ""one day"". ""While now is not the time to campaign to rejoin the EU, we must keep the dream alive,"" the Green Party MEP said. Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts said the EU must learn lessons from the UK's decision to leave. He said the bloc had to ""regain the hearts and minds of European citizens"" by focusing on what it could do for the many, not the few. Some MEPs wore ""half-and-half scarves"" to mark the UK's final day Earlier, the S&D coalition, which houses Labour's 10 MEPs, displayed a sign aimed at departing British members, which read: ""It's not goodbye, it's au revoir."" On Tuesday evening, several MEPs in the Green group also held a ceremony to mark the UK's departure. While Brexit Party MEPs spoke of their joy and relief at leaving, others shared messages of sadness on social media as they prepared to vote for the last time. The Green Party's Alexandra Phillips tweeted: ""I'm devastated to be leaving the best job in the world. I get to make real change every day while being surrounded by 27 different languages and cultures."" Liberal Democrats shared pictures of gifts from the pro-European Renew Europe group.

After the UK leaves, there will be an 11-month transition period in which the two sides hope to negotiate their future economic relationship. Trade talks are expected to begin in earnest in early March. The European Parliament will also get a say in ratifying any future trade deal. The UK has insisted talks should not extend beyond 31 December 2020 when atransition period- which will see the UK follow EU rules - comes to an end. President Sassoli told CNN on Tuesday that the timetable for a deal was tight. He said the UK's exit would be ""painful"" for the bloc but building a new partnership based upon friendly co-operation and mutual interests was now essential.

Police to show car tax discretion over MoT issues,"Most MoT tests for cars and light vehicles in Northern Ireland have been suspended with immediate effect Two new MoT lifts are to go into operation in Northern Ireland, possibly as early as Wednesday. They had already been purchased from the same company that provided NI's other 55 lifts. Most MoT tests for cars and light vehicles in Northern Ireland have been suspended with immediate effect. It followed aninspection of vehicle lifts in NI's MoT centres that detected ""signs of cracking""in 48 out of 55 lifts. Q&A: MoT shambles As of Tuesday, more than 7,000 MoT tests had been cancelled. Speaking on Wednesday, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said the two new lifts - one in Belfast and one in Newbuildings in Londonderry - ""will allow us to increase capacity, get to those priority motorists and start to address the backlog"". She said the lifts would be independently assessed before being put into operation in Belfast and Newbuildings. Ms Mallon said she was also conscious that people with four-year-old vehicles were concerned that their cars may be clamped if they are not taxed. ""DVA is not responsible for clamping vehicles, it is the DVLA which is a separate agency,"" she said. ""But my department has been in close contact with them, we are making it clear that no-one should be penalised for a situation not of their making - very close to the position and assurances that we were able to obtain from the Association of British Insurers."" Nichola Mallon said the new lifts would help the DVA prioritise taxis and four-year-old cars The minister said that car dealerships were also being affected by the MoT problems, as they were trying to sell four-year-old cars. ""I have said to DVA officials that I want the car dealers to be expedited and prioritised in terms of getting brand new appointments,"" she said. This video can not be played Sales lost because of MoT test cancellations, says Belfast dealer ""They should be getting proactively contacted by DVA, they should be getting appointments. ""Now that we've got these two new lifts in operation I've said that they must be used to prioritise taxis and four-year-old vehicles and that includes our car dealers."" One Belfast car dealer, Martin Hamill, said sales were already being lost. ""They just turned round and said they wouldn't be happy to take the car until it was MoT'd, so I think they're going to go out and buy another car maybe with an MoT on it or maybe a newer car,"" he said. Meanwhile police in Northern Ireland have set out their position on the MoT cancellations. In their statement, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said: ""Driving without vehicle tax is not prosecuted by PSNI and is the remit of DVLA. The BBC obtained a picture of a crack in a lift at one of the vehicle test centres in Northern Ireland ""Where a police officer detects a vehicle without tax and it is outside of the 14-day grace period provided in the legislation, a referral is made to the DVLA. ""Given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MoT certificate, providing the vehicle is in a roadworthy condition, officers would be encouraged to exercise discretion."" MoT exemption certificates lasting four months will be issued so motorists are able to drive. However, these cannot be issued for four-year-old cars or taxis. This is because four-year-old cars have never been through an MoT test before, meaning they do not have a certificate to extend, while taxis are covered by different legislation. An assembly member has called for emergency legislation to be brought in to address the MoT ""crisis"". As of Tuesday, more than 7,000 MoT tests had been cancelled Roy Beggs said legislation should be considered to extend the period in which cars do not need to be have MoTs. Mr Beggs, a member of the assembly's infrastructure committee, said he had put this to Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon. ""We have to remember there's a crisis coming in four months time,"" he said. ""In four months time we'll suddenly have twice as many as cars which will become due for MoT - those which are due at that time and those that are presently due."" Mr Beggs said at the minute cars that could be 10 years old were being exempted ""I would have thought four-year-old cars would be much, much safer, much newer and built to a much higher standard and there would be a lesser risk,"" he said. ""We need to investigate all options."" The infrastructure minister, Ms Mallon, said two reviews will be conducted to determine what went wrong and how to fix it. Allow Twitter content?

Tests on heavy goods vehicles and buses will continue. Daniel Donnelly, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said many small firms depended on their vehicles. ""It's absolutely key that clarity is brought soon,"" he said. Paul Duffy, chief executive of the Driver Vehicle Agency, said each of the 55 lifts could cost Â£30,000 to Â£40,000 to replace. He said an insurance inspector who examined some of the repaired lifts on Monday was not satisfied with the work. As a result, the agency was not comfortable that the rest of the lifts were safe to use, he said. Mr Duffy said it was too early to say whether the lifts could be repaired or would have to be replaced, but there was a possibility they may need to be replaced. UK companies who manufacture MoT lifts told me the cost to replace each one could be in and around Â£30,000 to Â£40,000 because of the specifications required for testing in Northern Ireland. The average manufacturing time for each lift can be anything from five to 10 weeks. Depending on the capacity of the company they could make some simultaneously, but you are still talking a number of months to fulfil such an order. One firm told me they could fulfil the order in four months if they pushed themselves - but that's because they already have 15 in stock. So that length of time plus a contract of this size and scale would inevitably be put out to tender by the department and that process could take some time. We don't know if the lifts will be replaced but it gives you a sense of the timescale and cost the department would be facing. Ms Mallon said she has asked her permanent secretary to commission two separate reviews, which she will oversee. The first investigation will focus on ""the precise timeline and to understand who knew what and when and all actions taken"". The DVA has said it is too early to say whether vehicle lifts could be repaired or would have to be replaced She said the review will be carried out independently by auditors from outside the Department for Infrastructure. Thousands of MoTs had already been cancelledafter the cracks in lifts were detected. The suspension was announced on Monday night. Motorists have also raised concerns about insurance cover if they are unable to get MoT certificates. On Tuesday, AXA insurance said: ""We are aware of the of the ongoing issues at MOT test centres in NI and that our customers may be concerned about their insurance cover. ""AXA can confirm that until this situation is resolved, it will not be a requirement for AXA customers to have a valid MOT certificate, as long as all other policy conditions are met"". Meanwhile, on Wednesday evening,the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) in the Republic of Ireland suspended the use of vehicle lifts used in its testing centres. The NCTS said it was ""recently made aware of a defect with a similar make and model"" to its lifts. Customers areadvised to continue to book and turn up for tests. They will be completed without the under-body inspection, which will be conducted when checks have been made on the lifts.,external Thousands of MoTs cancelled over cracked lifts Faults found on 48 out of 55 lifts in MOT centres Irish car test service to carry out checks on lifts Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

UK house price growth 'at 14-month high',"UK house prices rose at their fastest annual rate for 14 months, according to the Nationwide, with an increase of 1.9% in January. Commentators suggest there has been some release of pent-up demand following the clear general election result. However, the Nationwide, which bases its figures on its own mortgage data, said it expected property prices to be flat in 2020. It valued the average home at Â£215,897. House prices were up by 0.5% in January compared with the previous month, the building society said. ""Looking ahead, economic developments will remain the key driver of housing market trends and house prices,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. ""Much will continue to depend on how quickly uncertainty about the UK's future trading relationships lifts, as well as the outlook for global growth. Overall, we expect the economy to continue to expand at a modest pace in 2020, with house prices remaining broadly flat over the next 12 months."" Cost of living 'outstripped house prices in 2010s' Will house prices rise or fall this year? Analysts said that the Brexit process would again be key to the movement of house prices. ""January is usually a busy time for estate agents as would-be buyers begin their search in earnest. But this year their numbers have been swelled by thousands of people who sat on their hands as Brexit uncertainty swirled,"" said Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders. ""Sellers too are returning to the fold, meaning the market is seeing a simultaneous uplift in both demand and supply. Only when the dust settles will we know for certain how that double stimulus affects prices."" A separate survey by property portal Zoopla showed that cities outside the south of England saw the biggest rises in prices in 2019, partly as a result of their relative affordability. Annual house price growth stood at 6.1% in Edinburgh in December 2019 - the highest among UK cities, with Nottingham seeing the second biggest increase at 5.2%.

Diabetes patients hit by glucose monitor shortage,"The company behind a blood sugar monitor that has changed the lives of thousands of diabetics has been forced to apologise after supplies ran short. Pharmacies have been turning patients away as deliveries of healthcare firm Abbott's Freestyle Libre Sensor are delayed by two or three weeks. Abbott has said it is working hard to fulfil all the orders, but gave no further explanation. Diabetes.co.uk says almost 30,000 people in the UK use the device. That amounts to about 1 in 10 of those with Type 1 diabetes. The sensor was described as life-saving when it was first offered to NHS patients in 2017. Before the device came along, they had to prick their fingers multiple times a day in order to test their blood glucose levels and work out how much insulin they need. Now they are worried about their health and the reliability of the company's supply chain. They say their lives have become immeasurably harder because of the shortage. Worldwide sales of the Freestyle Libre grew exponentially in 2019. There are more than two million users globally and Abbott's 2019 third-quarter results showed worldwide sales of the sensor raised $496m (Â£380m), an increase of 63.1% from 2018. The company has capitalised on the growing digital diabetes market as patients try to find new and easier ways to manage their healthcare. However, this is not the first time the company has been unable to fulfil orders. This time last year, users struggled to get hold of devices and at the time, this was blamed on exceptional demand for the sensors. Sarah, 42, from Northampton, has had Type 1 diabetes since she was 14. She has been back on finger prick testing for a week and says it has made a difference to the stability of her condition. ""My blood sugars have run higher and I'm at risk of overcompensating, which could cause dangerous lows."" She doesn't know when her local pharmacy will re-stock the sensors and said that Abbott shouldn't ""underestimate the impact this has"". She warned that this delay is particularly worrying for parents with diabetic children, who use the sensors to check for dangerous highs and lows during the night. Andrew is one of many Type 1 diabetics who are concerned Andrew, 34, from West Sussex, is another Type 1 diabetic. He says the sensor ""is part of my prescription, part of my care package. It's like not supplying tablets"". With a lack of clear explanation about the delay from Abbott, users and their relatives have taken to social media to share their concerns. Allow Twitter content?

A sticky patch sits on the upper arm holding a small needle, which continuously monitors blood sugar levels. It is linked to an app on a mobile phone, so the user always has a clear and precise picture of their glucose levels and can therefore inject the appropriate amount of insulin. It is vital for Type 1 diabetics, whose bodies cannot produce their own insulin, that their blood sugars remain stable. If glucose levels run high, they face long term issues including nerve damage, kidney failure and heart disease. If blood sugars run low, symptoms include shakiness, nausea and fatigue. If low blood sugar is not corrected, there is a risk of loss of consciousness and even death. In a statement, Abbott said: ""We are doing all we can to expedite shipments in an effort to minimise interruptions and we have temporarily closed our web shop during this time."" This means NHS patients who want to buy the device privately cannot. The advice from Natasha Marsland, senior clinical adviser at Diabetes UK, is for diabetics ""to monitor blood glucose levels using their usual blood monitoring kits and test strips"". She also says the charity is in touch with Abbott and has ""expressed concern"" about the situation.

"Seriously ill wait more than hour for ambulanceHeart attack and stroke patients are among those facing long delays for crews to arrive, BBC finds.Health","Heart attack, stroke and burns victims are among the seriously ill and injured patients waiting over an hour for an ambulance to arrive in England and Wales, a BBC investigation shows. The delays for these 999 calls - meant to be reached in 18 minutes on average - put lives at risk, experts say. The problems affect one in 16 ""emergency"" cases in England - with significant delays reported in Wales. NHS bosses blamed rising demand and delays handing over patients at A&E. Many ambulance services have increased staffing - only to find the extra resource largely being swallowed up by the rise in delays faced by crews queuing outside hospitals. This has meant they have had to prioritise the most serious ""immediately life-threatening"" cases, such as cardiac arrests. But these represent just a small proportion of the high-priority 999 calls. Some of the longest waits for the next most serious level of calls, including those having fits as well as heart attack, stroke and burns victims, exceeded five hours. This video can not be played Mark Mitchell says his partner Derrin died while waiting for an ambulance Derrin Cozart, 55, was at home in Northumberland on his own last year when he collapsed. He came to and rang 999. That was the last time anyone spoke to him. It was over an hour before an ambulance crew arrived. By the time they did, he was dead. He had suffered a gastrointestinal haemorrhage, which causes internal bleeding. Thirty minutes after his call the ambulance service had rung back, but could not get hold of him. It took another 48 minutes for paramedics to reach him - two crews had to be diverted while they were on their way. His partner, Mark Mitchell, was out of the country on business at the time. ""It was devastating. I've been left wondering if the ambulance had got there more quickly he may have survived. ""We just don't know - and that's heartbreaking."" The North East Ambulance Service said a full investigation was being carried out into the case. This video can not be played Waiting for ambulances: ""The system is beyond a joke"" The BBC investigation, which used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain data, has also uncovered other worrying cases. These include 70-year-old Dave Jones, from Shropshire, who waited more than two hours for paramedics to arrive after suffering a heart attack. His daughter, Rebecca Jones, said they were ""frantic with worry"" while they waited for the ambulance. ""We called back several times to check he had not been forgotten. The NHS is just so stretched - the staff are doing the best they can in impossible circumstances."" In a joint statement, the hospital and ambulance trust apologised for the delays. Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, said patients were being ""let down badly at their moment of greatest need"" and getting a quick response could be ""a matter of life or death"". She said the delays were ""undoubtedly"" related to the sustained underfunding of the NHS. Mark MacDonald, of the Stroke Association, described the findings as ""alarming"", saying a quick assessment and transfer to hospital for brain scans was vital if a patient was going to make a good recovery. ""When stroke strikes, part of your brain shuts down. And so does a part of you. Around two million neurons are lost every minute that a stroke is untreated."" The BBC asked for long waits for the two highest priority groups of 999 calls - the immediately life-threatening category ones and the emergency category two cases - from the start of 2018 when a new system of measuring response times came in. Two of England's 10 ambulance services - the West Midlands and East of England - refused to provide the information. Long waits for immediately life-threatening cases were unusual - just one in 270 cases took longer than 30 minutes to reach. That works out at less than 40 a week. But the records for category two call logs showed long waits for these emergencies were much more common. The data showed there were 385,000 waits of over an hour from January 2018 to September 2019 out of just over six million incidents responded to. That works out at more than 4,000 a week on average - or one in 16 calls. East Midlands Ambulance Service had the greatest number of long delays - one in eight calls took over an hour. Director of operations Ben Holdaway said crews were often facing long waits at A&E to hand over patients which means they ""haven't been able to get back on the road quickly"". ""Every part of the system wants to tackle these issues, but it's clear we need more staff and beds and well-functioning social care."" In Wales there were more than 1,000 cases a week on average - nearly a quarter of callouts - although their second-tier emergency calls category is a little broader than England's and includes less urgent cases like diabetes complications which could account for some of the long waits. Lee Brooks, from the Welsh Ambulance Service, accepted that some patients were waiting too long, describing it as as ""frustrating for staff as it is for patients"". Ministers are in the process of setting up a taskforce to tackle the delays. Comparable data was not available in Scotland or Northern Ireland. NHS national ambulance adviser Anthony Marsh said: ""It is not easy to reach everyone as quickly as we would all like. All our staff are working flat out."" The Department of Health and Social Care in England said the government was increasing funding for the health service and had set aside a dedicated pot to invest in ambulance services. It also said it was investing in the workforce - from September student paramedics will be entitled to a Â£5,000-a-year grant to support them during their studies.

NI hauliers call for government help over BrexitThe Freight Transport Association says funding for training will be required to develop expertise.Northern IrelandComments,"Seamus Leheny is policy manager for the Freight Transport Association The haulage industry will need government support to help with Brexit, the Freight Transport Association (FTA) has said. It comes as EU chief negotiatorMichel Barnier said the UK's choices make frictionless trade ""impossible"". Seamus Lehany, FTA policy manager, said financial aid will be needed. ""As an industry, we are going to have to provide the expertise, the paperwork to facilitate trade so we are going to need... funding for training."" Mr Lehany told BBC News NI that it is ""a quick turnaround time if we are going to have to do this"". ""We need staff to do this, and at the moment we lack the staff and training and expertise to deliver."" The UK, including Northern Ireland, is due to leave the EU on Friday. Mr Barnier said new checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain are an ""indispensable"" consequence of the Brexit deal. But last week the prime minister suggested GB-NI trade would remain ""unfettered"". A simple guide to Brexit Brexit: The UK's trade deals so far Frictionless GB to NI trade 'impossible' Those working in logistics are concerned the responsibility will fall to them as they transport goods to and from retailers and manufacturers. Beatties Distribution in Crumlin delivers two thousand packages every day across Northern Ireland with many arriving from Great Britain. Could more paperwork mean businesses have to put up their prices to consumers? Richard Armour, sales director at Beatties, said: ""It's going to mean a lot more administration for us, we've another six or seven administrative staff coming on so it's a greater cost. ""We probably spent Â£100,000 last year upgrading our service and we are going to have to spend that again this year - that all has to be paid for."" A Ballymoney retailer called North x South, that sells electrical goods to and from GB to NI, had set up a base in the Republic of Ireland in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Andy Kilpatrick is managing director of a company that sells electrical goods But it now thinks there will not be much impact on its operations. ""We don't foresee much of a change to consumer pricing - what we might find is small delays, "" managing director Andy Kilpatrick said. ""It might require new processes, there might be costs involved, it's just if we want to continue being in business, it's just part of life. Nobody really wants to invest any more resources in hypothetical situations,"" The Brexit deal means Northern Ireland will follow EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods - the rest of the UK will not. Additionally, the whole of the UK will leave the EU's customs union but Northern Ireland will continue to enforce the EU's customs code at its ports. This means some new checks and processes for goods moving between Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK. The nature and extent of any checks will only become clear near the end of a one year transition period which expires at the end of 2020.

"Mrs Brown beats Gervais and Fleabag at the NTAsThe sitcom wins for a fifth year, while Ant and Dec, Jesy Nelson and Michael Palin are also honoured.Entertainment & Arts","Mrs Brown's Boys has beaten Fleabag and After Life to win a fifth comedy prize at the National Television Awards. The awards, voted for by the British public, saw Jesy Nelson, Peaky Blinders and Sir Michael Palin all collect prizes. Ant and Dec, meanwhile, enjoyed their 19th straight NTA success as best presenters. New awards host David Walliams also won one, which he went up to collect in his underpants. National Television Awards: Red carpet in pictures How Mrs Brown's Boys became a critic-proof hit How America fell in love with Fleabag There were wins for the usual suspects Strictly Come Dancing, This Morning and Emmerdale too during the event at London's O2 Arena. Phoebe Waller-Bridge's dark comedy, Fleabag, won big at the recent Emmys, Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards, but the show was overlooked on Tuesday night in favour of Brendan O'Carroll's Saturday night sitcom, Mrs Brown's Boys. Ricky Gervais' After Life - a similarly dark comedy about a suicidal journalist who has just lost his wife to cancer - also missed out. But after thanking his family, O'Carroll was quick to praise the Netflix-produced show as ""one of the best things I've ever seen"", drawing a wave of gratitude and a smile from Gervais in the crowd. Ricky Gervais and the cast of After Life Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge was not in attendance at the NTAs Gervais previously poked fun at popular sitcoms with laughter tracks, innuendo and catchphrases in his show Extras, yet after nine years Mrs Brown's Boys continues to be a huge draw. In 2018 its Christmas special brought in 6.8 million viewers, making it the most-watched programme of the day. ""Comedy is hard, it's not easy,"" declared the Irish writer, actor and comedian. Derry Girls and Sex Education found that to their cost, missing out in the comedy stakes at this year's awards, where Ant and Dec won their 19th successive presenting award despite having not hosted their own show, Saturday Night Takeaway, in 2019. The nation's favourite double act admitted the ceremony was getting more tense for them as the years went by. ""We had our chat on the way in about this being the year we don't win it - then you go and do this again,"" joked Ant. The pair enjoyed a second win of the night with best entertainment programme I'm a Celebrity..., which they present, and dedicated the award to those affected by the bushfires in Australia, where the programme is filmed. David Walliams - who took over proceedings from usual host Dermot O'Leary - made his opening speech from raised up high on a wire. David Walliams is lifted off the ground in rehearsal The show began with a VT of him playing a strange version of himself, appearing before even stranger versions of The X Factor judges, who were also played by the host himself. Later on, sitting bare-legged on Dec's lap, he leapt up to receive his own award for best TV Judge, for his work on Britain's Got Talent. ""When I die, which I will, they will show this clip on the news - me in my pants,"" quipped Walliams. An emotional Jesy Nelson won the award for best factual programme for Odd One Out, her documentary about cyber bullying. ""I'm so sorry, this is so overwhelming. I'm such a baby,"" declared the Little Mix star. The feature was inspired by her experiences of online trolling when she first rose to fame as a youngster with the band on The X Factor. ""I want to thank every single person that was in the documentary for being so brave and courageous to tell their own story to the world,"" she added. ""I don't think we ever expected for this to have such an impact and I'm just so grateful that such a negative experience in my life turned into such a positive one."" Jesy Nelson: Online trolls made me want to die Little Mix star praised for 'inspiring' documentary Sir Michael Palin received a special recognition award and used the platform to pay tribute to ""someone who taught me more about television than anyone else"" - his fellow Monty Python star Terry Jones, whodied last week aged 77. ""He had a skill in being very ruthless but also being charming at the same time"" said Sir Michael. National Television Awards 2020 winners in full Best challenge show - Great British Bake Off Best factual programme - Odd One Out, Jesy Nelson Best drama - Peaky Blinders Best comedy - Mrs Brown's Boys Best serial drama performance - Katie McGlynn, Coronation Street Impact award - Gavin & Stacey Best live magazine show - This Morning Best TV judge - David Walliams Best new drama - Chernobyl Best TV presenter - Ant & Dec Best Newcomer - Peter Ash, Coronation Street Special recognition award - Sir Michael Palin Best drama performance - Cillian Murphy, Peaky Blinders Best serial drama - Emmerdale Best talent show- Strictly Come Dancing The Bruce Forsyth entertainment award - I'm A Celebrityâ¦ Get Me Out Of Here In the best challenge show category, Love Island lost out to The Great British Bake Off. Earlier on Tuesday, Caroline Flack, who stepped down from the ITV2 show following an assault charge, made a return to social media to wish the cast and crew of the dating show the best of luck. Host Walliams brought weary groans from the crowd with jokes about Flack, and actor Lawrence Fox. Good Morning Britain show host Piers Morgan boycotted the awards this year because, he said, ""the same people always win"" and (like a stopped clock twice a day) he wasn't wrong; Emmerdale won best soap for a fourth straight year, and This Morning and Strictly Come Dancing won awards for a 10th and fifth year in a row respectively. Holly Willoughby praised her co-host Phillip Schofield - ""this silver haired man with a heart of gold"". Strictly host Tess Daly, meanwhile, paid tribute to her late former showbiz colleague Bruce Forsyth, whose name now adorns one of the awards. ""Brucewasshow business and his memory lives on,"" she said. Claudia Winkleman, who replaced him as her on-screen partner said they would celebrate the win with ""crisps and tequila"". In between the awards, The Pet Shop Boys debuted a new song called Monkey Business, backed by a cast of colourfully dressed dancers. Peaky Blinders picked up two gongs; best drama again and best drama performance for Cillian Murphy - though you might know him better as the gangster Thomas Shelby. The popular historical drama miniseries Chernobyl gained the plaudits for best new drama. And the award for best serial drama performance went to Katie McGlynn for her portrayal of Sinead Tinker in Coronation Street. ""That was nerve-wrecking trying to get up them steps in this dress,"" McGlynn laughed. She thanked the soap's bosses for ""trusting me with this huge story line"" and dedicated the award to her late granddad, who had encouraged her to put herself forward for it. He died just a month before her first audition on the show. Fellow fictional Weatherfield resident Peter Ash won the trophy for best newcomer. Finally, Gavin and Stacey was given a special ""Impact"" award and writer/actor Ruth Jones said it ""wasn't easy bringing the show"" back after a decade for the recent Christmas special. The episode became the UK's most-watched scripted TV programme of the entire 2010s, with days to spare. Jones admitted that she wished co-writer and now US-dweller James Corden ""was here to share this"". ""He and I have been on a journey that has lasted over 15 years."" Slipping into character and a thick Welsh accent for a second, Jones, or Nessa rather, delivered a pointed message to audience member and alleged former flame Sir Tom Jones. ""I don't know what you're laughing at Tom, you never writes, you never phones... ""There's still a lot of electricity between me and Tom and don't you knows it,"" she added.

Dissatisfaction with democracy 'at record high',"The survey warns democracy in many countries is in a ""state of malaise"" Dissatisfaction with democracy within developed countries is at its highest level in almost 25 years, according to University of Cambridge researchers. Academics have analysed what they say is the biggest global dataset on attitudes towards democracy, based on four million people in 3,500 surveys. The UK and the United States had particularly high levels of discontent. ""Across the globe, democracy is in a state of malaise,"" report author Roberto Foa said. The study, from the University of Cambridge's Centre for the Future of Democracy, has tracked views on democracy since 1995 - with the figures for 2019 showing the proportion dissatisfied rising from 48% to 58%, the highest recorded level. Is democracy having a mid-life crisis? Middle classes being squeezed out by the ultra-rich Life expectancy in the US in decline A brief history of populism What would Plato have to say about democracy and referendums? ""We find that dissatisfaction with democracy has risen over time and is reaching an all-time global high, in particular in developed countries,"" Dr Foa said. The research, covering 154 countries around the world, is based on asking people if they are satisfied or dissatisfied with democracy in their own country. Data for some countries goes back to the 1970s and the long-term picture recorded a steady upwards swing of the pendulum towards more satisfaction with democracy through the last decades of the 20th Century. The economic crash and widening social divisions have been linked to a loss of confidence in democracy This was an era of the collapse of Communist power in Eastern and Central Europe and the apparent ascendancy of Western democracy - with ""global sentiment"" appearing to be supportive of the rise in democracy. But over the past decade, this appears to have shifted steadily in a more negative direction - with rising dissatisfaction. The study suggests this could reflect political and social reverberations of the ""economic shock"" of the financial crash of 2008 and disquiet from the refugee crisis of 2015 and ""foreign policy failures"". It warns of a loss confidence in democracy and says the rise of populism is not so much a cause but a symptom. In the UK, the study says, from the 1970s satisfaction with democracy rose consistently for 30 years - reaching a high point in the years following the millennium. But it has slipped downwards since 2005 - following global trends such as the financial crisis and national controversies such as MPs' expenses. And researchers say there has been a more recent plunge in satisfaction, which could reflect the political stalemate around Brexit, in surveys carried out before December's general election: In 1995, the proportion of those dissatisfied with democracy in the UK was 47% In 2005, it reached its lowest point - 33% In 2019, in surveys before the general election, it reached 61% The US, meanwhile, has seen high levels of satisfaction - about 75% between 1995 and 2005 - followed by a ""dramatic and unexpected"" decline, to below 50%. Homelessness in Los Angeles: The US has seen a sharp fall in satisfaction with democracy Such cynicism might not be unusual in some countries but Dr Foa said it represented a ""profound shift in America's view of itself"". The study says satisfaction has deteriorated in the wake of the financial crash, with political polarisation and deepening levels of distrust. But a group of European countries has been bucking this trend, with satisfaction with democracy higher than ever before in Denmark, Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands. ""If confidence in democracy has been slipping, it is because democratic institutions have been seen failing to address some of the major crises of our era, from economic crashes to the threat of global warming,"" said Dr Foa. ""To restore democratic legitimacy, that must change."" Is democracy having a mid-life crisis?

Will the Bank of England cut interest rates?,"The Bank of England is set to announce whether or not it will change or hold interest rates on Thursday. The Bank's ""base rate"" is used by High Street banks and other lenders who set borrowing costs. Some investors think the first cut to the rate since 2016 could be on the cards, although others say it is too close to call. The rate, which is currently 0.75%, affects everything from mortgages to business loans and has a big impact on people's and companies' finances. So why could a cut be coming up? And how could that affect consumers' bank balances? Inflation, the rate at which prices for goods and services increase, is one key factor the Bank of England considers when setting the base rate. Inflation dropped to 1.3% in December, down from 1.5% in November, partly due to a fall in the price of women's clothing and hotel rooms. If the Bank thinks inflation is likely to stay below its target of 2%, it may cut interest rates to lower the cost of borrowing and therefore encourage spending. Other recent sets of data might suggest that the UK economy could do with a boost from its central bank. Retail sales fell in December as Christmas shoppers bought less food and goods in the run-up to the festive period. In the three months to December,external, the quantity bought in retail sales fell by 1% when compared with the previous three months. Overall, the UK economy grew by just 0.1%in the three months to November. Initial estimates suggest that the economy shrank by 0.3% that month. That was largely down to a decline in both services and production. Economists at Bank of America expect the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to cut the base rate to 0.5% on Thursday. ""We had thought that the MPC might wait until a few months after the general election, or the chancellor's first Budget, to make a decision on interest rates,"" said Robert Wood, chief UK economist at Bank of America. ""But it seems as though they might want to offer a helping hand to the economy a bit sooner than expected."" Earlier in January, markets put the likelihood of a rate cut as high as 70% - although this is now back down at about 50%. And even Mr Wood believes Thursday's decision is ""finely balanced"". As other figures have noted, there are brighter spots in the UK economy. For example, the UK employment rate stands at a record high of 76.3%,according to the latest release from the Office for National Statistics.,external Some surveys have also shown a more positive outlook for business after voters went to the polls in December. UK manufacturing and services saw their best month for more than a year in January,according to the composite purchasing managers' index (PMI). IHS Markit, which compiled the survey, said demand was growing after the election. James Smith, an economist at ING, said the Bank's decision would be a ""close call"" and questioned whether businesses would remain optimistic. ""The key conundrum for policymakers is whether or not this [optimism] will last."" He added that the MPC committee, headed up by the outgoing governor Mark Carney, could wait to see ""how better survey data translates into real economic activity, before deciding whether to act at future meetings"". ""We aren't expecting a rate cut this week,"" he said. Whether the base rate is held or falls, High Street banks often pass on the costs to their customers, by raising or cutting the rates offered on loans or savings accounts. So a cut to the base rate could make it less rewarding to save. After the Bank of England last cut interest rates in 2016, the average savings rate for an ""easy access"" bank account fell by 0.14% in the three months after, according to financial information service Moneyfacts. Savings accounts rates have been cut by some banks more recently. Santander announced a cut to the interest paidon balances up to Â£20,000 in its 123 current account from 1.5% to 1%. From 5 May, the interest paid on balances up to Â£20,000 in Santander's 123 account will be cut However, a rate cut could be good news for borrowers, as the rate of interest they repay is likely to be lower. Those on a variable-rate mortgage, or a ""tracker"" mortgage, could see changes in their bills. But if you're on a fixed-rate mortgage and the Bank of England's base rate is cut, you won't benefit from reduced repayments.

"Lives 'at risk' from long ambulance delaysThousands of emergency cases each week waiting over an hour for paramedics to arrive, BBC finds.HealthTop universities told to widen access to placesThe admissions gap between wealthier and poorer students should half in five years, a watchdog says.Family & Education","Heart attack, stroke and burns victims are among the seriously ill and injured patients waiting over an hour for an ambulance to arrive in England and Wales, a BBC investigation shows. The delays for these 999 calls - meant to be reached in 18 minutes on average - put lives at risk, experts say. The problems affect one in 16 ""emergency"" cases in England - with significant delays reported in Wales. NHS bosses blamed rising demand and delays handing over patients at A&E. Many ambulance services have increased staffing - only to find the extra resource largely being swallowed up by the rise in delays faced by crews queuing outside hospitals. This has meant they have had to prioritise the most serious ""immediately life-threatening"" cases, such as cardiac arrests. But these represent just a small proportion of the high-priority 999 calls. Some of the longest waits for the next most serious level of calls, including those having fits as well as heart attack, stroke and burns victims, exceeded five hours. This video can not be played Mark Mitchell says his partner Derrin died while waiting for an ambulance Derrin Cozart, 55, was at home in Northumberland on his own last year when he collapsed. He came to and rang 999. That was the last time anyone spoke to him. It was over an hour before an ambulance crew arrived. By the time they did, he was dead. He had suffered a gastrointestinal haemorrhage, which causes internal bleeding. Thirty minutes after his call the ambulance service had rung back, but could not get hold of him. It took another 48 minutes for paramedics to reach him - two crews had to be diverted while they were on their way. His partner, Mark Mitchell, was out of the country on business at the time. ""It was devastating. I've been left wondering if the ambulance had got there more quickly he may have survived. ""We just don't know - and that's heartbreaking."" The North East Ambulance Service said a full investigation was being carried out into the case. This video can not be played Waiting for ambulances: ""The system is beyond a joke"" The BBC investigation, which used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain data, has also uncovered other worrying cases. These include 70-year-old Dave Jones, from Shropshire, who waited more than two hours for paramedics to arrive after suffering a heart attack. His daughter, Rebecca Jones, said they were ""frantic with worry"" while they waited for the ambulance. ""We called back several times to check he had not been forgotten. The NHS is just so stretched - the staff are doing the best they can in impossible circumstances."" In a joint statement, the hospital and ambulance trust apologised for the delays. Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, said patients were being ""let down badly at their moment of greatest need"" and getting a quick response could be ""a matter of life or death"". She said the delays were ""undoubtedly"" related to the sustained underfunding of the NHS. Mark MacDonald, of the Stroke Association, described the findings as ""alarming"", saying a quick assessment and transfer to hospital for brain scans was vital if a patient was going to make a good recovery. ""When stroke strikes, part of your brain shuts down. And so does a part of you. Around two million neurons are lost every minute that a stroke is untreated."" The BBC asked for long waits for the two highest priority groups of 999 calls - the immediately life-threatening category ones and the emergency category two cases - from the start of 2018 when a new system of measuring response times came in. Two of England's 10 ambulance services - the West Midlands and East of England - refused to provide the information. Long waits for immediately life-threatening cases were unusual - just one in 270 cases took longer than 30 minutes to reach. That works out at less than 40 a week. But the records for category two call logs showed long waits for these emergencies were much more common. The data showed there were 385,000 waits of over an hour from January 2018 to September 2019 out of just over six million incidents responded to. That works out at more than 4,000 a week on average - or one in 16 calls. East Midlands Ambulance Service had the greatest number of long delays - one in eight calls took over an hour. Director of operations Ben Holdaway said crews were often facing long waits at A&E to hand over patients which means they ""haven't been able to get back on the road quickly"". ""Every part of the system wants to tackle these issues, but it's clear we need more staff and beds and well-functioning social care."" In Wales there were more than 1,000 cases a week on average - nearly a quarter of callouts - although their second-tier emergency calls category is a little broader than England's and includes less urgent cases like diabetes complications which could account for some of the long waits. Lee Brooks, from the Welsh Ambulance Service, accepted that some patients were waiting too long, describing it as as ""frustrating for staff as it is for patients"". Ministers are in the process of setting up a taskforce to tackle the delays. Comparable data was not available in Scotland or Northern Ireland. NHS national ambulance adviser Anthony Marsh said: ""It is not easy to reach everyone as quickly as we would all like. All our staff are working flat out.""

Island quarantine plan as foreigners leave China,"Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of China's coronavirus outbreak, as more deaths and cases are confirmed. Australia plans to quarantine its evacuees on Christmas island 2,000km (1,200 miles) from the mainland. Japan, the US and the EU are also repatriating their citizens. British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China, as the UK's Foreign Office warned against ""all but essential travel"" there. Several other airlines have taken similar measures. United Airlines and Cathay Pacific are restricting flights, while Lion Air - one of the region's biggest airlines - is stopping flights to China from Saturday. Cathay Pacific has also suspended inflight trolley services, changed some aspects of its meal offer, and stopped giving out hot towels, pillows, blankets and magazines in an effort to prevent the virus spreading. China's national women's football team is being quarantined in Australia after arriving there to play in an Olympic qualifying tournament, Australian media report. Thirty-two players and staff will stay in isolation in a hotel in Brisbane as a precaution until 5 February, officials said. The team, which passed through Wuhan last week, had been due to play Thailand on 3 February. In another development, the furniture retailer Ikea said it was temporarily shutting half its 30 stores in China ""in response to the Chinese government's call for efficient control of the spread of the disease"". An expert from the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) said it could take 10 more days for the outbreak to peak. The number of deaths from the virus has risen to 132 in China. Like the similar Sars and influenza viruses, the new coronavirus is a particular risk for elderly people and those with pre-existing illnesses. The sharp rise in cases is in part attributed to increased awareness, monitoring and testing in recent days. The number of cases of the new coronavirus has reached nearly 6,000 in China, surpassing the number of Sars cases in the country in the 2003 outbreak. The virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. It causes severe acute respiratory infection and there is no specific cure or vaccine. A number of people, however, have recovered after treatment. BA suspends flights to and from mainland China Starbucks closes 2,000 China outlets due to virus Coronavirus: Denmark in cartoon bust-up with China Australia's 600 evacuees will be held on Christmas Island for two weeks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. The announcement sparked controversy as the island is best known for a recently reopened immigration detention centre, which was criticised for its conditions. Currently only housing one Sri Lankan family of four, the facility was built to accommodate more than 1,000 people. New Zealand will co-operate with Canberra to bring its 53 citizens home alongside the Australian evacuees. By Frances Mao, BBC News, Sydney For over a week now, the Australians trapped in Wuhan - many of them children - have been calling on their government to help get them out. But the announcement of a two-week quarantine on Christmas Island have given many pause for thought. The external territory - closer to Indonesia than the Australian mainland - has long had a bad reputation. Since 2003, it's been one of the main places offshore where Australia detains asylum seekers, in conditionscriticised by the UN. But what will happen to the Sri Lankan family of four when others arrive? And are the medical facilities on the island adequate for the evacuees? Chinese-Australians are also asking why their children are being sent miles away, as opposed to hospitals on the mainland. Would this happen, they ask, to Australians who were holidaying in the UK? Some 200 Japanese nationals have been flown from Wuhan and have landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Around 650 others said they wanted to be repatriated, and the Japanese government said new flights were being planned. According to Japanese media, several of the returnees were suffering from fever or coughs. All will be taken to hospital, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms. They will then be tested in a quarantine ward before they can go home, and will be told not to leave their houses until the results are known. This video can not be played Like others who've been in Hubei province, the BBC's Stephen McDonell is staying away from the office for two weeks About 200 Americans - including workers from the local US consulate - are due to arrive in California after leaving Wuhan on an evacuation flight. CNN quotes health officials in Alaska, where the plane first landed on American soil, as saying they underwent health screenings and were then allowed to continue on to California. The UK Foreign Office is arranging the evacuation of about 200 Britons who wanted to leave the area. But someUK citizens have criticised the government, claiming lack of support for returning home. Australia to revive island detention centre Wuhan people cry out 'stay strong' from windows Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? A flight carrying 250 French nationals is also expected to leave Wuhan; and Italy is planning a flight for more than 50 of its citizens on Thursday. South Korea said about 700 of its nationals would leave on four flights this week. Both Malaysia and the Philippines also said they would evacuate their citizens in and around Wuhan. Meanwhile,Hong Kong announced plans to slash cross-border travelbetween the city and mainland China. Wuhan - as well as the wider Hubei province - is already effectively in a lockdown with strict transport restrictions. Kazakhstan is closing all passenger travel with its neighbour and Papua New Guinea has announced that travellers from Asia will be barred from entering. Confirmations of person-to-person transmission in Germany, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan - as opposed to travellers bringing the virus from China - have heightened concern about the spread of the virus. The United Arab Emirates has confirmed the first cases in the Middle East - a family who had recently arrived in the country from Wuhan. How are coronavirus patients treated? Leading Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan told Xinhua news agency: ""I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be no large-scale increases."" China has agreed that the World Health Organization (WHO) will send international experts to the country.

Long ambulance delays 'affect thousands each week',"Heart attack, stroke and burns victims are among the seriously ill and injured patients waiting over an hour for an ambulance to arrive in England and Wales, a BBC investigation shows. The delays for these 999 calls - meant to be reached in 18 minutes on average - put lives at risk, experts say. The problems affect one in 16 ""emergency"" cases in England - with significant delays reported in Wales. NHS bosses blamed rising demand and delays handing over patients at A&E. Many ambulance services have increased staffing - only to find the extra resource largely being swallowed up by the rise in delays faced by crews queuing outside hospitals. This has meant they have had to prioritise the most serious ""immediately life-threatening"" cases, such as cardiac arrests. But these represent just a small proportion of the high-priority 999 calls. Some of the longest waits for the next most serious level of calls, including those having fits as well as heart attack, stroke and burns victims, exceeded five hours. This video can not be played Mark Mitchell says his partner Derrin died while waiting for an ambulance Derrin Cozart, 55, was at home in Northumberland on his own last year when he collapsed. He came to and rang 999. That was the last time anyone spoke to him. It was over an hour before an ambulance crew arrived. By the time they did, he was dead. He had suffered a gastrointestinal haemorrhage, which causes internal bleeding. Thirty minutes after his call the ambulance service had rung back, but could not get hold of him. It took another 48 minutes for paramedics to reach him - two crews had to be diverted while they were on their way. His partner, Mark Mitchell, was out of the country on business at the time. ""It was devastating. I've been left wondering if the ambulance had got there more quickly he may have survived. ""We just don't know - and that's heartbreaking."" The North East Ambulance Service said a full investigation was being carried out into the case. This video can not be played Waiting for ambulances: ""The system is beyond a joke"" The BBC investigation, which used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain data, has also uncovered other worrying cases. These include 70-year-old Dave Jones, from Shropshire, who waited more than two hours for paramedics to arrive after suffering a heart attack. His daughter, Rebecca Jones, said they were ""frantic with worry"" while they waited for the ambulance. ""We called back several times to check he had not been forgotten. The NHS is just so stretched - the staff are doing the best they can in impossible circumstances."" In a joint statement, the hospital and ambulance trust apologised for the delays. Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association, said patients were being ""let down badly at their moment of greatest need"" and getting a quick response could be ""a matter of life or death"". She said the delays were ""undoubtedly"" related to the sustained underfunding of the NHS. Mark MacDonald, of the Stroke Association, described the findings as ""alarming"", saying a quick assessment and transfer to hospital for brain scans was vital if a patient was going to make a good recovery. ""When stroke strikes, part of your brain shuts down. And so does a part of you. Around two million neurons are lost every minute that a stroke is untreated."" The BBC asked for long waits for the two highest priority groups of 999 calls - the immediately life-threatening category ones and the emergency category two cases - from the start of 2018 when a new system of measuring response times came in. Two of England's 10 ambulance services - the West Midlands and East of England - refused to provide the information. Long waits for immediately life-threatening cases were unusual - just one in 270 cases took longer than 30 minutes to reach. That works out at less than 40 a week. But the records for category two call logs showed long waits for these emergencies were much more common. The data showed there were 385,000 waits of over an hour from January 2018 to September 2019 out of just over six million incidents responded to. That works out at more than 4,000 a week on average - or one in 16 calls. East Midlands Ambulance Service had the greatest number of long delays - one in eight calls took over an hour.

Wuhan people cry 'stay strong',"Keeping spirits up in virus-hit Wuhan As the number of coronavirus infections continues to grow, millions of people have gone into lockdown in Wuhan - the centre of the outbreak - to try to stop the virus spreading. But in this time of isolation some people are determined to raise each others' spirits. The deadly outbreak comes as China celebrates one of the most important dates in its calendar  - Lunar New Year. Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving all rolled into one - typically a time filled with lots of cheer. For many, it's the only chance in a year they have to meet up with their family and exchange gifts of food and money. In Wuhan people have been encouraged to stay home to minimise the spread of the virus. But residents in a block of flats found a small way to cheer each other up. Videos circulating on social media show people shouting ""Wuhan jiayou"" out of their windows- roughly translated to ""Stay strong Wuhan"" or ""Keep on going Wuhan"". This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city The phrase is echoed across the block and residents can be heard cheering in the background. Add oil! The Chinese expression keeping people going Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? China coronavirus: A visual guide Coronavirus: How worried should we be? It's also a cheer that's being repeated online. On social media site Weibo, the phrase ""Wuhan jiayou"" has been trending. Many across different parts of the country are posting the phrase in solidarity with Wuhan - where the majority of deaths as a result of the virus have occurred. ""We will get through this. Wuhan jiayou, the whole country is supporting you,"" said one comment on Weibo. More than one hundred people - mostly in Wuhan - have now died as a result of the outbreak which has spread across China and internationally. Though there is plenty of fear and anger at the authorities on social media in China, state media has been highlighting kind acts and stories of residents banding together in Wuhan. One new restaurant owner in Wuhan spent the Lunar New Year festival packing food for medical workers in the city, according to state news outlet Changjiang Daily. Li Bo had opened a restaurant in the city just a month ago. He sold his car and borrowed money in order to raise the funds for it. But before the 36-year-old could properly get his business started, the outbreak kicked in - leaving the streets of the city empty and his restaurant deserted. ""I panicked. I lay at home worrying about how I was going to repay the loan,"" he told Changjiang Daily. ""But then I saw [news] about how the medical staff in hospitals were struggling and I felt like it was time for me act. I wanted to do my part, no matter how insignificant."" According to a report by news site Beijing News, some hospitals in Wuhan have experienced food shortages. Two residents living in Wuhan had previously told the BBC that people in the city have been trying to stockpile food. Li Bo is packing 200 lunch boxes for medical workers at a local hospital Li Bo along with his chef spent days buying ingredients and cooking enough food to fit into 200 boxes. He told the news outlet on 26 January that he was in the process of finding enough boxes to pack the food into, adding that the meals would eventually be delivered to medical staff in Wuhan's Xiehe Hospital. ""I wanted to do my best to [make sure] the medical staff eat hot meals. I hope they get the nutrition they need and that will boost their immunity,"" he told the paper, adding that he plans to continue the food deliveries for as long as he can. ""I hope the city we love gets better soon."" Fears of the coronavirus have seen thousands across the country flocking to buy face masks - triggering a mask shortage in some places. Masks have become such a valuable commodity that many on Weibo have joked that they would rather receive face masks instead of the typical monetary gifts given out during Lunar New Year. One villager in Changde, a neighbouring province of Hubei where Wuhan is located, decided he would donate almost 15,000 face masks, according to news outlet the Xiaoxiang Morning Herald. Hao Jin had last year worked in a mask production factory. He eventually resigned from the job but the company could not afford to pay him his salary. He was instead given 15,000 masks - worth 20,000 yuan (Â£2,207; $2,883) as a form of compensation. He brought the masks home and forgot about them until he heard news of the mask shortage. ""I thought I would donate the masks I have to those in need, I hope they can be of more use and value to others,"" he said. He kept a handful of the masks for his family, and distributed some to those in his village before donating the rest to people in his county.

Laws for sustainable fishing planned post-Brexit,"All fish stocks in UK waters will be fished at sustainable levels after Brexit, the government says, as it publishes new legislation. The Fisheries Bill gives the UK power to operate as an independent coastal state and guarantees it will quit the EU Common Fisheries Policy in December. Environment group Greener UK welcomed the focus on sustainability. But fishing is likely to be a key area of contention in post-Brexit trade talks between the EU and UK. The Common Fisheries Policy currently sets out how much British fishermen can catch and where. It also allows vessels registered elsewhere in the EU to fish in UK waters - but the new legislation will end those automatic rights of access. Why is everyone talking about fishing? Varadkar: EU will have stronger team in trade talks Instead, access will be for the UK to negotiate in the future and foreign vessels will have to be licensed if they fish in British waters. Earlier this week, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told the BBC the UK ""may have to make concessions (in a future EU trade agreement) in areas like fishing in order to get concessions from us in areas like financial services"". But Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers insisted the bill ""takes back control of our waters"". She said it would enable the UK ""to create a sustainable, profitable fishing industry for our coastal communities, whilst securing the long-term health of British fisheries"". She added that leaving the ""failed"" Common Fisheries Policy was ""one of the most important benefits of Brexit"". The bill sets down in law that all fish stocks must be fished at sustainable levels, and aims to ensure species such as dolphins are protected. It also includes measures on ""climate-smart fishing"" to consider the impact of climate change on the sector - for example, if fish populations move as a result of rising temperatures. Patrick Killoran, from Greener UK - a coalition of 13 environmental organisations - said the focus on climate change and sustainability was ""very helpful"". ""It recognises that vibrant fisheries create a healthier wider environment,"" he said. ""However, this will only work if the government closes loopholes in the last bill that allowed ministers to exceed fishing limits."" He said more detail was need on ""how the government will actually ensure sustainable fishing"".

'Breakthrough' copy grown,"The new coronavirus has been grown outside China for the first time Scientists in Australia have become the first to recreate the new coronavirus outside of China in what they have called a ""significant breakthrough"". The discovery will be shared with the World Health Organization (WHO) in the hope it may help efforts to diagnose and treat the virus. Scientists in China have also recreated the virus and shared its genome sequence, but not the virus itself. The outbreak has killed 132 people in China and infected close to 6,000. There are at least 47 cases confirmed in 16 other countries, including in Thailand, France, the US and Australia. No deaths have been reported outside China. Island quarantine plan as foreigners evacuated China coronavirus: Your questions answered How misinformation about the virus is spreading online Researchers at a specialist lab in Melbourne, Australia, said they were able to grow a copy of the virus from an infected patient. The sample was sent to them last Friday. ""We've planned for an incident like this for many, many years and that's really why we were able to get an answer so quickly,"" said Dr Mike Catton of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. Doctors said the copy could be used as ""control material"" for testing and ""will be a game changer for diagnosis"". That could involve an early-diagnosis test which could detect the virus in people who have not displayed symptoms. How are coronavirus patients treated? Chinese authorities have said the virus - like a normal flu - is able to spread during its incubation period. But the WHO has said it remains unclear whether it is contagious before symptoms appear. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? ""An antibody test will enable us to retrospectively test suspected patients so we can gather a more accurate picture of how widespread the virus is, and consequently, among other things, the true mortality rate,"" said Dr Catton. ""It will also assist in the assessment of effectiveness of trial vaccines."" According to the WHO, the incubation period can range from two to 10 days. In recent days, the number of virus cases in China has jumped rapidly, despite authorities scrambling to contain its spread. Chinese authorities have taken extensive action to effectively lock down Wuhan in Hubei province, where the virus originated, and surrounding cities.

The virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. It causes severe acute respiratory infection and there is no specific cure or vaccine. A number of people, however, have recovered after treatment. BA suspends flights to and from mainland China Starbucks closes 2,000 China outlets due to virus Coronavirus: Denmark in cartoon bust-up with China Australia's 600 evacuees will be held on Christmas Island for two weeks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. The announcement sparked controversy as the island is best known for a recently reopened immigration detention centre, which was criticised for its conditions. Currently only housing one Sri Lankan family of four, the facility was built to accommodate more than 1,000 people. New Zealand will co-operate with Canberra to bring its 53 citizens home alongside the Australian evacuees. By Frances Mao, BBC News, Sydney For over a week now, the Australians trapped in Wuhan - many of them children - have been calling on their government to help get them out. But the announcement of a two-week quarantine on Christmas Island have given many pause for thought. The external territory - closer to Indonesia than the Australian mainland - has long had a bad reputation. Since 2003, it's been one of the main places offshore where Australia detains asylum seekers, in conditionscriticised by the UN. But what will happen to the Sri Lankan family of four when others arrive? And are the medical facilities on the island adequate for the evacuees? Chinese-Australians are also asking why their children are being sent miles away, as opposed to hospitals on the mainland. Would this happen, they ask, to Australians who were holidaying in the UK? Some 200 Japanese nationals have been flown from Wuhan and have landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Around 650 others said they wanted to be repatriated, and the Japanese government said new flights were being planned. According to Japanese media, several of the returnees were suffering from fever or coughs. All will be taken to hospital, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms. They will then be tested in a quarantine ward before they can go home, and will be told not to leave their houses until the results are known.

Australia to revive island detention centre Wuhan people cry out 'stay strong' from windows Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? A flight carrying 250 French nationals is also expected to leave Wuhan; and Italy is planning a flight for more than 50 of its citizens on Thursday. South Korea said about 700 of its nationals would leave on four flights this week. Both Malaysia and the Philippines also said they would evacuate their citizens in and around Wuhan. Meanwhile,Hong Kong announced plans to slash cross-border travelbetween the city and mainland China. Wuhan - as well as the wider Hubei province - is already effectively in a lockdown with strict transport restrictions. Kazakhstan is closing all passenger travel with its neighbour and Papua New Guinea has announced that travellers from Asia will be barred from entering. Confirmations of person-to-person transmission in Germany, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan - as opposed to travellers bringing the virus from China - have heightened concern about the spread of the virus.

Virus recreated outside China for the first time,"The new coronavirus has been grown outside China for the first time Scientists in Australia have become the first to recreate the new coronavirus outside of China in what they have called a ""significant breakthrough"". The discovery will be shared with the World Health Organization (WHO) in the hope it may help efforts to diagnose and treat the virus. Scientists in China have also recreated the virus and shared its genome sequence, but not the virus itself. The outbreak has killed 132 people in China and infected close to 6,000. There are at least 47 cases confirmed in 16 other countries, including in Thailand, France, the US and Australia. No deaths have been reported outside China. Island quarantine plan as foreigners evacuated China coronavirus: Your questions answered How misinformation about the virus is spreading online Researchers at a specialist lab in Melbourne, Australia, said they were able to grow a copy of the virus from an infected patient. The sample was sent to them last Friday. ""We've planned for an incident like this for many, many years and that's really why we were able to get an answer so quickly,"" said Dr Mike Catton of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. Doctors said the copy could be used as ""control material"" for testing and ""will be a game changer for diagnosis"". That could involve an early-diagnosis test which could detect the virus in people who have not displayed symptoms. How are coronavirus patients treated? Chinese authorities have said the virus - like a normal flu - is able to spread during its incubation period. But the WHO has said it remains unclear whether it is contagious before symptoms appear. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? ""An antibody test will enable us to retrospectively test suspected patients so we can gather a more accurate picture of how widespread the virus is, and consequently, among other things, the true mortality rate,"" said Dr Catton. ""It will also assist in the assessment of effectiveness of trial vaccines."" According to the WHO, the incubation period can range from two to 10 days. In recent days, the number of virus cases in China has jumped rapidly, despite authorities scrambling to contain its spread. Chinese authorities have taken extensive action to effectively lock down Wuhan in Hubei province, where the virus originated, and surrounding cities.

Britons warned against travel to mainland China,"The Foreign Office is warning Britons not to travel to mainland China, unless their journey is essential. It comes as Britons in Hubei Province, at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, prepare to be flown home as early as Thursday. The virus has caused more than 100 deaths, spreading across China and to at least 16 other countries. There have been no confirmed cases in the UK so far, with 97 people testing negative for the virus. Britons in China want more UK support Hong Kong to slash border travel Coronavirus: How worried should we be? China coronavirus: A visual guide The FCO had already warned against all travel to Hubei Province, saying anyone there who could leave should do so. Itsnew advice,externalwarns against ""all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China (not including Hong Kong and Macao)"". It warns the Chinese government is imposing further restrictions on movement, adding: ""It may become harder over the coming weeks for those who wish to leave China to do so."" The FCO is arranging to evacuate Britons from Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, urging those who want to leave to contact the British consulate before 11:00 local time on Wednesday. Up to 300 British people are thought to be in the area, which is now under strict travel restrictions. Officials estimate as many as 200 of them will want to return to the UK. One teacher in Wuhan, the capital city of the province, told the Press Association UK citizens were being given details of forthcoming flights - with some understood to be scheduled to fly back on Thursday morning. Wuhan is in lockdown, with travel out of the city restricted Travel journalist Simon Calder told BBC News the FCO's change of advice was ""extremely significant"". ""My estimate is that there are around 10,000 holidaymakers in China at the moment and many thousands more who are on business or living as expatriates,"" he said. ""The Foreign Office is being clear that it is not overly concerned with people who are there at the moment, it is more that they want to manage the scale of any possible problems. ""At the moment people can fly freely in and out of Beijing and Shanghai - the Foreign Office appears to be concerned that cities like that could be closed at short notice."" Mr Calder said airlines flying from the UK to China ""have all said that they will provide refunds and anyone booked on a package holiday due to depart imminently will be entitled to a full refund"". Those with packages booked to depart beyond the next week or so may be told to wait and see by their travel company, in case the FCO changes its advice. ""Anyone who travels to China against the Foreign Office advice risks invalidating their insurance,"" he added. Amie Keeley, head of news at Travel Weekly, said it was a quiet time for organised tours in China, but operators had been offering customers with bookings later in the year refunds or alternative travel dates. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was ""working urgently to finalise arrangements for an assisted departure from Hubei Province for British nationals this week, and are in contact with people in Hubei to ensure they register their interest and that we can keep them updated"". A man entering the subway in Beijing having his temperature checked Britons have also been advised by the FCO to ""comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities"".

A UK expert developing a vaccine against the virus has said it has a ""very good chance"" of being effective. Professor Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, said he plans to start testing the vaccine on animals by the middle of February, with human studies in the summer if enough funding is secured. Britons in parts of China affected by the virus have been criticising the UK governmentfor not doing enough to help them leave. Some in Wuhan said they had been given little information, compared with those from other countries. The US and Japan have been sending planes to Wuhan to evacuate their citizens. Meanwhile, tests on people who have returned to the UK from the area are continuing. One man currently being tested was filmed as he left home in Harborne, Birmingham, on Monday, on his way to hospital. A Twitter video shows a man, top (wearing black), walking into an ambulance and a medic in a protective suit A video posted on Twitter,externalby a neighbour showed him being escorted to an ambulance by a medic wearing a protective suit. Earlier, Public Health England in the West Midlands said blood tests on the man were ongoing but it later said it was not in a position to comment on individual cases and would not provide rolling updates on tests. It said testing for coronavirus involved taking samples from the patient's nose, throat and deeper respiratory tract and sending them to a laboratory which could provide a result within 24 hours.

Foreigners evacuated from China virus epicentre,"Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of China's coronavirus outbreak, as more deaths and cases are confirmed. Australia plans to quarantine its evacuees on Christmas island 2,000km (1,200 miles) from the mainland. Japan, the US and the EU are also repatriating their citizens. British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China, as the UK's Foreign Office warned against ""all but essential travel"" there. Several other airlines have taken similar measures. United Airlines and Cathay Pacific are restricting flights, while Lion Air - one of the region's biggest airlines - is stopping flights to China from Saturday. Cathay Pacific has also suspended inflight trolley services, changed some aspects of its meal offer, and stopped giving out hot towels, pillows, blankets and magazines in an effort to prevent the virus spreading. China's national women's football team is being quarantined in Australia after arriving there to play in an Olympic qualifying tournament, Australian media report. Thirty-two players and staff will stay in isolation in a hotel in Brisbane as a precaution until 5 February, officials said. The team, which passed through Wuhan last week, had been due to play Thailand on 3 February. In another development, the furniture retailer Ikea said it was temporarily shutting half its 30 stores in China ""in response to the Chinese government's call for efficient control of the spread of the disease"". An expert from the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) said it could take 10 more days for the outbreak to peak. The number of deaths from the virus has risen to 132 in China. Like the similar Sars and influenza viruses, the new coronavirus is a particular risk for elderly people and those with pre-existing illnesses. The sharp rise in cases is in part attributed to increased awareness, monitoring and testing in recent days. The number of cases of the new coronavirus has reached nearly 6,000 in China, surpassing the number of Sars cases in the country in the 2003 outbreak. The virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province.

Historic Brexit vote due in European ParliamentMEPs are set to back the terms of the UK's departure from the EU in a landmark session in Brussels.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Tears, hugs and Auld Lang Syne in EU Parliament Members of the European Parliament have overwhelmingly backed the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. MEPs ratified the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by 621 votes to 49 following an emotional debate in Brussels. After the vote, MEPs marked the UK's exit by singing Auld Lang Syne. Several British MEPs said they hoped the UK would return one day although Eurosceptics, including the Brexit Party's Nigel Farage, used their final speeches to tear into the EU. The UK is due to leave the bloc at 23:00 GMT on Friday. Ratification of thewithdrawal agreement, agreed by the UK and EU in October, was not in doubt after it easily cleared its committee stage last week. As it happened: An emotional send-off for Britain New Scottish MEP sworn in - for four days Tears and relief as the UK's MEPs bid goodbye Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit Signing the letter confirming the EU's consent, the Parliament's president, David Sassoli, said the two sides must heed the words of the late Labour MP Jo Cox when approaching their future relationship and recognise ""there is more that unites us than divides us."" ""You are leaving the EU but you will always be part of Europeâ¦It is very hard to say goodbye. That is why, like my colleagues, I will say arrivederci."" This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""We will never be far"" Wednesday's session saw those on either side of the Brexit debate, including the UK's 73 MEPs, celebrate or lament the end of British EU membership. Some MEPs marked the occasion with songs - others wore ""always united"" scarves. The Parliament's Brexit spokesman, Guy Verhofstadt, said it was ""sad to see a country leaving that has twice given its blood to liberate Europe"". He added that British MEPs had brought ""wit, charm, and intelligence"" as well as ""stubbornness"", and would be missed. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said ratification of the withdrawal deal was ""only a first step"" towards a new partnership between the EU and the UK. The two should ""join forces"" in areas such as climate change, she said, and seek a close partnership following the UK's exit on Friday. ""We will always love you and we will not be far,"" she told the UK in closing. The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also wished the UK well, saying the bloc would approach talks on the future relationship with ""patience"" and ""objectivity"" while defending its members' interests. This video can not be played Green MEP: ""One day I will be back"" This video can not be played The MEP's last sitting in the European Parliament On the other side, though, Conservative MEP and prominent Eurosceptic Daniel Hannan said opinion in Britain turned against the bloc when it became clear ""the aspiration was to have the EU as a quasi-state"". ""If at any stage Britain had been able to have a trade-only relationship that would have been enough,"" he went on, but added: ""You are losing a bad tenant and gaining a good neighbour."" Mr Farage - who has been campaigning for the UK's exit since before he was first elected to the Brussels Parliament in 1999 - used his final speech to excoriate the EU. ""I want Brexit to start a debate right across Europe - what do we want from Europe?"" he said, arguing that ""trade, friendship, co-operation and reciprocity"" between nations could be achieved without ""all of these institutions and all of this power"". He and his fellow Brexit Party MEPs waved Union flags before walking out of the chamber en masse. The S&D coalition in the European Parliament put up a sign aimed at departing British MEPs - ""au revoir"" literally meaning ""goodbye until we meet again"" A tearful Molly Scott Cato was applauded and hugged by her colleagues after she spoke of her ""grief and regret"" at Brexit and the hope she would return to the European Parliament ""one day"". ""While now is not the time to campaign to rejoin the EU, we must keep the dream alive,"" the Green Party MEP said. Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts said the EU must learn lessons from the UK's decision to leave. He said the bloc had to ""regain the hearts and minds of European citizens"" by focusing on what it could do for the many, not the few. Some MEPs wore ""half-and-half scarves"" to mark the UK's final day Earlier, the S&D coalition, which houses Labour's 10 MEPs, displayed a sign aimed at departing British members, which read: ""It's not goodbye, it's au revoir."" On Tuesday evening, several MEPs in the Green group also held a ceremony to mark the UK's departure. While Brexit Party MEPs spoke of their joy and relief at leaving, others shared messages of sadness on social media as they prepared to vote for the last time. The Green Party's Alexandra Phillips tweeted: ""I'm devastated to be leaving the best job in the world. I get to make real change every day while being surrounded by 27 different languages and cultures."" Liberal Democrats shared pictures of gifts from the pro-European Renew Europe group.

After the UK leaves, there will be an 11-month transition period in which the two sides hope to negotiate their future economic relationship. Trade talks are expected to begin in earnest in early March. The European Parliament will also get a say in ratifying any future trade deal. The UK has insisted talks should not extend beyond 31 December 2020 when atransition period- which will see the UK follow EU rules - comes to an end. President Sassoli told CNN on Tuesday that the timetable for a deal was tight. He said the UK's exit would be ""painful"" for the bloc but building a new partnership based upon friendly co-operation and mutual interests was now essential.
