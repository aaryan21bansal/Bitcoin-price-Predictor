'I've come to rescue you': My grandfather at Dunkirk,"I went to see the film Dunkirk because of my grandfather, Guy Farrer. He was one of the volunteers who went over to rescue British and French troops from the beaches. He didn't talk about it much but he wrote an account of his experiences. This is his story... In May 1940, Guy Farrer found himself approaching the beaches of Dunkirk in a small open boat. One of the trawlers in his convoy had just hit a mine and had ""gone up in a shattering explosion"". In the mist, it took him a little while to make out the thousands of soldiers sitting on the beach. The task he had been given struck him as ""crazy"". ""Fancy trying to evacuate a whole army from a shallow beach with the aid of paddle steamers and sailing barges!"" And things got crazier when he tried to persuade the soldiers to get on his boat. I lowered myself into the gentle surf and climbed up the beach into France. I approached the nearest group of soldiers, some of whom were playing cards. ""I've come to rescue you,"" I said modestly. ""Say that again, mate,"" said the corporal. ""I've come to take you off,"" I announced. ""Where to, mate?"" asked the corporal. He sounded suspicious. ""To England."" ""How we going to get there, mate?"" asked the corporal. Bethany's grandfather Guy, pictured in Suffolk before the war I took a deep breath. ""We are going by boatâ¦ We are unable to bring the boats any closer because the water is too shallow. You will therefore have to wade out to them. When we have a full complement of troops in the boats, we will row you out to the trawlers which are waiting to take you back to England. Is that clear?"" The corporal looked out to sea. ""I don't see no trawlers and I don't see no boats."" I looked behind me. The mist had thickened. There were no boats of any description visible. At the time of Dunkirk, Guy Farrer was 29 years old and a civilian. He had only got involved in the evacuation operation because he was taking a course with a yacht chandler named Capt OM Watts, in Albemarle Street, London. A keen sailor, Guy was preparing for his Yachtmaster's certificate exam, so that he could join the Navy as an officer. Guy's account, including a trip to the former King George V's barber During the class, the telephone rang. Capt Watts excused himself and was away for quite a time. 'That was the Admiralty,' he told us when he returned. ""They are requisitioning anything that will float and are asking everyone who can handle a boat to help take the troops off the Dunkirk beaches. I have been asked to appeal for volunteers. Any takers?"" A ripple of excitement flowed through the room. There were about 30 of us, all youngsters. ""When do we go?"" said one, reaching for his bowler hat. They were told to assemble in the City at 8pm that evening. There wasn't time to go home, so they went to a pub. ""We laughed and joked like a bunch of rugger supporters on their way to Twickenham,"" Guy wrote. ""This was the biggest adventure of our lives so far. Guy with his wife Peggy, who packed him a pair of pyjamas for the voyage to Dunkirk ""You will laugh when I tell you this was going to be my first trip to foreign parts. People in my income bracket didn't go abroad much in those days andâ¦ I was quite excited on that account alone."" His wife, Peggy, my grandmother, came up from their home in Richmond to see him off. She brought him a rucksack with sweaters, chocolate - and - ""you mustn't laugh"" - wrote my grandfather, a pair of pyjamas. At Tilbury, he was assigned to a lifeboat attached to a trawler.  ""I don't know how long these lifeboats have been out of commission,"" an elderly Naval commander told them. ""But we put them in the water at thirteen hundred this afternoon, and they are still afloat so they will probably be all right."" Guy began to wish he hadn't come. A 'motley procession of vessels' rescued 338,226 troops over 10 days They set off towards Dunkirk, ""part of the motliest procession of vessels which had ever put to sea in time of war"". As they approached the French coast, German aircraft appeared and a dogfight with British planes began. Bombs fell alarmingly close to their boat. ""I began to feel a little better as we neared the beaches,"" Guy wrote. But then he was faced with the challenge of trying to rescue the soldiers. After failing to persuade the corporal to come with him, he walked further along the beach until he found an officer. British soldiers shoot rifles at German aircraft attacking rescue ships at Dunkirk The officer was also suspicious, but eventually decided my grandfather wasn't an enemy agent when Guy told him he liked going to the Fox pub, halfway up Richmond Hill. Before they could get moving, there was ""a deafening roar"". I flung myself to the ground as an aircraft with its guns blazing, flew low over the beach. I wasn't able to see its markings because my eyes were tightly closed but it was clearly not one of ours. I looked around after it had gone expecting to see dead and wounded everywhere but miraculously nobody seemed to have been hit. ""I wish they wouldn't do that,"" said the officer with impressive cool. I tried to copy his nonchalant tone and said, ""I suppose you get quite used to that sort of thing."" ""Not a bit of it, old man,"" he replied, lowering his voice. ""What you get used to is pretending you are not as scared as your men are."" We walked down to the water's edge with the twenty men he had selected... The officer observing my anxious expression, said casually ""I suppose  there is more than one boat?"" ""Oh yes,"" I said. ""There's several..."" At this moment fortunately the mist lifted... and there before us... was a great armada of rescue vessels, the smaller ones close in and the biggest ones quite a long way off shore. Ships and boats of all sizes and shapes, some at anchor, some cautiously underway, some empty and some packed with men, some that would never sail again, like the one in the harbour, which was blazing from stem to stern. Over the next few hours, the volunteers struggled to row the soldiers out to the waiting trawlers, in the heavy unwieldy lifeboats, which kept getting grounded in the shallows. They had to make the troops wade out into deeper water before they could board. Once aboard the trawler, where ""every inch of deck space"" was occupied, they set off for Dover. Guy joined the Royal Navy after volunteering to rescue British forces from Dunkirk But their voyage was a brief one. Less than a mile from the beach, they hit a submerged wreck and became stuck. ""A loud groan of dismay"" went up. They were eventually rescued from the trawler by a destroyer. There was no room for kit, so Guy had to abandon my grandmother's carefully packed rucksack. Back in Dover, Guy learned with relief that he was not going to be sent back to Dunkirk, as things were ""hotting up"" there. He slept most of the way on the train back to London, woken from time to time by the locals, who greeted it with cheers and cups of tea. The arrival at Victoria brought me sharply back to reality. I rejoined my peers in the Richmond train and by half past nine I was in bed with my wife. I joined the expedition because it seemed at the time to be the right thing to do. I spent most of my time there wishing I hadn't come and I was profoundly grateful when they wouldn't let me go back. The aim of my story is to show what can happen to an ordinary young office worker should he happen to be in a certain room in Albemarle Street at a particular moment in history. After Dunkirk, Guy joined the Navy in 1941 and served in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. He eventually became a Lieutenant Commander. He died in 1984 at the age of 73.

'Airlines keep breaking my wheelchair',"Lucy Webster with friends in Barcelona The stress of air travel has increased this summer, with long queuesreported across Europebecause of tighter security and immigration checks. But for one group of passengers - those who use wheelchairs - flying often turns into an upsetting and nerve-wracking experience, whatever the time of year. From problems getting on the plane, to difficulties checking in equipment, and even being unable to go to the toilet onboard, there is always something to worry about. But there is one issue that can really ruin a holiday: damage to the wheelchairs which are our mobility lifelines. My wheelchair has been damaged multiple times, including on a recent EasyJet flight to Portugal at the end of July. So I set out to uncover the scale of the problem. I use a powerchair to get around; my cerebral palsy means my arms are too weak to propel a manual wheelchair. The chair is custom-built, heavy and extremely expensive. When I fly, my chair goes in the hold. On two successive trips in 2013, to Dublin and Barcelona, it came off the flight home making a foreboding rattling sound. A few weeks later, it stopped working. The repairs were costly and left me stuck in my university room, entirely reliant on others. If I was going to continue travelling, I needed another plan. I thought I'd solved the problem when I invested in another chair, which is specifically designed for travelling by air. The expensive piece of kit consists of a manual chair and an attachable motor. When flying, the motor can be stored in a suitcase. The idea is that breakable parts are kept safe. And yet, when I came to reassemble my chair after I arrived in Portugal last week, the motor had been bent out of shape. Five of my friends could not reattach it to the manual frame. (EasyJet says it is ""very rare"" for its ground handling companies to damage wheelchairs. When it does happen, they say, they arrange for repairs and a replacement chair. The airline also points out its customer satisfaction amongst passengers with reduced mobility was 84% in 2016). I spent the whole holiday in Portugal unable to move independently more than a few metres. And it turns out that my experience is far from unique. Dan on his trip in Philadelphia before his wheelchair was broken After flying more than 40,000 miles all over the world this year, Dan Dorszynski's wheelchair was broken on a short flight from Philadelphia to Detroit. ""The cargo guys couldn't fit it into the cargo door so they crammed it in and broke the backrest, armrest, and a few other things on my chair,"" he says. Although his chair was ""drive-able"", Dorszynski says it couldn't be fixed in time for his next trip. He bought a used version of the same model to take instead. ""Upon leaving Sweden on the way to return home, the airline insisted that I check this chair at the ticket counter instead of taking it to the gate because it was too heavy. ""I argued a bit... however it was fruitless and I just decided to let them have it so it would not be an issue. ""I get to Chicago and after all that, my back-up chair never made it on the first flight. Here I am two days later wondering where that chair is."" Michaela Hollywood on holiday on her recent trip - the first in which her wheelchair has survived unscathed Michaela Hollywood has also had difficulties when flying. ""Pretty much every time I've flown before [her most recent flight] there have been problems,"" she says. ""My chair has been lost for two weeks, only half of it brought back; stuck on the plane, stuck on the ground... my dad once had to actually put it into the hold himself."" And Jeff Courtade was left ""bedbound"" in his house for ""nearly a month"" after a flight from San Francisco to Washington DC. His highly-customised and pain-relieving chair was bent and rendered immobile. ""I am terrified of flying now,"" he says. 'A cultural problem' In my opinion, the problem has three parts: How airports and airlines handle wheelchairs How they compensate passengers for the cost of repairs The difficulty getting a temporary replacement chair in order to carry on with holidays or everyday life In the eyes of the industry, it seems, a wheelchair is the same - and as robust - as any other piece of luggage. I have seen my own motor being flung into a trolley of suitcases. Others have found their powerchairs lying on their sides on conveyor belts. Staff often do not know what they are handling - moving specially-positioned backrests and unplugging vital parts of chairs which cannot just be reattached. Chairs get lifted and pushed in ways that damage them. My powerchair's brakes were destroyed when staff pushed it without following instructions to set it to its manual settings. All wheelchairs are different, but some basic training in how they usually work would go a long way. Once a wheelchair is damaged, it is difficult and expensive to get it fixed. Transporting a broken powerchair involves specific vehicles and a lot of strength (they regularly weigh over 100kg). Spare parts, particularly for customised chairs, can take weeks to arrive and cost hundreds of pounds. A new chair could cost thousands. Being awarded compensation for these costs is also an uphill struggle. ""The issue is cultural rather than operational,"" says Roberto Castiglioni, who set up the organisationReduced Mobility Rights,externalafter experiencing the challenges of travelling with his disabled son. He now helps others to make successful compensation claims for damage or mistreatment. Thanks to the division of responsibilities between airports and airlines, there is ""endless (and useless) finger-pointing when something goes horribly wrong,"" he says. As for me, I eventually made it home from Portugal to the comfort and ease of my powerchair. I'll be setting off on my holidays again next year - perturbed but thankfully not deterred. But many will find themselves unwilling to entrust their most important belongings to an industry which - all too often - seems not to recognise their value. Remove detachable parts such as head and arms rests, footplates and joysticks and carry them onboard Submit aSpecial Declaration of Interest,externalbefore flying, allowing compensation claims above the usual cap to be made Label chairs with instructions on how to move them and which parts cannot be detached Pack detachable motors in sealed, hard cases BBC man condemns plane disability access Disabled man forced to crawl on to plane Reduced Mobility Rights - Setting New Standards in Access to Air Travel At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

How print is surviving the digital age,"Print sales have been declining for several years as readers find their content online - but now, something unusual is happening. When was the last time you bought a magazine? The answer is likely to depend on whether you prefer reading about Theresa May or Taylor Swift. Magazine sales have generally been falling since the day the inventor of the internet said: ""Hey, why don't I invent the internet?"" But the latestABC figures,external, released this week, show that sales of certain titles are actually going up. News and current affairs magazines are becoming more popular - but celebrity, gossip and fashion publications are still struggling. It's a trend that Sarah Penny, editor ofFashion Monitor,external, puts down to the news agenda. ""I think that we can all agree that the past 18 months have been pretty tumultuous within current affairs,"" she says. Readers have been choosing May and Trump over Rihanna and Kim ""With the likes of Brexit and Trump's election, the unsettled nature of society drives readers to seek out factual news and understand the effects on the economy for themselves from reputable titles that have an authoritative voice."" The titles that seem to be benefiting from this Trump bump include The Economist and The Spectator. Between January and June this year both sold more per issue than they did in the same period in 2016. Take a look at some celebrity, gossip and fashion titles, and the opposite is true. Look- weekly sales down 35% year on year to 59,390 Now- down 20.8% to 86,838 Closer- down 19.8% to 196,126 Heat- down 16.6% to 120,175 Grazia- down 13.4% to 110,031 Also losing sales:Star(down 14.3%)Vanity Fair(10%),Marie Claire(6%),OK!(3.5%) andVogue(3%). Prospect- up 37.2% to 44,545 The Spectator- up 11.3% to 85,429 Private Eye- up 8.6% year on year to 249,927 per issue The Economist- up 5% to 248,196 In the early noughties Heat magazine was an absolute bible for showbiz news junkies looking for their fix of Big Brother and Britney Spears. But these days it's more about Kylie and Kendall - and they tend to use Instagram rather than ink to connect with their fans. ""Gossip and celebrity tittle-tattle is rarely something that requires detailed analysis - so it's best suited to bite-sized content that zips around on social media,"" says Ian Burrell, media columnist forthe i paper,externalandThe Drum,external. ""Once it's out there, it's quickly shared and readers move on to the next morsel. No-one wants to wait a week to read about it in a print magazine."" Jennifer Lawrence spoke to Vogue for their 125th anniversary issue Penny adds: ""With the competition from digital media, vlogs, blogs and podcasts, readers are finding that their thirst for the content covered in the celebrity weeklies can be satisfied elsewhere for free and with ease online."" The way some quality newspapers and magazines have been able to survive in recent years is by introducing paywalls on their online content. Fraser Nelson, editor of The Spectator,wrote,externalthis week: ""A big change is taking place in the market. There's now too much writing online, and in an era of fake news, where you get your analysis from has never been more important."" ""As newspapers and magazines are finding out, if you can publish writing that is consistently and significantly better than what can be found online, people will pay."" But many editors are struggling to strike the right balance between physical and digital content. They are faced with the choice of either posting all their articles online for free so the magazine stays relevant, or charging readers money to protect the financial future of the brand. Earlier this week - US Vogue marked its 125th anniversary issue with a new interview and photo shoot with Jennifer Lawrence - one of the top film stars in the world. Sounds like a good read, right? But the whole interview was alsoposted online,externalby the magazine, removing any incentive for a fan to buy a paper copy. ""When you have major free news sites - such as Mail Online, The Sun and the Daily Mirror - pumping out celebrity and entertainment words, video and entire photo shoots around the clock, it's hard to see how a magazine is going to find it easy to charge readers for something that's likely to be offering stale news and limited pictures,"" Burrell says. ""At best, a celeb mag will be bought as a treat for the reader, which makes it a dispensable purchase in comparison to the high-quality news analysis publication providing information that its readers regard as valuable and essential."" Both Private Eye and The Spectator are seeing their circulation levels reach record highs - although The Spectator has beenaided by the way subscribers of both formats are counted twice,external- a trend they probably didn't predict when they launched their websites. But as Burrell points out: ""Many readers are hungry for a deeper understanding of the fast-moving changes in global news and politics rather than seeking to escape from it by burying their heads in celebrity gossip and entertainment stories."" A snap election in the UK and Trump's presidency have boosted sales of political titles Serious times call for serious journalism, and an extraordinarily frantic news agenda over the past year - with Brexit, Trump, a snap election, terror attacks and Grenfell Tower - has driven sales boosts for upmarket titles. This is because their intelligent take on events is a unique selling point. Whereas general-interest daily news has been turned into an almost universally available commodity by the internet, specialist journalism - from the unforgiving wit of Private Eye to the proud wonkery of Prospect - is still a service people value and think they can't get elsewhere. The internet is full of celebrity drivel, so print magazines who focus on the rich and famous will need to find something unique if they are to retain paying audiences. That something is what editors are paid to conjure up. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Is there a lost Scottish clan in northern Italy?,"Thousands of Italians emigrated to Scotland in the 20th Century, but it seems that 400 years earlier a group of Scots may have settled in a village in the Italian Alps. So local legend has itâ¦ And there are plenty of signs to suggest that maybe, just maybe, it's true. High up in the mountains of northern Italy, just a few kilometres from the Swiss border, the people of the tiny village of Gurro speak a strange dialect, incomprehensible even to the other villages in the same valley. They have peculiar surnames, and the women's traditional costume features a patterned underskirt that looks suspiciously like tartan. One possible explanation is that their forefathers include a unit of Scottish soldiers - theGarde Ecossaise- who served the French King, Francis I, and were defeated with him at the Battle of Pavia, near Milan, in February 1525. The story goes that while trying to make their way home the Scots stopped in Gurro, where they got snowed in for the winter. Many locals believe they never left. ""I've heard talk about this story since I was a child,"" says Alma Dresti, who was born and bred in Gurro. ""I know it's probably at least part legend but I like to believe in it and I do think there could be some truth in it. ""I like to imagine those strapping young soldiers trying to return home, stopping here, and liking it so much they stayed even once spring had come."" One tale describes how the Scottish visitors stole girls from the next village, celebrating their trophy brides with big parties - before waking the village priest at dawn to legalise their unions. Alma says this could explain a custom peculiar to Gurro, in which receptions were traditionally held before the marriage ceremony and weddings took place early in the morning. ""This tradition of having the wedding lunch one week before the actual marriage continued until the 1950s,"" she says. ""My parents, who got married in January 1951, did that - they had a big party with all their relatives a week before the wedding, then returned to their family homes, and then a week later got married at 6am in church."" Now 95, Alma's mother could once be found on a sunny bench passing the time of day with other women, all wearing traditional dress, including the tartan underskirt. Some have the surname Patritti, which they believe is derived from ""Patrick"". As we walk along the steep cobbled streets, Alma's youngest daughter, Sabrina, points out to me an unusual architectural feature - some of the buildings have wooden supports under the windows, positioned to form what looks like the St Andrew's cross. And she says some consider Celtic-derived words in their dialect to be a sign of Scottish origins. ""Especially the way you say 'yes'. It's 'si' in Italian and usually, in other dialects, you just change it a bit, like 'shi',"" she says. ""Here it's 'aye'. They actually switch the accent so it's more 'ayee' than 'aye' but it sounds like the Scottish way."" There are plenty more fragments of apparent evidence that locals can list. One is a typical folk song with words indicating nostalgia for the sea, although 500 years ago the people of Gurro would never have travelled far enough to see it. And there is a fisherman's knot that must have been taught to the mountain folk by men who fished. A traditional underskirt (centre) on display in the village museum All this so impressed a Scottish amateur anthropologist, Lt Col Gayre of Gayre and Nigg, baron of Lochoreshyre, that he embarked on his own investigation. His book, The Lost Clan - which bears little trace of the disturbing racial views he became notorious for - concluded that the people of Gurro most likely could claim Scottish descent, and in 1973 he symbolically adopted them into his own clan. Silvano Dresti (no relation of Alma's - it's a common name in Gurro) recalls an unforgettable party that was thrown to celebrate. ""There was a lot of excitement and the whole village was decorated with Scottish and Italian flags for the occasion. Being affiliated to a clan made us proud,"" he says. Silvano remembers the kilted Scottish baron and bagpipers, and VIP guests including Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who would later become president of Italy. A BBC Scotland television crew captured it all on film. This video can not be played Lt Col Gayre arrived with a piper and unveiled a plaque to commemorate the occasion Silvano was 18 at the time. ""I was a bell ringer,"" he says. ""I'd learned the Scottish anthem, Scotland the Brave, which I practised playing on our church bells up in the bell tower."" Alma Dresti remembers that the preparations began long in advance, with people cleaning, tidying, weeding and planting flowers. Some parents dress their children in tartan on special occasions Throughout the summer, groups of men and women gathered in the mountains above the village to practise old folk songs that they performed on the day, she says.  She was 21 and her first daughter, just two months old, was the youngest villager in traditional costume that day. ""It was such an emotion to watch the procession from the church square - the baron, the mayor, all the guests and the bagpipe players. It was so different. I still get goosebumps when I think back to it."" Her husband, Adriano Dresti, who was a village councillor at the time, has equally fond - though perhaps hazier - memories. ""We had a party in the municipal offices with the baron. There was an immediate feeling of kinship. He brought three or four crates of whisky!"" he laughs. The bar in the village had always been called the Scotch  Bar (it's now thecircolo degli scozzesi- the Scottish social club) but after the ceremony the bond with Scotland was consolidated. Silvano Dresti took up the bagpipes, though he is keen to specify that he plays the easier Italian variety, thebaghet bergamasco. Sylvano Dresti learned to play an Italian version of the bagpipes His brother, Giorgio, once dropped in on the Gayre family at their home, Minard Castle, near Inveraray. ""When he said he was from Gurro, they welcomed him in,"" Silvano says. Silvano has not visited the castle but will never forget the moment he finally made it to Scotland. His eyes mist as he remembers getting off the coach before crossing over the border from England. ""The guide explained to us, 'Over there that's where Scotland begins'. It was then and there that I felt some emotions rise up inside me that I really can't explain... Scotland... I remember thinking, 'This is the land they say we come from.'"" Stepping off the bus in Edinburgh, he heard the sound of bagpipes. ""I followed the sound through the streets until I reached the spot in front of a big store where there was a bagpiper in his kilt and finery. I already felt moved by the sound of bagpipes, but to be in the kingdom of Scottish bagpipes under the castle... that was so powerful."" Gurro's ""Scottish social club"" (the bar) is situated opposite the church A new Gaelic connection was made when Sabrina Dresti, Alma and Adriano's daughter, paid a visit to northern Scotland and fell in love with Sam MacDuff. Could the story they so fondly embrace in Gurro convince a sceptical Scot? ""Well, at first I thought it was a joke,"" Sam says. ""But when I read about it, I think it's possible, it's at least plausible that there might have been some roots."" Sam says his uncle, an academic at Edinburgh University and a genealogy and local history enthusiast, did some research of his own. ""He looked into some of the claims about the names and historical side and I think there is a reasonable amount of evidence that it might in fact be based on a certain element of truth,"" he says, cautiously. His mother-in-law remembers the reaction in Gurro when news of the engagement was announced. ""There were jokes like, 'Your daughter's going back to her roots, so now we have a real Scot and it's not just a legend any more!'"" Alma says. Visiting Scotland for the wedding was a moving experience for Alma and Adriano. ""It felt a bit like a return to our origins,"" says Alma. ""I think that all humans are happy to discover their origins and know they belong to a group. I felt at home there. I'd love to have confirmation that our story is true."" Adriano says they looked for evidence, but to no avail. ""We went to the baron's village. We even went to an old graveyard to see if we could find some names that resembled ours. We didn't find any that were similar but the emotion of that day was nice anyway."" Keen for her wedding to reflect what she regards as their shared Scottish heritage, Sabrina convinced Sam to wear a kilt. ""Yeah, for the first time in my life!"" says Sam. ""He did it mainly for me,"" laughs Sabrina,"" but also for this tradition."" Listen to Dany Mitzman's report onOutlook, on the BBC World Service.

How big is the health spending slice?,"What share of the cake budget should go on health spending? The total waiting list for routine surgery in England rising above four million patients for the first time in a decade has focused minds again on whether more money should be invested in the NHS. A raft of NHS England targets missed again, including waiting times for operations and the A&E four-hour benchmark, led one senior health official to argue that the system was ""unsustainable"" without enough resources to deliver what the public expected. New analysis shows that health spending in the UK expressed as a share of national income (GDP) is just above the average for the European Union. So does that mean the UK is spending enough on the NHS? Or is there still a need for higher funding? Comparisons between UK healthcare spending and other leading economies in the past have been difficult because of varying definitions. Some countries include elements of what could be considered social care in their published health data. But these differences have been ironed out by the international economic organisation, the OECD. Using the data compiled by the OECD, the Nuffield Trust think-tank has compiled a European league table for health spending. It shows that the UK spent 9.8% of GDP on healthcare (including both the NHS and private health) in 2014. This was slightly above the average of 9.7% for the EU 15 (the member states before the new joiners in 2004). On the face of it, this paints a rosier picture of UK health spending. Previous estimates suggested it was below the European average and that this was one of the main causes of the problems facing the NHS. The league table has the UK in the middle of the European pack, ahead of countries like Finland, Spain and Italy. But being mid-table by definition means not being one of the leaders of the pack. The UK figure is below that of three comparable economies - France, Sweden and Germany - which each spend 11.1% of national income on health. If their political and administrative leaders have all settled on the same level of spending, it is tempting to think there is a case to be made for that share of the cake to be allocated to the nation's health. The difference between 9.8% and 11.1% may not sound a lot, but in cash terms it amounts to a tidy sum.  Should the UK, through its four governments, decide to move up to that higher figure, it would add about Â£24bn a year to health spending. That would mean at least a 4p in the pound increase in income tax, or significant alternative tax-raising or cost-saving measures in other departments. Spending per head of population is another useful gauge. On this basis, Germany and Switzerland are ahead of France with each spending the equivalent of about Â£3,700 per person, compared with an approximate Â£2,850 in the UK. None of this proves that money is the answer. The case for greater efficiency in the NHS has been consistently made, with its advocates arguing that savings can be made in some areas and reallocated to front line care. Other leading economies in Europe have insurance-based health systems with a different culture to the NHS. Arguably they are less efficient than the NHS, which topped a recent international health league table compiled by the Commonwealth Fund think-tank. The authors of the analysis, written as an article for the British Medical Journal, were John Appleby of Nuffield Trust and Ben Gershlick of the Health Foundation. They argue that deciding what to invest is a complex process:  ""How much we spend on health is a political choice - informed by the preferences of the population and what we can achieve with different levels of spending, determined by the efficiency of the system."" Demands for money for the NHS will continue as winter approaches and the state of the health service rises up the political agenda. Thanks to the OECD and Nuffield, there is now some data to inform that debate. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Is healthcare spending really at record levels?

Shearer: Why I make Man Utd title favourites,"Alan Shearer joins Gary Lineker and Ian Wright on Match of the Day at 22:30 BST on Saturday night on BBC One and the BBC Sport website for highlights of eight Premier League games. I am expecting a lot of transfer activity from last season's top six before the window shuts at the end of August but, as things stands, I would say the title is between the Manchester clubs. Manchester City hired Pep Guardiola to win the Champions League and the Premier League and, despite spending a lot of money, his first year in England was a big disappointment. Guardiola has spent a fortune on full-backs and a new goalkeeper to try to rectify some of the defensive issues City had in the first trophyless campaign of his managerial career and, if he fails again, there are no more excuses for him. I think City will be there or thereabouts but, at the moment, I would go with Manchester United - just - to be champions. This video can not be played Premier League title between Manchester clubs - Shearer Whatever you think of United manager Jose Mourinho, he won two trophies last season and got them back into the Champions League, and he has strengthened them again significantly this summer. By buying Romelu Lukaku from Everton, United have signed a centre-forward who, at the age of 24, should be coming into his prime. Lukaku has scored on a regular basis in the Premier League for the past five seasons, for West Brom and Everton. He is only going to get better and, if United give him the amount of chances you would expect them to, he will score a lot of goals for them too. Nemanja Matic is another excellent signing. I was amazed Chelsea let him join one of their rivals, a team that are trying to catch them up. From what he has been saying this week, Blues boss Antonio Conte was surprised it was allowed to happen too - especially because Tiemoue Bakayoko is still not fit. This video can not be played Thereâs something 'brewing at Chelsea that isnât nice' - Shearer I know Matic is 29 and cost Â£40m, but he has got at least another two or three good years left in him, and he is exactly what United needed in midfield. Having him in the team will give Paul Pogba more freedom to get forward and I am expecting to see an improvement from him. We will see more from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford too. We will have to wait and see whether Rashford gets the chance to lead the line or has to play to one side of Lukaku, but this should still be a big season for him before next summer's World Cup. This video can not be played Clubs are creating 'strange and out of control' market - Mourinho And then there is Mourinho himself. More often than not, he finds a way to win, which is another reason I make United slight favourites. In Lukaku, Matic and centre-half Victor Lindelof, he has bought three more players to turn United into the team he wants them to be, and he is not finished yet - I think he is after one or two more this month as well. The big question marks over City are how will they do defensively and, as part of that, can they keep Vincent Kompany fit? John Stones will have to do a lot better because, for a Â£47.5m centre-half, he had a pretty poor start to his time at City. Kompany and Stones started only two Premier League games together in 2016-17 He made some mistakes but even when he had a good game he was in and out of the team. It was a really stop-start season for him and I did not think he ever really got going. He is a year older now and he will have learned from those experiences, but to make progress he has to form a proper partnership at the back and, the more he plays with Kompany, the better he will become. They only started two league games together in 2016-17, when it would have done Stones a lot of good to have his captain alongside him. Chelsea are the defending champions and when you go through their strongest XI, they are still as good as anyone else. But their issue is they need more players because they have Champions League football to deal with this season too. They have let a lot of squad players go, so even after signing Bakayoko, Antonio Rudiger and Alvaro Morata as like-for-like replacements for Matic, John Terry and Diego Costa, who looks like leaving too, they are still down numbers-wise. This video can not be played Antonio Conte - We need to improve our squad and the quality Chelsea have to go out and make two or three signings in the next couple of weeks, and Tottenham are in the same boat because they also need to bolster their squad. Having to play at Wembley already makes things more difficult for Mauricio Pochettino's side, because the opposition will raise their game there. Spurs have just fallen short in the league in the past couple of seasons and not signing anyone to try to push on now would be a huge error on their part. Spurs are at the stage where they will need to start winning things soon if they want to keep hold of their best players. It really needs to happen for them this season. This video can not be played Keeping Liverpool squad together makes sense - Klopp The Premier League season always starts before the summer transfer window shuts but, this year in particular, it feels like some big deals could be done that would change things at the top of the table. Two of them involve Liverpool. Firstly, will Philippe Coutinho go to Barcelona? If he leaves Anfield, Liverpool can forget about challenging for the title. On the other hand, the Reds want Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk and, if they were to get him and keep Coutinho, they will not be too far away. Alexis Sanchez's future at Arsenal has not been resolved yet either and there still seems to be a lot of uncertainty around the Gunners, even after Arsene Wenger signed a new two-year contract. At the moment they have got Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all entering the final year of their contracts. My guess is that is about Â£100m of talent at least. If all three leave for free in 12 months' time, you miss out on that money and also have to splash out on replacing them. Altogether we are talking about the best part of Â£200m and, I don't care how rich their owner Stan Kroenke is, that is still a heck of a lot of money whether you are a billionaire or not. This video can not be played Highlights: Arsenal beat Chelsea in penalty shootout I liked the look of Alexandre Lacazette's link-up play in the Community Shield and he adds something different to the Gunners' attack but, at the moment, it does not seem that much else about Arsenal has changed. Even if they keep all three of those players for this season, I still don't see them having enough to challenge for the title. My old team Newcastle are back in the Premier League and, for them, this season is all about staying there. Magpies boss Rafael Benitez has already said as much - I spoke to him this week for Football Focus and he was open and honest about their situation and how it will be a battle to stay up. This video can not be played Newcastle transfer activity frustrating - Benitez Benitez compared what Newcastle have spent - which is about Â£30m on four players - to the Â£20m or Â£25m that Bournemouth and Leicester have paid for just one. That shows where Newcastle are at, and what they are up against. They have not been able to get in the players they want and he is slightly frustrated. It will be difficult for them but it is a huge boost that Benitez says he is staying. With him in charge, they will be tough to beat and they have a chance. I know he is trying to get more players in before the window shuts. If they can get two or three, they might just have enough to stay up. I am on Match of the Day and Match of the Day 2 on Saturday and Sunday and I can't wait - it feels like it has been a long summer waiting for the season to start again. It is 25 years since the Premier League began and, when you consider where it is now - what has changed and by how much - then the difference is staggering. When you look at everything from transfer fees to the stadiums the teams play in, it is just incredible. In 1996, when I left Blackburn to join Newcastle for a world record fee of Â£15m, I said that there will never be a better time to be a footballer. How wrong I was - every year it just gets better and better. When I'm asked how the Premier League compares to everywhere else, I always try to consider the whole package - entertainment, excitement, stadiums, the managers and the players and their ability. So, although we might be lacking in comparison to, say, La Liga when it comes to the quality in our very top teams, if you put all of those above factors together, then the Premier League is the best.

Mixed messages: Trump v his officials on North Korea,"This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' At a time when nuclear war with North Korea seems a possible - if distant - threat, you'd think everyone would want the US administration to be on the same page. But in recent weeks, statements from President Trump and his top officials appear to directly contradict each other. President Trump's outburst on Friday - that the US military was""locked and loaded""ready to deal with North Korea - came just hours after his Defence Secretary James Mattis attempted to cool tensions by saying that diplomatic efforts were succeeding. Here are some of the other mixed messages we've heard since North Korea's second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test on 28 July. What Trump said: President Trump was pleased when the UN agreed new sanctions against Pyongyang. But he has also stressed the military option was open. On Tuesday, he boasted about America's military might and warned of ""fire and fury""if North Korea threatened the US. Then, after North Korea said it was preparing missile strikes on the US island territory of Guam, he took it up a notch again - saying the regime of Kim Jong-un should be""very, very nervous"". He said the regime would be in trouble ""like few nations have ever been"" if they did not ""get their act together"". What other officials said: Despite Mr Trump's tweets, many in his team have played down the prospect of war. Shortly after Mr Trump's comments on Guam, Gen Mattis cautioned that armed conflict would be ""catastrophic"" and insisted diplomacy was bearing fruit. ""The American effort is diplomatically led, it has diplomatic traction, it isgaining diplomatic results,"" Gen Mattis said. This video can not be played Mattis: ""The tragedy of war is known... it would be catastrophic"" US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also told reporters: ""I think the president's made it clear he prefers a diplomatic solution."" He argued that Mr Trump's words were designed to encourage dialogue with Pyongyang ""by ensuring North Korea understands what the stakes are"". Mr Tillerson has previously stressed the importance of sanctions - warning that any nation that provided economic or military benefits to the North was ""aiding and abetting a dangerous regime"". What Trump said: President Trump has praised China in the past, saying it is ""trying hard"" to rein in North Korea. However, in recent months, he has repeatedly criticised Beijing for continuing to trade with Pyongyang. ""So much for China working with us,"" the US president tweeted the day after North Korea claimed to have tested its long-range missile. At the end of July, he again said he was ""very disappointed"" with China for not doing enough to stop North Korea's weapons programme. ""They do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk,"" he wrote on Twitter. What others said: Back in June, Gen Mattis had praised Beijing's efforts to restrain North Korea's missile and nuclear activity. And on 2 August, Mr Tillerson said: ""We certainly don't blame the Chinese for the situation in North Korea."" What Trump said: The president has ratcheted up his rhetoric, warning that if North Korea attacks Guam it should expect ""big, big trouble"". ""If he [Kim Jong-un] utters one threat in the form of an overt threat... with respect to Guam or anyplace else that's an American territory or an American ally he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast."" However, he has also struck an optimistic tone, saying: ""Hopefully, it will all work out... nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump."" What others said: Secretary Tillerson has sought to assure Americans there is no imminent threat, despite some of the strong words from his boss. On Wednesday, he said the situation had not changed dramatically in recent days and that Americans ""should sleep well at night"". This video can not be played Don't listen to Tillerson - White House However, top Trump aideSebastian Gorka told BBC Newsthat Mr Tillerson was not actually speaking for the White House. ""You should listen to the president,"" Mr Gorka said. ""The idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical. ""It is the job of Secretary Mattis to talk about military options."" Sometimes Mr Trump's officials appear to disagree with each other too. Mr Tillerson struck a conciliatory tone after Pyongyang tested a second ICBM in July and claimed it could hit the US west coast. ""We do not seek a regime change, we do not seek the collapse of the regime,"" he said. ""We're not your enemy."" This video can not be played Rex Tillerson: We don't seek regime change in North Korea However, just days later Gen Mattis warned North Korea that its actions could usher in the ""end of its regime and the destruction of its people"". The Pentagon chief also said Pyongyang would be ""grossly overmatched"" in a war against the US and its allies. Trump to N Korea: US 'locked and loaded' Who's in Trump's good books?

British teen dies snorkelling in Greece,"Harry Byatt worked in Zakynthos A 19-year-old British sailing instructor has died while swimming in Greece. Harry Byatt, who worked in Zakynthos, an island in the south-west of Greece, failed to resurface after diving into the sea, his employer said. The former Eastbourne College pupil's body was found on the seabed at a depth of around 98ft (30m) on 6 August. Amemorial page,externalhas been set up paying tribute to a ""beloved son, brother, and friend"". The Peligoni Club, where Mr Byatt worked as an instructor, raised the alarm five minutes after he began swimming underwater using a monofin and a mask, a spokesman for the resort said. Mr Byatt was found unconscious and brought to the surface where CPR was administered, but doctors and medical professionals could not revive him. A statement from the East Sussex college where he studied before becoming an instructor said its community was ""deeply saddened"" by his death. ""Our thoughts are with his family at this incredibly sad time. The college and CCF (Combined Cadet Force) flags will fly at half-mast at the beginning of next term."" It went on: ""His parents and sister have asked us to let the college community know and to advise that further details about arrangements will follow in due course."" The Peligoni Club said it was working with local authorities to investigate the incident. A spokesman said: ""Three doctors, two guests from the UK and one local doctor, and an army medic from the UK did everything they could to revive him on site whilst awaiting the ambulance.""

Trump to N Korea: US 'locked and loaded',"This video can not be played Trump: North Korea will regret it fast President Donald Trump says the US military is ""locked and loaded"" to deal with North Korea, ramping up the rhetorical brinkmanship. ""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong-un will find another path!"" he tweeted. He spoke as Pyongyang accused him of ""driving"" the Korean peninsula to the ""brink of a nuclear war"". North Korea has announced plans to fire missiles near the US territory of Guam.

Tensions have risen since North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. The North Korea crisis in 300 words Can the US defend itself? The regime was further angered by last week's UN decision to increase economic sanctions against it. North Korea said it was finalising a plan to fire medium-to-long-range rockets towards Guam, where US strategic bombers are based, along with more than 160,000 US citizens.

Man denies being bus-push jogger,"Eric Bellquist ""categorically denies"" he was the jogger who pushed a woman into the path of an oncoming bus on Putney Bridge The man arrested on suspicion of pushing a woman into the path of a bus while jogging ""categorically denies"" he was involved, his lawyers say. Eric Bellquist, 41, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, following the incident on London's Putney Bridge. He was later released without charge while inquiries continue, police said. Mr Bellquist, a private equity firm partner, says he has ""irrefutable proof"" he was in the US at the time. A statement released by lawyers acting on behalf of Mr Bellquist, who was detained at a residential address in Chelsea, said: ""Our client has been wrongly implicated in this matter. ""He categorically denies being the individual concerned and has irrefutable proof that he was in the United States at the time of the incident. ""Consequently, we expect a swift resolution to this wholly untrue allegation."" Mr Bellquist works for Hutton Collins Partners and sits on the boards of the Wagamama and Byron restaurant chains, which are both owned by the firm. This video can not be played CCTV footage of a jogger who appeared to push a woman in front of a bus On Monday, CCTV footage was released showing the woman, 33, narrowly avoiding serious injury when she was pushed into the path of an oncoming bus by a jogger on Putney Bridge. The footage, captured on the morning of 5 May, shows a bus swerving to avoid the woman's head. Afterwards the driver stopped the bus, at which point several passengers got off and went to help the victim. About 15 minutes later the jogger came back the other way across the bridge. The woman, who received minor injuries, tried to speak to him but he did not acknowledge her and carried on jogging.

Anti-Islam candidate in UKIP leader bid,"The former Labour party member says Sharia courts ""treat women like absolute dirt"" An anti-Islam candidate has been allowed to stand for the UKIP leadership. Anne Marie Waters, a former Labour activist and founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, has previously called Islam ""evil"". Her leadership bid has split the party, with some MEPs threatening to quit if she was allowed into the race. But the UKIP National Executive Committee, which vets all would-be candidates, has allowed her to stand. The candidates to replace Paul Nuttall - whostood down after UKIP's poor performance in June's general election- are: Henry Bolton David Coburn Jane Collins David Kurten Marion Mason Aidan Powlesland John Rees-Evans Ben Walker Anne Marie Waters Peter Whittle David Allen Voting papers will be sent to party members over the next few weeks and the new leader will be announced at the party's annual conference in Torquay on the 29th and 30th of September. Ms Waters's leadership bid was backed by former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson and shehas previously been blockedfrom standing as a UKIP election candidate. James Carver, UKIP West Midlands MEP, said he ""sincerely hoped"" Ms Waters did not win - but added that she should be allowed to stand. He said: ""Her train of thought, I think is going about it the wrong way... there are many British Muslims in this country and that is a good thing."" The party's former leader, Paul Nuttall, has previously said her views made him ""uncomfortable"". Ms Waters believes her anti-Islam message, including a proposed ban on the burka, the closure of all sharia councils and a temporary freeze on all immigration, will strike a chord with many voters. She has argued that UKIP could regain support if it had the ""guts"" to be ""honest about Islam"" and challenge the view that it had ""nothing to do"" with jihadist violence. Last month, former leaderNigel Farage told BBC's Sunday Politicsthat ""if UKIP goes down the route of being a party that is anti the religion of Islam, then frankly it's finished"".

Bodyguard backs Taylor Swift grope claim,"Taylor Swift's ex-bodyguard has backed her sex assault claims by testifying that he saw a radio DJ reach under her skirt at a 2013 concert. Greg Dent told a Colorado court he ""did not see his hand touch her physically"", but ""saw his hand under her skirt"". Swift, 27, is suing ex-radio DJ David Mueller, 55, for allegedly groping her after she agreed to pose for a photo with him and his girlfriend. Mr Mueller sued the star for $3m (Â£2.3m), claiming she cost him his job. Ms Swift countersued a month later for the symbolic amount of $1, and has described the groping incident as ""completely intentional"". The alleged assault is said to have occurred in 2013 during a Denver stopover on the singer's Red tour. Mr Mueller, then a host on the top-rated radio station KYGO, had been invited to meet her before the show. Ms Swift complained to KYGO and the station fired Mr Mueller two days later. Taylor Swift wasn't backing down in court Taylor Swift: He grabbed under my skirt Taylor Swift's mum confronts DJ in court On Friday, Ms Swift's lawyers asked the judge to throw out the case against the pop star, arguing that she did not instruct the radio station to fire Mr Mueller. Mr Dent, who no longer works for Swift, told the court on Friday in Denver, Colorado, he was steps away when Mr Mueller posed with his girlfriend and the pop star. ""She reacted, pushed her skirt down and moved over closer to [Mr Mueller's girlfriend]. So in my opinion, I knew he touched her,"" he said. Mr Dent explained he did not act because ""he didn't sense danger after he touched her"", and Ms Swift did not signal that he should intervene. The Shake It Off and I Knew You Were Trouble singer, however, later complained and Mr Dent confronted Mr Mueller at the event. Swift 'certain' she was groped by DJ Taylor Swift trial: What you need to know His testimony came a day after Ms Swift took the stand to describe the incident, calling it a ""definite grab. A very long grab."" When Mr Mueller's lawyer, Gabriel McFarland, asked why her bodyguard did not interfere when the alleged incident happened, the pop star said: ""No-one could have expected this to happen. ""It had never happened before. It was horrifying and shocking."" Taylor Swift (left) has been present throughout the trial, often accompanied by her mother Andrea (second right) Mr Mueller's ex-girlfriend who was also in the photo, Shannon Melcher, also testified on Friday. She said she noticed nothing amiss during the brief meeting and that she and Mr Mueller were rudely escorted out of the arena later that evening. Ms Melcher added that Mr Mueller was devastated by the allegations. Mr Mueller's former radio show co-host, Ryan Kliesch, testified that he did not know his former colleague to be disrespectful toward women. He added when he heard the allegations, he ""thought it was a joke"".

Corsica beach shooting linked to nudism,"The island of Corsica is a popular destination for tourists (File photo) A shootout on a beach popular among naturists on the French island of Corsica was caused by a local businessman who disagreed with their presence there, police say. One woman was injured on Wednesday's incident, which led to dozens of nudist sunbathers fleeing Carataggio beach near Porto-Vecchio. Witnesses said the man had threatened the group if they did not get dressed. When they refused, he allegedly pulled out a rifle and started firing. The injured woman, reportedly in her thirties, was hit in the thigh as she ran away. The suspect - whose identity has not been revealed - owns a beachside cafe, police said on Friday. One man had been questioned in connection with the shooting but had since been released. Despite being famous among nudists, the beach is not an official naturist site and locals have complained about their presence there.

Eleven convicted after slavery trials,"The 11 defendants will be sentenced in September Eleven members of a traveller family have been convicted following a series of trials for modern slavery offences. The 10 men and one woman ran a driveway resurfacing company which used workers housed in caravans without running water or toilet facilities. Their victims worked long hours to fund what police said was a ""lavish lifestyle"". One had worked for the family for 26 years. The defendants will be sentenced in September. Police began operations against members of the Rooney family in September 2014, when seven warrants were executed in Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and London. A number of victims were found during the raids or were later traced and the UK Human Trafficking Centre concluded 18 men had been illegally trafficked to the sites. Ch Supt Nikki Mayo said Lincolnshire Police was aware ""through intelligence"" the workers at two travellers sites were being kept in poor conditions and worked for little money. ""The extent of these conditions soon became apparent - the victims were accommodated in caravans without running water or access to toilet facilities,"" she said. The defendants lived in comfort on the hard work of their victims The victims lived in squalor, police said The victims were all described as vulnerable adults, aged between 18 and 63, who were often homeless and had been picked up by the defendants from across the UK. Ch Supt Mayo said: ""They were being completely exploited - working long hours on driveways and block paving for the family. ""They were not given training for the manual labour and although not physically trapped, they were financially, emotionally and physically abused making any escape seem impossible. ""This exploitation was illegally funding a lavish lifestyle for the defendants. ""While their 'labourers' were suffering, company profits helped to fund luxurious holidays to Barbados, Australia, Egypt and Mexico, the purchase of high performance BMWs, spa days and even cosmetic surgery."" She said the victims had become completely institutionalised and were only fed when they worked and at times that was restricted to the family's leftovers. The investigation also found around Â£100,000 worth of stolen goods and that some members of the family had targeted elderly homeowners, getting them to sign over properties into their names. A total of four trials relating to the 11 defendants took place between November 2016 and August 2017. Ten of the 11 were released on bail ahead of the sentencing. Those convicted: John Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, conspiracy to defraud, fraud by false representation, two counts of theft Patrick Rooney, 31, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, fraud by abuse of position, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, two counts of theft Bridget Rooney, 55, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Martin Rooney, 35, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield - Conspiracy to defraud, two counts of converting criminal property Martin Rooney, 57, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, unlawful wounding Martin Rooney, 23, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby - Conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour, assault occasioning actual bodily harm Patrick Rooney, 54, of Sainfoin Farm, Gatemoor Lane, Beaconsfield - Converting criminal property John Rooney, 53, of Chantry Croft, Pontefract - Two counts of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Peter Doran, 36, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - Conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Gerard Rooney, 46, of Washingborough Road, Lincoln - Conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Lawrence Rooney, 47, of no fixed address - Conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour Two others, Eileen Rooney, 32, of Drinsey Nook, Sheffield Road, Saxilby and Nora Rooney, 31, of the same address, were both acquitted.

Gun-toting drone aims and fires in mid-air,"A US firm has armed a drone with a machine-gun and a grenade launcher in order to fight terrorism A US technology firm has developed a drone that is able to aim and fire at enemies while flying in mid-air. The Tikad drone, developed by Duke Robotics, is armed with a machine-gun and a grenade launcher. The gun can be fired only by remote control, and is designed to reduce military casualties by cutting the number of ground troops required. But campaigners warn that in the wrong hands, it will make it easier to kill innocent people. The Tikad drone, available for private sale at an undisclosed price, has won a security innovation award from the US Department of Defense, and there is interest from several military forces around the world, including Israel, reportsDefense One,external. According to the firm's website, two of the three co-founders of Duke Robotics worked for the Israel Defense Forces and the third at Israel Aerospace Industries. ""As a former Special Mission Unit commander, I have been in the battlefield for many years,"" said CEO Raziel Atuar. ""Over the last few years, we have seen how the needs of our troops in our battlefield have changed."" The weapon can be fired only remotely by human control. However, robotics expert Professor Noel Sharkey expressed concern that gun-toting drones could make it easier to kill innocent people. ""Big military drones traditionally have to fly thousands of feet overhead to get to targets, but these smaller drones could easily fly down the street to apply violent force,"" he told the BBC. ""This is my biggest worry since there have been many legal cases of human-rights violations using the large fixed-wing drones, and these could potentially result in many more."" US military to shoot down consumer drones Secret Service plans Trump security drone For the past decade, Prof Sharkey has been campaigning against killer robots, which are fully autonomous, computer-powered weapons that would be able to track and select targets without human supervision. Together with theCampaign To Stop Killer Robots,external, a coalition of over 60 international NGOs including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Nobel Women's Initiative, Sharkey has been lobbying the United Nations to ban autonomous weapons. However, the machine-gun on board the Duke Robotics device still has to be controlled remotely by a human operator. According to Prof Sharkey, some US military officials are concerned that although the US might follow the laws of war, terrorists could easily look at drone innovations and copy the idea to kill innocent people. ""We already know that Islamic State isusing drones laden with explosivesto kill people. What's to stop them from getting their hands on this? Copying has not been possible with big military drones, but once you get the idea that you can strap automatic weapons onto one and operate it remotely, that's very much easier,"" he said. ""This type of weapon is another dangerous step towards the development of fully autonomous weapons that could hunt down targets and kill them without human supervision.""

Berlin ponders urinals for women,"These urinals are a standard design but are in a gender-neutral toilet at a Berlin government building It's a common problem when you're out and about. Nature calls - but the queue for the ladies is bladder-testingly slow to advance. Meanwhile your male companion waltzes in and out with what often feels like unfair speed. Now, the Berlin city authorities plan to address the issue of gender equality in public toilets, as they seek to redevelop the city's conveniences. All locations that currently have a male-only ""pissoir"" (public urinal facility) should only exist in combination with unisex toilets, a 99-pagecity strategy paper,externalcalled ""the toilet concept"" concludes. ""In the future urinals which can be used by all genders should be offered,"" the paper says. The provision of urinals for women ""could be a subject for the continuation of the [toilet] concept and an opportunity for Berlin to show that it is innovative,"" it adds. The authors write that pissoirs serve a useful purpose, as they are an effective measure against the problem of ""Wildpinkeln"" (outdoor peeing, generally by men). It is not yet clear whether standing up to urinate will be acceptable to most Berlin women, or whether they will demand screens and/or separate cubicles. Physicists probe urination 'splashback' problem 'A lack of toilets led me to choose surgery' 'Sexist' toilets policy to be reviewed Other attributes the future ""Berliner toilet"" needs to have include good visibility at the entrance, well-lit exterior, emergency alarm, as well as discrimination-free pictograms. But what do Berlin's women think about future toilet provision in their city? And has anyone actually tried a female urinal? The toilet concept has been put together by Berlin's state government, which is currently controlled by left-wing coalition. The administration's paper shows photos of people discussing the plans at focus groups earlier this year. This conservative CDU-linked Berlin woman is sceptical. ""Why does [the state government] want me to pee standing up?"" she asks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Though her use of the hashtag #fail suggests she struggled. A German specialist in toilet design, Prof Mete Demiriz, told thewebsite jetzt.de,externalthat unisex urinals could save water, because a survey suggested that women often flush a public toilet three times during one visit. His team's design for a women's urinal, a prototype of which is installed at his university in Gelsenkirchen, includes a cubicle with a door. The system is like a men's urinal, only lower, Prof Demiriz told the website. The user has her back to the wall, and hunkers down as if skiing, he said. There are other women's urinals in existence, including a design called ""Girly"" by Italian firm Sintesibagno. It is not clear whether Berlin plans to put forward one design of urinal that could be used by both men and women. Some festivals - and the Shanxi Normal University in Xian, in China - have provided standard urinals for women plus a disposable cardboard device to help them to use them. China's Shanxi Normal University tells female students that it could save 160 tonnes of water a day if they all urinated standing up And providing gender-neutral toilets - helpful for some transgender people - can backfire, asLondon's Barbican Centre found out to its cost earlier this year,external. People complained that the queues for women at the arts centre just got longer, after the signs on one set of toilets were changed to ""gender-neutral toilet with urinals and cubicles"" and ""gender-neutral toilet cubicles only"".

US 'locked and loaded' and childbirth rethink,"The Times leads with a report that midwives have dropped their campaign for natural childbirth on the grounds that it has been making women feel bad. It says the Royal College of Midwives,externalhas overhauled its professional guidance and women will now no longer be advised that they should have babies without medical interventions, including caesareans and epidurals. In an interview with the paper, the chief executive of the RCM, Cathy Warwick, denied that what is known as the ""campaign for normal birth"", which has run since 2005, had compromised safety. But she said: ""We don't want to contribute to any sense that a woman has failed because she hasn't had a normal birth."" In an editorial,external, the paper says midwives are right to revisit received wisdom on what counts as a ""normal birth"". The paper welcomes the shift in emphasis with the focus now on what will work best for mothers and babies. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The Guardian reports,externalthat students waiting for next week's A-level results have described the stress of sitting new, untested, qualifications, which some say they have felt ill-prepared to tackle. The paper says they are the first student cohort to be examined using a more demanding set of qualifications, brought in as part of the government's education changes. It has left them feeling like ""guinea pigs"", the paper says. Some students have told the paper that the changes were ""rushed in"" with teachers struggling to master new syllabuses and with few revision materials available. One told how they felt like a ""lab rat"", saying: ""No past papers. No examiner reports. No practice. It's been awful"". The Daily Telegraph says,externaluniversities have been accused of allowing admissions to descend into a ""free for all"" as they battle to attract new students. The paper reports that many institutions are set to lower their entry grades drastically to entice young people after A-level results are released next week. It warns that the lifting of a number of controls in England in 2015 gave universities the freedom to recruit as many undergraduates as they wanted and it says the move has led to accusations that they now act like businesses, seeking to maximise their revenue by recruiting as many students as possible. The paper reports that some A-level pupils have been told their conditional offers - based around their predicted results - will be ""upgraded"" to unconditional offers if they confirm the university as their first-choice. Under the headline ""How insurers rip you off"" there is a warning onthe front page of the Daily Mail,externalthat drivers and homeowners who opt to pay for insurance by monthly instalments are unwittingly being charged hundreds of pounds extra each year. It reports that, in some cases, those who pay monthly end up being charged Â£300 a year more than if they paid in a lump sum. The paper says it believes the practice has netted three of the country's largest insurance firms more than Â£122 million in the first six months of this year. The Daily Mirror reports,externalthat online touts are already offering tickets for Premier League fixtures before the football clubs have opened their own sales. The shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, has described the inflated prices being charged as ""obscene"" and he tells the paper: ""It's been taken to a whole new level where the websites can sell tickets for matches that haven't even gone on sale."" Mr Watson has called for tougher action from the Premier League to tackle the issue. And the cartoonistMatt in the Daily Telegraph,externalcombines the current tensions in international relations with recent domestic concerns over contaminated food.

Is bag-in-box wine back?,"Amazon says its sales of boxed wine in June and July are up 212% year-on-year in the UK Supermarkets have reported a surge in sales of bag-in-box wine. Is its popularity back for good? It has long been regarded as a cheaper - and not necessarily nicer - alternative to bottled wine. But it seems bag-in-box vino is gradually shedding its image as cheap plonk and becoming the drink of choice for many, according to the latest sales figures. The packaging - developed by Australian winemaker Tom Angove in the 1960s - consists of a plastic bladder encased in a cardboard box. The drink is poured from a plastic tap. Amazon began selling boxed wine in 2015. It says sales in June and July are up 212% year-on-year in the UK. Waitrose has recorded a 15% increase, while Sainsbury's sales of its own label bag-in-box wines are up nearly 10% year-on-year. Meanwhile, sales of boxed wines at Asda are up 4.83% on last year. Susy Atkins, wine columnist for the Sunday Telegraph's Stella magazine, says bag-in-box wine is experiencing a surge in popularity because it is convenient and easy to transport. ""If I was heading to a festival, I would go for a bag in box rather than carrying bottles,"" she says. ""There are so many more outdoor events now - if not a rock festival, an outdoor cinema. ""There are good options. They won't knock your socks off, but there are viable options."" She says bag-in-box wine may also suit those who are just drinking a glass or two and want to keep their wine fresh. Plus, the quality of cheap wine has improved, she says. But she warns: ""Most wines are palatable - it doesn't mean I am recommending it."" Boxed wine has a lower carbon footprint than bottled wine, businesswoman Kirsty Tinkler says Weino BIB founder Kirsty Tinkler, who ran pop-up bar BIB Tap Room in east London in 2015 and 2016, says the attitude towards boxed wine has changed ""unbelievably quickly"" in the space of two years. It has earned a ""cool status"", she says. ""I think what has changed is the number of quality wine producers is starting to go to this format. It is not just mass produced. ""People are pleasantly surprised."" She says boxed wine has a lower carbon footprint compared to bottled wine. It's also cheaper to manufacture, and to transport. Sebastian O'Keefe - beer, wine and spirits store manager for Amazon - says bag-in-box wine increases in popularity over the summer months, because it can easily be transported to a picnic. He says drinkers are ""shrugging off"" the preconceptions of boxed wine and embracing the environmental benefits of switching from glass bottles. Waitrose - which is about to launch a selection of premium bag-in-box wine - says shoppers are looking for ""practical and environmental alternatives to glass bottles"". Indeed, bag-in-box wine can stay fresh in the fridge for four to six weeks. Perhaps it's time to open the tap, and give it a try. The wine detective battling counterfeiters Wine choice angst?

'Name the adulterer' says new divorce form,"The new-look form was introduced by the Ministry of Justice this week The government's new divorce form - which invites the writer to ""name and shame"" - could lead to more people being accused of adultery, lawyers say. The newly-designed form, used to apply for a divorce in England and Wales, asks for the name ""of the person your spouse has committed adultery with"". Family lawyers say that, in most cases, involving a third party adds ""conflict and complexity"". The Ministry of Justice said there was ""no obligation"" to name people. Lawyer Margaret Heathcote, vice-chairwoman of family law group Resolution, is one of those concerned about the form. ""Generally speaking, we don't name the third party. It increases the conflict from day one,"" she said. ""There's no need. But because the box is there, the indication will be to fill it in."" The online form has been updated to make the legal process more user-friendly - especially as some complete the process without seeking legal advice. The guidance on the form highlights that it is ""not normally necessary"" to name the person your spouse committed adultery with. But Georgina Hamblin, director at divorce lawyers, Vardags, said people are ""unlikely to read the much smaller print or choose to ignore it"". The older version of the form left a space for so-called ""co-respondents"" to be named where appropriate. ""The new form flatly asks for 'the name of the person your spouse has committed adultery with',"" Ms Hamblin explained. ""This is an invitation which I fear most broken hearts will not be able to refuse."" If you name the person your husband or wife committed adultery with, they become part of the court case. They will be sent copies of the paperwork and given a chance to respond. If they don't respond, proceedings may be delayed and could incur more costs. 'Unhappy' wife loses divorce case appeal The 'diva of divorce' for the world's super rich According to thelatest statistics,external, there were just over 100,000 divorces granted in England and Wales in 2015. Adultery was the reason for 12,148 of them. ""Unreasonable behaviour"" accounted for 46,815. Ms Hamblin said 80% of the new clients she deals with in matters of adultery ""want to get the new partner involved and to have their chance to say what they think of them"". ""But it puts the petitioner in a bad light. We have to talk clients down from doing that,"" she said. ""Judges take a very dim view of petitioners trying to bring in new partners and embroil them in proceedings."" When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following reasons: Adultery Unreasonable behaviour Desertion You have lived apart for more than two years and both agree to the divorce You have lived apart for at least five years, even if your husband or wife disagrees Source: Gov.UK A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""It has always been possible for a petitioner to name the person they believe their spouse has committed adultery with on divorce application forms. ""As set out in the previous form, and more clearly in the new form, there is obviously no obligation to do so. This is a relevant part of divorce proceedings.""

Egg scandal affecting over 15 countries,"This video can not be played How safe are Dutch eggs to eat? Fifteen EU countries as well as Hong Kong and Switzerland have received eggs contaminated with the insecticide fipronil, the European Commission says. The commission will hold a meeting with ministers and regulators on 26 September. Its food safety chief has called countries to stop ""blaming and shaming"" each other. A row has erupted over how long Belgian and Dutch authorities have known about the contamination. Eggs, coming mainly from the Netherlands, have been found to contain fipronil, a substance used to kill lice and ticks on animals that is banned by the EU for use in the food industry. It is thought it was used to combat lice in some chicken farms, affecting the eggs of laying hens. What do we know about the Europe egg scare? The insecticide can damage people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands if eaten in large quantities. However, food standards agencies are playing down the risks for anyone who has already eaten the tainted eggs. Farms were shut down in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and France after authorities confirmed that fipronil had been used, European Commission spokesman Daniel Rosario said on Friday. The EU countries that have received the eggs are the UK, Sweden, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia and Denmark. Non-EU Switzerland is also affected. Friday's revelation that tainted eggs had also been sent to Hong Kong marks the first time the widening scandal has spread outside Europe. The UK food watchdog also said about700,000 eggs had been sent to the UKfrom potentially contaminated Dutch farms, up from an earlier estimate of 21,000. The Food Standards Agency (FSA)said,externalit was very unlikely that there was a risk to public health. Processed foods containing eggs, including sandwiches and salads, have been recalled by leading supermarkets, including Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda. Supermarkets in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany have also withdrawn millions of eggs from sale. Eggs are being destroyed at chicken farms in countries including Belgium and the Netherlands On Friday, France's Agriculture Minister StÃ©phane Travert said about 250,000 affected eggs had been sold in the country since April, adding that all products containing eggs from contaminated farms would be taken off the shelves. In Hong Kong, the government's Centre for Food Safety says it identifiedtwo samples,externalof imported Dutch eggs containing excessive levels of fipronil last week and asked shops to remove the products. It has since tested other European egg imports and has not found any more ""unsatisfactory samples"", the South China Morning Post newspaper quoted a spokeswoman as saying. ""Blaming and shaming will bring us nowhere and I want to stop this,"" European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Vytenis Andriukaitis said on Friday. ""But first things first. Our common job and our priority now is to manage the situation, gather information, focus on the analysis and lessons to be learned in a view to improve our system and prevent criminal activity."" In the UK, the Dutch eggs were used in processed foods such as sandwich fillings A commission spokesperson later added that the event scheduled for 26 September was not a crisis meeting. It is unclear whether the meeting will involve all 28 EU member states, or only affected countries. On Thursday, Dutch police arrested two people in joint raids carried out with Belgian authorities. A criminal investigation is under way, centring on two firms. Poultry Vision, a pest control firm from Belgium, is alleged to have sold the treatment to a Dutch poultry farm cleaning company, Chickfriend. More than 100 poultry farms have been closed during the investigation, and 26 suspects identified and evidence seized from their companies. The Netherlands is Europe's biggest egg producer - and one of the largest exporters of eggs and egg products in the world. The problem first surfaced earlier in August, when supermarket chain Aldi withdrew all its eggs from sale in Germany. It has since emerged that Belgian officials knew about the contamination in June, but did not make the information public. Meanwhile, Belgian Agriculture Minister Denis Ducarme has accused the Dutch authorities of knowing about the problem as far back as November 2016. The food watchdog in the Netherlands has denied this. By James Gallagher, health and science reporter, BBC News Fipronil should not be allowed anywhere near food. But the risk from eggs is thought to be low, because the number of contaminated eggs is also low. While 700,000 eggs sounds like a lot, it is worth remembering we eat 34 million every single day in the UK. It is why the Food Standards Agency says it is ""very unlikely"" there is any health risk. Many of the affected eggs will have already passed through the food chain before anyone was aware of the scandal. And the FSA has now pulled egg sandwiches and egg salads off the shelves that were made while contaminated eggs were still being imported. It insisted there was ""no need"" for people to stop eating eggs.

Anger over 'untrue' climate claims,"Former Chancellor Lord Lawson's claims on climate change have been challenged by scientists Scientists have responded furiously to claims about climate change made in a live BBC radio interview. Experts told BBC News that the assertions made by former Chancellor Nigel Lawson on Radio 4's Today programme were simply untrue. Lord Lawson had claimed that global temperatures had ""slightly declined"" over the past 10 years. However, scientists working in the field said the records showed the complete opposite to be the case. BBC Radio 4's Today programme defended its decision to interview Lord Lawson on Thursday morning in a segment on climate change. The BBC argued that it had a duty to inform listeners about all sides of a debate. This video can not be played Lord Lawson's claims about climate change are ""simply not true"", says the Met Office's Peter Stott During the interview, Lord Lawson said that ""official figures"" showed that ""during this past 10 years, if anything... average world temperature has slightly declined"". Butspeaking in a follow-up discussion on Friday morning, Dr Peter Stott from the UK Met Office said the former Chancellor had got the facts wrong. ""We know that 2016 was the warmest on record, over a degree warmer than late 19th Century levels, so this claim that we heard from Nigel Lawson that there's been cooling is simply not true,"" he told the BBC. His view was echoed by Prof Richard Betts from the University of Exeter. ""The official figures do not show that the global mean temperature 'has slightly declined'. In fact, they show the opposite - global mean temperature has increased during the past 10 years,"" he said in a statement. ""The last three years were warmer than the previous seven, and indeed were the warmest on record, and this year is also shaping up to be nearly as warm (probably not quite as warm as last year since the influence of the El Nino has passed, but still a very warm year)."" Former US Vice President Al Gore is promoting his new climate change film in London On Thursday, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its2016 State of the Climate,externalreport, stating that the year was the warmest in 137 years of record keeping. All over the planet, the peer reviewed study found strong evidence of ongoing warming linked to human activities.  Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit new highs, as did global sea levels, while at both poles the extent of sea-ice hit new lows. Lord Lawson, who was energy secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government before becoming chancellor, now chairs the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think-tank that describes itself as ""open-minded on the contested science of global warming"". He was taking part in a segment followingan interview with former US Vice President Al Gore, who was promoting the sequel to his hit documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which made the case for tackling climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. On the programme, Mr Gore made the economic case for renewable energy and said that ""climate-related extreme weather events have grown far more numerous and far more destructive"" in the 10 years since the first film. It was suggested to the former Democratic presidential contender that he was going further than the scientific consensus but he said researchers around the world were ""virtually unanimous on this and have been for decades"", adding that ""record downpours"" in the UK were a result of climate change. Lord Lawson was asked why he thought Mr Gore was, in his words, ""talking complete nonsense"". The former cabinet minister said that ""all the experts say there hasn't been"" an increase in extreme weather events, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But speaking on Friday morning, Dr Stott said Lord Lawson was wrong about the IPCC as well. New research this week shows that river floods across Europe have been impacted by climate change over the past 50 years The panel had clearly indicated that there had been an increase in extreme events and that these increases were linked to human use of fossil fuels. ""If you take the global picture, the IPCC said very clearly that it is very likely that human influence has contributed to observed global-scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes,"" he told the Today programme. ""If you take the global picture and look at the global fingerprint - yes, you can attribute that."" Many scientists took to Twitter to express their dismay at the airing of what they say were false claims. Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox said it was ""irresponsible and highly misleading to give the impression that there is a meaningful debate about the science"". Fellow physicist and broadcaster Jim al-Khalili tweeted: ""For @BBCr4today to bring on Lord Lawson 'in the name of balance' on climate change is both ignorant and irresponsible. Shame on you."" He added: ""There should be NO debate anymore about climate change. We (the world minus Trump/Lawson et al) have moved on."" In a statement, the BBC said: ""The BBC's role is to hear different views so listeners are informed about all sides of debate and we are required to ensure controversial subjects are treated with due impartiality.""

Bin volunteers labelled 'scab army',"This video can not be played Volunteers clear rubbish from Birmingham's streets Volunteers have been labelled a ""scab army"" for helping clear waste during a long-running bin strike, which a union now warns could last until Christmas. The Bearded Broz, who have cleared 45 tonnes of waste in Birmingham during the six-week strike, were criticisedin the socialist Morning Star,external. The group said it respected workers, but wanted to clean the streets. The Unite union warned on Friday action could continue ""unless the city council negotiates a fair settlement"". Labour-run Birmingham City Council said it was ""very disappointed"" by the union's warning and said Unite was ""effectively holding the city to ransom"". The article published in the Morning Star said: ""The community group, known as Bearded Broz, are encouraging people to join their scab operation as they undermine the strike by Birmingham City Council refuse workers over job losses."" Why are the refuse workers striking? However, Naveed Sadiq from the group, which was set up and run by volunteers from the Muslim community, said members had met refuse workers, who said they ""respected"" the team for taking care of their areas. This video can not be played Cat flap locked to stop rodents as bin bags pile up Mr Sadiq said the respect was mutual: ""We can see the work that they do and respect them for the work that they do. ""We don't undermine them at all, we don't have a personal agenda or a personal grief with the binmen. Our issue is, these are our streets and we're gonna do something about it. ""If you want to call me a scab, that's fine."" Workers will be on strike until at least September unless an agreement can be reached The BBC has asked Unite to respond to the comments made about the Bearded Broz, but the union is yet to comment. The council had said earlier positive discussions were continuing with unions and it had visited more than three-quarters of the city's 8,200 streets as part of its ""operation to ensure all wards receive refuse collections during the industrial dispute"". More stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country However, on Friday Unite said it was balloting refuse collection members to renew its industrial action mandate, which could result in more strikes after the present round ends on 21 September. Unite assistant general secretary Howard Beckett said: ""We continue to hold talks with the council, but progress has been slow and we would call on the council to now step up and conclude this urgently."" Waste was spilling from bin bags on Avon Street, in Sparkhill, earlier this week The union will ballot members on 17 August. The ballot closes on 31 August. Councillor Lisa Trickett, cabinet member for clean streets, recycling and environment at the city council, said: ""We are very disappointed by this latest development. ""Unite are effectively holding the city to ransom with this announcement. ""They have talked about red lines they wish to negotiate with us, but this threat of extended industrial action will not help the process of achieving a swift resolution so we can get on with delivering a modern, effective and efficient refuse collection service for the people of Birmingham. ""We have put the offer of [conciliation service] Acas to Unite as an open, fair and transparent way of ending the dispute."" Meanwhile, action escalated on Friday, with the three-hour stoppages being split into three separate hour-long blocks, spaced out across the shift. It means workers will return to their depot - which they also do for breaks - three times a day. Previously they had taken a two-hour stoppage from 06:00-08:00 and a one-hour stoppage between 12:30-13:30. The BBC has contacted the Morning Star for comment.

'Yoda' fruit bat officially recognised,"The hamamas tube-nosed fruit bat has been named after the Papuan word for 'happy' A bat from the rainforests of Papua New Guinea affectionately known as 'Yoda' has been given official recognition as a new species. The mammal gained its nickname due to a likeness to the Star Wars character, but a University of York biologist has named it the hamamas tube-nosed fruit bat after the Papuan word for 'happy'. It has a rounder jaw than similar fruit bats, giving the impression of a grin. The recognition follows a study of 3,000 specimens by a team of experts. The type of fruit bat was originally nicknamed 'Yoda' due to a likeness to the Star Wars character The bat's scientific name, Nyctimene wrightae, honours the conservationist Dr Deb Wright who worked in conservation in Papua New Guinea. The University of York said the Nyctimene family of bat is characterised by its odd protruding tubular nostrils. The bat is part of the Nyctimene family, known for their distinctive nostrils Dr Nancy Irwin, who named the bat and led a research group that visited 18 museums around the world, said: ""Most of the morphological characteristics that separate this bat from other species are associated with a broader, rounder jaw which gives the appearance of a constant smile. ""Since most remote Papuans have never seen Star Wars, I thought it fitting to use a local name."" Tube-nosed bats have been depicted on stamps in Papua New Guinea Dr Irwin, a biologist at the university, said the 'happy' bat belonged to a group that had been known since 1769, but was not officially recognised. ""Now after 250 years this cryptic species, very difficult to tell apart from its cousins, can be identified and its ecology can be studied in the field,"" she added.

Where in UK are worst flight delays?,"Sorry your browser is not supported Air passengers leaving Gatwick have suffered the longest average delays during summer getaways from major UK airports, BBC analysis reveals. Those travelling to and from the UK on EasyJet flights have waited the longest among the 10 busiest airlines. Figures collected by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) during the last two summers reveal the typical delays. Flyers using EasyJet had an average delay of 24 minutes, and those leaving from Gatwick waited 27 minutes. Both said they appeared at the top of the delay list partly as a result of having among the most flights to and from Europe, and many delays were beyond their control. The analysis, by the BBC's data journalism team, is based on the last two years of CAA data for all flights from or to UK airports during June to August. Flight calculator: At the top of the page you can enter your UK departure city, and your destination, to find average delays for the airlines serving this route in the last two summers. EasyJet has the longest average delay at 24 minutes when taking all summer flights into consideration, whether delayed or not, for the busiest airlines in June to August for the last two years. Aer Lingus delays were half that length, at 12 minutes. This chart shows the average delay per journey for the 10 airlines with the greatest number of flights from or to the UK over the last two summers. Past performance will not necessarily be repeated during this and future summers. An EasyJet spokeswoman said: ""EasyJet operates the largest number of flights of any UK airline, flying over 78 million passengers per year. In 2017, EasyJet will operate 33% more flights than in 2011, with less than 0.8% delayed by more than three hours. ""In fact, despite a number of adverse external factors like increasingly congested airspace, particularly in the London area, and record numbers of air traffic control strikes, over the last year, EasyJet has actually reduced the proportion of flights delayed by more than three hours. ""We work hard to minimise disruption and fully comply with all relevant regulations."" While Gatwick had the longest average delay per outbound flight, the data reveals that travellers were less likely to experience departure delays at smaller UK airports. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map A spokesperson for Gatwick Airport said it had more flights to Europe than any other UK airport, and was impacted disproportionately by events on the continent. He said the airport was calling on UK and European authorities to accelerate plans to increase the efficiency of UK and European airspace. ""We recognise the inconvenience that delays cause to our passengers, and we will continue to do everything possible to prevent them from occurring,"" he said. BA flight delayed over loo roll Heathrow 'poor' for disabled travellers ""We operate the world's busiest and most efficient single runway airport, but, over recent years, Gatwick has been disproportionately affected by issues beyond our control. ""These include repeated strike action by French, Greek, Spanish and Italian air traffic controllers and airport employees, prolonged bad weather, and heavily congested airspace above parts of Europe and London. ""Gatwick has made it a priority to address punctuality and, in partnership with our airlines and ground handlers, we are already seeing the benefits of a new wide range of measures that have been implemented to improve punctuality."" Travellers flying from the EU or on European airlines do have a right to compensation. This means: If your flight departed the European Union or was with a European airline, you might have rights under EU law to claim if the delay or cancellation was within the airline's control If your flight's delayed for two or more hours the airline must offer food and drink, access to phone calls and emails, and accommodation if you're delayed overnight - including transfers between the airport and the hotel If you arrive more than three hours late in a journey of less than 1,500km (932 miles) you are entitled to 250 euros (Â£225) in compensation from the airline If you arrive more than three hours late in a journey spanning more than 1,500km, but within the EU, you can get 400 euros in compensation from the carrier Journeys to non-EU destinations more than 3,000km away that arrive between three and four hours late put you in line for 300 euros in airline payouts, while delays longer than four hours to these destinations are due 600 euros in compensation Alex Neill, from the consumer organisation, Which?, said airlines should offer compensation, rather than wait for customers to come to them: ""If you're unlucky enough to experience a severe delay, compensation could be available and people should claim what they're entitled to. ""We want to see airlines introduce automatic compensation where possible so that passengers can quickly and simply receive the money they are owed."" This video can not be played Flight delay compensation: When can you claim? All data used on this page is compiled andmade available by the Civil Aviation Authority,external, which publishes aggregated statistics on punctuality for all flights taking off or landing at major UK airports. The BBC has combined the CAA's data for June, July and August of 2015 and 2016 and used this to calculate the average (i.e. mean) delay per flight across these months for all routes listed in the data. Routes with fewer than 50 flights over this period were excluded, as were airlines that registered no flight data for the summer months of 2016 (even if they had been active in 2015). Chartered flights were not distinguished from scheduled flights in the calculations for airlines that fly both categories on the same route. The data for outbound delays is based on the time the aeroplane takes off from the UK runway, and the data for return delays is based on the time the aeroplane arrives back on the UK runway. Flights that take off or land early are recorded as having a delay of zero minutes.

Fire on Oxford Circus Tube train,"This video can not be played Transport for London said the fire was caused by an electrical fault Four people have been treated for smoke inhalation following a fire on a Tube train at Oxford Circus in central London. The station was evacuated shortly before 09:00 BST and trains did not stop at the station for nearly two hours. Pictures on social media showed smoke billowing out from a Bakerloo line train sitting on a platform. Transport for London (TFL) said the fire was caused by an electrical fault. The station reopened and services resumed at around 10:50. London Ambulance Service said it treated four people at Oxford Circus for smoke inhalation, two of whom were taken to hospital as a precaution. Oxford Circus Tube station was evacuated just before 09:00 BST BBC journalist Katie Silver was in the station at the time. She said: ""I was coming off the Victoria Line but there was smoke as you walked past the Bakerloo Line and there was the smell of smoke and burning plastic. ""We were all being evacuated. Some people were running up the escalator but they had shut certain exits, although it was very orderly. ""When we got out there were a couple of people crying. I think they were scared."" TFL said a ""comprehensive investigation"" would take place. Nigel Holness, London Underground's director of network operations, said: ""The cause of the smoke was an electrical fault under one of the carriages, which resulted in a small fire that was quickly extinguished. ""Understandably this was a distressing incident for our customers, for which I give my sincere apologies."" This video can not be played Oxford Circus station was evacuated. Police say it isn't suspicious. If you are ever in a Tube station and hear the announcement ""would Inspector Sands please go to the operations room immediately"", you may find that you are asked to leave the station a few minutes later. The message, which can be heard in the above video clip, is an automated message which is activated when the station fire alarm sounds. TFL says the message gives them an opportunity to investigate why the fire alarm is operating. It is a safety mechanism that has been agreed with the London Fire Brigade (LFB) and is the same system used in major national rail stations and airports in the UK. LFB is continuing to investigate the cause of the fire. It said it was called to attend at 08:47 and the station had been evacuated before fire crews arrived. The station was evacuated prior to fire crews attending Tom Singer, who was at Oxford Circus station at the time, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he saw a smoke-filled Bakerloo line Tube train coming into the platform. ""As we were waiting on the platform you could smell something coming in, as the train was coming in, and as it got closer the smell got stronger and stronger."" He added that as the train came in it was clear passengers had been moved from one of the carriages, and then when the train came to a stop people ""came pouring out"". He said: ""There were a lot of people with hands over mouths and coughing a lot coming off of the train. ""It looked like it was just one carriage that had the problem."" He said he also saw smoke coming from underneath the Tube train.

Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation,"Protesters outside the White House call for a de-escalation in tensions Donald Trump's warning that North Korea could face ""fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen"" has been widely interpreted as a threat backed by the destructive power of the US nuclear arsenal. In case that message wasn't clear, the following morning the president boasted that US nuclear weapons were ""far stronger and more powerful than ever before"". ""Hopefully we will never have to use this power,""he tweeted,external, ""but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!"" The president's recent nuclear sabre-rattling shouldn't be viewed as an isolated incident, however. Mr Trump has displayed a keen interest in the utility of atomic weapons for decades. It's part of a political worldview that has long since solidified into firm beliefs for the septuagenarian. His thoughts on trade have been influenced by the American industrial might of the post-World War Two era. His demographic views of the nation hark back to an ethnic homogeneity that has long since vanished. And his thoughts on atomic weaponry reflect a certain strain of Cold War arms-race enthusiasm and diplomatic brinkmanship. North Korea: Are Trump's assumptions about the nuclear threat right? The North Korea crisis in 300 words Trump and the nuclear codes Last December President-elect Trumpemphasised that the US had to ""greatly strengthen and expand""its nuclear weaponry and would ""outmatch"" any adversaries. In August MSNBC's Joe Scarboroughreported,externalthat candidate Trump had asked his foreign policy advisers several times why the US couldn't use its nuclear weapons - a claim the Trump campaign denied. The report, however, followed on the heels of an April 2016 town hall forumexchange,externalbetween Mr Trump and MSNBC's Chris Matthews, who asked him why he had refused to categorically rule out the use of nuclear weapons. ""Would there be a time when it could be used?"" Trump replied. ""Possibly. Possibly."" When pressed on the risks of openly talking of using nuclear weapons, Mr Trump said: ""Then why are we making them? Why do we make them?"" (The US no longer makes new nuclear warheads. It maintains its current arsenal.) He repeated that he is not going to take any of his ""cards off the table"". Digging back further, in 1990 Mr Trump gave an interview with Playboy Magazine in which the topic of atomic weaponry came up. ""I've always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it's a very important element in my thought process,"" Mr Trump said. He called it the ""ultimate catastrophe"" and compared it to an illness no one wants to talk about it. ""I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people's believing it will never happen,"" he continued, ""because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What [expletive]."" US troops regularly hold training drills with South Korea In 1984 - at the height of the Cold War - Mr Trumpeven told,externala Washington Post interviewer he wanted to be put in charge of US-Russia nuclear arms negotiations. ""It would take an hour-and-a-half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles,"" Mr Trump said. ""I think I know most of it anyway."" Around the time of this interview a computer game called Balance of Power, which simulated the Cold War struggle between the US and Soviet Union, became a surprise hit. Players could sabotage, scheme and sabre-rattle up to the brink of nuclear war. The trick was you were never quite sure how close you could get before the missiles started flying. Escalation could lead to inadvertent annihilation. And if it did, this was the message, displayed in white letters on a black screen: ""You have ignited an accidental nuclear war. And no, there is no animated display of a mushroom cloud with parts of bodies flying through the air. We do not reward failure."" This video can not be played It's not the first time North Korea has made threats against Guam If Mr Trump's past comments are any guide, he appears to be making the calculus that the US nuclear arsenal is ineffective if adversaries don't believe the nation is willing to pull the trigger. It's all part of the ""unpredictability"" strategy he repeatedly touted during his presidential campaign (and plugged again in a recent tweet). Mr Trump - and his Defence Secretary Jim Mattis - have spoken of how the US will prevail in any military confrontation with North Korea. Largely left unmentioned amid the bluster, however, is the danger that an extended standoff could spin out of control and the high cost in human lives - in civilian lives on both sides of the Korean demilitarised zone and for US military personnel - that any such conflict would entail. The US would almost certainly prevail, but it would be difficult to view such a result as anything but a failure. North Korea's missile programme What damage can North Korea do?

Life sentence for fire murder brother,"Blair Logan poured petrol onto his brother's bed before setting it alight A man who murdered his brother by setting fire to him has been ordered to spend at least 20 years in jail. Cameron Logan, 23, died in the blaze in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, and his girlfriend Rebecca Williams, 25, was seriously injured. Last month, Blair Logan, 27, admitted murdering his brother and attempting to murder Ms Williams at the family home. He said he doused his sibling in petrol and set him alight but did not mean to kill him. At the High Court in Edinburgh, he was given a life sentence with a minimum jail term of 20 years before he can be considered for parole. An earlier hearing was told that the brothers had a ""hostile"" relationship and had not spoken to each other since 2013. Brother admits New Year fire murder In a letter read to the court, his parents said they found it ""extremely difficult to reconcile the Blair that they know with the Blair that caused Cameron's death"". Both parents were in the court room in Edinburgh, along with Ms Williams and her family, as thesentence was passed by Lady Scott.,external She said Cameron was a ""happy and much loved young man"" who had died a ""horrible death"" and that Logan ""acted with wicked recklessness"". Cameron Logan died and Rebecca Williams was seriously injured in the fire on New Year's Day The judge accepted court reports that he had ""abnormal personality traits"" and features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But she said there was no suggestion that Logan had a mental disorder and he was fully criminally responsible for his actions. ""Your motivation was malice,"" she said. ""You had planned this attack for a considerable time."" Lady Scott said Logan's actions had also dramatically affected the life of Ms Williams, who sustained ""truly terrible injuries"", and his parents. ""At the time Miss Williams was employed in her dream job in radio broadcasting - you have robbed her of her voice and her career, of her future with Cameron and of her confidence and sense of self-worth. She remains disfigured, impaired and in pain,"" she added. ""Your act in setting this fire also endangered the lives of your own parents who were asleep upstairs. I cannot imagine the pain they will forever endure from what you did, losing in effect both their sons."" This video can not be played Lady Scott says she ""cannot imagine the pain"" Blair Logan's parents will endure In a statement read by her father outside court, Ms Williams said Cameron Logan was a ""caring, respectful and loving man"" but their future together had been ""stolen"". She added that no sentence would ever be enough for such a ""barbaric and ruthless"" murder. ""The horror of what happened in that room will haunt me forever,"" she said. ""Cameron died in the most cruel way, in front of my eyes. I can only imagine the pain and suffering he will have experienced in his final moments. ""I wish more than anything that I could have saved him."" An earlier hearing at the High Court in Glasgow heard that Blair Logan told police the brothers had not spoken since the death of their grandmother in 2013. The attack was said to be in retaliation for a recent incident at the house when his brother had punched him. On the night of the fire Cameron and Ms Williams slept on an inflatable mattress in the living room of the family home, after returning from a party at about 04:00. Catherine Logan, the brothers' mother, went downstairs at 07:15 and saw a dark figure in the living room. This video can not be played Rebecca Williams says the horror of what happened will stay with her She saw him throw something that was on fire and then run out of the house - but she did not know who he was. The court was told that when she turned back to the living room, she saw ""orange and crackling"" and the room turning black. Cameron and Ms Williams were screaming. Ms Williams managed to crawl into the kitchen but was unable to open the back door. She put her head in the fridge to protect herself from the fire before passing out. The parents of Blair and Cameron Logan were also in court in the capital Mr Logan senior tried to get into the living room but was beaten back by the intensity of the smoke and flames. Ms Williams was rescued from the fire and treated in hospital for burns to her face, arms and hands and fire damage to her throat. She has undergone ""numerous"" operations and has a tracheostomy in place which may be permanent. Logan's parents were treated for smoke inhalation but were not badly injured - he admitted endangering their lives. The family dog, Gomez, was also killed in the fire. In mitigation, defence QC Shelagh McCall said Logan had shown genuine remorse and viewed the murder of his brother as ""horrific"" and said it could not be justified. She told the court that the Logan had attempted suicide in prison and is under high observation.

Tata Steel signs new pensions deal,"Steel company Tata has formally announced it is to separate its UK pension scheme from the business. It could mean a potential merger between the Indian-owned firm and the German steel producer ThyssenKrupp is more likely to move forward. The Â£15bn British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) has been a significant barrier to any agreement. The deal affects thousands of current and former workers, with 130,000 steel pension scheme members across the UK. The agreement with trustees follows a deal between unions and the company which will see reduced benefits for current employees. But the decision will also affect all members of the pension scheme, including the many thousands already retired. About 8,000 people are employed by Tata Steel across England and Wales, including 3,500 in Port Talbot. Tata Steel UK has offered to pay Â£550m into its now-closed pension scheme and give the fund a 33% stake in its UK business. It means Tata would no longer have any responsibility for the pension scheme. Future pension increases for current and retired steelworkers will be less under the new scheme - but there will be no reduction in the lump sums they have already built up. All members of the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) will now be invited to transfer to the new scheme. They will also have the option of transferring into the pension protection fund (PPF) - the pension lifeboat - although they could lose more money. Thousands of workersvoted to back the deal in February. Koushik Chatterjee, Tata Steel's group executive director, said it had been a long and detailed process but this was an ""important milestone in Tata Steel UK's journey towards a sustainable and enduring future"". Tata fined Â£1m after Scunthorpe workers exposed to toxic gas Why steel is still so important to Port Talbot How a town's fortunes have mirrored its steelworks He added: ""Considering the continued challenges in the global steel industry as well as the uncertain global politico-economic environment, the regulated apportionment arrangement (RAA) presents the best possible structural outcome for the members of the BSPS and for the Tata Steel UK business."" Trade unions Community, GMB and Unite said: ""For over a year our members have feared for their security in retirement and this announcement helps to bring that uncertainty to an end."" But they added that members had been ""extremely disappointed at the unacceptable lack of communication"" in recent months. ""This has to change immediately,"" said the unions in a statement. ""The company and the trustees must remember they are dealing with people's long term future, their life savings and their family's financial security; it is vital members are given all the support that they need."" This video can not be played Gary Keogh, multi-unions vice chairman at Port Talbot, said there were 'no happy endings' Analysis from Simon Gompertz, BBC News personal finance correspondent There is bitterness, likely to be followed by bewilderment. Current and former steelworkers have watched their pensions being tampered with. Next they will be faced with what could be a mind-boggling choice about what to do. The British Steel Pension Scheme trustees say the new scheme with trimmed benefits will be better for the vast majority than falling back on the Pension Protection Fund. But there are a lot of variables to consider: the age at which they want to retire, the tax-free lump sum they can get, or whether they should accept the tempting sums being offered to exit the scheme entirely. It is very important, the trustees admit, that members make an informed choice after taking advice ""including from an independent financial advisor"". But who will pay for that? The trustees won't, and the Pensions Regulator won't make them. There will be leaflets and written information, but many workers will feel they are being left on their own to make one of the most important financial decisions of their lives. This video can not be played Nicola Parish, executive director for front-line regulation at the Pensions Regulator, explains workers' options Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of The Pensions Regulator, said: ""We do not agree to these types of arrangements lightly but after several months of robust negotiations in this case, we believe that it is the best possible outcome for everyone involved in what is a very difficult situation."" BSPS trustees chairman Allan Johnston said: ""It is the best outcome that could be achieved in the circumstances."" Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said it was important to remember that the agreement to the pension changes was contingent upon substantial investment from Tata. ""It is vital that Tata follow through on their Â£1bn investment plan to ensure Port Talbot and downstream sites remain at the leading edge of 21st Century steel-making,"" he said. The UK Government said it would ""continue to work closely with the sector to help secure a viable long-term future for the UK steel industry."" Analysis by Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent Tata had been warning for years that its business in the UK was under threat. It blamed falling steel prices as well as high energy costs and business rates in the UK compared to many other EU countries. Pensions was not one of the main reasons it gave for its concerns but it clearly was an issue. The company attempted to radically reduce the benefits its scheme provided but that was seen off with the threat of strike action by unions. Less dramatic changes to pensions were agreed instead. When Tata announced it was selling its UK operations, it started to see action in areas it had long been complaining about. The UK government introduced financial help for heavy energy using industries like steel. EU tariffs were placed on cheap steel imports from China and Russia. Then as you can see from the chart above, prices started to rise; the Port Talbot plant became more efficient and the drop in the value of the pound made selling overseas easier. The dispute over pensions took many twists along the way, including an aborted attempt to change the law for the Tata scheme that many felt would set a dangerous precedent. What has now been agreed instead is highly unusual. Tata will still have some responsibilities over the huge Â£15bn pension fund but it will now be expected to stand on its own two feet with an injection of Â£550m to help plug its black hole and a third stake in the company's UK operations for the new scheme. It paves the way for a merger deal between Tata Steel and its German rival, Thyssenkrupp. Whether that deal is actually good for the future of Port Talbot is still a hotly-contested point. The pension changes along with the tackling of issues like energy costs and cheap imports put Tata's UK operations - which are now largely based in Wales - on a more solid foundation. However, the world is still making far more steel every year than it needs. China still has newer steelworks as well as lower labour and energy costs, so will remain fiercely competitive. Tata's promised future investment in Port Talbot is tied to its performance. The immediate danger may have receded but there are still many challenges ahead.

Ex-Davis aide: Brexit is 'a calamity',"This video can not be played Brexit will ""make Black Wednesday look like a picnic"", says David Davis' former aide James Chapman (left) The former chief of staff to Brexit Secretary David Davis has said leaving the EU will be a ""calamity for our country"". James Chapman claimed two cabinet ministers had expressed interest in a new centre party to oppose Brexit. He also claimed that the Conservatives will struggle to win a majority again. Pro-Brexit Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said the party was ""broadly united"" and most voters accepted the result of last year's referendum. Mr Chapman is the Daily Mail's former political editor and was a senior adviser to former Chancellor George Osborne before becoming Brexit Secretary David Davis's chief of staff. He quit the government before June's general election and now works in public relations. At-a-glance guide to Brexit negotiations Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? What chance for a new 'centre ground' party? In recent weeks he has launched a series of social media attacks on his former Brexit-supporting colleagues, including one message which appeared to be aimed at Boris Johnson: ""Let's be honest, if we had an effective electoral law leading Brexiteers would now be in jail. #wheresmy350maweekboris.""

In June, he accused Prime Minister Theresa May of taking an ""absolutist"" position on some aspects of Brexit policy and of having ""hamstrung"" his former boss Mr Davis. He has called for a new party - called the Democrats - to oppose Brexit. Speaking to the Today programme, he claimed that the ""two main parties have been captured by their fringes"". He claimed that two cabinet ministers and ""a number of people who have been in Conservative cabinets before now - better cabinets, I might say, than the current one - and a number of shadow cabinet ministers have also been in touch. ""They're not saying that they're going to quit their parties but they understand that there's an enormous gap in the centre of British politics."" He added: ""My view is that the Conservative Party brand has now been damaged to such an extent that the party won't... ever again get a majority. ""Don't forget that 60% of the Tory parliamentary party were for remain and now they're paralysed. They won't say what they think."" Mr Rees-Mogg, who campaigned for a vote to leave the EU ahead of last year's referendum, said First Secretary of State Damian Green campaigned to remain in the EU but now ""is playing a crucial role in ensuring government policy is delivered"". He added: ""I think most people in the higher levels of the party and across the Conservative Party and the nation have accepted the democratic result of the referendum."" Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said most voters accepted the referendum result On the subject of a new anti-Brexit centre party, he suggested: ""Their proposed name ought to be the oligarchs, rather than the Democrats."" The Conservative backbencher argued that the Liberal Democrats campaigned at this year's election on a policy of giving voters a second referendum on a final Brexit deal ""and the electorate blew a raspberry at them"". New Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable hassaid he wants to occupythe ""vast middle ground in British politics that's largely been abandoned"" and has proposed giving voters the option of ""an exit from Brexit"". Reacting to the claim that two cabinet ministers have expressed an interest in a new anti-Brexit party, Sir Vince said: ""The Liberal Democrats will provide a home for all those who are unhappy with Brexit and the paths the other parties are taking. ""But equally we are prepared to work with people of all parties and none to get the best possible future for this country."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Egg scandal hits more than 15 countries,"This video can not be played How safe are Dutch eggs to eat? Fifteen EU countries as well as Hong Kong and Switzerland have received eggs contaminated with the insecticide fipronil, the European Commission says. The commission will hold a meeting with ministers and regulators on 26 September. Its food safety chief has called countries to stop ""blaming and shaming"" each other. A row has erupted over how long Belgian and Dutch authorities have known about the contamination. Eggs, coming mainly from the Netherlands, have been found to contain fipronil, a substance used to kill lice and ticks on animals that is banned by the EU for use in the food industry. It is thought it was used to combat lice in some chicken farms, affecting the eggs of laying hens. What do we know about the Europe egg scare? The insecticide can damage people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands if eaten in large quantities. However, food standards agencies are playing down the risks for anyone who has already eaten the tainted eggs. Farms were shut down in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and France after authorities confirmed that fipronil had been used, European Commission spokesman Daniel Rosario said on Friday. The EU countries that have received the eggs are the UK, Sweden, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia and Denmark. Non-EU Switzerland is also affected. Friday's revelation that tainted eggs had also been sent to Hong Kong marks the first time the widening scandal has spread outside Europe. The UK food watchdog also said about700,000 eggs had been sent to the UKfrom potentially contaminated Dutch farms, up from an earlier estimate of 21,000. The Food Standards Agency (FSA)said,externalit was very unlikely that there was a risk to public health. Processed foods containing eggs, including sandwiches and salads, have been recalled by leading supermarkets, including Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda. Supermarkets in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany have also withdrawn millions of eggs from sale. Eggs are being destroyed at chicken farms in countries including Belgium and the Netherlands On Friday, France's Agriculture Minister StÃ©phane Travert said about 250,000 affected eggs had been sold in the country since April, adding that all products containing eggs from contaminated farms would be taken off the shelves. In Hong Kong, the government's Centre for Food Safety says it identifiedtwo samples,externalof imported Dutch eggs containing excessive levels of fipronil last week and asked shops to remove the products. It has since tested other European egg imports and has not found any more ""unsatisfactory samples"", the South China Morning Post newspaper quoted a spokeswoman as saying. ""Blaming and shaming will bring us nowhere and I want to stop this,"" European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Vytenis Andriukaitis said on Friday. ""But first things first. Our common job and our priority now is to manage the situation, gather information, focus on the analysis and lessons to be learned in a view to improve our system and prevent criminal activity."" In the UK, the Dutch eggs were used in processed foods such as sandwich fillings A commission spokesperson later added that the event scheduled for 26 September was not a crisis meeting. It is unclear whether the meeting will involve all 28 EU member states, or only affected countries. On Thursday, Dutch police arrested two people in joint raids carried out with Belgian authorities. A criminal investigation is under way, centring on two firms. Poultry Vision, a pest control firm from Belgium, is alleged to have sold the treatment to a Dutch poultry farm cleaning company, Chickfriend. More than 100 poultry farms have been closed during the investigation, and 26 suspects identified and evidence seized from their companies. The Netherlands is Europe's biggest egg producer - and one of the largest exporters of eggs and egg products in the world. The problem first surfaced earlier in August, when supermarket chain Aldi withdrew all its eggs from sale in Germany. It has since emerged that Belgian officials knew about the contamination in June, but did not make the information public. Meanwhile, Belgian Agriculture Minister Denis Ducarme has accused the Dutch authorities of knowing about the problem as far back as November 2016. The food watchdog in the Netherlands has denied this. By James Gallagher, health and science reporter, BBC News Fipronil should not be allowed anywhere near food. But the risk from eggs is thought to be low, because the number of contaminated eggs is also low. While 700,000 eggs sounds like a lot, it is worth remembering we eat 34 million every single day in the UK. It is why the Food Standards Agency says it is ""very unlikely"" there is any health risk. Many of the affected eggs will have already passed through the food chain before anyone was aware of the scandal. And the FSA has now pulled egg sandwiches and egg salads off the shelves that were made while contaminated eggs were still being imported. It insisted there was ""no need"" for people to stop eating eggs.

Poorer men 'more likely to be single',"The earnings gap between men from poor families and rich ones is widening, the IFS said Men from poor backgrounds are twice as likely to be single in their early 40s than those from rich families, research suggests. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) also found this group were likely to earn less and marry women with lower incomes. It said the trends made poverty more likely to continue from one generation to the next and reduce social mobility. The government said it wanted to ""build an economy that works for everyone"". Since coming to power, Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to do more for families who are ""just about managing"". Among other things, she has said it is vital to tackle the shorter life expectancy for those born poor, and the lower chances of white working class boys going to university. The Prime Minister has promised to do more for those ""just about managing"" However, with price increases outstripping wages as inflation rose in the wake of the Brexit vote, many workers are getting poorer on average in real terms. Moreover, average real wages in the UKare still lowerthan they were before the financial crisis 10 years ago. The IFS based its findings on the most recent long-term study available, which surveyed people born in 1970 and followed them as they got older. It found that more than a third of men aged 42 from the poorest fifth of families did not live with a partner in 2012. That compared with only a seventh from high-income backgrounds. It said men from disadvantaged backgrounds experienced lower rates of marriage and higher rates of divorce. Men from disadvantaged backgrounds experience ""lower rates of marriage and higher rates of divorce"" It also looked at men in couples. It found that the partners of those from richer backgrounds earned more than 70% more than the partners of men from poorer families. Chris Belfield, a research economist at the IFS, said: ""As well as having higher earnings, those from richer families are more likely to be in work, more likely to have a partner and more likely to have a higher-earning partner than those from less well-off backgrounds. ""And all these inequalities have been widening over time."" The IFS said it was ""well known"" that the sons of richer parents tended to go on to earn more. However, it said the earnings gap with those from less well-off backgrounds was widening. In 2012, employed 42-year-old men whose parents were among the richest fifth of households earned on average 88% more than those from the poorest families, it said.  Back in 2000 the figure was only 47%. IFS director Paul Johnson, told the BBC that social mobility also appeared to have dropped over time. He said the relationship between the incomes of people born in the early 1970s and that of their parents was stronger than for people born in the late 1950s. That, combined with the fact that ""you're more likely to marry someone who's more like you...  means social mobility is even lower and it's another thing that's reducing social mobility over time because this relationship between your parents' incomes and your partner's earnings has grown over time"". However, a Treasury spokesman said that overall, income inequality had fallen and that more people were in work than ever before.

UK 'faces Islamist threat for decades',"This video can not be played Ex-MI5 boss Jonathan Evans warns of the ongoing threat to the UK from Islamic terrorism The UK may continue to face the threat of Islamist terrorism for another ""20 to 30 years"", the former head of MI5 has said. Lord Evans told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the issue was a ""generational problem"" and that the UK needed to ""persevere"" with efforts to defeat it. He also said devices connected to the internet needed to be made more secure in the face of emerging cyber threats. And he warned that Russia was likely to try to interfere in the UK's democracy. Lord Evansstepped downas the director general of the security service MI5 in 2013 at a time when it seemed that the terrorism threat from al-Qaeda might be subsiding. But now, with the rise of the so-called Islamic State militant group, he said the threat was unlikely to end soon. Reality Check: How terrorism threat levels work UK threat level reduced from critical Lord Evans said: ""There's no doubt that we are still facing a severe terrorist threat but I think its also important to put this in a slightly longer context because right the way back from the 1990s we have been experiencing difficulties from Islamist terrorists of one sort or another. ""Over that period the threat has come and gone but the underlying threat has continued. ""Since 2013 there have been 19 attempted attacks that have been disrupted and even since the attack at Westminster we are told there have been six disruptions, so this is a permanent state of preparedness."" He added: ""We're at least 20 years into this. My guess is that we will still be dealing with the long tail in over 20 years' time. ""I think this is genuinely a generational problem. I think we are going to be facing 20 to 30 years of terrorist threat and therefore we need, absolutely critically, to persevere."" The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner, who conducted the interview, said Lord Evans was also asked about being responsible for sending people inside terrorist cells to gather intelligence. The former MI5 head said it often was ""just sleepless nights"" and ""nail-biting"" but measures to protect staff were taken. By BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford The head of national counter-terrorism policing, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, has said a ""whole-system effect"" was now needed in which the public, other public services and agencies, and businesses all need to work together to keep the UK safe. It is an acknowledgement that after the bloody months of March, May and June the system for tackling terrorism will have to change. There are already internal reviews of how the police and security services dealt with their previous knowledge of some of the perpetrators of this year's attacks. But this is more than that. It is a plea for help, on the day that Lord Evans, who stepped down as director general of MI5 in 2013, warned that the threat from terrorism will be with us for 20 or 30 more years. Lord Evans also warned that the ""internet of things"" - in which vehicles and domestic devices are all connected to the internet - will need to be made more secure to reduce emerging cyber threats. He said it was concerning that Russia had apparently been interfering in the democratic processes of some Western countries. Lord Evans said it was something the UK needed to be alert to, as he would be ""very surprised"" if it was not a target as well. Speaking on Radio 4's Today, the head of national counter-terrorism policing called the current Islamist threat a ""cultish movement"" compared to al-Qaeda and the IRA who were ""a very tight network of wicked individuals"". Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: ""You've got that range of people who have picked up that ideology and come up with their own plan based on the encouragement of the propaganda all the way through to the more organised directed attacks. ""This widening cohort of people that we're concerned about and our ability to keep our radar on them is no longer just a job for police and security services."" He added the change in tempo of the threat was ""quite dramatic"" consideringin four years 13 terror plots were foiledcompared to six in the last few months. How do terrorism threat levels work?

Oxford Circus Tube station fire,"This video can not be played Transport for London said the fire was caused by an electrical fault Four people have been treated for smoke inhalation following a fire on a Tube train at Oxford Circus in central London. The station was evacuated shortly before 09:00 BST and trains did not stop at the station for nearly two hours. Pictures on social media showed smoke billowing out from a Bakerloo line train sitting on a platform. Transport for London (TFL) said the fire was caused by an electrical fault. The station reopened and services resumed at around 10:50. London Ambulance Service said it treated four people at Oxford Circus for smoke inhalation, two of whom were taken to hospital as a precaution. Oxford Circus Tube station was evacuated just before 09:00 BST BBC journalist Katie Silver was in the station at the time. She said: ""I was coming off the Victoria Line but there was smoke as you walked past the Bakerloo Line and there was the smell of smoke and burning plastic. ""We were all being evacuated. Some people were running up the escalator but they had shut certain exits, although it was very orderly. ""When we got out there were a couple of people crying. I think they were scared."" TFL said a ""comprehensive investigation"" would take place. Nigel Holness, London Underground's director of network operations, said: ""The cause of the smoke was an electrical fault under one of the carriages, which resulted in a small fire that was quickly extinguished. ""Understandably this was a distressing incident for our customers, for which I give my sincere apologies."" This video can not be played Oxford Circus station was evacuated. Police say it isn't suspicious. If you are ever in a Tube station and hear the announcement ""would Inspector Sands please go to the operations room immediately"", you may find that you are asked to leave the station a few minutes later. The message, which can be heard in the above video clip, is an automated message which is activated when the station fire alarm sounds. TFL says the message gives them an opportunity to investigate why the fire alarm is operating. It is a safety mechanism that has been agreed with the London Fire Brigade (LFB) and is the same system used in major national rail stations and airports in the UK. LFB is continuing to investigate the cause of the fire. It said it was called to attend at 08:47 and the station had been evacuated before fire crews arrived. The station was evacuated prior to fire crews attending Tom Singer, who was at Oxford Circus station at the time, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he saw a smoke-filled Bakerloo line Tube train coming into the platform. ""As we were waiting on the platform you could smell something coming in, as the train was coming in, and as it got closer the smell got stronger and stronger."" He added that as the train came in it was clear passengers had been moved from one of the carriages, and then when the train came to a stop people ""came pouring out"". He said: ""There were a lot of people with hands over mouths and coughing a lot coming off of the train. ""It looked like it was just one carriage that had the problem.""

CCTV to be in all English abattoirs,"Slaughterhouses in England will have to install CCTV as part of government plans to monitor animal welfare. Under rules being phased in over the next year, Food Standards Agency vets will be able to ask to see footage of all areas where livestock are held. Slaughterhouses found to be failing welfare standards could face a criminal investigation or lose staff licences. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the proposals would make the UK a ""global leader on animal welfare"". Currently, keepers of animals bred for meat must meetanimal welfare laws and codes of practice,external, which cover the treatment of livestock including how they are fed, housed and transported, as well as how they are killed. Abattoirs in England must meet welfare regulations, with separate rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and additional EU regulations. Plans to make CCTV mandatory in all slaughterhouses are being considered by the Welsh government. The government has said it plans to increase standards for farm animals and domestic pets in England by updating these statutory animal welfare codes. Breaches would result in a welfare enforcement notice, the suspending or revoking of staff licences or referral for a criminal investigation. Mr Gove said animal welfare was important to producing food to the ""very highest standards"" The first codes to be revised will cover chickens bred for meat, followed by laying hens, pigs, dogs, cats and horses over the course of the next year. New codes were needed to reflect modernising medicines, technology, as well as the latest research and advice from vets, the government said. Mr Gove said: ""We have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world and the actions I am setting out today will reinforce our status as a global leader. ""As we prepare to leave the EU, these measures provide a further demonstration to consumers around the world that our food is produced to the very highest standards."" FSA chairwoman Heather Hancock said the watchdog supported compulsory CCTV in abattoirs, since voluntary adoption by slaughterhouses had reached a ""plateau"". She said: ""We look forward to the introduction of a comprehensive requirement for using, accessing and retaining footage from CCTV in abattoirs. ""We see CCTV as an invaluable management tool for business owners to help with compliance with official controls and to improve animal welfare standards across the industry."" British Veterinary Association (BVA) president Gudrun Ravetz said the mandatory CCTV in all areas of slaughterhouses was  ""essential"" to safeguarding animal welfare. ""We are particularly pleased to see a commitment to official veterinarians having unrestricted access to footage, which the BVA has been calling for,"" he said. ""Vets' independence and unique qualifications help ensure that the UK will continue to have the highest standards of animal health, welfare and food safety.""

BBC defends Lawson climate change interview,"Lord Lawson heads a think tank which says there is a ""contested science of global warming"" BBC Radio 4's Today programme has defended its decision to interview Lord Lawson in a segment on climate change. The former Conservative chancellor said average global temperatures had declined over the past decade. The Green Party said Lord Lawson had made ""false claims"" and prominent scientists including Professor Brian Cox criticised the interview. But the BBC insisted it had a duty to inform listeners about all sides of a debate. Lord Lawson, who was energy secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government before becoming chancellor, is a critic of government policies on renewable energy. He now chairs the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think tank which describes itself as ""open-minded on the contested science of global warming"". He told Today that energy costs in the UK were high ""because of our absurd, climate-driven energy policy"". ""We tax fossil fuel energy, we subsidise renewable energy,"" he said, adding: ""Conventional energy is more reliable and cheaper."" Lord Lawson also said that ""official figures"" showed that ""during this past 10 years, if anything... average world temperature has slightly declined"". However, this is contradicted by all the major global temperature datasets. The leading agencies, such as the UK Met Office and Nasa, all recognise a clear warming trend over this period, with 2016, 2015 and 2014 being the hottest years ever measured. Lord Lawson's comments followed an interview with former US Vice-President Al Gore, who was promoting the sequel to his hit documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which made the case for climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Al Gore said major scientific bodies were ""virtually unanimous"" on climate change On the programme, Mr Gore made the economic case for renewable energy and said that ""climate-related extreme weather events have grown far more numerous and far more destructive"" in the 10 years since the first film. It was suggested to the former Democratic presidential contender that he was going further than the scientific consensus but he said scientists around the world were ""virtually unanimous on this and have been for decades"", adding that ""record downpours"" in the UK were a result of climate change. Lord Lawson was asked why he thought Mr Gore was, in his words, ""talking complete nonsense"". The former cabinet minister said that ""all the experts say there hasn't been"" an increase in extreme weather events, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). An IPCC working group,externalhas said: """"Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950. Some of these changes have been linked to human influences, including a decrease in cold temperature extremes, an increase in warm temperature extremes, an increase in extreme high sea levels and an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events in a number of regions."" Of Mr Gore, Lord Lawson said: ""He's like the man who goes around saying 'the end of the world is nigh' on a big placard. ""To begin with you might be a little bit scared but after 10 years of him doing that and the end of the world isn't nigh then you think, well, maybe we should forget that and concentrate on real problems."" In a letter to Today programme editor Sarah Sands, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley wrote: ""I was disappointed to hear the BBC give airtime to Lord Lawson during an important debate on climate change and the UK energy system. ""He made a number of points which were demonstrably untrue."" He said the former chancellor had also ""claimed that the UK does not subsidise fossil fuels, and implied that green energy companies receive more subsidies than fossil fuels"". Mr Bartley claimed fossil fuel companies ""have received Â£6.9bn for work overseas since 2000, while green energy companies have only received Â£39m since 2012 (when such subsidies began)"". He also accused the programme of failing to challenge Lord Lawson's claims. ""It is false balance, and risks grossly misleading the public,"" he added. Green groups also rejected Lord Lawson's claim on high energy prices, pointing toofficial government figures,externalthat show UK residential users actually pay less for their electricity and gas on average than consumers in other EU countries. Professor Brian Cox said the science of climate change was not a matter of debate Physicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox was among those whoresponded angrily to the interview on Twitter,,externalsaying it was ""irresponsible and highly misleading to give the impression that there is a meaningful debate about the science"". Fellow physicist and broadcaster Jim al-Khalili tweeted: ""For @BBCr4today to bring on Lord Lawson 'in the name of balance' on climate change is both ignorant and irresponsible. Shame on you."" He added: ""There should be NO debate any more about climate change. We (the world minus Trump/Lawson et al) have moved on."" In a statement, the BBC said: ""The BBC's role is to hear different views so listeners are informed about all sides of debate and we are required to ensure controversial subjects are treated with due impartiality. ""This split segment started with an interview with Al Gore, at 0710 and at twice the length of Lord Lawson's interview, and concluded with Fisher Stevens responding after Lawson, who as chairman of the Global Warming Policy Foundation had set out their position on the economics of subsidising green energy. ""It was introduced by our environment analyst who will be examining some of the claims further on tomorrow's programme."" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Mr Stevens directed the film Before the Flood, a collaboration with Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio. The film-maker defended the campaigning of high-profile figures such as Mr DiCaprio and Mr Gore, arguing that ""it's very tough to get people to care"" about global warming.

Eggs scare sparks safety scramble,"The Guardian leads with the plight of hundreds of people who have been told they will have to temporarily leave an estate in south-east London because of safety fears. Southwark Council has issued the warning to residents living in four 13-storey blocks on the Ledbury estate in Peckham. Checks carried out after the Grenfell Tower fire show the buildings are at risk of collapse if there is a gas explosion in one of the flats. The Ledbury estate is in the London borough of Southwark The paper says the gas supply has been cut off,external, leaving residents - including some people in their 80s - without cooking facilities, hot water and heating. The council says it is doing all it can to provide residents with alternatives while the gas is off. RAF spy planes could be sent on a mission to North Korea to hunt for nuclear weapon sites,according to the lead in the Daily Mirror,external. It says if the Commons backs a US request then at least one British aircraft could fly to a base in Japan within a fortnight. The paper quotes an unidentified source as saying that although conflict between North Korea and the US is unthinkable, everything is being done to prepare for this - including stepping-up intelligence gathering. The Ministry of Defence has declined to comment. The Daily Telegraph leads with a call from campaigners,externalfor grooming gangs from the Asian Muslim community to be treated as racially-aggravated criminals. An imam in Leeds also tackles the issue in an article for the paper. Qari Asim says the Newcastle grooming case appalled everyone but people cannot hide from the fact the perpetrators of these crimes were mostly Muslim. He says if cultural prejudices have led the abusers to prey on white girls then this needs to be addressed. He also warns that some community elders prefer to blame women - or even evil spirits - rather than accept young men can be responsible for these terrible crimes. The Times says that British people will lose some of their rights to sue the government,externalfor breaking the law, under the Brexit bill going through Parliament. It says that areas such as the environment, workers' rights and business regulation will no longer be subject to financial redress through the courts. Since 1991, a European Court ruling has allowed citizens to sue member states for damages if their rights are infringed by the failure of a country to implement EU law. Some campaigners - especially those trying to force ministers to tackle air pollution - have expressed concerns to the Times about such a change. But the government insists that after Brexit, people will still be able to claim for compensation for losses if laws are breached. The Sun's front page has the story of Rocky,external, the African grey parrot, who helped police jail a burglar who was raiding his owner's home.

Three million switch electricity supplier,"The number of customers switching electricity suppliers has risen 14% this year. Over three million customers had already switched their electricity supplier by the end of July, according to the latest figures. Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, said one in five had signed up to small or medium sized suppliers. In July alone 385,000 customers switched, a 16% increase on July 2016. Lawrence Slade, chief executive of Energy UK, said: ""There are now over 50 suppliers to choose from, which is driving innovation, improvements to customer service and providing an incentive to keep prices competitive as suppliers fight to keep and attract customers."" Although the largest number of switches were done by customers moving from one large supplier to another, some 34% transferred from a large supplier to a small or mid-tier one. The steady increase in the number of consumers looking for better deals comes as electricity and gas price rises outstrip inflation. British Gas owner Centrica said in August it would hike electricity prices on its standard tariff by 12.5% from September, although it is maintaining a freeze on its gas prices. The five other big suppliers - E.ON, ScottishPower, npower, EDF Energy, and SSE - have come out with similar increases. The price comparison website uSwitch estimates that the average annual cost of dual-fuel standard tariffs from the ""Big Six"" will rise between 7% and 10%. However, those taking advantage of switching are still in a minority. uSwitch believes that seven out of ten households are overpaying for gas and electricity on expensive standard tariffs. The reasons for the inertia were revealed in areport last year by the Competition and Markets Authority,external(CMA). It said: ""Those who have low incomes, have low qualifications, are living in rented accommodation or who are above 65 are less likely to be engaged in the domestic retail energy markets.""

Grenfell money 'not reaching survivors',"Donations made since the Grenfell Tower fire in west London two months ago are not reaching survivors quickly enough, campaigners have said. Charity Commission figures show that less than 15% of the Â£18.9m raised has been given to people who lost their homes and loved ones. The commission said there were initial difficulties contacting those affected, and others had yet to come forward. The commission regulates charities and charitable funds in England and Wales. Millions of pounds worth of donations were pledged by concerned members of the public in the days following the Grenfell fire in the early hours of 14 June, which claimed at least 80 lives. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Visual guide to the fire Everything you need to know The funds were intended to help people who had lost family members in the blaze as well as Grenfell residents who survived but had lost their home and possessions. With so much money given, and several charitable groups working to provide immediate support for those caught up in the aftermath, the commission stepped in to advise how best to distribute funds to those affected. The latest Charity Commission figures, eight weeks on from the fire, show only Â£2.8m has been handed out. The body said charities now want to work with survivors to discuss how the remaining funds should be spent long-term. But in the Grenfell community there is growing anger and frustration, as many believe some charities are not being completely transparent. Yvette Williams, of the Justice 4 Grenfell group, said: ""It's definitely not been fast enough. ""The survivors are raising it more and more: where's the money, who's distributing it, why aren't they distributing it, how have they been chosen to distribute it, what's the criteria for distribution, and how are you communicating with the people who should be receiving that money? ""Information isn't transparent. They have to beg for information and it's still not clear the background of it, or how they're going forward with it."" The Red Cross and the Kensington and Chelsea Foundation each raised Â£5.75m, and the Evening Standard newspaper fund collected more than Â£6.7m. The London Emergencies Trust, which was overseeing the channelling of those funds,announced in July that it was processing three types of interim payment.,externalThey were: Â£20,000 to the next of kin of those who died in the fire Â£10,000 to those hospitalised for a week or more Â£3,500 to those hospitalised for more than six hours A ""fresh start"" grant of Â£10,000 per family when they are permanently rehoused is also being distributed by the Rugby Portobello Trust. Charity Commission chief operating officer David Holdsworth said: ""We have been working to help charities co-ordinate their response so that those affected know where to go to get access to the funds that have been raised for them. ""As the regulator, we also ensure that funds are protected for those they are intended for.""

The Italian highlanders who may have Scottish roots,"Thousands of Italians emigrated to Scotland in the 20th Century, but it seems that 400 years earlier a group of Scots may have settled in a village in the Italian Alps. So local legend has itâ¦ And there are plenty of signs to suggest that maybe, just maybe, it's true. High up in the mountains of northern Italy, just a few kilometres from the Swiss border, the people of the tiny village of Gurro speak a strange dialect, incomprehensible even to the other villages in the same valley. They have peculiar surnames, and the women's traditional costume features a patterned underskirt that looks suspiciously like tartan. One possible explanation is that their forefathers include a unit of Scottish soldiers - theGarde Ecossaise- who served the French King, Francis I, and were defeated with him at the Battle of Pavia, near Milan, in February 1525. The story goes that while trying to make their way home the Scots stopped in Gurro, where they got snowed in for the winter. Many locals believe they never left. ""I've heard talk about this story since I was a child,"" says Alma Dresti, who was born and bred in Gurro. ""I know it's probably at least part legend but I like to believe in it and I do think there could be some truth in it. ""I like to imagine those strapping young soldiers trying to return home, stopping here, and liking it so much they stayed even once spring had come."" One tale describes how the Scottish visitors stole girls from the next village, celebrating their trophy brides with big parties - before waking the village priest at dawn to legalise their unions. Alma says this could explain a custom peculiar to Gurro, in which receptions were traditionally held before the marriage ceremony and weddings took place early in the morning. ""This tradition of having the wedding lunch one week before the actual marriage continued until the 1950s,"" she says. ""My parents, who got married in January 1951, did that - they had a big party with all their relatives a week before the wedding, then returned to their family homes, and then a week later got married at 6am in church."" Now 95, Alma's mother could once be found on a sunny bench passing the time of day with other women, all wearing traditional dress, including the tartan underskirt. Some have the surname Patritti, which they believe is derived from ""Patrick"". As we walk along the steep cobbled streets, Alma's youngest daughter, Sabrina, points out to me an unusual architectural feature - some of the buildings have wooden supports under the windows, positioned to form what looks like the St Andrew's cross. And she says some consider Celtic-derived words in their dialect to be a sign of Scottish origins. ""Especially the way you say 'yes'. It's 'si' in Italian and usually, in other dialects, you just change it a bit, like 'shi',"" she says. ""Here it's 'aye'. They actually switch the accent so it's more 'ayee' than 'aye' but it sounds like the Scottish way."" There are plenty more fragments of apparent evidence that locals can list. One is a typical folk song with words indicating nostalgia for the sea, although 500 years ago the people of Gurro would never have travelled far enough to see it. And there is a fisherman's knot that must have been taught to the mountain folk by men who fished. A traditional underskirt (centre) on display in the village museum All this so impressed a Scottish amateur anthropologist, Lt Col Gayre of Gayre and Nigg, baron of Lochoreshyre, that he embarked on his own investigation. His book, The Lost Clan - which bears little trace of the disturbing racial views he became notorious for - concluded that the people of Gurro most likely could claim Scottish descent, and in 1973 he symbolically adopted them into his own clan. Silvano Dresti (no relation of Alma's - it's a common name in Gurro) recalls an unforgettable party that was thrown to celebrate. ""There was a lot of excitement and the whole village was decorated with Scottish and Italian flags for the occasion. Being affiliated to a clan made us proud,"" he says. Silvano remembers the kilted Scottish baron and bagpipers, and VIP guests including Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who would later become president of Italy. A BBC Scotland television crew captured it all on film. This video can not be played Lt Col Gayre arrived with a piper and unveiled a plaque to commemorate the occasion Silvano was 18 at the time. ""I was a bell ringer,"" he says. ""I'd learned the Scottish anthem, Scotland the Brave, which I practised playing on our church bells up in the bell tower."" Alma Dresti remembers that the preparations began long in advance, with people cleaning, tidying, weeding and planting flowers. Some parents dress their children in tartan on special occasions Throughout the summer, groups of men and women gathered in the mountains above the village to practise old folk songs that they performed on the day, she says.  She was 21 and her first daughter, just two months old, was the youngest villager in traditional costume that day. ""It was such an emotion to watch the procession from the church square - the baron, the mayor, all the guests and the bagpipe players. It was so different. I still get goosebumps when I think back to it."" Her husband, Adriano Dresti, who was a village councillor at the time, has equally fond - though perhaps hazier - memories. ""We had a party in the municipal offices with the baron. There was an immediate feeling of kinship. He brought three or four crates of whisky!"" he laughs. The bar in the village had always been called the Scotch  Bar (it's now thecircolo degli scozzesi- the Scottish social club) but after the ceremony the bond with Scotland was consolidated. Silvano Dresti took up the bagpipes, though he is keen to specify that he plays the easier Italian variety, thebaghet bergamasco. Sylvano Dresti learned to play an Italian version of the bagpipes His brother, Giorgio, once dropped in on the Gayre family at their home, Minard Castle, near Inveraray. ""When he said he was from Gurro, they welcomed him in,"" Silvano says. Silvano has not visited the castle but will never forget the moment he finally made it to Scotland. His eyes mist as he remembers getting off the coach before crossing over the border from England. ""The guide explained to us, 'Over there that's where Scotland begins'. It was then and there that I felt some emotions rise up inside me that I really can't explain... Scotland... I remember thinking, 'This is the land they say we come from.'"" Stepping off the bus in Edinburgh, he heard the sound of bagpipes. ""I followed the sound through the streets until I reached the spot in front of a big store where there was a bagpiper in his kilt and finery. I already felt moved by the sound of bagpipes, but to be in the kingdom of Scottish bagpipes under the castle... that was so powerful."" Gurro's ""Scottish social club"" (the bar) is situated opposite the church A new Gaelic connection was made when Sabrina Dresti, Alma and Adriano's daughter, paid a visit to northern Scotland and fell in love with Sam MacDuff. Could the story they so fondly embrace in Gurro convince a sceptical Scot? ""Well, at first I thought it was a joke,"" Sam says. ""But when I read about it, I think it's possible, it's at least plausible that there might have been some roots."" Sam says his uncle, an academic at Edinburgh University and a genealogy and local history enthusiast, did some research of his own. ""He looked into some of the claims about the names and historical side and I think there is a reasonable amount of evidence that it might in fact be based on a certain element of truth,"" he says, cautiously. His mother-in-law remembers the reaction in Gurro when news of the engagement was announced. ""There were jokes like, 'Your daughter's going back to her roots, so now we have a real Scot and it's not just a legend any more!'"" Alma says. Visiting Scotland for the wedding was a moving experience for Alma and Adriano. ""It felt a bit like a return to our origins,"" says Alma. ""I think that all humans are happy to discover their origins and know they belong to a group. I felt at home there. I'd love to have confirmation that our story is true."" Adriano says they looked for evidence, but to no avail. ""We went to the baron's village. We even went to an old graveyard to see if we could find some names that resembled ours. We didn't find any that were similar but the emotion of that day was nice anyway."" Keen for her wedding to reflect what she regards as their shared Scottish heritage, Sabrina convinced Sam to wear a kilt. ""Yeah, for the first time in my life!"" says Sam. ""He did it mainly for me,"" laughs Sabrina,"" but also for this tradition."" Listen to Dany Mitzman's report onOutlook, on the BBC World Service.

Manchester businesses recovering after attack impact,"Business groups expect the financial impact on the city to be 'short-lived' Like other terror attacks in Europe: London, Paris and Brussels, Manchester was fundamentally a human tragedy. But even in the immediate aftermath, Manchester was resolute that it would carry on; it was ""business as usual"". Growth in professional services, tourism and the burgeoning tech sector over recent years means it is now the UK's second city in terms of economic activity. However, businesses in the area near to the Manchester Arena said they experienced a noticeable drop in trade following theevent on 22 Mayin which 22 people were killed. There was an increased police presence in the city following the attack Howard Burns, who runs a jewellery business that has been in the city since the late 1800s, says that in the days immediately following the attack ""there was no one shopping here"". ""I think that the retail business in Manchester dropped off an awful lot just after the bomb because people were worried to come into Manchester. To hear more about the impact the terror attack in Manchester has had on business in the city listen to the BBC 5 live Wake Up To Moneypodcast. ""Some people were frightened of being in a crowded area, some people were just scared of anyone with a rucksack on their back, and anyone who acted suspiciously."" Manchester City Council says it had offered support to firms closest to the arena, including business rate relief. Cllr John Flanagan, Manchester City Council's executive member for finance, says: ""Businesses within the inner cordon were impacted most acutely, and we have been in conversation since the attack to support them, including business rate relief, and the Manchester Business Continuity Forum has been updating and reviewing their continuity plans."" Howard Burns, a jeweller in the city, said it took two weeks for normal trade to resume He added that the council and tourism groups would ""continue promoting the city as a key UK destination, and to make sure visitor perceptions are not affected in the long-term"". Certainly in Paris, the tourism sector reported asharp fallin the number of visitors to the city following the attacks in 2015. Fewer tourists meant lost business for restaurants, shops, tourist attractions and transport. Christian Spence, âhead of research and policy at Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, says: ""Broadly... we don't expect anything in the long term; certainly not beyond some of the comparables we've seen in other cities who've faced similar incidents."" There was a sharp fall in visitors to Paris after the 2015 attacks Manchester's economic data for the summer months will not be available ""for a long time"", but chamber members expect the impact on businesses in the city to be short-lived, Mr Spence adds. According to its latest Quarterly Economic Survey, the city's Chamber of Commerce is predicting that UK growth will be 1.6% this year and 1.5% in 2018, while growth in Greater Manchester will be 3.25%. Mr Spence says: ""For those businesses that were closest to the terror site itself, of course there was a colossal impact in the immediate aftermath, which lasted for around a week as the cordon stayed in place. ""Otherwise more widely the major impact will have been around our conference and hotel facilities. That's a relatively short-term impact... but it will have hit some of those businesses. After London, among British visitors, Manchester is the second most visited city in the UK. Adrian Ellis, chair of Manchester Hoteliers' Association (MHA), says many hotels in the city had lost a lot of business, but that the industry is recovering The tourist economy is worth around Â£7.5bn to the Greater Manchester region. Tourism was a sector that felt an immediate impact following the May attack. The general manager of the Lowry Hotel, Adrian Ellis, says: ""Our hotel, and along with the other hotels in the city, lost considerable amount of business, mostly with concerts cancelling because the arena was closed and still is closed."" The Manchester Arena is due toreopenin September 2017. Concerts by acts including Celine Dion, Radiohead, Bros and Blink-182 have been cancelled or rearranged. Gavin Sharp, owner of the Band on the Wall, venue says visitor numbers dropped noticeably Mr Ellis, who is also chair of Manchester Hoteliers' Association (MHA), said the hospitality sector was noticing an improvement now. Perhaps inevitably, other music venues were affected too. One of those to experience a noticeable drop in visitors was the iconic Band on The Wall club, run by chief executive, Gavin Sharp. He says: ""Probably the best example is Craig Charles, who plays with us the last Saturday every month... it always sells out, it's quite a mainstream, broad audience. ""The Saturday after the bomb was Craig's show and it didn't get to sell out that time, and in fact 60 people who had bought tickets didn't turn up for the show, so even though they'd spent the money they decided they weren't going to come into the city centre."" Katie Gallacher, head of Manchester Digital, says the attack has not put people off relocating to the city for work But the mood in the city is optimistic, particularly among those in the tech sector. It is Manchester's fastest growing industry. Katie Gallacher, head of Manchester Digital, says the industry had been relatively immune to events. She and many others in her sector are trying to encourage digital and tech professionals to relocate to Manchester. ""We're still seeing companies relocating here. It's a really great place to be, and the community's stronger than ever.""

Spain sees record migrant sea arrivals,"This video can not be played A boat full of migrants lands at a popular tourist beach in southern Spain Three times as many migrants have arrived in Spain so far this year compared to the same period in 2016, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says. It means the number of sea arrivals in Spain - at 8,385 - could overtake Greece, which has had 11,713 people. The shift may be because migrants are finding the Spanish route safer. Earlier this week, footage showed migrants arriving by dinghy on a beach in CÃ¡diz to the surprise of beachgoers. The IOM say 11,849 people have arrived in Spain so far this year, compared with 13,246 in all of last year. Child migrantâs body sparks soul searching in Spain The deadly Spanish route attracting migrants Spain finds migrants in funfair lorries ""We assume that some of the change is due to the fact that the route [to Spain] is considered a safe route up to the coast through Morocco,"" Joel Millman, a senior IOM spokesman, was quoted by AFP news agency as saying. ""It's possible that Spain will outperform Greece this year,"" Mr Millman said. ""If so, that's a big change."" Many of those opting for the longer route to Europe are from west African countries including Senegal, Gambia, Guinea and Ivory Coast. Spain is still far behind Italy, which received 96,861 until 9 August,according to the IOM.,external Overall numbers have fallen by almost 60% from the same period the previous year. On Thursday, coastguards in southern Spain said 10 men from sub-Saharan Africa were rescued off Tarifa. Trying to stop ships rescuing migrants Are migrants paying price as EU targets smugglers? The coastguard said they were on a rickety boat off the southern town of Tarifa, in CÃ¡diz province, where a boat full of migrants landed at a popular tourist beach on Wednesday, stunning tourists. According to AFP, nine of the 30 or so migrants who arrived on the beach on Wednesday had been found. They are all minors in their teens and, while they did not have any ID on them, are thought to be from Morocco, police were quoted as saying. They will be taken to migrant reception centres, where they can apply for asylum in Spain, AFP adds. Earlier this year thousands of protesters called on the Spanish government to allow people fleeing war-hit areas such as Syria in the country. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

Trump thanks Putin for diplomatic staff cut,"Russia said the US diplomatic staff would have to leave by 1 September US President Donald Trump has thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for ordering the departure of 755 staff from US diplomatic missions. Speaking to reporters in New Jersey, he said he wanted to thank the Russian leader for saving the US money. Several US investigations are looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, which allegedly meddled in the 2016 election. Mr Trump has rejected the inquiries as a ""witch hunt"". This video can not be played Who's in Trump's good and bad books? At the end of July, President Putin said 755 staff would have to leave US diplomatic missions in Russia, in retaliation for new US sanctions against Moscow. Many employees are believed to be ""local hires"", meaning it is likely far less than 755 people will actually have to leave the country. He said they had to leave by 1 September, bringing staff levels to 455, the same as Russia's complement in Washington. Staff in the embassy in Moscow as well as the consulates in Ekaterinburg, Vladivostok and St Petersburg were affected. At the time, the US State Department said the move was a ""regrettable and uncalled for act"". But Mr Trump thanked Mr Putin for reducing the US government's ""payroll"". ""I want to thank him because we're trying to cut down our payroll and as far as I'm concerned I'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people,"" he said. Also on Thursday, President Trump said he was ""very surprised"" by raids on the Virginia home of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort by federal agents on 26 July. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who is heading up the main investigation into Russian election interference, left Mr Manafort's Alexandria home with ""various records"", the Washington Post reported on Wednesday. The president, who is on a working holiday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, also told reporters he had not thought about the possibility of firing Mr Mueller, whowas appointed as special counselin May following Mr Trump's sacking of then FBI Director James Comey.

Cladding to be stripped from hospital,"Cladding similar to that used in the fire-hit Grenfell Tower in London is to be removed from Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital building. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said ""forensic checks"" had identified cladding similar to, but not the same as, that used in the London tower. The board stressed that the hospital was designed to be ""one of the most fire safe buildings in the country"". But they said the cladding would be removed as a ""precautionary measure"". Cladding made from an aluminium composite material is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread ofthe fire which engulfed Grenfell Towerin June. Scottish local authorities and other organisations have beenundertaking checksever since, withsome schoolsandother buildingsfound to have used it. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said that checks by external technical advisors had identified cladding on the hospital, which opened in April 2015, ""of a type similar to, but not the same as, Grenfell"". The board said Health Facilities Scotland and their National Fire Advisor had given ""renewed assurances"" that the hospital was ""an extremely safe building"", but said panels would be removed ""as a purely precautionary measure"". They said this move would ""make sure the public, our patients and our staff have full confidence in the safety of the hospital"". Work on removing the panels, which are present in three external sections of the building, will take place ""at the earliest possible opportunity"". The board said hospital management teams are working on plans to minimise any impact on patient care. The Scottish government's working group on building and fire safety, which was set up in the wake of the Grenfell fire, held its fourth meeting earlier on Thursday. Members - which include Communities Secretary Angela Constance and housing minister Kevin Stewart - discussed the Glasgow hospital cladding, but were reassured by fire service representatives that safety audits of the building were satisfactory. Health Secretary Shona Robison said: ""Patient safety is paramount and that is why further forensic checks are currently taking place across the whole NHS estate in Scotland. ""Following the identification of a type of aluminium composite material on the QEUH of a similar type to, but not the same as Grenfell, I am reassured that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have decided that the material should be removed as a precautionary measure.""
