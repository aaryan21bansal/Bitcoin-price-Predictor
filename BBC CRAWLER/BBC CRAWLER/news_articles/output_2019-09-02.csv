Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a double defeat in the Commons after MPs turned down his motion for a general election. There has been a lot to take in, so if you're still catching up - and who would blame you - here's a quick reminder of the major happenings: The Daily Mirror uses its front page to declare Mr Johnson ""Britain's worst PM (since the last one)"". An image of what the paper calls a ""deflated"" Mr Johnson looking downward fills the front page. Theresa May smiles out from an inset picture. A more animated photo of the prime minister fills the front page of the Daily Express. ""Boris urges 'people power' to force election,"" is the headline. It calls Jeremy Corbyn's decision not to support a general election until a bill designed to help avert a no-deal Brexit is passed ""an extraordinary act of cowardice"". The front pages of the Daily Mail and the Sun both pick up on Boris Johnson calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""chicken"" for refusing to back a general election before the Hilary Benn's bill is passed into law. The Sun goes as far as superimposing the Labour leader's face onto a chicken, alongside the headline ""Is this the most dangerous chicken in Britain?"". Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph opts for the headline ""'Hypocrite' Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock"". The newspapers are responding to another momentous day in Parliament. The front pages of the i, the Guardian and the Financial Times all say the prime minister has been left ""cornered"" by MPs after losing three votes in the Commons.

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is reported to have told European diplomats that negotiations with London over the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU are in a state of paralysis. He also advised the meeting that Britain appeared intent on reducing the level of ambition in the political declaration that will steer the next stage of the negotiations. The statement is in stark contrast with claims by the UK government that progress has been made in redrafting elements of the agreement painstakingly negotiated over the past two years. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said it was leading EU leaders to think Mr Johnson ""cannot have a solution up his sleeve - despite all the rhetoric"". Find our how your local MP voted on the bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and on the PM's call for an early general election. MPs have voted on an early general election and a bill that could delay Brexit. Sir Michael Fallon has been the MP for Sevenoaks since 1997 Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has announced he will be standing down at the next election. In a statement he said: ""Sadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last.  I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than 30 years - quite long enough. ""I want to thank all my constituents for their support and encouragement. ""Wendy and I will continue to live in the constituency and to be involved locally. If an immediate election is called, I will not therefore be a candidate."" Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert ""I think the truth is the argument about no-deal is just a
re-hash of the debate about whether we want to remain or leave in the first
place."" ""With Brexit there is no point in talking about the electorate as a whole. ""We have two different electorates: we have a remain electorate and we have a leave electorate. ""Seventy five per cent of remain voters think that leaving without a deal is a bad idea and they oppose it. And around 75% of leave voters think that it is a good idea and they favour it. ""We're now seeing that divide remain/leave divide very, very clearly articulated in their preference for a general election."" The government has announced that some EU nationals will be able to apply to stay in the UK for three years in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Those arriving in the UK before the end of next year will be able to apply to the new scheme, the government confirmed on Wednesday evening. This would allow EU nationals who arrive before the end of 2020 to stay until December 2023. You canread the full story here.

Over in the House of Lords, peers are still voting on amendments to the business motion which aims at ensuring the no-deal bill has time to become law before the suspension of Parliament.

Hundreds of steel jobs could go at Newport plant,"Up to 380 jobs could be lost at the plant Hundreds of jobs could go with the closure of a Tata steel plant in Newport. There has been a factory at the site since 1898 but Orb Electrical Steels has not been in profit for four years. Up to 380 jobs could go although Tata hope to offer jobs elsewhere in Wales. The factory, which makes electrical steel used in power transmission, was put up for sale in May 2018, with Tata wanting to concentrate on its core steel business. Tata Steel's European operations head Henrik Adam said: ""I recognise how difficult this news will be for all those affected and we will work very hard to support them."" Unions said Tata - which employs nearly 6,000 workers in Wales - was breaking its commitments over job guarantees. Orb Electrical Steels is part of Tata's Cogent division, part of which is being sold to the Japanese steel company JFE Shoji Trade Corporation. Tata is also closing its Wolverhampton Engineering Steels service centre, with up to 26 jobs at risk. Tata said it would have cost Â£50m to upgrade the Orb site to make it competitive The Orb site makes electrical steel used in generators, transformers, motors and magnetic products, including for the car industry. But the sector has been suffering from over-capacity over the last 10 years, and struggling to compete in particular with big volume producers in China. ""This business is the smallest volume electrical steel manufacturer in the world - and we've only been able to make a profit in two of the last 10 years and no profit in the last four years,"" Tor Farquhar, Tata Steel Europe's HR director, told BBC Wales. Meanwhile, converting the Orb plant would have cost Tata more than Â£50m. Mr Adam added: ""Continuing to fund substantial losses at Orb Electrical Steels is not sustainable at a time when the European steel industry is facing considerable challenges."" But he said workers would be offered alternative employment at other Tata sites in Wales where possible and consultations with staff and unions would start shortly. Factory output 'falls at fastest pace for seven years' Tata plant with 350 workers up for sale Is steel-making still important to the Welsh economy? Paul Horton, a Community union official at the plant, said there had been an agreement for no compulsory job losses until 2021 One of the plant's union officials Paul Horton, who has nearly 37 years experience, said it would mean a loss of well-paid jobs in the area, with workers earning up to Â£40,000, with overtime on top. ""We weren't expecting anything this severe, this quickly,"" he said. ""We understand the business has been struggling but there has been no inkling of this happening over the last few weeks."" This video can not be played Jason Sims, Matthew Grande and Paul Spencer have 55 years experience at Orb behind them Jason Sims, who has worked at the plant for 13 years, said: ""It's sad news. Everyone's in a bit of shock at the moment, trying to take it in."" He said there was a lot of uncertainty whether there would be offers of work in Port Talbot or Llanwern. Matthew Grande said news had been leaking out since Sunday and they had to work with a ""massive cloud hanging over our heads. We're gutted and devastated to be honest with you"". He said it was like a family firm, with everyone knowing each other and ""more or less growing up together"". Paul Spencer, with 22 years at the plant behind him, said he hoped there would be jobs at the end of it. ""There have been rumours for about 12 months on and off, but when go to the meeting this morning, it's real, your stomach sinks."" Orb was privatised from British Steel 30 years ago Unite's Tata official Tony Brady said Orb's closure would be a ""body blow"" for the economy of Wales. ""Unite will be fighting for every job and holding Tata Steel's feet to the fire over assurances that workers affected by today's announcement will be redeployed."" He said the union would not sit back and allow ""decent well-paid jobs and irreplaceable skills to go to the wall"". Roy Rickhuss of the Community steelworkers' union called it ""shocking"" news which ""makes a mockery of the understanding we reached with Tata around the jobs guarantee"". ""There has been no consultation about this proposal either at UK or European level and company management should hang their heads in shame in the way this has come about,"" he said. ""This is of course extremely devastating news for workers at the Orb, but all Tata Steel workers should be concerned by the way Tata is breaking its commitments."" He called for government intervention. The Newport transporter bridge was opened in 1906 to help workers reach the plant There has been steelmaking on the Newport site since 1898, when the old Lysaght company moved from Wolverhampton. The famous city landmark, the transporter bridge, was built a few years later to carry workers across to the works. It eventually became part of British Steel and then European Electrical Steels in 1991. Cogent took over in 2001. There have been concerns for the future of Tata's Cogent operation for a few months, ever since it was put up for sale. Cogenthad been put up for sale by Tata in May last yearafter the Indian owners had decided to concentrate on its core steel production business, as it planned to merge with the German company Thyssenkrupp. Given Cogent's specialism, it was hoped that a buyer could be found, but unions said at the time they were not persuaded by the case for a sale. They had privately been growing increasingly concerned about the future of the plant. This decision could set Tata and the unions on an even bigger collision course. As part of the unions' agreement to support less generous pensions, they believe Tata committed to no compulsory redundancies until 2026. Tata has always maintained that it committed to try to avoid compulsory redundancies. Unions could see this as breaching a commitment to its entire Welsh workforce, and industrial action could be possible, they say. Economy Minister Ken Skates said he stressed the importance in talks with the company of avoiding compulsory redundancies. ""The Welsh Government will now do everything it can to support individuals, the community and the supply chain affected by this announcement,"" he added. ""Today's news clearly demonstrates the fragility of the global steel market and the UK government must now step up and broaden its approach to supporting the industry, including its supply chain, across the whole of the UK."" The UK government said it was in regular contact with the company, unions and other partners and was taking ""wide-ranging action to support the industry"". A spokesman said: ""We have a long and proud history of steelmaking excellence and the UK government is committed to supporting a modern and vibrant steel sector."" Newport East MP Jessica Morden said job losses would be ""devastating news"" for workers and families.Â ""What is particularly tragic is that this, the only UK plant with the potential to produce electric steels for motors and with investment, vision and government backing this could be the key part of the supply chain for electric vehicles,"" she said.

Elephant traps and pigs in pokes?,"""You're asking me about a pig in a poke!"" Those few words were described as having ""terrifying"" consequences for British democracy - after they were used by one of the prime minister's closest allies over the weekend. Then, as if one complicated animal metaphor wasn't enough, a former prime minister warned politicians not to fall into an elephant trap. So who's poking pigs, where do the elephants come in and what has it all got to do with Brexit? It all started on Sunday. Senior Conservative MP Michael Gove was being grilled about the plans to leave the European Union next month - whatever happens, with or without a deal. Michael Gove, pointing at his own name, earlier this year That means we could come out without an agreed plan on things like trade or how the Irish border would work - it's an outcome some people thinkwould be disastrous. So disastrous, in fact, that certain MPs are trying to get together and change the law to stop it happening. And that's where our little piggies come in. Michael Gove was asked, if that law was passed, could the government just ignore it - and leave the EU anyway? ""You're asking me about a pig in a poke!"", he said. If, like most people, you've got no idea what that means - it, apparently, stems back to the 16th century. The gist is you shouldn't buy something until you've inspected it (""poke"" is an old word for sack - and we're told pig salespeople would sometimes palm customers off with stray cats instead. So always check your shopping bags, people). What Michael Gove would look like with a pig in his poke In other words, Michael Gove refused to rule out ignoring the law until he knows what's in it. Some other MPs were outraged. ""It is clear that this government's gone rogue,"" said the SNP's Pete Wishart. He added: ""No-one is above the law, and for Boris Johnson's government to act like they are is genuinely terrifying for our democracy."" Bear with us. This video can not be played Brenda. From Bristol. In all her glory. You might remember Brenda from Bristol who went viral in 2017. Well she might not be pleased to know ageneral election may well be on its way. Government officials say Boris Johnson will call for one on 14 October if MPs succeed in changing the law. You'd think it would be great news for the party trying to get into power - Labour. Well, not according to former Labour prime minister Tony Blair. Also apparently a fan of obscure animal-based sayings, he's said that election would bean ""elephant trap""for his old party. Tony Blair, pictured here coming up with the analogy in South Africa in 2006 You'll be sad to know we don't know the history behind this one, but it means a trap any sensible person would avoid. Why?

EU studies backstop while watching MPs in uproar,"Key players: EU summit chairman Donald Tusk (L) and Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier As the UK steels itself for a week of edge-of-yer-seat high political drama, what do our ""negotiating partners"" in the EU make of it all? I use inverted commas for ""negotiating partners"" because, despite UK government assertions, there are no real EU-UK negotiations currently taking place. Truth be told, EU leaders are pretty open-mouthed at what's going on across the Channel. Italian colleagues mutter that these levels of deep political splits and spin, plus divisions and rampant uncertainty amongst the general public, are normally associated with their country - which, they are delighted to point out, is currently calmly (for once) digging itself out of a government crisis as I write. A cabinet minister in Finland, meanwhile, described himself as so gobsmacked by the idea that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will suspend parliament at such a time of political crisis, that he likened it to the Finnish government trying to announce a national ban on saunas (which they aren't intending to do, by the way). Finland currently holds the rotating EU presidency. But more senior EU leaders - such as those in France and Germany - have kept their thoughts on the UK political drama to themselves. Make no mistake though: they are monitoring the situation very carefully. EU leaders are closely watching Boris Johnson's battle in Westminster You see, for the EU this not at all about Boris Johnson v Jeremy Corbyn or the ""Rebel Alliance"" v Brexiteers in government. It's about damage limitation. Consider the fact that EU officials in Brussels have just announced they're debatingwhether to classify a no-deal Brexit as a ""major disaster"",external, so that affected EU countries can legally request compensation funding from the bloc's Solidarity Fund, usually reserved for floods, fires and earthquakes. There's a very stark contrast between the EU focus at the beginning of these negotiations - when Brussels wanted the UK to sign up to the most advantageous deal possible (from the EU perspective!) - and now, with a no-deal Brexit looming, when the EU is in full self-preservation mode. Political leaders like Germany's Angela Merkel and the Netherlands' Mark Rutte are nervously wondering how they - and the bloc as a whole - can emerge from the Brexit drama as unscathed as possible. Aware of the economic cost of no deal for them at home, plus the geopolitical impact of an acrimonious no-deal Brexit - which they believe would serve the interests of Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin above anyone else's - they are very keen indeed that a Brexit compromise deal be found, if possible. But as ever, EU leaders' keenness to agree a Brexit deal should not be confused with a willingness to do whatever it takes. 'Election in October' if MPs block no deal Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? Everything you need to know about Brexit EU Single Market concerns are paramount when looking at alternatives to the backstop guarantee for the open Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Angela Merkel is certainly not chasing a deal ""at any price"". The EU will only make real compromises if Europe's leaders are convinced that their pain will definitely result in their gain. That by the EU making change X or Y to the Brexit deal, then a majority in the UK parliament would be guaranteed to pass the revised deal. Right now Brussels can see that Boris Johnson doesn't have the numbers. An election could change all that, of course. If it were held before the UK leaves the EU. If Boris Johnson were to win a majority. Brexit drama: This is a crunch week for MPs as time is running out The prime minister is wrong to claim the UK's negotiating power is dependent on a credible no deal threat and is weakened purely by rebel MPs' push to prevent a no-deal Brexit by 31 October. EU leaders believe Mr Johnson is serious about no deal, but that alone is not enough to persuade them to make serious changes to the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. It cannot be emphasised enough: Boris Johnson's parliamentary numbers are key. The PM said on Monday night that he doesn't want to hold an election (though rumours persist that he'll call one anyway). He also said he believes the chances of a deal with the EU are rising all the time. Things look and sound very different in Brussels. ""We can see Boris Johnson is playing a political game,"" a diplomat from a country traditionally very close to the UK told me. ""But we don't understand the rules or the strategy."" Yes, the prime minister's EU envoy David Frost travels back and forth to Brussels. He is expected here on Wednesday and possibly again on Friday this week. But the Johnson government has yet to put a workable alternative to the backstop on the table and the EU is waiting to see what happens in Westminster. Meanwhile, Mr Frost's visits are regarded in the EU as optics aimed at a UK domestic audience, rather than a serious opportunity to talk substance. The process is viewed across Europe with deep distrust. Officially, of course, the EU position is that it waits for London to come up with alternative solutions to replace the controversial backstop to keep the Irish border open after Brexit. But what would an acceptable alternative look like? Does it actually exist? EU figures are divided on this. Warrenpoint Port: The Northern Ireland border remains the thorniest issue Some in Brussels hope a win for Boris Johnson in Westminster would allow him to return to the original Northern Ireland-only backstop, as he would no longer be reliant for support in parliament on the Northern Ireland unionist DUP party. That original backstop proposal would see only Northern Ireland remaining in a customs union with the EU and adhering to some single market rules - not the whole UK. Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit EU diplomats say they could dress up the ""new old backstop"" as something different, to make it easier for Mr Johnson to sell back home. And there are those in Brussels who even wonder if the prime minister could hold a referendum in Northern Ireland on whether to accept that backstop, safe in the knowledge that polls suggest the majority there are in favour. Though of course such a referendum could easily be manipulated into a de facto vote on Northern Ireland's political future instead. Another thought doing the Brussels rounds is that the EU may have to hold its nose and go for a sector-by-sector customs agreement for Northern Ireland, similar to the deal the bloc has (and had sworn never to replicate) with Switzerland. But of course Switzerland has customs infrastructure on its EU borders, something that no-one wants to see in Ireland. Would Dublin accept some checks between Ireland and the rest of the EU to avoid a no-deal Brexit? The EU-UK route towards compromise is as fraught with difficulty as the current UK political impasse. There's only one bet that EU figures are happy to make at the moment: that the EU leaders' scheduled mid-October summit will not deliver their final word on deal or no deal. Expect a Brexit-focused emergency EU summit (or two) before Halloween night is out.

EU considers treating no deal as a 'disaster',"The Dutch port of Rotterdam is among those that could see disruption in a no-deal Brexit The European Commission is considering allowing EU countries to apply for cash to cope with a no-deal Brexit using a special emergency fund. Officials are working on a plan to classify no deal as a ""major disaster"", a category normally used to describe destructive natural events such as earthquakes or major floods. The move would require the approval of EU states and the European Parliament. PM Boris Johnson says the UK must leave with or without a deal by 31 October. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the European Union with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process. That would mean leaving the single market and customs union - both designed to facilitate smooth trade - and institutions like the European Court of Justice and Europol, its law enforcement body, overnight. Opponents of no deal fear it would damage UK and EU economies, lead to significant disruption to travel, and affect supplies of food, medicine and other goods. Proponents, though, argue any disruption would be short term. Barnier rejects demands for backstop to be axed What are EU countries doing to prepare for no deal? No-deal Brexit: How might it affect the EU? Under the proposals being considered by the Commission, EU countries would be able to apply for no-deal cash using the EU'ssolidarity fund,external. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the plans would be discussed on Monday, and could be formalised at a Commission meeting due on Wednesday. The fund, first set up after flooding in central Europe in 2002, is normally used to finance repair work caused by major natural disasters. Since then it has been used to provide help to a number of countries coping with the aftermath of earthquakes and floods, including Italy, Germany and Austria.

EU considers treating no deal as a 'disaster'Can no-deal Brexit be stopped?What happens next?Elephant traps and pigs in pokes?,"The Dutch port of Rotterdam is among those that could see disruption in a no-deal Brexit The European Commission is considering allowing EU countries to apply for cash to cope with a no-deal Brexit using a special emergency fund. Officials are working on a plan to classify no deal as a ""major disaster"", a category normally used to describe destructive natural events such as earthquakes or major floods. The move would require the approval of EU states and the European Parliament. PM Boris Johnson says the UK must leave with or without a deal by 31 October. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the European Union with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process. That would mean leaving the single market and customs union - both designed to facilitate smooth trade - and institutions like the European Court of Justice and Europol, its law enforcement body, overnight. Opponents of no deal fear it would damage UK and EU economies, lead to significant disruption to travel, and affect supplies of food, medicine and other goods. Proponents, though, argue any disruption would be short term. Barnier rejects demands for backstop to be axed What are EU countries doing to prepare for no deal? No-deal Brexit: How might it affect the EU? Under the proposals being considered by the Commission, EU countries would be able to apply for no-deal cash using the EU'ssolidarity fund,external. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the plans would be discussed on Monday, and could be formalised at a Commission meeting due on Wednesday. The fund, first set up after flooding in central Europe in 2002, is normally used to finance repair work caused by major natural disasters. Since then it has been used to provide help to a number of countries coping with the aftermath of earthquakes and floods, including Italy, Germany and Austria. Funding applications under the scheme have to be approved by EU states and the European Parliament, and can often take months to be paid out.

What happens next?Elephant traps and pigs in pokes?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Climate activists glue themselves to bankThe protesters are part of an Extinction Rebellion camp set up last week in Manchester.Manchester,"The campaigners say Barclays is a large investor in fossil fuels Climate change protesters glued themselves to the pavement outside the Barclays Bank headquarters in Manchester. The group of eight campaigners broke away from a four-day blockade of Deansgate in Manchester city centre organised by Extinction Rebellion. The protesters, who have since been removed by police, said Barclays invested in fossil fuels. The original climate camp protest began on Friday. A Barclays statement said: ""We recognise that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today and are determined to do all we can to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, while also ensuring that global energy needs continue to be met."" The demonstrators blocked the entrance to Barclays' HQ Protesters who had been camped elsewhere in Manchester staged a ""die-in"" near Barclays An Extinction Rebellion Manchester spokesperson said: ""Barclays has funded the fossil fuel industry, from fracking and coal here in Britain to the Dakota Access pipeline in North America. ""Mines and oilfields are financed with the help of Barclays, who are increasing their financing for fossil fuel. ""Today we're calling on them to stop doing that and recognise that we are facing catastrophic ecological breakdown which these practices are contributing to. ""We have just a handful of years before the damage we have done to the planet becomes irreversible."" Protesters staged ""die-in""protests by lying on the pavement or roads The protesters say they have been speaking to police and civic authorities Earlier, demonstrators joined fracking protesters outside Manchester's Civil Justice Centre where a legal challenge to an injunction restricting certain protests outside Cuadrilla's fracking site in Lancashire was taking place. Both sets of activists cheered and sang songs outside the court. Protesters from the climate change camp in Deansgate joined the Barclays demo to stage another ""die-in"" protest there. Meanwhile, more climate change protesters blocked Great Ancoats Street and held a third ""die-in"" demonstration at the former Central Retail Park site near Urban Exchange. Transport for Greater Manchester tweeted,externalthe road had reopened but delays were still expected. Protesters also lay down outside fashion outlet Primark on Market Street, hindering shoppers getting into the store for 11 minutes, highlighting the 11 years the group believes we have to save the planet. The activists said they wanted to draw attention to the ""wastefulness of the fashion industry"". The protesters then moved on to HSBC in St Ann's Square. Climate change protests began on Friday Extinction Rebellion moved plants into Deansgate A closing ceremony for the protests took place at a yellow boat on Deansgate Extinction Rebellion Manchester said it had been working with authorities and meeting police every few hours to keep them informed about its activities. Both the council and Greater Manchester Police warned activists not to break the law. Councillor Nigel Murphy, deputy leader of Manchester City Council, said: ""Protesters have made their point. It's a point about the urgency of tackling climate change which many Mancunians completely understand. ""But any actions which cause disruption to the lives of large numbers of ordinary citizens risk being counterproductive to the protesters' cause and we would encourage them to act appropriately."" A closing ceremony for the protests took place around a yellow boat on Deansgate which had been the protesters' base while they have demonstrated at banks and shops across the city. Demonstrators sang songs and held up banners to bring to an end four days of action. Police confirmed no arrests had been made.

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is reported to have told European diplomats that negotiations with London over the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU are in a state of paralysis. He also advised the meeting that Britain appeared intent on reducing the level of ambition in the political declaration that will steer the next stage of the negotiations. The statement is in stark contrast with claims by the UK government that progress has been made in redrafting elements of the agreement painstakingly negotiated over the past two years. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said it was leading EU leaders to think Mr Johnson ""cannot have a solution up his sleeve - despite all the rhetoric"". Find our how your local MP voted on the bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and on the PM's call for an early general election. MPs have voted on an early general election and a bill that could delay Brexit. Sir Michael Fallon has been the MP for Sevenoaks since 1997 Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has announced he will be standing down at the next election. In a statement he said: ""Sadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last.  I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than 30 years - quite long enough. ""I want to thank all my constituents for their support and encouragement. ""Wendy and I will continue to live in the constituency and to be involved locally. If an immediate election is called, I will not therefore be a candidate."" Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert ""I think the truth is the argument about no-deal is just a
re-hash of the debate about whether we want to remain or leave in the first
place."" ""With Brexit there is no point in talking about the electorate as a whole. ""We have two different electorates: we have a remain electorate and we have a leave electorate. ""Seventy five per cent of remain voters think that leaving without a deal is a bad idea and they oppose it. And around 75% of leave voters think that it is a good idea and they favour it. ""We're now seeing that divide remain/leave divide very, very clearly articulated in their preference for a general election."" The government has announced that some EU nationals will be able to apply to stay in the UK for three years in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

"Hundreds of steel jobs could go at Newport plantThe factory closure is called a ""devastating blow"" although Tata hopes to offer alternative work.Wales","Up to 380 jobs could be lost at the plant Hundreds of jobs could go with the closure of a Tata steel plant in Newport. There has been a factory at the site since 1898 but Orb Electrical Steels has not been in profit for four years. Up to 380 jobs could go although Tata hope to offer jobs elsewhere in Wales. The factory, which makes electrical steel used in power transmission, was put up for sale in May 2018, with Tata wanting to concentrate on its core steel business. Tata Steel's European operations head Henrik Adam said: ""I recognise how difficult this news will be for all those affected and we will work very hard to support them."" Unions said Tata - which employs nearly 6,000 workers in Wales - was breaking its commitments over job guarantees. Orb Electrical Steels is part of Tata's Cogent division, part of which is being sold to the Japanese steel company JFE Shoji Trade Corporation. Tata is also closing its Wolverhampton Engineering Steels service centre, with up to 26 jobs at risk. Tata said it would have cost Â£50m to upgrade the Orb site to make it competitive The Orb site makes electrical steel used in generators, transformers, motors and magnetic products, including for the car industry. But the sector has been suffering from over-capacity over the last 10 years, and struggling to compete in particular with big volume producers in China. ""This business is the smallest volume electrical steel manufacturer in the world - and we've only been able to make a profit in two of the last 10 years and no profit in the last four years,"" Tor Farquhar, Tata Steel Europe's HR director, told BBC Wales. Meanwhile, converting the Orb plant would have cost Tata more than Â£50m. Mr Adam added: ""Continuing to fund substantial losses at Orb Electrical Steels is not sustainable at a time when the European steel industry is facing considerable challenges."" But he said workers would be offered alternative employment at other Tata sites in Wales where possible and consultations with staff and unions would start shortly. Factory output 'falls at fastest pace for seven years' Tata plant with 350 workers up for sale Is steel-making still important to the Welsh economy? Paul Horton, a Community union official at the plant, said there had been an agreement for no compulsory job losses until 2021 One of the plant's union officials Paul Horton, who has nearly 37 years experience, said it would mean a loss of well-paid jobs in the area, with workers earning up to Â£40,000, with overtime on top. ""We weren't expecting anything this severe, this quickly,"" he said. ""We understand the business has been struggling but there has been no inkling of this happening over the last few weeks."" This video can not be played Jason Sims, Matthew Grande and Paul Spencer have 55 years experience at Orb behind them Jason Sims, who has worked at the plant for 13 years, said: ""It's sad news. Everyone's in a bit of shock at the moment, trying to take it in."" He said there was a lot of uncertainty whether there would be offers of work in Port Talbot or Llanwern. Matthew Grande said news had been leaking out since Sunday and they had to work with a ""massive cloud hanging over our heads. We're gutted and devastated to be honest with you"". He said it was like a family firm, with everyone knowing each other and ""more or less growing up together"". Paul Spencer, with 22 years at the plant behind him, said he hoped there would be jobs at the end of it. ""There have been rumours for about 12 months on and off, but when go to the meeting this morning, it's real, your stomach sinks."" Orb was privatised from British Steel 30 years ago Unite's Tata official Tony Brady said Orb's closure would be a ""body blow"" for the economy of Wales. ""Unite will be fighting for every job and holding Tata Steel's feet to the fire over assurances that workers affected by today's announcement will be redeployed."" He said the union would not sit back and allow ""decent well-paid jobs and irreplaceable skills to go to the wall"". Roy Rickhuss of the Community steelworkers' union called it ""shocking"" news which ""makes a mockery of the understanding we reached with Tata around the jobs guarantee"". ""There has been no consultation about this proposal either at UK or European level and company management should hang their heads in shame in the way this has come about,"" he said. ""This is of course extremely devastating news for workers at the Orb, but all Tata Steel workers should be concerned by the way Tata is breaking its commitments."" He called for government intervention. The Newport transporter bridge was opened in 1906 to help workers reach the plant There has been steelmaking on the Newport site since 1898, when the old Lysaght company moved from Wolverhampton. The famous city landmark, the transporter bridge, was built a few years later to carry workers across to the works. It eventually became part of British Steel and then European Electrical Steels in 1991. Cogent took over in 2001. There have been concerns for the future of Tata's Cogent operation for a few months, ever since it was put up for sale. Cogenthad been put up for sale by Tata in May last yearafter the Indian owners had decided to concentrate on its core steel production business, as it planned to merge with the German company Thyssenkrupp. Given Cogent's specialism, it was hoped that a buyer could be found, but unions said at the time they were not persuaded by the case for a sale. They had privately been growing increasingly concerned about the future of the plant. This decision could set Tata and the unions on an even bigger collision course. As part of the unions' agreement to support less generous pensions, they believe Tata committed to no compulsory redundancies until 2026. Tata has always maintained that it committed to try to avoid compulsory redundancies. Unions could see this as breaching a commitment to its entire Welsh workforce, and industrial action could be possible, they say. Economy Minister Ken Skates said he stressed the importance in talks with the company of avoiding compulsory redundancies. ""The Welsh Government will now do everything it can to support individuals, the community and the supply chain affected by this announcement,"" he added. ""Today's news clearly demonstrates the fragility of the global steel market and the UK government must now step up and broaden its approach to supporting the industry, including its supply chain, across the whole of the UK."" The UK government said it was in regular contact with the company, unions and other partners and was taking ""wide-ranging action to support the industry"". A spokesman said: ""We have a long and proud history of steelmaking excellence and the UK government is committed to supporting a modern and vibrant steel sector."" Newport East MP Jessica Morden said job losses would be ""devastating news"" for workers and families.Â ""What is particularly tragic is that this, the only UK plant with the potential to produce electric steels for motors and with investment, vision and government backing this could be the key part of the supply chain for electric vehicles,"" she said.

Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth AM said the closure was ""devastating"" and he wanted the Welsh and UK governments to investigate all possible interventions.

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is reported to have told European diplomats that negotiations with London over the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU are in a state of paralysis. He also advised the meeting that Britain appeared intent on reducing the level of ambition in the political declaration that will steer the next stage of the negotiations. The statement is in stark contrast with claims by the UK government that progress has been made in redrafting elements of the agreement painstakingly negotiated over the past two years. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said it was leading EU leaders to think Mr Johnson ""cannot have a solution up his sleeve - despite all the rhetoric"". Find our how your local MP voted on the bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and on the PM's call for an early general election. MPs have voted on an early general election and a bill that could delay Brexit. Sir Michael Fallon has been the MP for Sevenoaks since 1997 Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has announced he will be standing down at the next election. In a statement he said: ""Sadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last.  I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than 30 years - quite long enough. ""I want to thank all my constituents for their support and encouragement. ""Wendy and I will continue to live in the constituency and to be involved locally. If an immediate election is called, I will not therefore be a candidate."" Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert ""I think the truth is the argument about no-deal is just a
re-hash of the debate about whether we want to remain or leave in the first
place."" ""With Brexit there is no point in talking about the electorate as a whole. ""We have two different electorates: we have a remain electorate and we have a leave electorate. ""Seventy five per cent of remain voters think that leaving without a deal is a bad idea and they oppose it. And around 75% of leave voters think that it is a good idea and they favour it. ""We're now seeing that divide remain/leave divide very, very clearly articulated in their preference for a general election."" The government has announced that some EU nationals will be able to apply to stay in the UK for three years in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Those arriving in the UK before the end of next year will be able to apply to the new scheme, the government confirmed on Wednesday evening. This would allow EU nationals who arrive before the end of 2020 to stay until December 2023. You canread the full story here.

Climate activists glue themselves to bankThe protesters are part of an Extinction Rebellion camp set up last week in Manchester.,"The campaigners say Barclays is a large investor in fossil fuels Climate change protesters glued themselves to the pavement outside the Barclays Bank headquarters in Manchester. The group of eight campaigners broke away from a four-day blockade of Deansgate in Manchester city centre organised by Extinction Rebellion. The protesters, who have since been removed by police, said Barclays invested in fossil fuels. The original climate camp protest began on Friday. A Barclays statement said: ""We recognise that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today and are determined to do all we can to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, while also ensuring that global energy needs continue to be met."" The demonstrators blocked the entrance to Barclays' HQ Protesters who had been camped elsewhere in Manchester staged a ""die-in"" near Barclays An Extinction Rebellion Manchester spokesperson said: ""Barclays has funded the fossil fuel industry, from fracking and coal here in Britain to the Dakota Access pipeline in North America. ""Mines and oilfields are financed with the help of Barclays, who are increasing their financing for fossil fuel. ""Today we're calling on them to stop doing that and recognise that we are facing catastrophic ecological breakdown which these practices are contributing to. ""We have just a handful of years before the damage we have done to the planet becomes irreversible."" Protesters staged ""die-in""protests by lying on the pavement or roads The protesters say they have been speaking to police and civic authorities Earlier, demonstrators joined fracking protesters outside Manchester's Civil Justice Centre where a legal challenge to an injunction restricting certain protests outside Cuadrilla's fracking site in Lancashire was taking place. Both sets of activists cheered and sang songs outside the court. Protesters from the climate change camp in Deansgate joined the Barclays demo to stage another ""die-in"" protest there. Meanwhile, more climate change protesters blocked Great Ancoats Street and held a third ""die-in"" demonstration at the former Central Retail Park site near Urban Exchange. Transport for Greater Manchester tweeted,externalthe road had reopened but delays were still expected. Protesters also lay down outside fashion outlet Primark on Market Street, hindering shoppers getting into the store for 11 minutes, highlighting the 11 years the group believes we have to save the planet. The activists said they wanted to draw attention to the ""wastefulness of the fashion industry"". The protesters then moved on to HSBC in St Ann's Square. Climate change protests began on Friday Extinction Rebellion moved plants into Deansgate A closing ceremony for the protests took place at a yellow boat on Deansgate Extinction Rebellion Manchester said it had been working with authorities and meeting police every few hours to keep them informed about its activities. Both the council and Greater Manchester Police warned activists not to break the law. Councillor Nigel Murphy, deputy leader of Manchester City Council, said: ""Protesters have made their point. It's a point about the urgency of tackling climate change which many Mancunians completely understand. ""But any actions which cause disruption to the lives of large numbers of ordinary citizens risk being counterproductive to the protesters' cause and we would encourage them to act appropriately."" A closing ceremony for the protests took place around a yellow boat on Deansgate which had been the protesters' base while they have demonstrated at banks and shops across the city. Demonstrators sang songs and held up banners to bring to an end four days of action. Police confirmed no arrests had been made.

Man admits crushing boy to death with car seat,"Alfie Lamb died three days after he was crushed in the footwell of a car A man has admitted crushing a three-year-old boy to death by reversing his seat as the boy sat in a car footwell. Stephen Waterson, 26, killed Alfie Lamb - his girlfriend's son - in February 2018. Waterson initially denied manslaughter but changed his plea to guilty ahead of a retrial at the Old Bailey. In May, Alfie's mother Adrian Hoare - who watched as her son was crushed - was jailed fortwo years and nine months for child cruelty. Hoare was cleared of manslaughter while a jury failed to reach a verdict on the same charge for Waterson. The court had heard Waterson had been annoyed at Alfie's crying on a journey back from a shopping trip and moved his seat into him as he sat in the footwell at his mother's feet. Stephen Waterson admitted manslaughter by gross negligence When Alfie continued to moan, Waterson reversed again, saying, ""I won't be told what to do by a three-year-old,"" Hoare told jurors. Alfie collapsed in the car and died in hospital three days later from irreversible brain injuries. In their trial earlier this yearHoare, of Gravesend, Kent, told a string of lies to protect her boyfriend, claiming she had been in a taxi, while Waterson fled in the Audi. Det Ch Insp Simon Harding said: ""Stephen Waterson and Adrian Hoare, even after Alfie died, were more concerned about being together. ""Stephen Waterson was concerned the real story never came out. He went on to intimidate and assault people."" Three-year-old Alfie suffered irreversible brain injuries Waterson also gave officers a false name, a false statement and sold the Audi. Hoare eventually broke her silence and told her half-sister Ashleigh Jeffrey what happened in a taped conversation handed to police. Jurors were also told Waterson had three previous convictions for attacking an ex-girlfriend and his sister's husband. At a trial in February, Mr Waterson told the court he only moved his seat back an inch, before moving forwards again Waterson, the adopted son of former Conservative minister Nigel Waterson, admitted manslaughter by gross negligence on what was set to be the first day of his retrial. He was remanded in custody to be sentenced on 9 September. Det Ch Insp Harding said: ""For a three-and-a-half-year-old to be crushed by something so strong and no-one helping, it's a shocking way to die. ""Stephen Waterson has come across as a selfish, abhorrent individual"". Alfie's mother, Adrian Hoare, was cleared of manslaughter but jailed in May after being found guilty of child cruelty Angela Moriarty, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""This was a harrowing and difficult case for all those involved, but finally justice has been served for Alfie."" Speaking after the hearing police revealed social services had been involved in Alfie's care and that the Medway Safeguarding Children Board is conducting a serious case review.

Is this the phone call that saves my life?," Emma’s long wait for alife-saving call By Dominic Hughes and Rachael Buchanan It is the small hours of the morning in the depths of winter, and Emma Watson is sitting in a dimly lit room in Ward 10 of the transplant unit in the Manchester Royal Infirmary. She looks drawn and tired. It has been a long night. The previous evening, Emma received a phone call at home to say the moment had come. She has been waiting for a kidney and pancreas transplant for more than a year, and donor organs are on their way to Manchester.   She’s been here before - not once, but a dozen times. It’s nearly always the same - a phone call, a hurried goodbye to her husband who mostly stays at home to look after their 10-year-old daughter, the dash to the hospital. And then the wait, knowing that she could be just hours away from an operation that has the potential to change her life. Or, if things go wrong, end it. But Emma is not the only one on the ward waiting - across the corridor another patient is going through the same process of blood tests, ECGs and health checks. For each transplant operation, two people on the transplant list are called in. One is a primary recipient, the other a backup. Both are evaluated to establish the best match for the precious organs. Staff do their best to ensure the patients don’t meet. A transplant could be derailed for many reasons. The donated organs may be in poor condition, they may not suit the recipient, or the patient might have an underlying illness. Something as innocent as a mild cold could be enough to halt the process.     It’s the tail end of 2018, and the last time Emma was on the ward was August. That time, she was carrying too much weight for the operation to go ahead safely. As on previous occasions, hopes had been raised, only to be dashed. When we meet her, she is downbeat, exhausted, her eyes puffy and smudged with dark rings. Emotionally, she seems flat - wrung-out and resigned. “When you know you’ve got to go home and carry on living the life you’re living, it’s hard,” she says. “How long can I carry on like this for? You go home and have a little cry out loud, and then you have one to yourself. You build your hopes up, and then nothing comes out of it.” Coming to the hospital full of hope, only to be sent home after hours of waiting, disappointed and frustrated, is taking its toll. Emma is on tenterhooks every day, hoping for the call. “After a year and a half, everyone else gets excited for you. ‘Oh yeah, you’ll get it this time,’ they say. But the more excited you get, the more of a fall you are going to have.” After all this waiting, will this finally be Emma’s time?     Shortly after 05:00, it is decided who will receive the organs. Once again, it will not be Emma. Her weight is fine, but surgeons have looked at the organs and feel they are a better match for the other patient. By this time, Emma is dozing on a bed on the ward. Staff decide it is kinder to let her sleep a little while longer, before gently breaking the news to her. Despite the counselling patients receive, and the compassion of the staff who have to break the bad news, it’s tough to take. “You just think, ‘Back to square one, start all over again.’ And then you think, ‘Can I do this again? Can I keep doing this?’” Emma’s wait for a suitable donor continues, but the strain is becoming unbearable. And all the time the 38-year-old’s health is slowly failing. Her kidney function - a measure of how her organs are coping - is about just 7%. Time is running out.         It’s the tail end of 2018, and the last time Emma was on the ward was August.

Can I keep doing this?’” Emma’s wait for a suitable donor continues but the strain is becoming unbearable. And all the time the 38-year-old’s health is slowly failing. Her kidney function - a measure of how her organs are coping - is about just 7%. Time is running out.      Emma has type 1 diabetes. About 8% of people in the UK with diabetes have type 1. She was first diagnosed at the age of 10, the age her daughter is now. Emma had been feeling unwell but when her mother phoned the family doctor, she was told it was probably just a bug. “It got to the third day and I was very poorly.” Emma’s blood-sugar levels had soared, and when the doctor came out to see her, he said she needed to go to hospital straight away. “In the space of a couple of weeks, I lost a couple of stone in hospital and the doctor said I was close to being in a coma.”   That was the beginning of a life that would eventually be dominated by type 1 diabetes. It’s a condition that is not caused by diet or lifestyle, and despite years of research, it is still not clear why it happens. But it has a profound effect on the lives of those who have it. After being diagnosed, Emma needed to take insulin and to be very careful about what she ate, and when. And like many of those diagnosed not far off their teenage years, it was a real struggle. “You want to do what everyone else is doing. You want to go out, you want to enjoy life. You don’t tend to think, ‘I need to get up, I need to take my insulin, I need to eat the right food.’ That’s the last thing on your mind. You want to fit in.” With type 1, the body attacks the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, the hormone that allows glucose in our blood to enter our body’s cells and provide us with fuel. The body still breaks down the carbohydrates in food and drink to glucose - or sugars - which enter the bloodstream, but in the absence of insulin these sugars have nowhere to go. The glucose builds up and over a prolonged period can damage the heart, eyes, feet and kidneys. By the time she reached her 20s, Emma was struggling. Her eyesight was affected and her weight had shot up to about 19 stone (121kg). Perhaps most seriously, her kidneys were under pressure, compounded by a series of infections. A gastric bypass helped get her weight under control and eased the strain on her kidneys, but gradually their performance started to deteriorate once again. Emma’s kidneys were in a bad way by the time she was in her late 30s. But with type 1 diabetes, simply having a kidney transplant would be only a temporary measure. She needed a new pancreas as well, so that her body could start producing the insulin it needed on its own. Without the pancreas, any new kidneys would just become damaged in the same way. Emma manages to hold down a 40-hour-a-week job as an office administrator,  despite the gruelling process of dialysis that now dominates her life. She started doing what is known as peritoneal dialysis in May 2017. It’s a process that helps her failing kidneys flush out the waste products from her body.   It involves her attaching a tube to a valve fitted in her stomach wall. The tube is then attached to a machine that pumps fluid into her stomach, causing it to swell up. “You feel your stomach getting bigger and bigger, because your peritoneal cavity is at the front of your stomach.” It makes moving around uncomfortable and sleeping difficult, she says. “It’s like you’ve eaten too much and you can’t move. You’ve got to try to sleep with that feeling. [Then] it drains out and starts again. You’ll have that feeling all night.” The fluid is then flushed out through another hose that trails across her bedroom floor and into the bathroom, where it empties into the toilet. The process is repeated four or five times a night - 10 litres of fluid altogether.      There is also a lot of infection control that needs to be done. Everything has to be cleaned with anti-bacterial wipes to make sure no germs get introduced. The machine makes a swooshing sound as it flushes the fluid in and out of Emma’s body. It will often sound an alarm during the night - if the hose gets a kink when Emma rolls over in her sleep, for example. It is an exhausting process. “I can’t remember the last time I had a decent night’s sleep,” says Emma.    “And then sometimes you just sit down and shout. And you’re like, ‘I’m shouting at a machine.’ You just get so annoyed with it. It just goes on and on.” There are also significant logistical challenges to carrying out dialysis at home. Emma must make sure she has adequate stocks of all the fluid packs, sterile wipes and other bits of kit that she uses every night. In her new-build house on a modern estate in Cheshire, an entire room is given over to storing the things she needs. But without dialysis, her kidneys will fail.   Emma relies heavily on her husband Lee to do the washing, cleaning and cooking. Her brother and sister are also available to help out. She does, however, try to do the school run in the morning before going to work - even though it means waking up really early to allow the fluid to drain from her body first. “My daughter’s been late a couple of times because I’ve just been stuck on my machine.” After a day at work, fighting off exhaustion, Emma struggles to fit in any family time. “I pick my daughter up, come back home and then go to bed for about four hours. Then I’ll get up for about an hour. I’ll prepare my machine and then I will plug up and I’ll go back to sleep. Some nights I may sit up for a couple of hours.”   Emma worries that managing her condition means that her daughter is missing out on things. But there is a deeper, nagging anxiety - that her daughter might have inherited diabetes. “My niece got it when she was 10, so it seems to be hereditary. You do think, ‘Is my child going to get this?’ I’ve always tried to keep her active. And you do try to push [the message], ‘Treat your body well, so you don’t end up like your mum.’” The dialysis, the phone calls, the waiting, the gnawing worry over her daughter. There is no escape. “I think I’m just existing. I’m not living. And it does get soul destroying, doing it day in and day out.” Dialysis will keep Emma going, but she is running out of road. Kidneys that are functioning at just 7% are not a long-term option. On average, a 35-year-old with diabetes and kidney failure stands to see their life shortened by about 25 years. Emma needs that transplant.   We first met Emma on a bright autumn afternoon in November 2017, when she had been on the organ transplant waiting list for just three months. At the time, she was one of 175 people in the UK waiting for both a pancreas and kidney. But they are just a small element of the wider UK organ waiting list. Each year about 6,000 people have their lives put on hold for want of a replacement heart, kidney, liver, lungs or bowel. Patients like Emma - who need a simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplant - have an average wait of just under a year. For those needing other organs, it can be much longer - an average of 706 days for a kidney and 1,085 for a non-urgent heart transplant - and many don’t make it. About 400 people die each year while waiting for an organ, with more than 700 a year taken off the list because they are no longer well enough for a transplant. So with more patients in need than organs on offer, how is the decision made to give those life-saving donations? It’s not just the people who have waited the longest. A range of complex medical and biological factors weigh in, most notably regarding the body’s immune system. Its job is to seek out and destroy foreign organisms - a welcome function when talking about bacteria or other pathogens, but a problem when an organ is being transferred from one person into another. The key to a successful transplant is finding a donor who is as biologically similar to the recipient as possible. Crucial to that match is a collection of markers on the outside of nearly all of our cells - HLAs (Human Leukocyte Antigens). They are like little flags that tell our immune systems which cells belong in our bodies and which don’t. An identical line-up of HLAs is extremely unlikely, but in kidney transplants, for example, doctors like to match at least a third of the key HLAs to be more confident of success. When Emma joined the transplant list, her blood group and HLA profile were put on file. Since then, every time a kidney and pancreas was donated, the blood group and HLA profile of the donor were compared to Emma’s. This and other factors - such as time on the waiting list, age difference between the donor and recipient, the rarity of HLA profile, and whether a patient’s immune system has developed antibodies to certain tissue types - all form part of the regularly revised algorithm that is used to match donor to recipient. When a new organ becomes available, the UK transplant computer system, rather than a human, combs through all those data points to produce the closest, and fairest, match. That search takes in the whole of the UK, which means organs could be matched to patients anywhere in the four nations, even though there are differences in the way donation systems operate. Wales and Jersey have moved to an opt-out system, which means everyone is presumed to be a donor unless they state on the register that they don’t want to donate. Elsewhere, there is an opt-in system – people need to sign the organ donor register if they want to donate. But England and Scotland will also switch this year, and Guernsey and the Isle of Man have plans to follow later. Northern Ireland is sticking to opt-in. The jury is still out on whether this move to what is sometimes called “presumed consent” will increase the number of organs available for transplant, as families will still have the last word on whether donation goes ahead. But the disparity in the maths is clear - with about 6,000 patients on the waiting list and just 3,941 transplants from UK deceased donors going ahead in 2018, there are not enough donors to meet the need.     A key factor is whether a person dies in circumstances suitable for donation. It is a common misconception that someone can be a donor regardless of how they die, for example at the side of the road in a traffic accident. Because of the fragility of our organs, death needs to have occurred in a controlled environment. As soon as a heart stops beating, blood and oxygen cease circulating around the body and its organs begin to deteriorate. For a kidney, ideally there is a window of up to 18 hours to remove the organ from the donor, transport it and transplant it into the recipient. For the heart it is just four hours. So, every donor will have been on an intensive care unit. For about 40% of patients, death will come when their heart has stopped beating - following either cardiac arrest or a planned withdrawal of life support. But most donations are from patients who are “brain-dead” - having suffered such a severe injury to their brain that they have permanently lost the potential for consciousness and the capacity to breathe on their own. A series of tests is carried out over 30 minutes - often in front of the family - to confirm the diagnosis. They include shining a light in the donor’s eyes, trying to induce a gag reflex, and seeing whether they are able to breathe unaided. Brain death is confirmed if the patient fails to respond to all of these tests. Only about 1% of the 600,000 people who die each year in the UK do so under conditions that would enable the organs to be used. The pool is already small, but if you add in lack of awareness about the dying patient’s wishes, the numbers shrink further.  Donating a loved one’s organs - NHS intensive care staff show the BBC the test for brain stem death and how families are approached for organ donation  Under all UK laws, families have the final say on donation. Fewer than half consent if they are unaware of their deceased relative’s views. Nine in 10 agree to donate when they know it was what the person wanted. There are concerns among medics and patient groups that the change to the new system, where a patient is presumed to have consented, could foster the belief that there is no need to sign the organ donation register, leaving even more families uncertain of their relative’s wishes. The organisation in charge of organ donation - NHS Blood and Transplant - is clear that if you want to donate, it is vital you sign the register and share your wishes with your family.       The renal transplant unit at the Manchester Royal Infirmary is the busiest in the country, with more operations than any other hospital in the UK. At the heart of the process is a relatively small team of transplant co-ordinators. All are experienced nurses and they act as the bridge between the patients and the hospital. One of them is Brian Kelly, a 42-year-old softly spoken Irishman who radiates a kind of calm compassion. It is he, or one of his colleagues, who will phone patients like Emma and let them know that a potential donor has been identified and that they should come into hospital. They are also often the ones who have to tell them when a transplant is not going ahead. But Brian says it helps that each patient is given counselling when they go on the transplant list. “It’s actually OK, because we’ve pre-empted everything. When I call somebody on the phone, I always say there’s a ‘potential’ offer, and this may be a dry run.” Brian says that when a patient is called in and then sent home, it increases their chances of getting another call soon.    The MRI has about 900 people on its transplant list, most of whom are waiting for a single kidney rather than the dual transplant Emma needs. Only 500 or so are what is called “active”. Some patients may be on holiday, others may need a break for personal or health reasons. But every day there are fresh cases to manage. It may come as a surprise to know that some patients will receive more than one transplant over the course of a lifetime. Brian, who has been working with the team for more than a decade, says that while some patients have kidneys that have lasted 30 years or more, the average is only 10 to 12 years. So he is beginning to see patients who he cared for when he first started on the post-operative ward.    For Brian, what matters even more than all the logistics that he carries out every day, is that human contact with patients. But there is always the knowledge that some may not make it. “It’s very depressing sometimes. A couple of young people recently passed away while waiting on the list. And someone came around for another transplant - a woman in her 30s. We knew the family, we saw her here for her first transplant, and unfortunately she passed away. “But [there have been] more highs than lows, without a doubt. Over the past 10 years, I have seen many people who have done so, so well, and who recognise and appreciate what we’ve done. “I think about the donors, as well. They’re not all people that have led very full lives. A lot of them are very young, and you are just very grateful.”      It’s a curious thing but most transplants seem to take place at night, or at least in the early hours of the morning. We are told this is when the operating theatres are most likely to be free for what can be long and complicated procedures. Just 10 days after Emma was last called in, only to be sent home again, she is back at the MRI on another cold, dark winter’s night. Once more she has packed a bag, said goodbye to Lee and her daughter, and headed off alone, unsure of what lies ahead. This is the 14th time she has been called with news of a potential donor. In contrast to the last time she was here, she is brighter and definitely more upbeat. Blood tests are under way to make sure she is in good health. There is a feeling that this time, things may be moving in the right direction. And soon the news Emma has been waiting for comes. Out there in the darkness, an ambulance is making its way through the rain towards Manchester, carrying with it a precious cargo of donor organs. At about 04:20 they arrive, the flashing blue light of the ambulance illuminating an otherwise deserted, rainswept hospital forecourt. The organs are taken quickly up to the transplant unit in what looks like a cool box. Forms are signed and the organs officially checked in at 04:26.   There are still a few hurdles to clear. The surgical team needs to be sure that the organs are a good match for Emma. Doctors also want to have a good look at the state they are in. Nearly two hours are spent delicately examining and repairing the kidney and pancreas. Extracting them from the donor can cause some damage. This time, there is intricate stitching to be done. Each organ sits in fluid in a shallow bowl, bathed by a pool of light from the bright surgical lamps that hang from the ceiling. Three doctors are hunched over them, talking to each other in low, controlled voices.         The whole procedure is overseen by consultant surgeon Raman Dhanda, who has been working for more than 15 years in transplant surgery. He feels the pancreas is the biggest cause for concern.      “It has quite a complex blood supply and we have to ensure that there’s no damage, and the blood vessels are properly reconstructed,” he says. “It’s a delicate organ by nature, so the main risk with the pancreas is the development of inflammation, a condition called pancreatitis. The more you touch it, the more likely the patient is going to get pancreatitis. “So we try not to touch it, but at the same time prepare it in a way that there are the fewest risk factors associated with the organs themselves.” There is less demand for the pancreas than other organs. The waiting list is one of the shorter ones, with just 250 people as of April 2019.  So with nearly 500 pancreases donated each year, you would expect the list to be cleared pretty quickly. But given how easily damaged it can become, more than half never make it into a patient. This means just 204 organs were transplanted in 2018, while about the same number of new patients joined the queue. Most people know what to expect when they see a kidney. Human kidneys are not that different, at least in external appearance, from those you might see in a butcher’s window. The pancreas resembles what you might imagine an alien from another world could look like – vaguely triangular, sort of ruffled around the edges, slightly bobbly, a creamy grey colour as it sits in its bowl of fluid. Eventually Dhanda is satisfied and the news is good. The organs look healthy. Emma is prepped for surgery.    It’s just after 06:00 when she goes into the operating theatre. Two anaesthetists check Emma’s vital signs to make sure she is unconscious but stable. Dhanda is there with two surgeon colleagues. Emma has been warned there is a risk she may not survive the surgery if something goes wrong. But the team is confident, calm, efficient. Surgeons begin what will turn out to be an operation lasting more than four and a half hours. The first incision into Emma’s abdomen is made at about 07:45.

The first incision into Emma’s abdomen is made at about 07:45.              “It’s a complex operation,” says Dhanda. “But it’s enjoyable because it needs a lot of surgical skills. Most of the time whilst you’re doing the operation, you’re just thinking about the benefit the patient is going to get straight away. “I’m very passionate about it. This operation is one of the most beautiful operations we can actually perform because it’s very different from other surgeries. You are giving something to the patient, rather than removing abnormal or pathological organs from a patient. At the time you’re just concentrating on getting the pancreas in right, as quickly as possible.”         The new organs will sit in the body alongside Emma’s existing ones. It takes a few hours to get to the point when they can be transplanted. First, the pancreas goes in, lifted carefully from its bed of ice. The tension in the room rises. This is a crucial moment. If the pancreas retains its creamy grey colour, something has gone wrong. There is palpable relief when, at about 09:20, the pancreas quickly turns a rosy pink, showing that blood is flowing through the organ as it should.       “It’s a complex operation,” says Dhanda. “But it’s quite an enjoyable because it needs a lot of surgical skills.

There is palpable relief when, at about 09:20, the pancreas quickly turns a rosy pink, showing that blood is flowing through the organ as it should.        Dhanda is pleased. “The patient is not requiring any insulin. The blood sugars are already falling. We would like [the pancreas] to be salmon pink, which you can see it is, so you can see it is functioning really well.”  The kidney is transplanted next. It will be a few hours before the operation is complete and Emma is taken to the intensive care unit, where she will spend several days recovering.   While the operation itself was a success, Emma experiences some complications. The new kidney is a bit reluctant to start working properly and there is a suspected bleed in her abdomen that involves a second investigative operation. She spends much longer in hospital than was originally expected and her recovery is long and slow. But essentially she has been cured - at least for the moment - of the type 1 diabetes that has plagued her life for nearly 20 years.   We catch up with Emma in the spring of 2019 in a park near her house. Although she is still recovering and is moving a little gingerly, the change in her is immediately obvious. “It’s been a long recovery,” she says. “But every day it has got better. Like any big operation, it’s a shock to the system. But in the long term, it’s going to be worth it.” And the diabetes is now a thing of the past, although it has left her with a legacy of poor eyesight and problems with her feet. As long as her new pancreas lasts, Emma can live a much more normal life. “I do feel like somebody that isn’t diabetic. Obviously, I’ve got complications that are hard because of the diabetes. Hopefully, I should get at least 10 years out of it. But sometimes things do last longer, sometimes shorter.”       Emma will have to take immunosuppressants - drugs to ensure her body doesn’t reject the transplanted organs - for the rest of her life. But so far, things are going well. She is gradually picking up the threads of her life and has been thinking about doing some of the things that her condition had made impossible. When we first met in 2017, one of the things that obviously weighed heavily on Emma was the impact on her family. So what about now? “I’ve got plans. I’d like to go on holiday and just live my life, instead of just existing. So now there’s nothing to stop me doing anything that I want to do - holidays, further my career, do something that I’ve not been able to do. “I want more time with my daughter. I can take her for her dance exams and things like that, which I wasn’t doing before.” Emma still needs to be careful about what she eats. Her body is relying on one new kidney, and it is possible that her kidney function will start to decline again. Her gratitude to the team in Manchester is genuine and heartfelt. “They’ve definitely done a fantastic job. They’ve been there for me. I can’t fault them at all. They are such a lovely team. And very, very supportive.” But there is also the selfless decision by one donor and their family. That person’s death gave Emma the gift of a new life. She doesn’t know who that person was, but the hospital provides support to transplant patients so they can write to the donors’ families to express their gratitude. So does she think about them? “Oh God, of course I do. It’s a grieving process, obviously, for the donor’s family. When you’re in that situation and you’ve lost somebody, it’s hard to think about organ donation.” Emma will be living with the consequences of the transplant for years to come. But if it wasn’t for the donor whose life ended prematurely, Emma’s story would also have been over far too soon.

Man admits crushing boy to death,"Alfie Lamb died three days after he was crushed in the footwell of a car A man has admitted crushing a three-year-old boy to death by reversing his seat as the boy sat in a car footwell. Stephen Waterson, 26, killed Alfie Lamb - his girlfriend's son - in February 2018. Waterson initially denied manslaughter but changed his plea to guilty ahead of a retrial at the Old Bailey. In May, Alfie's mother Adrian Hoare - who watched as her son was crushed - was jailed fortwo years and nine months for child cruelty. Hoare was cleared of manslaughter while a jury failed to reach a verdict on the same charge for Waterson. The court had heard Waterson had been annoyed at Alfie's crying on a journey back from a shopping trip and moved his seat into him as he sat in the footwell at his mother's feet. Stephen Waterson admitted manslaughter by gross negligence When Alfie continued to moan, Waterson reversed again, saying, ""I won't be told what to do by a three-year-old,"" Hoare told jurors. Alfie collapsed in the car and died in hospital three days later from irreversible brain injuries. In their trial earlier this yearHoare, of Gravesend, Kent, told a string of lies to protect her boyfriend, claiming she had been in a taxi, while Waterson fled in the Audi. Det Ch Insp Simon Harding said: ""Stephen Waterson and Adrian Hoare, even after Alfie died, were more concerned about being together. ""Stephen Waterson was concerned the real story never came out. He went on to intimidate and assault people."" Three-year-old Alfie suffered irreversible brain injuries Waterson also gave officers a false name, a false statement and sold the Audi. Hoare eventually broke her silence and told her half-sister Ashleigh Jeffrey what happened in a taped conversation handed to police. Jurors were also told Waterson had three previous convictions for attacking an ex-girlfriend and his sister's husband. At a trial in February, Mr Waterson told the court he only moved his seat back an inch, before moving forwards again Waterson, the adopted son of former Conservative minister Nigel Waterson, admitted manslaughter by gross negligence on what was set to be the first day of his retrial. He was remanded in custody to be sentenced on 9 September. Det Ch Insp Harding said: ""For a three-and-a-half-year-old to be crushed by something so strong and no-one helping, it's a shocking way to die. ""Stephen Waterson has come across as a selfish, abhorrent individual"". Alfie's mother, Adrian Hoare, was cleared of manslaughter but jailed in May after being found guilty of child cruelty Angela Moriarty, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""This was a harrowing and difficult case for all those involved, but finally justice has been served for Alfie."" Speaking after the hearing police revealed social services had been involved in Alfie's care and that the Medway Safeguarding Children Board is conducting a serious case review.

Make-upâs big secret,"This video can not be played Emmy Burbidge is a make-up artist who runs her own beauty salon in Somerset, and wants to know where palm oil comes from and how it's made. Palm oil is used in 70% of cosmetic products, and Emmy says that her customers are increasingly asking whether it's in the products she's using. 20% of palm oil globally is certified as sustainable but it's also responsible for the loss of around 8% of the world's forests between 1990 and 2008. The 28-year-old travels to Papua New Guinea to discover the truth about what's in her make-up, and to find out whether there's a sustainable way of producing the oil used in making it.

Human rights body hit by eight budget cuts,"The ability of Northern Ireland's human rights watchdog to take legal cases is now severely restricted by repeated budget cuts, it has said. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission had to ask for a funding reprieve this year from the Northern Ireland Office in an attempt to bolster its finances. Its budget is just over Â£1.1m. It argues that this figure has been almost halved, in real terms, since 2010. Chief Commissioner Les Allamby said the commission has been operating within significant financial constraints. ""Within this budget, we are required to provide a range of public services including taking strategic legal cases, providing advice to government on critical issues such as Brexit, carrying out investigations as well as promotion and education,"" he told BBC News NI. ""Our ability to take strategic legal cases to challenge human rights violations is severely restricted by our budget."" Set up under the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) is an independent body funded by the government through the Northern Ireland Office (NIO). Among its functions is to initiate cases and provide legal assistance to individuals taking human rights legal challenges. It has 14 staff members, down from 32 in 2009. The body said that it has now faced eight annual cuts to its budget, with staff numbers reduced on four occasions. To maintain its current workforce,it warned in its annual report,external, published in July, that further reductions in its investigation and legal budgets were required. This, the organisation warned, would mean it would have to seek business case approvals from the NIO, on a case-by-case basis, to secure additional resources before supporting legal cases. Since then, the NIO has stepped in to provide a funding plug of about Â£79,000, BBC News NI understands. But the commission said its funding problem has not gone away. It said itsSupreme Court challenge to the law on abortion in Northern Ireland, which ran for more than five years, cost Â£225,000. The NIHRC lost a Supreme Court appeal over the legality of Northern Ireland's abortion law in 2018 Its successful Court of Appeal (NI) challenge to adoption law that discriminated against same sex couples ran for more than four years at a cost of Â£130,000. The commission said a budget of Â£1.63m in 2010 was considered necessary for it to effectively operate as envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement. When inflation is taken into account, it argues that its budget for 2019-20 should have been set at just over Â£2m. ""The organisation will continue to take a can-do practical approach to its mandate to protect and promote the human rights of everyone in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Allamby added. ""To do that, we need a decent financial platform. As a statutory public body, we are obliged to live within our means, nonetheless it would be remiss of us as an organisation not to highlight the difficulties we face in fully meeting our mandate."" In the 2018-2019 financial year, the commission said it received more than 400 enquiries from the public seeking assistance. The commission granted legal support to three individuals. The NIO told the BBC that it remained ""committed to the ongoing work"" of the commission.

'Get ready for Brexit' campaign launchesAn advertising campaign urging the public to prepare for Britain's exit from the EU begins.,"Adverts in national newspapers on Monday told the public to 'prepare' for Britain's exit from the EU An information campaign urging the public to ""get ready for Brexit"" has been launched by the government. The campaign began on Sunday with the launch of a website,gov.uk/brexit,external. Billboards and social media adverts will appear in the coming days and TV adverts will air later this month. Michael Gove, who is in charge of no-deal plans, said the adverts encourage ""shared responsibility"" for preparing to leave the EU on 31 October. It has been reported that the campaign could cost as much as Â£100m as ministers seek to inform people what they might need to do, if anything, ahead of the deadline. Meanwhile,it has emerged the EU is considering classifying no deal as a ""major disaster"",like an earthquake, in order to free up funds for countries affected. MPs 'will propose legislation' to stop no deal Will we see an early election? And other questions Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? Benedict Pringle, author of thepoliticaladvertising.co.uk,externalblog, said that, if true, the Â£100m budget would be roughly double what the National Lottery spends on advertising each year. ""So if you think about how often you see a lottery advert and double it, that's how much we could be seeing the campaign over the next two months,"" he told the BBC. ""At football grounds, in advert breaks for Coronation Street and The Great British Bake Off, this is where you'll get the biggest reach with the public."" This video can not be played Michael Gove: 'Everyone will have the food they need' An image showing one of the campaign's billboards was issued by the Cabinet Office ahead of their rollout this week. Leaflets, online seminars, and information stands at events will also be used. British citizens who are intending to travel to Europe and businesses which export to the EU are among the specific groups targeted by the campaign. The campaign encourages people and businesses to visit the government website to answer questions and receive advice on preparing for Brexit. The campaign includes an online questionnaire, which ends with advice specific to individuals' circumstances According to the campaign, some sections of society ""do not need to take any action"" to prepare for Brexit. People on that list are British citizens who both live and work in the UK, do not run a business and do not plan to travel abroad ""after 31 October 2019"". #GetReadyForBrexit was the fourth highest UK trend on Twitter on Monday morning. While some users welcomed the government's drive, the majority of tweets mocked either the campaign or Brexit itself. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Announcing the launch, Mr Gove said ensuring the UK left the EU in an orderly manner was ""not only a matter of national importance, but a shared responsibility"". Mr Gove was earlier criticised by a retail trade association for claiming there would be no shortages of fresh food in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The British Retail Consortium said Mr Gove's assertion on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that ""there will be no shortages of fresh food"" was ""categorically untrue"". The government has said it""cannot fully protect"",externalthe rights of UK nationals living in the EU, and that some Brits must apply to be a resident in the country they live in, if they want to stay there. Jane Golding, a lawyer based in Berlin who co-chairs an organisation called British in Europe, said a no-deal Brexit would lead to ""27 separate contingency plans"" in each of the remaining EU member states. This could mean a lack of co-ordination on healthcare and social security policies - while the uncertainty around being allowed to stay in their homes was causing ""a lot of anxiety"" for expats. Shetold Radio 4's Today programmethat the key principle in the citizens' rights negotiations was ""reciprocity"" - meaning the way EU citizens are treated in the UK will affect UK citizens in the EU. The French village that fears for its Brits Â£3m fund to help UK nationals with EU forms Brexit: How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Travel will remain visa free but working in more than one EU country will become complicated, she added. ""We are a very mobile population,"" she said.

The campaign began on Sunday with the launch of a website,gov.uk/brexit,external. Billboards and social media adverts will appear in the coming days and TV adverts will air later this month. Michael Gove, who is in charge of no-deal plans, said the adverts encourage ""shared responsibility"" for preparing to leave the EU on 31 October. It has been reported that the campaign could cost as much as Â£100m as ministers seek to inform people what they might need to do, if anything, ahead of the deadline. Meanwhile,it has emerged the EU is considering classifying no deal as a ""major disaster"",like an earthquake, in order to free up funds for countries affected. MPs 'will propose legislation' to stop no deal Will we see an early election? And other questions Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? Benedict Pringle, author of thepoliticaladvertising.co.uk,externalblog, said that, if true, the Â£100m budget would be roughly double what the National Lottery spends on advertising each year. ""So if you think about how often you see a lottery advert and double it, that's how much we could be seeing the campaign over the next two months,"" he told the BBC. ""At football grounds, in advert breaks for Coronation Street and The Great British Bake Off, this is where you'll get the biggest reach with the public."" This video can not be played Michael Gove: 'Everyone will have the food they need' An image showing one of the campaign's billboards was issued by the Cabinet Office ahead of their rollout this week. Leaflets, online seminars, and information stands at events will also be used. British citizens who are intending to travel to Europe and businesses which export to the EU are among the specific groups targeted by the campaign. The campaign encourages people and businesses to visit the government website to answer questions and receive advice on preparing for Brexit. The campaign includes an online questionnaire, which ends with advice specific to individuals' circumstances According to the campaign, some sections of society ""do not need to take any action"" to prepare for Brexit. People on that list are British citizens who both live and work in the UK, do not run a business and do not plan to travel abroad ""after 31 October 2019"". #GetReadyForBrexit was the fourth highest UK trend on Twitter on Monday morning. While some users welcomed the government's drive, the majority of tweets mocked either the campaign or Brexit itself. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Announcing the launch, Mr Gove said ensuring the UK left the EU in an orderly manner was ""not only a matter of national importance, but a shared responsibility"". Mr Gove was earlier criticised by a retail trade association for claiming there would be no shortages of fresh food in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The British Retail Consortium said Mr Gove's assertion on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that ""there will be no shortages of fresh food"" was ""categorically untrue"". The government has said it""cannot fully protect"",externalthe rights of UK nationals living in the EU, and that some Brits must apply to be a resident in the country they live in, if they want to stay there. Jane Golding, a lawyer based in Berlin who co-chairs an organisation called British in Europe, said a no-deal Brexit would lead to ""27 separate contingency plans"" in each of the remaining EU member states. This could mean a lack of co-ordination on healthcare and social security policies - while the uncertainty around being allowed to stay in their homes was causing ""a lot of anxiety"" for expats. Shetold Radio 4's Today programmethat the key principle in the citizens' rights negotiations was ""reciprocity"" - meaning the way EU citizens are treated in the UK will affect UK citizens in the EU. The French village that fears for its Brits Â£3m fund to help UK nationals with EU forms Brexit: How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Travel will remain visa free but working in more than one EU country will become complicated, she added. ""We are a very mobile population,"" she said.

Factory output 'falls at fastest pace since 2012',"Activity in the UK's manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace for seven years in August, a closely-watched survey has suggested. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the global economic downturn were some of the factors hitting firms, according to the survey from IHS Markit/CIPS. The purchasing managers' index (PMI) produced by IHS Markit/CIPS,externalfell to 47.4 in August, down from 48 in July. A figure below 50 indicates the sector is contracting. New orders fell at the fastest pace for seven years, and business confidence fell to its lowest level since the survey first began to track the measure in 2012. ""High levels of economic and political uncertainty alongside ongoing global trade tensions stifled the performance of UK manufacturers in August,"" said Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit. ""The global economic slowdown was the main factor weighing on new work received from Europe, the USA and Asia. ""There was also a further impact from some EU-based clients routing supply chains away from the UK due to Brexit."" The UK economy contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter of the year- the first time it has shrunk since 2012. If the economy contracts in the current July-to-September period, then it will deemed to be in recession as it will have shrunk for two quarters in a row. Mr Dobson said the PMI survey's results suggested the manufacturing sector - which accounts for about 20% of the UK's economy - was contracting at a quarterly pace of ""close to 2%"". However, Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said that could be too pessimistic. ""With the CIPS surveys tending to be overly sensitive to political uncertainty and carmakers maintaining production in August (having brought their annual summer shutdowns forward this year), the sector's performance is unlikely to be that grim,"" he said. ""But with global and domestic headwinds showing no sign of easing, the remainder of 2019 is set to remain a difficult period for manufacturers."" Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said that while the latest PMI survey was weak, ""we still doubt that manufacturing will pull the economy as a whole into recession"".

"Hundreds of steel jobs could go at Newport plantThe factory, which makes electrical steel for the power industry, has been for sale for 16 months.Wales","Up to 380 jobs could be lost at the plant Hundreds of jobs could go with the closure of a Tata steel plant in Newport. There has been a factory at the site since 1898 but Orb Electrical Steels has not been in profit for four years. Up to 380 jobs could go although Tata hope to offer jobs elsewhere in Wales. The factory, which makes electrical steel used in power transmission, was put up for sale in May 2018, with Tata wanting to concentrate on its core steel business. Tata Steel's European operations head Henrik Adam said: ""I recognise how difficult this news will be for all those affected and we will work very hard to support them."" Unions said Tata - which employs nearly 6,000 workers in Wales - was breaking its commitments over job guarantees. Orb Electrical Steels is part of Tata's Cogent division, part of which is being sold to the Japanese steel company JFE Shoji Trade Corporation. Tata is also closing its Wolverhampton Engineering Steels service centre, with up to 26 jobs at risk. Tata said it would have cost Â£50m to upgrade the Orb site to make it competitive The Orb site makes electrical steel used in generators, transformers, motors and magnetic products, including for the car industry. But the sector has been suffering from over-capacity over the last 10 years, and struggling to compete in particular with big volume producers in China. ""This business is the smallest volume electrical steel manufacturer in the world - and we've only been able to make a profit in two of the last 10 years and no profit in the last four years,"" Tor Farquhar, Tata Steel Europe's HR director, told BBC Wales. Meanwhile, converting the Orb plant would have cost Tata more than Â£50m. Mr Adam added: ""Continuing to fund substantial losses at Orb Electrical Steels is not sustainable at a time when the European steel industry is facing considerable challenges."" But he said workers would be offered alternative employment at other Tata sites in Wales where possible and consultations with staff and unions would start shortly. Factory output 'falls at fastest pace for seven years' Tata plant with 350 workers up for sale Is steel-making still important to the Welsh economy? Paul Horton, a Community union official at the plant, said there had been an agreement for no compulsory job losses until 2021 One of the plant's union officials Paul Horton, who has nearly 37 years experience, said it would mean a loss of well-paid jobs in the area, with workers earning up to Â£40,000, with overtime on top. ""We weren't expecting anything this severe, this quickly,"" he said. ""We understand the business has been struggling but there has been no inkling of this happening over the last few weeks."" This video can not be played Jason Sims, Matthew Grande and Paul Spencer have 55 years experience at Orb behind them Jason Sims, who has worked at the plant for 13 years, said: ""It's sad news. Everyone's in a bit of shock at the moment, trying to take it in."" He said there was a lot of uncertainty whether there would be offers of work in Port Talbot or Llanwern. Matthew Grande said news had been leaking out since Sunday and they had to work with a ""massive cloud hanging over our heads. We're gutted and devastated to be honest with you"". He said it was like a family firm, with everyone knowing each other and ""more or less growing up together"". Paul Spencer, with 22 years at the plant behind him, said he hoped there would be jobs at the end of it. ""There have been rumours for about 12 months on and off, but when go to the meeting this morning, it's real, your stomach sinks."" Orb was privatised from British Steel 30 years ago Unite's Tata official Tony Brady said Orb's closure would be a ""body blow"" for the economy of Wales. ""Unite will be fighting for every job and holding Tata Steel's feet to the fire over assurances that workers affected by today's announcement will be redeployed."" He said the union would not sit back and allow ""decent well-paid jobs and irreplaceable skills to go to the wall"". Roy Rickhuss of the Community steelworkers' union called it ""shocking"" news which ""makes a mockery of the understanding we reached with Tata around the jobs guarantee"". ""There has been no consultation about this proposal either at UK or European level and company management should hang their heads in shame in the way this has come about,"" he said. ""This is of course extremely devastating news for workers at the Orb, but all Tata Steel workers should be concerned by the way Tata is breaking its commitments."" He called for government intervention. The Newport transporter bridge was opened in 1906 to help workers reach the plant There has been steelmaking on the Newport site since 1898, when the old Lysaght company moved from Wolverhampton. The famous city landmark, the transporter bridge, was built a few years later to carry workers across to the works. It eventually became part of British Steel and then European Electrical Steels in 1991. Cogent took over in 2001. There have been concerns for the future of Tata's Cogent operation for a few months, ever since it was put up for sale. Cogenthad been put up for sale by Tata in May last yearafter the Indian owners had decided to concentrate on its core steel production business, as it planned to merge with the German company Thyssenkrupp. Given Cogent's specialism, it was hoped that a buyer could be found, but unions said at the time they were not persuaded by the case for a sale. They had privately been growing increasingly concerned about the future of the plant. This decision could set Tata and the unions on an even bigger collision course. As part of the unions' agreement to support less generous pensions, they believe Tata committed to no compulsory redundancies until 2026. Tata has always maintained that it committed to try to avoid compulsory redundancies. Unions could see this as breaching a commitment to its entire Welsh workforce, and industrial action could be possible, they say. Economy Minister Ken Skates said he stressed the importance in talks with the company of avoiding compulsory redundancies. ""The Welsh Government will now do everything it can to support individuals, the community and the supply chain affected by this announcement,"" he added. ""Today's news clearly demonstrates the fragility of the global steel market and the UK government must now step up and broaden its approach to supporting the industry, including its supply chain, across the whole of the UK."" The UK government said it was in regular contact with the company, unions and other partners and was taking ""wide-ranging action to support the industry"". A spokesman said: ""We have a long and proud history of steelmaking excellence and the UK government is committed to supporting a modern and vibrant steel sector."" Newport East MP Jessica Morden said job losses would be ""devastating news"" for workers and families.Â ""What is particularly tragic is that this, the only UK plant with the potential to produce electric steels for motors and with investment, vision and government backing this could be the key part of the supply chain for electric vehicles,"" she said.

""This is further evidence of why it's more important than ever to have the clearest possible focus on the threats facing us, and the opportunities that need to be sought out at this time of unprecedented uncertainty.""

"Teacher starting salaries could rise to Â£30,000","Starting salaries for teachers in England could rise by up to Â£6,000 under new government plans. The Department for Education said the move would make new teachers' salaries -set to rise to Â£30,000 by 2022-23,external- ""among the most competitive"" in the graduate labour market. Unions say the increase is long overdue, and necessary, to attract enough graduates into the profession. The proposal is the latest education announcement by the government. On Friday,a multi-billion pound cash boost was promised for schools in Englandover the next three years, while Chancellor Sajid Javid also pledged to invest an extra Â£400m into further education for 16 to 19-year-olds. Schools face 'severe' teacher shortage Teachers to be offered cash to stay in school Ministers signal 2% pay cap for teachers The minimum salary for teachers in England and Wales, excluding London, is currently Â£23,720, according tothe government's Get Into Teaching website.,external The minimum for inner London is Â£29,664. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the proposed increase to teachers' starting salaries was ""fundamentally necessary"" if the government was going to get enough graduates to choose teaching. She said: ""Teacher training targets have been missed for six years in a row, and this announcement may go some way to making teaching more attractive."" However, she said it did not address the issue of retaining experienced teachers, adding that almost half of teachers in England leave the profession within 10 years. The DfE said the investment announced by the prime minister last week would ensure that ""pay can be increased for all teachers"". I'll quit before my job kills me - teacher Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will set out his proposal to increase teachers' starting salaries in a letter to the School Teachers' Review Body, asking for their recommendations.

Bahamas battered by 'monster' Hurricane Dorian,"This video can not be played ""We need help"": Video shows missing roofs and flooded roads The most powerful storm to hit the Bahamas since records began has torn off roofs and caused severe flooding. The slow-moving, category five Dorian - the second-strongest Atlantic hurricane on record - is now packing sustained winds of up to 165mph (270km/h) and may cause a storm surge of up to 23ft (7m). There is no official word on casualties but the Red Cross fears some 13,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. The hurricane is moving slowly west, with the eastern US coast at risk. The US states of Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina have all declared states of emergency. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that at 10:00 GMT,external, Dorian was moving very slowly through Grand Bahama, having made landfall earlier on the Abaco islands, which are just to the east. Both chains are in the north of the Bahamas archipelago. Grand Bahama, with a population of about 50,000, is only 100km (60 miles) east of West Palm Beach in Florida. Residents share images of devastation How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Are you in the affected region? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Dorian is travelling west at just over 1mph (2km/h). The NHC said the hurricane would ""continue to pound Grand Bahama Island"" through much of the day and evening on Monday. There was little information overnight from the affected Bahamas islands amid power cuts and limited internet access. However, video and tweets posted by Latrae Rahming, a former aide to ex-PM Perry Christie, showed severe damage on the Abaco Islands, home to about 17,000 people, where landfall was first made with sustained winds close to 185mph. Cars have been flipped over and roofs torn off. Mr Rahming told the BBC it was as though a tornado had swept through Marsh Harbour on the Abacos, with a surge as high as a two-storey building bringing intense flooding. He said he feared for one shanty town area that houses about 1,500 people. One video as the storm hit the Abacos carried a desperate plea for help: Allow Twitter content?

High winds and torrential rainfall have also struck Grand Bahama.The Tribune website reports that Grand Bahama International Airport,externalis said to be under water. Kristoff Ayala-Strachan, a blogger in Freeport on Grand Bahama, told the BBC he had stacked up on supplies and shuttered the windows, and was expecting the storm to last at least two days. The 24 year old said this was his eighth major hurricane. This video can not be played Matt Taylor presents an update on Hurricane Dorian Joy Jibrilu, director general of the Ministry of Tourism and Aviation, said on Sunday afternoon: ""It's devastating. There has been huge damage to property and infrastructure. Luckily, no loss of life reported."" However,Eyewitness News later carried an interview with a grandmother,externalwho said her eight-year-old grandson had drowned on the Abaco Islands. The government has opened 14 shelters and namesdozens of churches, schools and other buildings,externalon its official lists of emergency shelters. But as sites become full, there is concern that people will be forced to take refuge in other places that aren't listed to receive food and water from the government. The country is one of those most regularly hit by hurricanes, and homes are required to be reinforced to withstand the winds of a category four storm. An image from social media of Marsh Harbour in the Abaco Islands Prime Minister Hubert Minnis did announce an evacuation order for parts of Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands. All tourists were asked to leave. But officials expressed dismay that some people had chosen to stay. Mr Minnis said: ""I can only say to them, that I hope this is not the last time they will hear my voice and may God be with them."" The visibly upset prime minister said in a news conference on Sunday: ""This is probably the most sad and worst day of my life. We're facing a hurricane... that we've never seen in the history of the Bahamas."" Although Dorian is currently heading westwards, it is forecast to make a gradual turn north or north-west, taking it along the eastern US seaboard, making its landfall point, if any, uncertain. The NHC said that Dorian's slow weakening would continue, but it would remain ""a powerful hurricane during the next couple of days"" and would ""move dangerously close to the Florida east coast"" on Monday night through to Wednesday evening. President Donald Trump cancelled a planned trip to Poland last week and has met emergency management officials. He told reporters on Sunday that the storm ""looks monstrous"" and the US east coast would ""be ultimately impacted and some of it very, very severely"". Dorian has grown larger in size, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 45 miles (75km) from the storm's centre. President Trump has issued a federal state of emergency for Florida, and the state's governor, Ron DeSantis, has activated 2,000 National Guard troops, with another 2,000 on standby. Mr DeSantis warned people not to be complacent following the change in the storm's predicted path.  ""This storm at this magnitude could really cause massive destruction,"" he said. Capital: Nassau Population391,000 Area13,939 sq km (5,382 sq miles) Major languageEnglish Major religionChristianity Life expectancy72 years (men), 78 years (women) CurrencyBahamian dollar Popular attractions, including Disney World in Orlando, have said they are ""closely monitoring"" the storm. Miami has ordered the removal of electric rental scooters from the streets to avoid them becoming projectiles. South Carolina on Sunday issued a mandatory evacuation of the entire coast, effective of noon on Monday and affecting 830,000 people. Georgia then followed suit. Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes. Although 2018 was the third year in a row of above-average storms in the Atlantic season, years can vary widely. However, many do believe climate change is affecting the severity of the storms. This is for two main reasons. Firstly, an increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump. Then there is the issue of rising sea levels. They are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms. The warming world is also making storms more sluggish. Over the past seven decades tropical events have slowed, for example going 20-30% less quickly over land in North America. Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

'PCs taken off beat for mental health calls',"Mark Collins said police should not be responsible for ""lower level calls"" Supporting mental health patients can occupy police officers for ""10 to 12 hours"" before doctors can make an assessment, a chief constable has said. Specialist support for mental health-related calls costs Welsh police Â£1.2m a year - but Mark Collins said a ""true cost"" is the loss of PCs on the beat. ""All the time we are dealing with mental health matters we are taking officers off the street,"" he said. ""We are sometimes conveying people 60 miles one way and getting delayed. ""So that's a 120-miles round trip and, in fact, sometimes we're sat there waiting for doctors to come for sometimes 10 to 12 hours."" Police 'dealing with more mental health incidents' Meet the London's first 'mental health' police unit Mental health dominates armed police time Dyfed-Powys Police chief constable Mr Collins, who leads on mental health and policing for the National Police Chiefs' Council, said officers should always respond in an emergency but should not be responsible for ""lower level calls"" The Welsh Government said it spent more on mental health services than on any other part of the NHS. All four police forces in Wales, whose combined budget is around Â£600m, use specialist mental health-trained staff in their call centres or in triage teams that attend mental health-related incidents. But the true cost of the police hours spent on mental health-related incidents would be much higher. In January,the South Wales Police chief constable said police were often ""plugging a gap""despite not being the most appropriate service to support those suffering a mental health crisis. Lowri Smith says police are not the right people to be giving her support ""Very rarely there will be a crime related to a mental health call,"" added Mr Collins. ""When someone is threatening to harm themselves or someone else, of course we should be deployed - but we are regularly filling in for routine crisis and community care calls where there is not the capacity within the NHS."" Lowri Smith, 29, from Cardiff, said police have been sent to her home five times in the past three years when she has called her local NHS mental health service out of hours. She said while the police do the best job they can, they are not the right people to be giving her support. ""It can make a situation worse,"" she said. ""Quite often when I have been in crisis I have shut down, I won't speak to them, I go very quiet, because the police coming to your house can be seen as quite threatening."" On one occasion, officers were accompanied by a specialist mental health nurse. ""It was quite helpful to talk to someone in that field... it's a lot more helpful to see someone face to face,"" she said. A spokesperson for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: ""Patients that are under the care and support of the crisis team have individualised care plans in place dependent on their needs and there are mechanisms in place to support people out of hours."" Helen Bennett says similar schemes in England have been very successful Helen Bennett is a former mental health nurse who now works with the Welsh mental health charity Hafal. She has been involved with a trial putting two mental health nurses in the South Wales Police control room. ""They will be patched into calls, speak to officers who are out with individuals and they may well speak to those individuals as well,"" she said. ""They will be assessing over the telephone and advising police officers... they also link in with crisis teams, community mental health teams, third sector charities, local authorities... to make sure the outcome for the individual is a joined-up process.

"Teacher starting salaries could rise to Â£30,000Unions say the increase is long overdue, and necessary, to attract graduates into the profession.Family & Education","Starting salaries for teachers in England could rise by up to Â£6,000 under new government plans. The Department for Education said the move would make new teachers' salaries -set to rise to Â£30,000 by 2022-23,external- ""among the most competitive"" in the graduate labour market. Unions say the increase is long overdue, and necessary, to attract enough graduates into the profession. The proposal is the latest education announcement by the government. On Friday,a multi-billion pound cash boost was promised for schools in Englandover the next three years, while Chancellor Sajid Javid also pledged to invest an extra Â£400m into further education for 16 to 19-year-olds. Schools face 'severe' teacher shortage Teachers to be offered cash to stay in school Ministers signal 2% pay cap for teachers The minimum salary for teachers in England and Wales, excluding London, is currently Â£23,720, according tothe government's Get Into Teaching website.,external The minimum for inner London is Â£29,664. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the proposed increase to teachers' starting salaries was ""fundamentally necessary"" if the government was going to get enough graduates to choose teaching. She said: ""Teacher training targets have been missed for six years in a row, and this announcement may go some way to making teaching more attractive."" However, she said it did not address the issue of retaining experienced teachers, adding that almost half of teachers in England leave the profession within 10 years. The DfE said the investment announced by the prime minister last week would ensure that ""pay can be increased for all teachers"". I'll quit before my job kills me - teacher Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will set out his proposal to increase teachers' starting salaries in a letter to the School Teachers' Review Body, asking for their recommendations.

Eco-community land 'to be sold' when lease ends,"This video can not be played Brithdir Mawr's land and buildings will be sold when the 15-year lease ends in December An eco-community will have to raise Â£1m or leave after being told its land and buildings will be sold when the lease ends in December. Members of the Brithdir Mawr community near Newport, Pembrokeshire, have been given first refusal to purchase the 80-acre (32 hectare) site. Brithdir Mawr is off-grid, with electricity being generated by solar panels and a wind turbine on the site. Land owner Julian Orbach said he ""very much"" wanted the community to continue. Ten adults and seven children live at Brithdir Mawr on a partially communal basis, with the farmhouse as the main hub. The main community hub is at the farmhouse It was established in 1993 by Mr Orbach with his then wife, and a number of low-impact buildings were constructed around the farmhouse at the site without planning permission. In 1998, the buildings were spotted from the air by the authorities, and the community facedplanning battles to retain them,external. The developments at Brithdir Mawr led to the establishment of the Welsh Government's One Planet policy which permits low-impact dwellings in the countryside. Mr Orbach said he had been hoping the community would buy the land for the past 10 years, and members told BBC Wales they were confident of being able to do so. Lea Trainer says it is ""great"" the community has been given first refusal Lea Trainer, who has lived at Brithdir Mawr with his family for three months, said: ""It's been a community and we have absolute gratitude to them [the Orbachs]. ""Our landlord, Julian, is looking to sell, but the great thing is he's looking to sell to us. ""Governments around the world are declaring a climate emergency. The way we can help with the climate is by living like this, by living sustainably, and only extracting the resources you need."" The family-of-four living off-grid The remote UK community living off-grid Living off-grid for almost 80 years Nick Ward, who has lived there for three years, added: ""There is a chance this place will be sold and that will be unfortunate because it's a beautiful place and we have some great plans. ""I'm pretty confident to be honest. We're valued in the wider community. We hold a special place in people's hearts."" The community plans to launch a community share offer in September, meaning people living anywhere in the world can buy a share.

Far right surge in two eastern German states,"In Brandenburg AfD - led by Andreas Kalbitz - doubled its vote share compared with 2014 Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party surged in elections in two eastern states, but not enough to oust the ruling coalitions there. The centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) of Chancellor Angela Merkel lost votes in Saxony but still came top with 32%, ahead of AfD's 27.5%. In Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) won with 26.2%, while AfD got 23.5%. AfD is shunned by the other parties. In both states the other parties will now discuss forming new coalitions - perhaps including the Greens - which will exclude AfD. Germany's far-right AfD: Victim or victor? AfD's surge was biggest in Saxony, where it gained 17.8 percentage points compared with the 2014 election. The state has long been seen as an AfD stronghold. The SPD - nationally in government with the CDU - plunged dramatically to 7.7% in Saxony. Support for AfD grew when it campaigned against Mrs Merkel's admission of nearly a million non-EU migrants in 2015. AfD also drew on discontent in the former communist east over Germany's closure of loss-making businesses, including coal mines. Just how far to the right is AfD? Angela Merkel's quiet power AfD's slogan ""let's complete the change"" harked back to the 1989 ""Wende"" (change), which many eastern Germans see as unfinished business. Despite huge investment from the richer west, for many people the economic restructuring did not transform their lives as they had hoped. ""We're satisfied in Brandenburg as well as in Saxony,"" AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland said, adding that his party had ""punished"" Mrs Merkel's conservatives. But despite the gains, the result may disappoint AfD as the party had hoped to come top in Brandenburg, the BBC's Damien McGuinness reports from Berlin. The CDU state premier of Saxony, Michael Kretschmer, said ""I'm very happy with the result"", but added that opposition messages had made an impact on social media. ""The filter bubble on the internet is so powerful, and in 20 months you cannot reach everyone,"" he told broadcaster ARD. The CDU-SPD national coalition is due to last until federal elections in 2021, and a collapse could trigger a snap election or result in a minority government. Mrs Merkel herself plans to step down as chancellor in 2021, having already resigned as CDU leader at the end of last year.

Human rights body hit by eight budget cutsThe NI Human Rights Commission says its budget is severely restricting its ability to take legal cases.Northern Ireland,"The ability of Northern Ireland's human rights watchdog to take legal cases is now severely restricted by repeated budget cuts, it has said. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission had to ask for a funding reprieve this year from the Northern Ireland Office in an attempt to bolster its finances. Its budget is just over Â£1.1m. It argues that this figure has been almost halved, in real terms, since 2010. Chief Commissioner Les Allamby said the commission has been operating within significant financial constraints. ""Within this budget, we are required to provide a range of public services including taking strategic legal cases, providing advice to government on critical issues such as Brexit, carrying out investigations as well as promotion and education,"" he told BBC News NI. ""Our ability to take strategic legal cases to challenge human rights violations is severely restricted by our budget."" Set up under the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) is an independent body funded by the government through the Northern Ireland Office (NIO). Among its functions is to initiate cases and provide legal assistance to individuals taking human rights legal challenges. It has 14 staff members, down from 32 in 2009. The body said that it has now faced eight annual cuts to its budget, with staff numbers reduced on four occasions. To maintain its current workforce,it warned in its annual report,external, published in July, that further reductions in its investigation and legal budgets were required. This, the organisation warned, would mean it would have to seek business case approvals from the NIO, on a case-by-case basis, to secure additional resources before supporting legal cases. Since then, the NIO has stepped in to provide a funding plug of about Â£79,000, BBC News NI understands. But the commission said its funding problem has not gone away. It said itsSupreme Court challenge to the law on abortion in Northern Ireland, which ran for more than five years, cost Â£225,000. The NIHRC lost a Supreme Court appeal over the legality of Northern Ireland's abortion law in 2018 Its successful Court of Appeal (NI) challenge to adoption law that discriminated against same sex couples ran for more than four years at a cost of Â£130,000. The commission said a budget of Â£1.63m in 2010 was considered necessary for it to effectively operate as envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement. When inflation is taken into account, it argues that its budget for 2019-20 should have been set at just over Â£2m. ""The organisation will continue to take a can-do practical approach to its mandate to protect and promote the human rights of everyone in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Allamby added. ""To do that, we need a decent financial platform. As a statutory public body, we are obliged to live within our means, nonetheless it would be remiss of us as an organisation not to highlight the difficulties we face in fully meeting our mandate."" In the 2018-2019 financial year, the commission said it received more than 400 enquiries from the public seeking assistance. The commission granted legal support to three individuals. The NIO told the BBC that it remained ""committed to the ongoing work"" of the commission.

Johanna Konta reached the US Open quarter-finals for the first time by edging an unpredictable match against Czech third seed Karolina Pliskova. Konta, 28, fought back from a set and 3-1 down to win 6-7 (1-7) 6-3 7-5. She will faceElina Svitolinain the last eight after the Ukrainian fifth seed beat Madison Keys 7-5 6-4. ""I've been in the fourth round twice before so reaching the quarter-finals is a massive achievement for me,"" said the British number one. ""The key was to keep going, with Karolina you know there will be massive portions of the match where I don't feel effective. ""It is about staying out there and trusting the fundamental things. It was a great match and I'm so happy."" The 16th seed missed chances in the first set before composing herself to punish an out-of-sorts Pliskova at Flushing Meadows. The Czech won 77% of points on her first serve and served 16 aces but those statistics were undermined by nine double faults and a second serve which earned her just seven points. Konta has been hitting clean groundstrokes all tournament and continued to trust her ability against the similarly powerful Pliskova, landing 45 winners which outnumbered her unforced errors and proved to be a key differential. Konta, who is the first British woman to reach the quarter-finals in New York since Jo Durie in 1983, has now made the last eight at all four Grand Slams. She reached the French Open semi-finals and Wimbledon quarter-finals earlier this year. On emulating Durie, Konta said: ""I'm really pleased with that and, more specifically, this season to make it three quarter-finals in successive Grand Slams is a tremendous achievement. ""I will enjoy this but I have to keep looking forward and try to go one, two or three steps further."" Konta will now face 24-year-old Svitolina, who enjoyed a routine win over 10th seed and 2017 finalist Keys in the first night session match on Arthur Ashe Stadium. ""It is going to be another great battle,"" said Svitolina, who boasts a 3-0 winning record against Konta. Federer cruises into US Open quarter-finals by thrashing Goffin Second seed Barty knocked out by Wang Medvedev the Russian troll in New York Murray and Skupski into last eight Konta, supported again by actor Tom Hiddleston in her player box, started strongly against an opponent who had won six of their seven previous tour-level meetings. She broke to love in the first game and continued to create more opportunities as the tall Czech struggled to land first serves, enabling Konta to dismantle Pliskova's second serve on her way to setting up nine points for a double break in the opening set. Pliskova rallied to save all of them and it looked likely to prove costly for Konta when her service game - which she had only dropped twice in her previous three matches - suddenly disintegrated. Konta failed to land a first serve as she tried to see out the opener at 5-4, paying the price as the Czech rediscovered her biggest weapon to instead take the advantage. Pliskova looked completely in control as she broke in the first game of the second set and won nine out of 10 points with Konta's game starting to become ragged. Actor Tom Hiddleston has watched two of Johanna Konta's matches at Flushing Meadows, having met her on the street in New York But, after the pair traded two more successive breaks, momentum shifted back to Konta, who won five games in a row to take an engrossing match into a decider. Konta had won 16 of her 19 three-set matches this year and looked set to improve that tally when a poor service game from Pliskova, which featured three unforced errors and a double fault, left the Briton serving for the match. However, as when she served for the first set, nerves seemed to take hold and Pliskova threatened to level by bringing up break point. Konta, though, composed herself again with a brave forehand winner down the line. After missing a first match point, she reset again to win at the second opportunity when 27-year-old Pliskova - still searching for a maiden Grand Slam title herself - hit long to go down in two hours and 20 minutes. ""It was important not to panic or be worried,"" Konta said about fighting back from a set and a break down. ""I was doing a lot of good things out there and I kept into perspective I was playing the number three player in the world. ""I was pleased with what I was doing in that first set, even though I wasn't able to come through, and I definitely felt there was a lot for me to build on. ""I trust in my ability to create more opportunities and I managed to do that."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Flushing Meadows Johanna Konta won that match the hard way. Many would have subsided after losing a first set they had dominated - especially after being broken twice in a row at the start of the second. But Konta has an extraordinary third-set record this year, and seems to relish mixing it with the elite. She has won her past four matches against top 10 players in Grand Slams - against Sloane Stephens twice, Petra Kvitova and now Karolina Pliskova. The serve is the bedrock of her game, but she also hit bravely and freely from the baseline when the match was up for grabs. To have reached the last eight of all four Grand Slams is a mighty achievement, and she is only the 14th active player to have done so.
