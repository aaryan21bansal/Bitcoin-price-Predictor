12 things we learned,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's much-anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey has aired in the US and the UK - with the couple sharing their side of the story about life in the Royal Family. The couple spoke about their relationships with other royals, racism and how their mental health suffered. Meghan spoke with Oprah for most of the interview, before being joined by Prince Harry. One of the biggest allegations from the interview was that there were ""several conversations"" within the Royal Family about how dark Meghan and Harry's baby might be. ""In those months when I was pregnant [there were] concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,"" said Meghan. She said the conversations were with Harry, who relayed them to her. Both she and Harry refused to say which royal said it. ""That conversation, I am never going to share,"" said Harry. ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked."" Harry also said that it hurt him that his family never spoke out about the ""colonial undertones"" of news headlines and articles. The couple's first child, Archie, was born in May 2019 One storythat circulated in the newspapers a few years ago,externalwas that the Duchess of Cambridge was left in tears by Meghan in the run-up to the wedding in a row over flower girl dresses. But Meghan told Oprah the reverse was true. ""A few days before the wedding [Kate] was upset about the flower girl dresses and it made me cry,"" Meghan said. She said Kate later apologised and brought flowers and a note to make amends. ""I'm not sharing that piece about Kate to be disparaging about her,"" Meghan said. She said Kate was ""a good person"" and hoped that she would have wanted the false stories corrected. The media ""really seemed to want a narrative of a hero and a villain,"" said Meghan Meghan spoke about how lonely she felt after joining the Royal Family and the loss of her freedom. ""When I joined that family, that was the last time until we came here that I saw my passport, my driver's licence, my keys, all that gets turned over,"" she said. She said her mental health got so bad that she ""didn't want to be alive any more"". ""I went to the institution and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help, said I had never felt that way before and need to go somewhere, and I was told that I couldn't, that it wouldn't be good for the institution."" She said she went to ""one of the most senior people"" within the institution and then to the palace human resources department. ""Nothing was ever done,"" she added. Princess Diana's name came up many times throughout the interview - with similarities drawn between their experiences of being in the Royal Family. ""I didn't even know who to turn to,"" said Meghan, of the time when she was struggling. ""One of the people I reached out to who's continued to be a friend and confidante was one of my husband's mom's best friends. ""Because it's like who else could understand what it's actually like on the inside?"" Oprah asked Harry about his relationships with his family and especially with his father, the Prince of Wales, and brother, the Duke of Cambridge. At one point after stepping back as senior royals, Harry said Charles ""stopped taking my calls"". ""I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like and Archie's his grandson. ""But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship."" On William, Harry said he loved him to bits and they have been through hell together. ""But we were on different paths."" Harry said he has a ""really good"" relationship with his grandmother and he has spoken to her more in the past year - including video calls with Archie - than he has for many years. ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be."" Meghan also praised the Queen and said she gave her some beautiful jewellery for the couple's first joint engagement together as well as sharing a blanket with her to keep warm while travelling together. Harry denied ever ""blindsiding"" the Queen when he stepped down as a senior royal In the first quarter of 2020, Harry said his family ""literally cut me off financially"". He said the Netflix and Spotify deals that he and Meghan have struck to make shows and podcasts were never part of the plan but ""I had to afford security for us"". ""But I've got what my mum left me and without that we wouldn't have been able to do this."" The couple reveal that, after they were cut off, American billionaire and media mogul Tyler Perry provided Harry and Meghan with a home and security last year when they moved from Canada to southern California. Meghan said that the evening after she told Harry that she was feeling suicidal, they had to attend an official event at the Royal Albert Hall. Meghan spoke about a photo that has haunted her because of what it reminded her of. ""You've no idea what's going on for someone behind closed doors,"" said the duchess She said a friend had commented how great the couple looked but she added: ""That picture, if you zoom in, what I see is how tightly his knuckles are gripped around mine,"" she told Oprah, as she became emotional. ""We are smiling and doing our job but we're both just trying to hold on. ""Every time those lights went down in that royal box, I was just weeping."" Talking about the first time she met the Queen, Meghan said she was surprised to learn she had to curtsy. She said she thought it was just ""part of the fanfare"" and didn't happen inside the Royal Family She described having to quickly practise curtsying before an impromptu lunch with the Queen. ""I said: 'It's your grandmother,"" said Meghan. ""He said: 'It's the Queen.'"" Meghan added that she hadn't done any research on the family before joining - and insisted she had never looked up her husband online while they were dating. Millions of people watched Harry and Meghan tie the knot at Windsor Castle in 2018. That ceremony was when they were legally married - but the couple revealed they also exchanged vows in front of the Archbishop of Canterbury three days before. Meghan said: ""We called the archbishop and we just said, 'look, this thing, this spectacle is for the world but we want our union between us... just the two of us in our backyard'."" Harry spoke about Archie, and the joy he gets from taking him out on bike rides. The interview included a clip of the toddler playing on the beach with his parents. The couple joked that his favourite word for the past few weeks has been ""hydrate"", and Harry said whenever anyone leaves the house, Archie tells them ""drive safe"". Archie - who will be two years old in May - now says words like palm tree and house, said Harry The couple confirm they're expecting a baby girl in the summer. Harry said it was ""amazing"", adding: ""What more can you ask for?"" - but said they would be done after baby number two arrives. Towards the end of the interview, Oprah asked if Meghan had got her happy ending with Prince Harry after all. ""Greater than any fairytale that you've ever read,"" she said.

"Meghan, Diana and the press","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's explosive Oprah interview was significant formany reasons- and one of them was the number of times Prince Harry's mum, Princess Diana, was mentioned. Meghan Markle said she spoke to one of Diana's friends about the pressures of joining the Royal Family, ""because it's like who else could understand what it's actually like on the inside?"" Similarities were drawn between their experiences of being in the Royal Family. Prince Harry said he had feared history was ""repeating itself"" before he and Meghan stepped back from their roles as senior royals. And it's not the first time he's comparedsome tabloid coverage,externalof his wife to the way in which Diana was treated. Princess Diana was considered to be one of the most famous women in the world and often written about in the newspapers - with both her charity work and private life making headlines. ""Diana became a royal icon unlike any other. She was globally recognised and internationally famous,"" royal author Katie Nicholl tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. But, Katie adds, the attention she received wasn't always positive. ""Diana was criticised in the press. She was the most famous person in the world and the paparazzi were a constant presence in the lives of Prince William and Harry"". Royal author Katie Nicholl says Princess Diana was ""frequently followed"" by paparazzi Journalist James Brookes agrees. ""At times she had a very good relationship with the press and they were on her side. At other times she complained about the media for being intrusive. It was a mixed relationship."" In later years Diana gave personal interviews to the press that led some to say she was encouraging the publicity and attention. Meghan shut down her personal blog when she joined the Royal Family and the majority of her interviews before this one were about her charity work. Although Katie points out some people believe Meghan and Harry are contradicting themselves. In January 2020, the couple said they wouldstep back from senior royal dutiesafter struggling with the media spotlight. They moved to Canada and then California and it was recently announced they won't return to the UK as working members of the Royal Family. But Katie says they have ""revealed more about their lives now [since moving to America] than they ever did whilst in the UK"". Since stepping back from Royal duties, the couple havelaunched a Spotify podcast, signed adeal with Netflixand giveninterviews to James Cordenand Oprah Winfrey. ""People are questioning a couple who moved because they wanted a quiet life, thinking, 'Why are they courting James Corden and Oprah Winfrey and revealing details about their son?'"" adds Katie. ""The idea about escaping Britain and the media spotlight doesn't ring true with a lot of people who are seeing more of Harry and Meghan than they ever did when they were in the UK."" Harry told Oprah that the Netflix and Spotify deals were never part of the plan, but his family had ""literally cut me off financially"" in early 2020. ""Wherever she went there were huge amounts of journalists and photographers covering her every move"" ""Wherever she went there were huge amounts of journalists and photographers covering her every move,"" says James Brookes. James believes Prince Harry's opinion of the media goes back to when Princess Diana died. 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' 12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview ""A lot of Harry and William's perspective of the media is tainted by [their mother's death] because in their eyes their mother was hounded by the paparazzi,"" he says. Princess Diana died in a car crash in a road tunnel in Paris on 31 August 1997. Prince Harry was 12 at the time. The driver - Henri Paul - had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes. An inquest later found Diana had been unlawfully killed as result of the ""gross negligence"" of the driver and the paparazzi. In a 2017 BBC documentary, Prince Harry spoke about his mother's death and the role of the paparazzi. ""I think one of the hardest things to come to terms with, is the fact that, the people that chased her into the tunnel, were the same people taking photographs of her dying on the back seat of the car."" Prince Harry says the way Meghan is treated by tabloid press is ""bullying"" Despite Prince Harry's statement in October 2019, Katie believes ""Meghan isn't followed or chased by the paparazzi in the way Diana was"". However she thinks the prince is clearly fed up with the stories which criticise Meghan. ""He's attacking the journalists who he believes are constantly fuelling the negative narrative about his wife. ""There have been numerous negative stories about spending. Including the cost of renovating their house which has been met by taxpayers' money."" This money - Â£2.4m - was laterrepaid by the couple. Meghan 'didn't want to be alive any more' ""There's also the cost of the Duchess of Sussex's designer outfits, which have gone into hundreds of thousands of pounds. ""There were separate stories around the wedding. The rumours of Meghan wanting air fresheners in St George's chapel. The rumoured tiara tantrum. The rumoured upset between Meghan and Kate at a bridesmaid fitting for Princess Charlotte."" Meghan told Oprah the reverse was true about the dress fitting before her wedding. ""A few days before the wedding [Kate] was upset about the flower girl dresses and it made me cry,"" Meghan said. She said Kate later apologised and brought flowers and a note to make amends. She said Kate was ""a good person"" and hoped that she would have wanted the false stories corrected. Katie says the prince ""is very protective of Meghan"" Some people say Meghan should expect attention because, unlike Princess Diana, she was a celebrity before marrying Harry. That's something Katie disagrees with. ""I think even though she had a celebrity lifestyle before, I don't think it compares to being in the Royal Family. ""Yes she had celebrity status but she wasn't an A-list actress, like Angelina Jolie or Nicole Kidman. She's said this herself, she's never experienced this level of public scrutiny."" She adds: ""I think Meghan has come under just as much scrutiny as any other member of the Royal family. People have short memories, but the Duchess of Cambridge also had a rough time in the tabloids."" The difficulty, Katie says, is that there is a clear public interest in the couple but there is a line about what is acceptable. ""It's the job of the press to report on the Royal Family, but it has to be fair and has to be impartial."" A version of this article appeared on 9 January 2020.

Prince Harry told Oprah Winfrey that the UK tabloid media is ""bigoted"" and creates a ""toxic environment"" of ""control and fear"". He said he thought the Prince of Wales had to ""make peace with it"". The Society of Editors said the media is not bigoted and is holding the ""rich and powerful to account"".

The two-hour interview was broadcast last night in the US and was screened in the UK on ITV on Monday night and on ITV Hub, courtesy of Harpo Productions/CBS. In other key revelations: Meghan said she found life within the Royal Family so difficult that at timesshe ""didn't want to be alive any more"" She said Harry had been asked by an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be Oprah later saidthe family member was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh The couple announced their second child, which is due in the summer, is a girl They exchanged vows in a ceremony led by the Archbishop of Canterbury in their ""backyard"" three days before they were legally married at their public wedding in May 2018 Harry said his brother and father were ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family He said his family cut him off financially at the beginning of last year and his father stopped taking his calls But Harry said he loved his brother ""to bits"" and wanted to heal his relationship with both him and his father Meghan said she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month US President Joe Biden's press secretary, Jen Psaki, said it had taken ""courage"" for Harry and Meghan to tell their own personal story and speak about struggles with mental health. Asked about the claims that the Royal Family had failed to look after the Sussexes' mental health and that one family member had speculated on their unborn child's skin colour, Prime Minister Boris Johnson declined to comment, except to say he ""always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role she plays"". He said ""when it comes to matters to do with the Royal Family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing"", after being asked specifically if he believed the Royal Family was racist. In previously unseen footage from the three hour 20 minutes interview, Oprah asked the prince if the couple left the UK because of racism. Prince Harry replied: ""It was a large part of it."" He said that shortly after the couple announced they would step back from royal duties, someone who was ""friends with a lot of the editors"" had warned him about their confrontational stance with the press: ""Please don't do this with the media, they will destroy your life."" The conversation happened at a fundraising dinner in January 2020, a few months afterMeghan sued the Mail on Sundayover a private letter and Prince Harry said he feared his wife would fall ""victim to the same powerful forces"" that he lost his mother to. The friend of the editors told him: ""You need to understand that the UK is very bigoted."" But the duke responded: ""The UK is not bigoted, the UK press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids."" Speaking to Oprah, the prince added: ""But, unfortunately, if the source of information is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society."" He said that ""sadly"" no-one in the family had said they were sorry that the couple felt they had to move away from royal life because they did not feel supported. ""The feeling is that this was our decision, therefore the consequences are on us."" He said it was ""really hard because I am part of the system with them, I always have been"". Prince Harry said he was warned about the media shortly after announcing the couple would step back as senior royals Prince Harry said he is ""very aware"" that his brother Prince William ""can't leave that system but I have"".

The duke said he will ""always be there"" for his brother and the rest of his family and he has ""tried to help them to see what has happened"". His father, the Prince of Wales, ""had to make peace"" with the relationship with the media. But Meghan said she and the duke could not make peace with it themselves, saying it was ""different"" because of social media, describing it as ""like the wild, wild West"". The Society of Editors criticised the couple for accusing the media of racism without ""any supporting evidence"". ""The UK media has never shied away from holding a spotlight up to those in positions of power, celebrity or influence. If sometimes the questions asked are awkward and embarrassing, then so be it, but the press is most certainly not racist,"" said executive director Ian Murray. In another unaired clip shared by broadcaster CBS on social media, Prince Harry said that in January last year the couple had an invitation to visit the Queen at Sandringham suddenly withdrawn by her private secretary, who said she was ""busy all week"". ""When you're head of the firm there are people around you that give you advice. And what has also made me really sad is some of that advice has been really bad,"" said Harry. Also in the unaired footage, the Duchess of Sussex said her treatment in the press had been worse than other royals, saying that although the Duchess of Cambridge being branded ""Waity Katie"" before her marriage to Prince William must have been ""really hard"", it was ""not the same"". ""If a member of his family would comfortably say 'we've all had to deal with things that are rude', rude and racist are not the same,"" she said. ""And equally you've also had a press team that goes on the record to defend you, especially when they know something's not true, and that didn't happen for us."" Meghan said there had been an ""obsession about anything in my world"", including the media offering money to track down her parents.

Also in the unaired footage, the Duchess of Sussex said her treatment in the press had been worse than other royals, saying that although the Duchess of Cambridge being branded ""Waity Katie"" before her marriage to Prince William must have been ""really hard"", it was ""not the same"". ""If a member of his family would comfortably say 'we've all had to deal with things that are rude', rude and racist are not the same,"" she said. ""And equally you've also had a press team that goes on the record to defend you, especially when they know something's not true, and that didn't happen for us."" Meghan said there had been an ""obsession about anything in my world"", including the media offering money to track down her parents.

"Fears for 5,000 steel jobs as lender collapses","Sanjeev Gupta, who has been called the ""saviour of steel"" The principal financial backer of one of the UK's largest industrial groups has fallen into administration. Specialist bank Greensill Capital was the main lender to businessman Sanjeev Gupta's sprawling empire, which includes Liberty Steel. The appointment of administrators to Greensill puts 5,000 jobs at risk at Liberty Steel and other firms. In a court filing, Greensill said Mr Gupta's operations were in ""financial difficulty"" and defaulting on debt. Mr Gupta declined to comment on the claims, but his business GFG Alliance earlier said that it had adequate funding for its current needs. Union officials are to hold crisis talks with the steel magnate on Tuesday. Liberty owns 12 steel plants in the UK including in Rotherham, Motherwell, Stocksbridge, Newport and Hartlepool. The Community union said: ""Sanjeev Gupta needs to tell us exactly what the administration means for Liberty's UK businesses and how he plans to protect jobs. The future of Liberty's strategic steel assets must be secured and we are ready to work with all stakeholders to find a solution."" A spokesperson for Grant Thornton said its insolvency practitioners Chris Laverty, Trevor O'Sullivan and Will Stagg had been appointed as joint administrators of Greensill Capital and Greensill Capital Management Company. ""The joint administrators are in continued discussion with an interested party in relation to the purchase of certain Greensill Capital assets. As these discussions remain ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,"" the spokesperson added. Mr Gupta, who has been called the ""saviour of steel"", has defied pessimists in the industry for years by buying up seemingly unloved industrial assets. These included steel and aluminium plants that many thought could not be run profitably in the face of cut price competition from China. The BBC understands that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng held an emergency meeting on Sunday with the chief executive of Liberty Steel UK, John Ferriman. They discussed contingency plans in the event that Greensill went bust. It is understood the options did not include nationalisation. Further meetings are expected later on Monday. Mr Kwarteng also chaired a meeting of UK steel executives on Friday at which the future of Liberty, owned by Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance, was brought up, However, it was not discussed in any detail with this wider group, which included union bosses. Liberty Steel is the UK's third-largest steelmaker, employing 3,000 people at 11 sites. Another 2,000 people in engineering businesses within the group are also involved. That's a substantial chunk of the 32,000 people who work in the industry. Employment and output have fallen significantly for the steel industry over the last four decades. In its heyday as the state-owned British Steel Corporation in the early 1970s, it had 10 times as many workers. The whole UK steel industry has gone through a chequered period of ownership since it was privatised in the 1980s. However, the sector is still considered important by government ministers, regional politicians and business leaders. Many of Liberty Steel's assets were part of Tata Steel's UK business until they changed hands for Â£100m in 2017. When Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance snapped them up, he was hailed as saving thousands of UK jobs. But his empire has often been criticised for its complicated structure and lack of transparent accounting. With news of the financial problems facing Greensill Capital, one of Mr Gupta's key sources of finance, those criticisms are now coming home to roost. Greensill, run by former investment banker Lex Greensill, counts former Prime Minister David Cameron among its paid advisers. The BBC has approached Mr Cameron for comment. The company specialises in short-term supply chain financing to provide capital for businesses around the world. However, it too has been accused of opaque accounting. Greensill's heavy exposure to Mr Gupta's business has prompted Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to Â£10bn worth of funds held as security. Their heavy exposure to each other has proved disastrous for both Greensill and Gupta. Mr Gupta's financing requirements constituted more than 50% of Greensill's lending volumes. While figures are not available for the proportion of his funding that Mr Gupta raised from Greensill, sources close to Greensill put his funding needs from the firm at $70m a day. A spokesman for Mr Gupta said Liberty's operations were ""running as normal"", had adequate funding for their current needs and that the refinancing plans were progressing. It added that a recent upturn in global steel prices was beneficial for the company's prospects. Liberty is a major supplier to the public, including hydro-power contracts in Scotland and steel contracts for the Ministry of Defence. The government said it was ""monitoring the situation closely"". ""This is a deeply concerning situation and a very worrying time for Liberty Steel workers,"" said Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow minister for business and consumers. ""It's vital that the government acts with the urgency required and doesn't wash their hands of the situation.""

BP staff set to work from home two days a weekThe oil giant told staff last month that the new model will start for office-based staff this summer.BusinessComments,"BP has told office-based staff they will be expected to spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease. The oil giant said in meetings last month that most would be asked to work from home 40% of the time, or two days a week for full-time employees. The new ""hybrid"" work model will affect 25,000 BP staff, with 6,000 in the UK. It comes as part of a cost-cutting drive for the firm, which sawthousands of job cuts announced last year. BP informed staff of the changes in ""town hall"" meetings in February, and suggested that it would offer a ""more flexible, engaging and dynamic way of working"". Many of its office-based UK employees have been working from home full-time since the start of the pandemic. They were also expected to bear the brunt of redundancies announced in last June. 'People are tired of working from home' Can my boss force me to go to work? Bank boss rejects work from home as the 'new normal' In the government's roadmap,externalfor ending coronavirus restrictions, it recommends that people in England continue to work from home where possible. It is hoped, however, that all legal limits on social contact can be removed from 21 June. BP's new policy is expected to come into force this summer, after teams have discussed on a case-by-case basis how often and which days they will commute in.

Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy BP is the latest firm to commit to a new model with the pandemic having shaken up working patterns for many, previously office-based, staff. The boss of insurance firm Phoenix Group told the BBC's Today programme on Monday that its staff would continue working from home for the foreseeable future. Chief executive Andy Briggs said: ""The vast majority of our colleagues are working from home. ""We look forward to getting back into the office in due course, but our business has been able to operate very well working from home, so we're continuing to do that at the moment... although many of us are pleased to see our children go back to school."" Lloyds Banking Group is also set to reduce its office space by 20% over two years after a staff survey found that nearly 80% wanted to work at home for at least three days a week. HSBC has announced a 40% cut in its office footprint too. Paul Hubble spent five hours a day commuting to London from Eastbourne in East Sussex Paul Hubble used to have to leave his home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, at 06:10 to get to his desk at Barclays' London headquarters in Canary Wharf by 09:00 - a morning commute of two-and-a-half hours. He had to leave just before 17:00 if he wanted to make it home for 1930. But since home-working became the norm for Barclays employees, Paul says he can get more done. ""I now have more time for myself but also can be more productive in that I can start work early and finish work later,"" he told the BBC. Plus he saves Â£6,000 a year on his rail season ticket. It also means he can make time for a mid-afternoon dog walk, which he says is a ""great way of recharging the batteries"". However, others such as investment bankGoldman Sachs have rejected remote workingas the ""new normal"", with chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, calling it an ""aberration"". Last month, Barclays' chief executive Jes Staley said that working from home was ""not sustainable"".

According to thelatest data from the Office for National Statistics,external, the number of employees returning to work full-time is gradually increasing. Its survey of 4,000 people between 24 and 28 February found that 39% of adults said they were exclusively working outside the home, compared with 32% who were only working from home. The figures show about 10% are combining home-working and going in to the office. The peak of this trend came at the end of last September at 14%.

They were edited by Claire Heald, Sarah Fowler, Vanessa Barford, Paul Gribben and Chris Lansdown. That brings Harry and Meghan's highly anticipated interview with Oprah to a close.

Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent This is about as bad it might have been for the Royal Family, barring direct criticism of the Queen. Harry portrays his family as cold and unsympathetic, unable to relate emotionally, obsessed with who is going to pay for what. Itâs clear that relationships were and in some cases, still are, dreadful. Oprah asks Harry about Meghan's earlier comments that an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be ""That conversation, I am never going to share,"" Harry replies. ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he says, adding that this conversation took place ""right at the beginning"" of his relationship with Meghan. Oprah asks what the exact questions were in that conversation. Harry says he's not comfortable sharing that but suggests a few moments later that it was along the lines of: ""What will the kids look like?"" Oprah said earlier today that Prince Harry has clarified thatthe family member was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. Oprah asks Prince Harry what his relationship with his family is like now. He says he has spoken to the Queen, his grandmother, more in the last year than he has for many, many years and they have a really good relationship. ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be."" Asked about his relationship with his father, Prince Charles - heir to the throne - Harry pauses for a moment. ""There's a lot to work through there,"" he says. ""I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like... and Archie's his grandson. ""But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship."" Asked about the relationship with his brother, Prince William, Harry says he loves him ""to bits"" and they have been through ""hell together"". ""But we were on different paths,"" he adds. The Duke of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Prince of Wales pictured in 2019 Prince Harry says the Netflix and the Spotify deals he and Meghan have made recently were ""never part of the plan"". He says that came from when his family ""literally cut me off financially"" in the first quarter of 2020, and he had to pay for his family's security. He says the money that his late mother left him was the only way he and Meghan ""were able to do this"". Harry draws parallels between the treatment of Meghan and his mother, Princess Diana. âYou know, for me, I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you with my wife by my side,â he says. âBecause I can't begin to imagine what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself all those years ago, because it has been unbelievably tough for the two of us - but at least we had each other."" Harry's late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, relinquished the Her Royal Highness title at the time of her divorce from the Prince of Wales in August 1996. She died the following year in a car crash in Paris. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes when the accident happened. Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Trapped. Thatâs the word Harry used to describe his life in the Royal Family. Thatâs the impression he gave very often when out and about. But he goes on â he says his brother William, his father Charles, they too are trapped. And he feels compassion for them. It is a velvet-covered dagger into the institution he walked away (or, in his words, stepped back) from. You can read Jonny's full analysis here. Oprah asks Meghan and Harry about one of the prevailing storylines about the royal couple: that Meghan orchestrated their departure from the Royal Family, in what the tabloids branded as ""Megxit"". ""Can you imagine how little sense that makes?"" Meghan replies. ""I left everything for him."" She continues: ""Our plan was to do this forever."" Oprah turns to Harry, asking if he would have stepped back from his life in the Royal Family if it were not for Meghan. ""The answer is no. I wouldnât have been able to,"" he says. ""I myself was trapped."" Oprah pushes back - asking how a ""literal prince"" could be ""trapped"". I was ""trapped within the system"", Harry replies. ""My father and my brother - they are trapped. They donât get to leave - and I have huge compassion for that."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Harry looks so relaxed, so happy, so comfortable. Such a change from the deeply unhappy man he appeared to be in the final year in the UK. Meghan and Harry both come across very sympathetically, speaking without rancour but with the utmost clarity about a time in their lives they both clearly bitterly regret. This is explosive stuff â raw, revealing and hugely damaging for the Palace. Giving further details about his disappointment that his family did not show Meghan public support, Harry says: ""I also am acutely aware of where my family stands, and how scared they are of the tabloids turning on them."" He says there was an ""invisible contract"" between the Royal Family and UK tabloids - where if royals give access to reporters, they will get better press. ""There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations."" Oprah asks about how Harry and Meghan dealt with Meghan experiencing suicidal thoughts. ""I had no idea what to do, I wasn't prepared for that, I went to a very dark place as well,"" he says. Harry says he did not tell anyone in the family because ""that's just not a conversation that would be had"". ""I guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them,"" he says, adding that it's a very trapping environment. ""I didn't have anyone to turn to,"" he adds. ""For the family, they very much have this mentality of, 'this is just how it is. This is how it's meant to be, you can't change it, we've all been through it'. ""But what was different for me, was the race element. Because it wasn't just about her, it was about what she represents. He adds that for Meghan and Harry, ""and the specifics around her race"", it was an opportunity for the Royal Family ""to show some public support"". He says the ""most telling"" parts - and ""saddest parts"" - was that more than 70 MPs came out and condemned the colonial undertones of headlines and news articles. ""Yet no-one from my family ever said anything over those three years,"" he says. ""That hurts."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Just slipped into the conversation, as he listed the calls that he made to his family to talk about his future, is that Harryâs father - Prince Charles - stopped taking his calls. Did Harry mean to let that slip? Who knows? But it is an insight into how bad things got, maybe still are, in private relations inside the Royal Family. Harry says his biggest concern while living in Canada was that their security was going to be removed and people knew their location. He adds in a jibe at the Daily Mail newspaper at this point - saying that people knew their exact location ""courtesy of the Daily Mail"". He says the Palace's justification for removing security was ""a change in status""- but Harry says he ""pushed back"" and asked whether there had been a change of threat or risk, to which the Palace said no. They decided to move to California because they felt they were not safe in Canada. Oprah asks them what was the tipping point to their decision to step back as senior royals. ""It was desperate,"" says Harry. ""I went to all the places which I thought I should go to to ask for help, we both did, separately and together. Oprah asks: ""So you left because you were asking for help but couldn't get it?"", ""Yeah, basically,"" says Harry. ""But we never left,"" he says. ""We never left the family,"" adds Meghan, saying they only wanted to have a type of role that already exists - a non-senior royal. Harry says they wanted to ""take a breath"" from this ""constant barrage"". ""Meghan
clearly felt that the Palace was against her. That it didn't care. That it
didn't relate to the kind of pain that she was in."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond is on the latest Newscast podcast talking through
what the interview tells us about some of the relationships in the Royal
Family. Hear the full conversation now on BBC Sounds. Harry denies ever ""blindsiding"" his grandmother, the Queen, with his family's departure from senior royal duties. ""Iâve never blindsided my grandmother, I have too much respect for her,"" Harry tells Oprah. He says he had three telephone calls with the Queen ahead of the first statement announcing he and Meghan would be stepping back. He spoke with his father twice, he says, ""before he stopped taking my calls"". Why did Prince Charles stop speaking to Harry, Oprah asks. ""Because by that point I took matters into my own hands,"" Harry replies. ""It's really sad that it's gotten to this point, but I've got to do something for my own mental health, my wife's and for Archie's as well, because I could see where this was headed."" Harry said he and Meghan wanted to ""take a breath"" from ""the constant barrage"" the couple were facing as working royals. ""My biggest concern was history repeating itself,"" he tells Oprah. ""And what I was seeing was history repeating itself."" But he said this time it was ""far more dangerous"" compared to his mother's situation, taking into account the race and social media dimensions. He said he asked for help to ""call the dogs off"" but said none was given, and was instead told continuously ""this is how it is"". The Prince and Princess of Wales with Harry Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent The allegation that there were discussions in the Palace about how dark Meghanâs first baby might be is a devastating one. This is heading into ""worst-case scenario"" territory for the Palace. It is worth remembering we are currently only getting one side of the story. And Meghan has not revealed who said that to Harry. But it is a horrible allegation for the Palace to deal with. Now it's time for Prince Harry to join Meghan and Oprah. And no sooner has he sat down than they announce they are having a baby girl. Harry says his first thought was ""amazing"" and feeling ""grateful"". ""We've got our family,"" he says - ""the four of us and our two dogs"". They confirm that two children ""is it"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Harry: Tabloid racism 'large part' of why we leftIn unaired footage, the Duke of Sussex says the ""bigoted"" UK media created a ""toxic environment"".","The interview took place in the garden of a house near where the couple live in Montecito, west of Los Angeles The Duke of Sussex has said racism from the tabloid press that filtered into the rest of society was a ""large part"" of why he and his wife left the UK. Prince Harry told Oprah Winfrey that the UK tabloid media is ""bigoted"" and creates a ""toxic environment"" of ""control and fear"". He said he thought the Prince of Wales had to ""make peace with it"". The Society of Editors said the media is not bigoted and is holding the ""rich and powerful to account"". Meghan said social media had made the relationship with the press like ""the wild, wild West"" and said the Royal Family's press operation failed to defend her and Harry from untrue stories. Analysis: Harry and Meghan rattle monarchy's gilded cage Meghan 'didn't want to be alive any more' 12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview In the much-anticipated interview with Oprah, Harry and Meghan covered a range of deeply personal topics, including racism, mental health, their relationship with the media and Royal Family dynamics. The two-hour interview was broadcast last night in the US and was screened in the UK on ITV on Monday night and on ITV Hub, courtesy of Harpo Productions/CBS. In other key revelations: Meghan said she found life within the Royal Family so difficult that at timesshe ""didn't want to be alive any more"" She said Harry had been asked by an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be Oprah later saidthe family member was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh The couple announced their second child, which is due in the summer, is a girl They exchanged vows in a ceremony led by the Archbishop of Canterbury in their ""backyard"" three days before they were legally married at their public wedding in May 2018 Harry said his brother and father were ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family He said his family cut him off financially at the beginning of last year and his father stopped taking his calls But Harry said he loved his brother ""to bits"" and wanted to heal his relationship with both him and his father Meghan said she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month US President Joe Biden's press secretary, Jen Psaki, said it had taken ""courage"" for Harry and Meghan to tell their own personal story and speak about struggles with mental health. Asked about the claims that the Royal Family had failed to look after the Sussexes' mental health and that one family member had speculated on their unborn child's skin colour, Prime Minister Boris Johnson declined to comment, except to say he ""always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role she plays"". He said ""when it comes to matters to do with the Royal Family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing"", after being asked specifically if he believed the Royal Family was racist. In previously unseen footage from the three hour 20 minutes interview, Oprah asked the prince if the couple left the UK because of racism. Prince Harry replied: ""It was a large part of it."" He said that shortly after the couple announced they would step back from royal duties, someone who was ""friends with a lot of the editors"" had warned him about their confrontational stance with the press: ""Please don't do this with the media, they will destroy your life."" The conversation happened at a fundraising dinner in January 2020, a few months afterMeghan sued the Mail on Sundayover a private letter and Prince Harry said he feared his wife would fall ""victim to the same powerful forces"" that he lost his mother to. The friend of the editors told him: ""You need to understand that the UK is very bigoted."" But the duke responded: ""The UK is not bigoted, the UK press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids."" Speaking to Oprah, the prince added: ""But, unfortunately, if the source of information is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society."" He said that ""sadly"" no-one in the family had said they were sorry that the couple felt they had to move away from royal life because they did not feel supported. ""The feeling is that this was our decision, therefore the consequences are on us."" He said it was ""really hard because I am part of the system with them, I always have been"". Prince Harry said he was warned about the media shortly after announcing the couple would step back as senior royals Prince Harry said he is ""very aware"" that his brother Prince William ""can't leave that system but I have"". Asked if William wanted to leave the system, he replied: ""I don't know, I can't speak for him."" Harry said the ""relationship and that control and the fear by the UK tabloids, it's a really, it's a toxic environment"". The duke said he will ""always be there"" for his brother and the rest of his family and he has ""tried to help them to see what has happened"". His father, the Prince of Wales, ""had to make peace"" with the relationship with the media. But Meghan said she and the duke could not make peace with it themselves, saying it was ""different"" because of social media, describing it as ""like the wild, wild West"". The Society of Editors criticised the couple for accusing the media of racism without ""any supporting evidence"". ""The UK media has never shied away from holding a spotlight up to those in positions of power, celebrity or influence. If sometimes the questions asked are awkward and embarrassing, then so be it, but the press is most certainly not racist,"" said executive director Ian Murray. In another unaired clip shared by broadcaster CBS on social media, Prince Harry said that in January last year the couple had an invitation to visit the Queen at Sandringham suddenly withdrawn by her private secretary, who said she was ""busy all week"". ""When you're head of the firm there are people around you that give you advice. And what has also made me really sad is some of that advice has been really bad,"" said Harry. Also in the unaired footage, the Duchess of Sussex said her treatment in the press had been worse than other royals, saying that although the Duchess of Cambridge being branded ""Waity Katie"" before her marriage to Prince William must have been ""really hard"", it was ""not the same"". ""If a member of his family would comfortably say 'we've all had to deal with things that are rude', rude and racist are not the same,"" she said. ""And equally you've also had a press team that goes on the record to defend you, especially when they know something's not true, and that didn't happen for us."" Meghan said there had been an ""obsession about anything in my world"", including the media offering money to track down her parents. ""I did everything I could to protect both of them in that media frenzy for over a year,"" she told Oprah.

Itâs clear that relationships were and in some cases, still are, dreadful. Oprah asks Harry about Meghan's earlier comments that an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be ""That conversation, I am never going to share,"" Harry replies. ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he says, adding that this conversation took place ""right at the beginning"" of his relationship with Meghan. Oprah asks what the exact questions were in that conversation. Harry says he's not comfortable sharing that but suggests a few moments later that it was along the lines of: ""What will the kids look like?"" Oprah said earlier today that Prince Harry has clarified thatthe family member was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. Oprah asks Prince Harry what his relationship with his family is like now. He says he has spoken to the Queen, his grandmother, more in the last year than he has for many, many years and they have a really good relationship. ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be."" Asked about his relationship with his father, Prince Charles - heir to the throne - Harry pauses for a moment. ""There's a lot to work through there,"" he says. ""I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like... and Archie's his grandson. ""But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship."" Asked about the relationship with his brother, Prince William, Harry says he loves him ""to bits"" and they have been through ""hell together"". ""But we were on different paths,"" he adds. The Duke of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Prince of Wales pictured in 2019 Prince Harry says the Netflix and the Spotify deals he and Meghan have made recently were ""never part of the plan"". He says that came from when his family ""literally cut me off financially"" in the first quarter of 2020, and he had to pay for his family's security. He says the money that his late mother left him was the only way he and Meghan ""were able to do this"". Harry draws parallels between the treatment of Meghan and his mother, Princess Diana. âYou know, for me, I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you with my wife by my side,â he says. âBecause I can't begin to imagine what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself all those years ago, because it has been unbelievably tough for the two of us - but at least we had each other."" Harry's late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, relinquished the Her Royal Highness title at the time of her divorce from the Prince of Wales in August 1996. She died the following year in a car crash in Paris. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes when the accident happened. Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Trapped. Thatâs the word Harry used to describe his life in the Royal Family. Thatâs the impression he gave very often when out and about. But he goes on â he says his brother William, his father Charles, they too are trapped. And he feels compassion for them. It is a velvet-covered dagger into the institution he walked away (or, in his words, stepped back) from. You can read Jonny's full analysis here. Oprah asks Meghan and Harry about one of the prevailing storylines about the royal couple: that Meghan orchestrated their departure from the Royal Family, in what the tabloids branded as ""Megxit"". ""Can you imagine how little sense that makes?"" Meghan replies. ""I left everything for him."" She continues: ""Our plan was to do this forever."" Oprah turns to Harry, asking if he would have stepped back from his life in the Royal Family if it were not for Meghan. ""The answer is no. I wouldnât have been able to,"" he says. ""I myself was trapped."" Oprah pushes back - asking how a ""literal prince"" could be ""trapped"". I was ""trapped within the system"", Harry replies. ""My father and my brother - they are trapped. They donât get to leave - and I have huge compassion for that."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Harry looks so relaxed, so happy, so comfortable. Such a change from the deeply unhappy man he appeared to be in the final year in the UK. Meghan and Harry both come across very sympathetically, speaking without rancour but with the utmost clarity about a time in their lives they both clearly bitterly regret. This is explosive stuff â raw, revealing and hugely damaging for the Palace. Giving further details about his disappointment that his family did not show Meghan public support, Harry says: ""I also am acutely aware of where my family stands, and how scared they are of the tabloids turning on them."" He says there was an ""invisible contract"" between the Royal Family and UK tabloids - where if royals give access to reporters, they will get better press. ""There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations."" Oprah asks about how Harry and Meghan dealt with Meghan experiencing suicidal thoughts. ""I had no idea what to do, I wasn't prepared for that, I went to a very dark place as well,"" he says. Harry says he did not tell anyone in the family because ""that's just not a conversation that would be had"". ""I guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them,"" he says, adding that it's a very trapping environment. ""I didn't have anyone to turn to,"" he adds. ""For the family, they very much have this mentality of, 'this is just how it is. This is how it's meant to be, you can't change it, we've all been through it'. ""But what was different for me, was the race element. Because it wasn't just about her, it was about what she represents. He adds that for Meghan and Harry, ""and the specifics around her race"", it was an opportunity for the Royal Family ""to show some public support"". He says the ""most telling"" parts - and ""saddest parts"" - was that more than 70 MPs came out and condemned the colonial undertones of headlines and news articles. ""Yet no-one from my family ever said anything over those three years,"" he says. ""That hurts."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Just slipped into the conversation, as he listed the calls that he made to his family to talk about his future, is that Harryâs father - Prince Charles - stopped taking his calls. Did Harry mean to let that slip? Who knows? But it is an insight into how bad things got, maybe still are, in private relations inside the Royal Family. Harry says his biggest concern while living in Canada was that their security was going to be removed and people knew their location. He adds in a jibe at the Daily Mail newspaper at this point - saying that people knew their exact location ""courtesy of the Daily Mail"". He says the Palace's justification for removing security was ""a change in status""- but Harry says he ""pushed back"" and asked whether there had been a change of threat or risk, to which the Palace said no. They decided to move to California because they felt they were not safe in Canada. Oprah asks them what was the tipping point to their decision to step back as senior royals. ""It was desperate,"" says Harry. ""I went to all the places which I thought I should go to to ask for help, we both did, separately and together. Oprah asks: ""So you left because you were asking for help but couldn't get it?"", ""Yeah, basically,"" says Harry. ""But we never left,"" he says. ""We never left the family,"" adds Meghan, saying they only wanted to have a type of role that already exists - a non-senior royal. Harry says they wanted to ""take a breath"" from this ""constant barrage"". ""Meghan
clearly felt that the Palace was against her. That it didn't care. That it
didn't relate to the kind of pain that she was in."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond is on the latest Newscast podcast talking through
what the interview tells us about some of the relationships in the Royal
Family. Hear the full conversation now on BBC Sounds. Harry denies ever ""blindsiding"" his grandmother, the Queen, with his family's departure from senior royal duties. ""Iâve never blindsided my grandmother, I have too much respect for her,"" Harry tells Oprah. He says he had three telephone calls with the Queen ahead of the first statement announcing he and Meghan would be stepping back. He spoke with his father twice, he says, ""before he stopped taking my calls"". Why did Prince Charles stop speaking to Harry, Oprah asks. ""Because by that point I took matters into my own hands,"" Harry replies. ""It's really sad that it's gotten to this point, but I've got to do something for my own mental health, my wife's and for Archie's as well, because I could see where this was headed."" Harry said he and Meghan wanted to ""take a breath"" from ""the constant barrage"" the couple were facing as working royals. ""My biggest concern was history repeating itself,"" he tells Oprah. ""And what I was seeing was history repeating itself."" But he said this time it was ""far more dangerous"" compared to his mother's situation, taking into account the race and social media dimensions. He said he asked for help to ""call the dogs off"" but said none was given, and was instead told continuously ""this is how it is"". The Prince and Princess of Wales with Harry Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent The allegation that there were discussions in the Palace about how dark Meghanâs first baby might be is a devastating one. This is heading into ""worst-case scenario"" territory for the Palace. It is worth remembering we are currently only getting one side of the story. And Meghan has not revealed who said that to Harry. But it is a horrible allegation for the Palace to deal with. Now it's time for Prince Harry to join Meghan and Oprah. And no sooner has he sat down than they announce they are having a baby girl. Harry says his first thought was ""amazing"" and feeling ""grateful"". ""We've got our family,"" he says - ""the four of us and our two dogs"". They confirm that two children ""is it"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Meghan 'didn't want to be alive any more',"The interview took place in the garden of a house near where the couple live in Montecito, west of Los Angeles The Duchess of Sussex has said she found life within the British Royal Family so difficult that at times she ""didn't want to be alive any more"". In a deeply personal TV interview, Meghan told Oprah Winfrey that she did not get help when she asked for it. She said a low point was when Harry was asked by an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be. Oprah latersaid Harry had told her it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh who made the comment. The highly-anticipated interview with Oprah, which the couple were not paid for, aired overnight in the US. LIVE: Latest reaction to the interview 12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' During the two-hour CBS special, to be screened in the UK on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday night and on ITV Hub, Courtesy of Harpo Productions/CBS, the couple covered a range of topics, including racism, mental health, their relationship with the media and Royal Family dynamics. In other key revelations: The couple announced their second child, which is due in the summer, is a girl They exchanged vows in a ceremony led by the Archbishop of Canterbury in their ""backyard"" three days before they were legally married at their public wedding in May 2018 Harry said his brother and father were ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family He said his family cut him off financially at the beginning of last year and his father stopped taking his calls But Harry said he loved his brother ""to bits"" and wanted to heal his relationship with both him and his father Meghan said she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month The couple moved to California after formally stepping down from royal duties in March 2020, and it was announced last month that they would not be returning as working members of the Royal Family. Meghan referred to the Duchess of Cambridge as ""Kate"" during the interview Meghan said that she started to feel lonely when limits were placed on what she could do, revealing that at one point she did not leave the house for months. At one point she thought she ""could not feel lonelier"", she told Oprah. Asked by Oprah if she was thinking of self-harm and having suicidal thoughts at some stage,  the 39-year-old replied: ""Yes. This was very, very clear. Very clear and very scary. I didn't know who to turn to in that."" Meghan said that she felt ""haunted"" by a photograph from an official event she attended with Harry at the Royal Albert Hall while she was pregnant. ""Right before we had to leave for that (event), I had just had that conversation with Harry that morning,"" Meghan said. Winfrey asked: ""That you don't want to be alive any more?"" ""Yeah,"" Meghan confirmed. She said that she attended the event with Harry that night because she felt she could not be ""left alone"" and recalled Harry gripping her hand tightly while in attendance at the Royal Albert Hall. Harry and Meghan attended the premiere of Cirque du Soleil's Totem at the Royal Albert Hall in January 2019 Oprah also asked the duchess why she thought the Royal Family did not make her son Archie a prince - which Meghan said she wanted so that he would get police protection. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children do not automatically become princes or princesses because of a rule that has been in place since 1917 - unless the Queen steps in. ""In those months when I was pregnant, all around this same time so we have in tandem the conversation of he won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title, and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,"" Meghan said. She said the remarks about skin colour were made to Harry and he relayed them to her. Asked by Oprah whether there were concerns that her child would be ""too brown"" and that would be a problem, Meghan said: ""If that is the assumption you are making, that is a pretty safe one."" When pressed, she refused to reveal who the individual was, saying: ""I think that would be very damaging to them."" The couple's first child, Archie, was born in May 2019 Harry also refused to give further details, saying: ""That conversation, I am never going to share."" ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he added. The 36-year-old prince said that none of his relatives spoke out in support of Meghan following the racism he said his wife faced from the media. ""No-one from my family ever said anything over those three years. That hurts,"" Harry said. Meghan and Harry have upended the narrative created by Britain's bestselling newspapers. They have revealed the terrible strains inside the palace. They have drawn a picture of unfeeling individuals lost in an uncaring institution. They have spoken of racism within the Royal Family. This was a devastating interview. But Harry describing his brother and father as ""trapped"", and Meghan revealing that she repeatedly sought help within the palace only to be rebuffed, is a body blow to the institution. It's not at all clear if and how the palace will respond. Many of the revelations are so personal that getting any reaction seems unlikely. The Queen has made clear repeatedly the affection in which the couple are still held. As for the newspapers that the couple so despise - will they change their tune? It is not in their nature. There were pages of bile in some Sunday newspapers prior to the interview. Meghan and Harry have given up on getting a fair hearing from many of the most popular publications. It seems highly unlikely that they will see anything published that will make them change their minds. During the interview, the Royal Family were also accused of failing to protect the duke and duchess, with Meghan saying the situation ""started to really worsen"" after the couple married in May 2018. ""I came to understand that not only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family. ""But they weren't willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband."" She was referencing rumours that she had made the Duchess of Cambridge cry during a disagreement about flower girl dresses - a story that prompted a flurry of tabloid stories. Meghan said the opposite happened. She added that Catherine later apologised, bringing flowers and a note to make amends. Royal Family tree and line of succession In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together Joining his wife and Oprah for the second half of the interview, Harry talked about his relationship with the rest of his family. He said his relationship with his grandmother, the Queen, was ""really good"" and that the two of them speak often. However, his relationship with his father, the Prince of Wales, has suffered. Harry said that he feels ""really let down"" by his father. He added that he will always love him, but ""there's a lot of hurt that's happened"". He described his father and his brother as ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family. ""They don't get to leave,"" he added. Of Prince William, he said they were on ""different paths"". This video can not be played Dean Stott, a friend of Prince Harry, suggested that he didn't think the Royal Family had ""a voice"" The interview aired while Harry's grandfather, Prince Philip,was recovering in hospital after a heart procedure- although it was recorded before Prince Philip was admitted. When he went into hospital, Meghan said she phoned the Queen ""just to check in"". She said the monarch had ""always been wonderful to me"" and recalled her sharing her blanket while travelling together between visits. Harry also revealed that his family had cut him off financially at the beginning of last year, after the couple announced their intention to step back as senior royals. He said deals withNetflixandSpotifywere ""never part of the plan"" but they needed them to pay for security staff. In new footage not included in the original interview,Prince Harry was asked if the couple left the UK because of racism, and replied: ""It was a large part of it."" He recalled a conversation he had with someone with media connections who advised him not to take on the British tabloid press. He said he was told he had to understand that the UK was ""very bigoted"". But Harry recalled that he immediately responded: ""The UK is not bigoted, the UK press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids."" The prince told Oprah: ""But unfortunately if the source of info is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Meghan's allegations about racism and lack of mental health support should be taken ""very seriously"". Asked whether Boris Johnson agreed with this, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was ""a matter for the palace"" and Mr Johnson had not seen the interview.

BP staff set to work from home two days a week,"BP has told office-based staff they will be expected to spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease. The oil giant said in meetings last month that most would be asked to work from home 40% of the time, or two days a week for full-time employees. The new ""hybrid"" work model will affect 25,000 BP staff, with 6,000 in the UK. It comes as part of a cost-cutting drive for the firm, which sawthousands of job cuts announced last year. BP informed staff of the changes in ""town hall"" meetings in February, and suggested that it would offer a ""more flexible, engaging and dynamic way of working"". Many of its office-based UK employees have been working from home full-time since the start of the pandemic. They were also expected to bear the brunt of redundancies announced in last June. 'People are tired of working from home' Can my boss force me to go to work? Bank boss rejects work from home as the 'new normal' In the government's roadmap,externalfor ending coronavirus restrictions, it recommends that people in England continue to work from home where possible. It is hoped, however, that all legal limits on social contact can be removed from 21 June. BP's new policy is expected to come into force this summer, after teams have discussed on a case-by-case basis how often and which days they will commute in.

The boss of insurance firm Phoenix Group told the BBC's Today programme on Monday that its staff would continue working from home for the foreseeable future. Chief executive Andy Briggs said: ""The vast majority of our colleagues are working from home. ""We look forward to getting back into the office in due course, but our business has been able to operate very well working from home, so we're continuing to do that at the moment... although many of us are pleased to see our children go back to school."" Lloyds Banking Group is also set to reduce its office space by 20% over two years after a staff survey found that nearly 80% wanted to work at home for at least three days a week. HSBC has announced a 40% cut in its office footprint too. Paul Hubble spent five hours a day commuting to London from Eastbourne in East Sussex Paul Hubble used to have to leave his home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, at 06:10 to get to his desk at Barclays' London headquarters in Canary Wharf by 09:00 - a morning commute of two-and-a-half hours. He had to leave just before 17:00 if he wanted to make it home for 1930. But since home-working became the norm for Barclays employees, Paul says he can get more done. ""I now have more time for myself but also can be more productive in that I can start work early and finish work later,"" he told the BBC. Plus he saves Â£6,000 a year on his rail season ticket. It also means he can make time for a mid-afternoon dog walk, which he says is a ""great way of recharging the batteries"". However, others such as investment bankGoldman Sachs have rejected remote workingas the ""new normal"", with chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, calling it an ""aberration"". Last month, Barclays' chief executive Jes Staley said that working from home was ""not sustainable"". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: ""It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have."" According to thelatest data from the Office for National Statistics,external, the number of employees returning to work full-time is gradually increasing. Its survey of 4,000 people between 24 and 28 February found that 39% of adults said they were exclusively working outside the home, compared with 32% who were only working from home. The figures show about 10% are combining home-working and going in to the office. The peak of this trend came at the end of last September at 14%.

Starlings stop man's car in 'impressive' display,"Jamie Kingscott said he hopes his photo will inspire more people to take an interest in wildlife An ecologist who photographed thousands of starlings as they surrounded his car has said ""you can't help but be slightly impressed"" by the birds. Jamie Kingscott, 26, from Puriton, was on his way to work on the Somerset Levels when the birds flew directly across the road in front of him. He said: ""There was several thousand of them. They were all over the place. ""They lend themselves to impressive photography. They show off to the camera quite nicely."" Mr Kingscott took the photo on his way to work at Secret World Wildlife Rescue Mr Kingscott, who works for Secret World Wildlife Rescue as a wildlife release co-ordinator, said that unlike in a standard murmuration, the birds were very low to the ground. ""They crossed the road in front of me and then turned and crossed back over, so I just stopped the car and watched,"" he said. ""I fumbled around for my phone to try and catch something of it and that was the only photo I managed. ""Then I put it on twitter and it's gone mad, it has about 3,000 likes."" He added: ""They were really low, so less of the standard murmuration, but they did do a bit of a flourish to show off, and they came right over the bonnet... it was quite something."" Mr Kingscott said that he often makes a ""special effort"" to see the stunning winter murmurations, but the fact they ""came to see me on my way to work, was quite nice of them"".

Welsh roads 60% busier than first lockdown,"Cardiff has seen one of the highest increases in south Wales All parts of Wales have seen a rise in road traffic in recent weeks, compared with the first national lockdown. Some areas recorded almost double the amount of vehicles, Traffic Wales and Welsh Government figures reveal. There has been a 62% rise in road use across Wales over the most recent six weeks compared with the first six full weeks of restrictions from March 2020. This is despite almost identical restrictions, with people asked to avoid all non-essential travel. Traffic data is recorded by the Welsh Government at specific points on roads, including main routes like the M4 and A55. Figures for 2020 and up to 20 February 2021 have been obtained by BBC Wales and from them we can get an indication of the traffic picture throughout the country. Newport saw the lowest increase in traffic in Wales, with just over 420,000 (30%) more vehicles recorded. This goes against the trend in the rest of south Wales, with every other site recording a increase higher than 70%. Newport: 30% Swansea: 72% Magor: 75% Cardiff: 81% Beulah, near Llanwrtyd Wells in Powys saw an increase of 58% - the lowest figure outside the M4. Beulah: 58% Wrexham: 64% Southgate near Aberystwyth: 70% Dolgellau, Gwynedd: 79% Conwy: 94% This recent increase follows an initial dip over the Christmas period, which saw the lowest traffic levels of 2020. The traffic levels we are seeing now were not reached last year until the very end of June, 14 weeks after the first restrictions were put in place. During summer the amount of road traffic recovered to levels seen before any restrictions were in place. However each subsequent lockdown is seeming to have less of an effect on the numbers. Prof Stuart Cole, emeritus professor of transport at the University of South Wales, said people were ""overcoming the scare that was put about"" during the first lockdown, but added that commuting was likely to fall because of homeworking. ""People just think 'well this is really efficient, I can talk to anybody just as efficiently'. So I think the new market's going to be leisure for the trains,"" he said. John Parkinson, head of psychology at Bangor University, said while he acknowledged the impact of ""lockdown fatigue,"" he thought people's intentions to follow the rules remained ""incredibly high."" ""If you have an end-point it should help people, it helps planning, commitment, and it helps motivation. But he said as vaccination rates rose, there could be a belief that ""it must be safe now"". ""So I imagine that could have a negative impact on compliance to rules."" Conwy has seen one of the largest traffic increases in Wales, with just under the double the amount of traffic recorded. Data released by Google allows us to calculate changes in travel behaviour of communities over time, compared to a baseline figure taken in January-February 2020. Using this data for Conwy, we can see that the number of people visiting parks and outdoor recreation areas has often reached levels higher than even before the pandemic. The amount of people visiting supermarkets has stayed at around the same level. However visits to retail and hospitality destinations in general have recently seen levels almost 80% lower than pre-lockdown numbers. Forecasts suggest public transport usage will take years to recover One striking decrease in behaviour, seen throughout Wales, is the decrease in people using public transport, with many regions showing more than a 60% reduction, potentially leading to inflated road traffic. Prof Cole said he thought messaging about avoiding public transport would have a lasting impact on passenger numbers. ""You believe [the government] when they say the scientists have said to stay at home, you must not travel on public transport, public transport is dangerous. ""That will be in people's minds for quite some time,"" he said. He said reassuring people public transport is safe would take a lot of time, with the most optimistic forecasts showing figures returning to 80% of the pre-pandemic level over the next three years, and only then with no restrictions in place.

LiveLivePM praises âastonishingâ effort as England schools return4 minutes ago4 minutes ago Thanks for joining usThanks for joining us6 minutes ago What's been happening today?What's been happening today?12 minutes ago Analysis: Delicate balance to be struck as schools returnAnalysis: Delicate balance to be struck as schools return,"UK PM Boris Johnson praises ""astonishing"" effort of teachers, staff and parents in No 10 news conference But ""emotional"" return of England's schools will have an impact on spread of virus, he warns England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries says declining rates are ""pleasing"" but ""new wave could easily take off again"" Millions of children in England are back in class after more than two months of home-schooling Primary schools have fully opened for all pupils, while secondary schools will have a phased return to class Secondary school pupils in England will take regular rapid Covid tests and need to wear masks in class 65 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test in the UK, while a further 4,712 people have tested positive, daily figures show Hundreds of thousands of care home residents in England will be able to receive indoor visits from a nominated friend or relative from today Scotland's first minister has said mass gatherings of Rangers fans celebrating the side's Premiership win were ""disgraceful"" Edited by Rob Corp and Paul Gribben Thanks for reading today's live updates on the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and across the globe. Today's updates were brought to you by Hamish Mackay, John Harrison, Alice Evans and Jennifer Scott. The editors were Rob Corp and Paul Gribben. Thanks for joining us. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic until tomorrow. But before we do, here's a re-cap of today's main headlines:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In the Covid briefing, the prime minister talked about a
âbig budget of riskâ from opening schools, adding transmission will inevitably
rise. While children are at incredibly low risk and evidence
suggests they are less susceptible to infection and transmit less - certainly
younger children - having millions mixing in school will of course lead to some
spread. Schools, after all, are not islands. Children go home and mix with
their families. During the November lockdown cases fell despite schools
being open. But modelling forecasts that may not be the case this time.
That is because of the new more contagious UK variant has become dominant since
then. Experts say this could pushthe R numberabove one, leading a growth in
cases. But the bigger question is whether this matters. With the
rollout of the vaccination programme â nearly half of adults have received
their first dose â the link between infection rates and serious illness has
begun to be broken. There are though still vulnerable people who are yet to be
vaccinated or are only just building up their immunity following a vaccination. This is why there is a delicate balance to be struck. Some
rise can be tolerated, but not too much. Many travel businesses continue to be ""excluded"" from government support despite not trading for almost a year due to Covid, according to an industry trade body. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) says tour operators, online travel companies and home-based workers are not eligible for government grants. As uncertainty over testing regimes and quarantine continues to hit bookings, ABTA is calling on the government to make support available for all travel businesses that have been forced to shut due to the pandemic. A number of travel firms have fallen into administration in the last year. In Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget last week, the government extended the furlough scheme, business rates relief and VAT reductions. It also extended grants for struggling retail businesses. But ABTA says: ""We urge the government to... make grants available to all travel businesses, not just those with retail premises, recognising that the reopening of overseas travel will come later than the other sectors and will likely be gradual."" Read the full story here. Noah painted the background for this piece, which was finished artist and NHS worker Freeman (@freeman_uk on Instagram) A 12-year-old boy's lockdown art project has raised about Â£100,000 for charity, after 250 artists came forward to help him. Noah, who hashydrocephalus,external, epilepsy and cerebral palsy, began painting on cardboard at home in Dedham, Essex, a year ago. His father posted on Instagram, asking artists to finish the pictures. They weredisplayed in a gallerybefore being auctioned for theColchester and Ipswich Hospitals Charity,external. Mr Jones sent the backgrounds that his son created to the artists, who finished them and posted them back. More than 200 pieces were then auctioned on eBay and raised more than Â£80,000, with the rest made up from book sales featuring the art and donations. Noah's father Nathan Jones says they had originally hoped to raise Â£500 and are ""absolutely stunned"" by the total. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked if
more money would be made available to help people deal with the financial
impact of having to self-isolate. âWhat weâre doing in addition to helping people to self-isolate - in addition to the Â£500 support and all the rest of it
- is giving money to councils. I have a figure of Â£170m in my head to help
them give people who really need it help to self-isolate,â he said. Weâre not sure where the Â£170m figure
comes from. However, we know that since the end of
September, the government has given councils Â£110m to fund the Test and Trace
Support Payment scheme. This scheme gives those on low-incomes a
Â£500 payment, if they can prove they will be financially affected if they have
to stay at home for the 10-day isolation period. We recently used a Freedom of Information request for figures on this for all councils in England and Wales. Their
responses showed that two-thirds of people who applied for the payment did not
get it. Councils and unions told us that the
criteria for getting the payment was too tough. You can find out more about this here. Queuing for Covid tests at the Harris Academy in Beckenham, south London The first day back at school for millions of children in Englandhas ""gone well"", say head teachers. They are reporting high levels of take-up of Covid tests and compliance with new rules on wearing masks in secondary school classrooms. Primary schools have opened in full, but most secondary schools are phasing a return to allow time for Covid tests. As we reported earlier, at a Downing Street news conference the prime minister described it as a ""big day and an emotional day"" for families. Indoor care home visits have resumed in England today and the BBC has been speaking to some of those affected. Beccy Pile, 48, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, spent an hour with her 23 year-old son today at his care home in Essex earlier. Luke has lived at the home for adults with learning
disabilities for the last three years - but Beccy has only managed to see him twice in the last year before today. âIt feels like itâs been forever since I last saw him,"" she says. ""It
was incredible. He was really excited and had tidied his flat. âWe had to stop ourselves from hugging each other because
thatâs not allowed yet but he has a sign for a hug where he puts his arms
across his chest which he did and he blew me lots of kisses. âThe visit was incredibly well-managed. I only had an hour
but it didnât feel like an hour because the home had everything ready. ""I had my
test in the car park half an hour before and as soon as it was negative I could
go in and spend my time with him. âI did have a moment where I thought âwhat if itâs positive
because Luke thinks Iâm coming?â I thought I might have to just see him through
the window or something but thankfully it was OK."" Boris Johnson has finished his Downing Street briefing. If you're just a joining us, here's a recap of what was said: Asked by the Metro about a proposed 1% pay rise for some NHS workers, the PM repeats his ""gratitude"" for the nursing profession during the pandemic. He says that rather than a greater pay rise -which is what the unions have called for- many nurses have told him they most want to solve staffing issues in the health service and boost the number of people training to be nurses. ""I understand of course that the whole sector has been under massive pressure,"" he says, adding that the government has been investing ""colossally"" to support the NHS during Covid. The next journalist points to reports about parents failing to give permission for testing their children, and asks if they are ""undermining the safety of their classmates"". Dr Harries says she does recognise that for many parents ""it is quite an unusual ask"" and ""it will take time for families to get used to that"". But she believes that, ""with time"", families will give their permission, as it will not just help students, but will be ""for their family's benefit as well"". The final question is away from Covid and about the ongoing post-Brexit issues with trade, especially in Northern Ireland. Asked if it was time he ""came clean"" that his Brexit deal was not as great as he claimed, Johnson sticks to his guns by backing it. He says there is ""no question"" that there have been ""teething problems"" - but he believes they can ""all be ironed out... with goodwill and imagination"". Next up is a question for Dr Jenny Harries, after unions said schools could close again in the near future. Asked if she agrees, she says ""hopefully not"" as education is ""critical"" - adding the public can be ""very optimistic"". But she warns there may be a short period with more students testing positive and being taken out of school, advising people to look to ""three or four weeks' time"" for an accurate reading of how it is going. The PM is then pressed again about Harry and Meghan, and asked if the Royal family is racist. Johnson jokingly praises the reporter for his ""determined attempt to involve me in this story"". ""But he adds: ""I really think when it comes to matters with the Royal family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing."" Ben Kentish of LBC asks whether lockdown could be eased a little earlier than the PM has set out in his roadmap, on the basis that the vaccine rollout is going so well. The PM says he agrees there are some ""encouraging signs"" in the data on vaccinations and declining case numbers, but that we must not forget there is a ""big budget of risk"" in reopening schools. He says ""the whole point"" of his cautious easing is to remember where we were last summer - when rates were relatively low - before a surge in cases in the autumn and winter. Johnson adds that he believes businesses would rather see a ""cautious and irreversible"" approach to easing measures than a ""hasty"" one that leads to them having to be closed down again. Harries adds that each stage of the roadmap involves waiting and checking, and ""we need that time period"" of four to five weeks of observation before moving on to the next phase. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent On International Women's Day, the prime minister says the burden of childcare and home-schooling has fallen
""disproportionately"" on women during the pandemic. Earlier, his spokeswoman told
reporters he was keen to hear from women in business how flexible working could
continue beyond the pandemic. Boris Johnson hosted a
virtual round table discussion with senior female business figures this
morning. But she said it was ""not
unreasonable"" to ask questions about the PM's attitude to
women given some of his past comments and work as a journalist. The BBC's Ben Wright asks if Johnson and Harries accept that infection rates will go up now that children in England are back in the classroom - and what would be an acceptable level. The PM says a risk of increased transmission now that schools are back is ""inevitable"". But he adds that immunity has ""bedded in"" for millions of people who have now had their first dose of the Covid vaccine, which means it's safe to continue with the reopening plans. As we approach the next steps of lockdown easing we must be ""very, very cautious,"" the PM warns. Harries adds that education is of public health importance ""just as much as Covid is"" so the UK should press on with getting children back to school. She adds that it will be difficult to tell what impact a return to schools has to the numbers, because social interaction will also increase as the roadmap continues. While the news conference is about the continuing pandemic, the PM is asked about the big story of the day -the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""I've always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country and  across the Commonwealth,"" he says. He says he's spent ""a long time"" not commenting on Royal Family matters and doesn't plan to make that change. The next question is on the rumoured spend of Â£200,000 on refurbishing the PM's Downing Street flat but Johnson does not reveal any details. He is then asked, with the vaccination programme significantly accelerated since his roadmap announced, would he consider speeding up exiting lockdown. Johnson says he understands ""the urgency that people feel"", but says the government must be ""driven by the data"". He says case rates are still very high and there are thousands still in hospital. Johnson says we must ""remain prudent"" and people would prefer ""security and certainty"" in the roadmap out of lockdown. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson is preparing
the public for a rise in coronavirus cases after the return of all pupils to
schools in England. He says the risk of increased
transmission is âinevitableâ, but that as the vaccine programme continued, immunity would be ""bedded in."" The key factor will be the
impact that has on the number of people admitted to hospital and in turn the
strain it puts on the NHS, which Dr Jenny Harries says would be ""considerably
less"". It's perhaps the first sign
of how the UK will manage and live with coronavirus cases long term after the
pandemic has passed. The press conference now moves to questions - starting with two from the public. The first - Arjun from Watford - asks about young people, saying they are at ""the bottom of the priority list"" and need more support. Johnson says ""the most important thing"" was getting young people back into school, which will make a ""massive difference"". For those thinking about jobs and their futures, he adds the government wants to ""give you the maximum possible help"" by supporting business. The second member of the public asks the PM about the much-rumoured vaccine passports and how under-16s might be able to travel. He says the government is looking at the way certificates could work, but adds they ""raise all sorts of issues"" around those who can't get vaccines, for example. Johnson says it is a ""novel"" idea for the UK, but says they may become part of our future. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the declining death and case rates in the UK are ""pleasing"" but should have ""some caution attached"". The case rate is still falling, she says, but is not uniform across the country. Harries says ""it's really important"" that everyone continues to practise social distancing and follows the rules in place. She adds that the case rate is back to around the levels the UK had in September, adding: ""This is a level at which a new wave could easily take off again from."" Boris Johnson says there now needs to be a ""concerted programme"" from the government to ensure it carries on with its ""cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom"". He says a quarter of the population has now been vaccinated and it has been at least three weeks since the most vulnerable had their first dose, giving him ""confidence"" in the first steps. As well as schools, changes today include being able to meet one to one outside, and for people to visit loved ones in care homes. Johnson warns, however, that this will have ""an impact on the spread of the virus"" - but promises that ""at all times, we will be driven by the data"" on opening up. Â© 2025 BBC.

Skin colour remark 'not Queen nor Duke' - Oprah,"This video can not be played Oprah Winfrey: ""Neither his grandmother nor grandfather were part of those conversations [on skin colour]"". Oprah Winfrey has said Prince Harry clarified it was neither the Queen nor the Duke of Edinburgh who questioned what his son's skin colour would be. Winfrey told CBS News on Monday the prince ""did not tell me who was part of those conversations"". The revelation that a family member wondered ""how dark"" Archie's complexion might be came during a TV interview that aired overnight in the US. The Duchess of Sussex had described the remarks as a low point. ""He did not share the identity with me but he wanted to make sure I knew, and if I had an opportunity to share it, that it was not his grandmother or grandfather that were part of those conversations,"" Winfrey said. When asked for further details on Monday, Winfrey said she ""tried to get that answer on camera and off"" but the prince did not elaborate. She told CBS This Morning that she was shocked to hear about the skin colour remarks during the interview. ""Even on the take, you can hear me go, 'whoa I cannot believe you are saying this now'."" When asked why she thinks the couple agreed to speak with her, Winfrey said she felt they ""were ready to do it"" after having been ""lied about for a series of years"". ""I said to my team, the most important question to be answered here at the end of this show will be, 'why did they leave'?"" Winfrey said. ""And I think the stories of blindsiding the Queen were very damaging to them and also hurtful because they understood clearly that there had been months and months of preparation."" CBS has also shared new clips from the couple's three hour interview with the chat show host. In one, when asked by Winfrey if the couple left the UK because of racism, Prince Harry said that ""was a large part of it"". Harry: Tabloid racism 'large part' of why we left Meghan 'didn't want to be alive any more' 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' In another clip discussing how the UK press treated other members of the royal family, Meghan told Winfrey that ""rude and racist are not the same"". ""You've also had a press team that goes on the record to defend you especially when they know something's not true, and that didn't happen for us,"" the duchess said. Winfrey also asked Prince Harry if any family members had apologised to him for the reasons he felt he had to leave. Prince Harry replied, ""sadly not"".

NHS approves 'most expensive' drug for genetic disease,"Babies with SMA need help to breathe A life-changing drug has been approved by the NHS to treat babies with a rare fatal genetic disorder. The gene therapy Zolgensma offers hope to infants with a type of severe spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). With a list price of Â£1.79m it could become the most expensive drug ever approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). NHS England says it has negotiated an undisclosed discount that is 'fair to taxpayers'. The Scottish Medicines Consortium also announced later on Monday that it has approved the drug. Around 80 babies and young children with type 1 SMA could benefit from the treatment each year in England, say experts. The condition causes muscle weakness and affects movement and breathing, meaning most babies who have it do not live past two years without intervention. When a lottery 'wins' sick babies life-saving drugs Almost 1m Belgians pay for life-saving drug Children with the condition often need breathing assistance or a feeding tube. The one-off treatment has been described in the British Medical Journal as""the most expensive drug course of treatment ever"",external. In draft guidance, Nice ruled that although the drug was hugely expensive, its use is justified by the exceptional impact it can have on young children. It is hoped that if the drug is given to children in their first six months of life before they develop symptoms, it might come close to being a cure by halting disease progression. Tora received the gene therapy treatment while living in the US Rajdeep Patgiri's daughter Tora had the treatment in the US when she was nearly 11 months old. Rajdeep says it has made a big difference to her life and what she can now do: ""She has been able to sit independently...she can stand independently and walk with assistance. So a lot of progress. ""Before, at the time of diagnosis and before treatment, time felt like an enemy because every day you expect something to deteriorate. And now, time is a friend because every day she improves even by tiny bits so there is always something to look forward to."" The drug contains a replica of the missing gene SMN1. In studies, it has helped babies to reach milestones such as breathe without a ventilator, sit up on their own and crawl and walk after a single infusion treatment. At present only limited data about the impact of Zolgensma is available from clinical trials, so any decision to give it to older children aged between six and 12 months will have to be taken by a national team of clinicians. Another drug called Spinraza, which is already available, can help slow the degeneration in some SMA patients, but it must be taken for life. Meindert Boysen, deputy chief executive and director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation at Nice, said: ""Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a very serious, debilitating and distressing condition that has very significant effects on every aspect of life of those with SMA, and their families and carers. ""As is the case with many new treatments for very rare diseases, limited evidence means there are uncertainties about the long-term benefits. ""But for some babies who are diagnosed before they have symptoms, it might come close to being a cure."" NHS England Chief Executive Sir Simon Stevens said they had ""moved mountains"" to make the treatment available.

"Fears for 5,000 steel jobs as lender collapsesThe main backer of the UK's third-largest steelmaker has gone into administration.Business","Sanjeev Gupta, who has been called the ""saviour of steel"" The principal financial backer of one of the UK's largest industrial groups has fallen into administration. Specialist bank Greensill Capital was the main lender to businessman Sanjeev Gupta's sprawling empire, which includes Liberty Steel. The appointment of administrators to Greensill puts 5,000 jobs at risk at Liberty Steel and other firms. In a court filing, Greensill said Mr Gupta's operations were in ""financial difficulty"" and defaulting on debt. Mr Gupta declined to comment on the claims, but his business GFG Alliance earlier said that it had adequate funding for its current needs. Union officials are to hold crisis talks with the steel magnate on Tuesday. Liberty owns 12 steel plants in the UK including in Rotherham, Motherwell, Stocksbridge, Newport and Hartlepool. The Community union said: ""Sanjeev Gupta needs to tell us exactly what the administration means for Liberty's UK businesses and how he plans to protect jobs. The future of Liberty's strategic steel assets must be secured and we are ready to work with all stakeholders to find a solution."" A spokesperson for Grant Thornton said its insolvency practitioners Chris Laverty, Trevor O'Sullivan and Will Stagg had been appointed as joint administrators of Greensill Capital and Greensill Capital Management Company. ""The joint administrators are in continued discussion with an interested party in relation to the purchase of certain Greensill Capital assets. As these discussions remain ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,"" the spokesperson added. Mr Gupta, who has been called the ""saviour of steel"", has defied pessimists in the industry for years by buying up seemingly unloved industrial assets. These included steel and aluminium plants that many thought could not be run profitably in the face of cut price competition from China. The BBC understands that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng held an emergency meeting on Sunday with the chief executive of Liberty Steel UK, John Ferriman. They discussed contingency plans in the event that Greensill went bust. It is understood the options did not include nationalisation. Further meetings are expected later on Monday. Mr Kwarteng also chaired a meeting of UK steel executives on Friday at which the future of Liberty, owned by Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance, was brought up, However, it was not discussed in any detail with this wider group, which included union bosses. Liberty Steel is the UK's third-largest steelmaker, employing 3,000 people at 11 sites. Another 2,000 people in engineering businesses within the group are also involved. That's a substantial chunk of the 32,000 people who work in the industry. Employment and output have fallen significantly for the steel industry over the last four decades. In its heyday as the state-owned British Steel Corporation in the early 1970s, it had 10 times as many workers. The whole UK steel industry has gone through a chequered period of ownership since it was privatised in the 1980s. However, the sector is still considered important by government ministers, regional politicians and business leaders. Many of Liberty Steel's assets were part of Tata Steel's UK business until they changed hands for Â£100m in 2017. When Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance snapped them up, he was hailed as saving thousands of UK jobs. But his empire has often been criticised for its complicated structure and lack of transparent accounting. With news of the financial problems facing Greensill Capital, one of Mr Gupta's key sources of finance, those criticisms are now coming home to roost. Greensill, run by former investment banker Lex Greensill, counts former Prime Minister David Cameron among its paid advisers. The BBC has approached Mr Cameron for comment. The company specialises in short-term supply chain financing to provide capital for businesses around the world. However, it too has been accused of opaque accounting. Greensill's heavy exposure to Mr Gupta's business has prompted Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to Â£10bn worth of funds held as security. Their heavy exposure to each other has proved disastrous for both Greensill and Gupta. Mr Gupta's financing requirements constituted more than 50% of Greensill's lending volumes. While figures are not available for the proportion of his funding that Mr Gupta raised from Greensill, sources close to Greensill put his funding needs from the firm at $70m a day. A spokesman for Mr Gupta said Liberty's operations were ""running as normal"", had adequate funding for their current needs and that the refinancing plans were progressing. It added that a recent upturn in global steel prices was beneficial for the company's prospects. Liberty is a major supplier to the public, including hydro-power contracts in Scotland and steel contracts for the Ministry of Defence. The government said it was ""monitoring the situation closely"". ""This is a deeply concerning situation and a very worrying time for Liberty Steel workers,"" said Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow minister for business and consumers. ""It's vital that the government acts with the urgency required and doesn't wash their hands of the situation.""

Mr Gupta declined to comment on the claims, but his business GFG Alliance earlier said that it had adequate funding for its current needs. Union officials are to hold crisis talks with the steel magnate on Tuesday. Liberty owns 12 steel plants in the UK including in Rotherham, Motherwell, Stocksbridge, Newport and Hartlepool. The Community union said: ""Sanjeev Gupta needs to tell us exactly what the administration means for Liberty's UK businesses and how he plans to protect jobs. The future of Liberty's strategic steel assets must be secured and we are ready to work with all stakeholders to find a solution."" A spokesperson for Grant Thornton said its insolvency practitioners Chris Laverty, Trevor O'Sullivan and Will Stagg had been appointed as joint administrators of Greensill Capital and Greensill Capital Management Company. ""The joint administrators are in continued discussion with an interested party in relation to the purchase of certain Greensill Capital assets. As these discussions remain ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,"" the spokesperson added. Mr Gupta, who has been called the ""saviour of steel"", has defied pessimists in the industry for years by buying up seemingly unloved industrial assets. These included steel and aluminium plants that many thought could not be run profitably in the face of cut price competition from China. The BBC understands that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng held an emergency meeting on Sunday with the chief executive of Liberty Steel UK, John Ferriman. They discussed contingency plans in the event that Greensill went bust. It is understood the options did not include nationalisation. Further meetings are expected later on Monday. Mr Kwarteng also chaired a meeting of UK steel executives on Friday at which the future of Liberty, owned by Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance, was brought up, However, it was not discussed in any detail with this wider group, which included union bosses. Liberty Steel is the UK's third-largest steelmaker, employing 3,000 people at 11 sites. Another 2,000 people in engineering businesses within the group are also involved. That's a substantial chunk of the 32,000 people who work in the industry. Employment and output have fallen significantly for the steel industry over the last four decades. In its heyday as the state-owned British Steel Corporation in the early 1970s, it had 10 times as many workers. The whole UK steel industry has gone through a chequered period of ownership since it was privatised in the 1980s. However, the sector is still considered important by government ministers, regional politicians and business leaders. Many of Liberty Steel's assets were part of Tata Steel's UK business until they changed hands for Â£100m in 2017. When Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance snapped them up, he was hailed as saving thousands of UK jobs. But his empire has often been criticised for its complicated structure and lack of transparent accounting. With news of the financial problems facing Greensill Capital, one of Mr Gupta's key sources of finance, those criticisms are now coming home to roost. Greensill, run by former investment banker Lex Greensill, counts former Prime Minister David Cameron among its paid advisers. The BBC has approached Mr Cameron for comment. The company specialises in short-term supply chain financing to provide capital for businesses around the world. However, it too has been accused of opaque accounting. Greensill's heavy exposure to Mr Gupta's business has prompted Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to Â£10bn worth of funds held as security. Their heavy exposure to each other has proved disastrous for both Greensill and Gupta. Mr Gupta's financing requirements constituted more than 50% of Greensill's lending volumes. While figures are not available for the proportion of his funding that Mr Gupta raised from Greensill, sources close to Greensill put his funding needs from the firm at $70m a day. A spokesman for Mr Gupta said Liberty's operations were ""running as normal"", had adequate funding for their current needs and that the refinancing plans were progressing. It added that a recent upturn in global steel prices was beneficial for the company's prospects. Liberty is a major supplier to the public, including hydro-power contracts in Scotland and steel contracts for the Ministry of Defence. The government said it was ""monitoring the situation closely"". ""This is a deeply concerning situation and a very worrying time for Liberty Steel workers,"" said Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow minister for business and consumers. ""It's vital that the government acts with the urgency required and doesn't wash their hands of the situation.""

George Floyd death: How will jurors be selected?,"Derek Chauvin faces trial after posting a $1m (Â£720,000) bail in October It was video footage seen across the world - Derek Chauvin with his knee pressed on the neck of George Floyd for about nine minutes before he died. Now the former US police officer faces trial on second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. Three other dismissed officers will stand trial together later this year, but proceedings in Mr Chauvin's trial will start on Monday, when jury selection begins. Live updates on murder trial A pool of eligible local citizens has been called to appear by Hennepin County in Minnesota. From them, a jury of 12 and four alternates will be selected. It could take weeks. Although it is highly unlikely potential jurors will have no prior knowledge of the case - George Floyd's death in May last year in Minneapolis inspired weeks of global protests - they will be questioned to determine whether they will be able to judge Derek Chauvin fairly. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life How are African-Americans treated under the law? 'Stop yelling', officer told gasping George Floyd The prosecution and defence can both ask Judge Peter Cahill to dismiss a potential juror ""for cause"" if they perceive bias. The prosecution can also dismiss nine potential jurors - and the defence team 15 - without giving any reason, although this can be objected to. This video can not be played George Floyd death: Whatâs changed, 100 days later? Once 16 people have been approved, the jury can be seated. The trial itself will not begin until 29 March. Each potential juror has already been asked to fill in a 16-page questionnaire about the case. The main thrust is to determine familiarity with the case and issues such as a potential juror's own interactions with law enforcement. Key questions include: How many times did you see the video of George Floyd's death? Did you participate in marches against police brutality and, if so, did you carry a sign? What are your views of the group Blue Lives Matter (the movement supporting police) - favourable or unfavourable? Do you believe our criminal justice system works? How potential jurors respond can lead to either defence or prosecution dismissing them. The case prompted a wave of calls for the officers to face justice, so will be closely watched Prof Valerie Hans, a jury researcher based at Cornell Law School, says the questionnaire is more detailed and personal than most pre-trial documents, and asks about their ""deepest attitudes on some of the most important political and social topics of the day"". Prof Hans says the aim for the two teams is to get ""a sense of whether or not a prospective juror will be open to the kinds of arguments that they intend to make over the course of the trial"". The selection process is different from the UK. Jury trials there are less common, and jurors - picked at random - don't know which trial they will serve on until they've been sworn in. Jurors can only be dismissed by a judge in very specific circumstances. In cases involving issues such as racism, the selection process can be seen as hugely important to the outcome of the trial and how fair it is perceived. A lack of diversity could lead to questions about the legitimacy of the verdict. The jury pool in Hennepin County was 80% white and 8% black in the financial year to September 2020, the New York Times reported, a bigger gap than for Minneapolis as a whole (64% to 19%). The vetting system does try to ensure that a cross-section of society is represented, but at the same time, both defence and prosecution will be looking for jurors that will bring them a favourable outcome. In high-stakes trials, they often use special consultants who look at factors such as the jurors' backgrounds and even their body language. Prof Hans says the judge will need to keep a close eye on patterns emerging among dismissals of potential jurors by the prosecution or defence, as this cannot be done on race grounds. Security has been upped around where the trial will take place In general terms, legal experts say white jurors are less likely to convict law enforcement officials, although it is in unclear how much of this has changed following the worldwide reaction to the Floyd case. The chosen jurors will be partially sequestered, or isolated, during the trial and fully sequestered once deliberation starts. They will also remain anonymous until the judge allows their identities to be made public. It's not uncommon for US jurors to speak out about their deliberations afterwards, and in some infamous examples, like the OJ Simpson trial, some have even gone on to write books about their experiences. Derek Chauvin faces a long trial - it could take weeks just to select jurors The high-profile video of George Floyd's death brought an outpouring of anger in the US and beyond, but securing a legal conviction is another matter. The first issue is the charges. To convict of second-degree murder, jurors must find that Mr Chauvin had committed, or was trying to commit, a felony that caused the death. Second-degree manslaughter would mean Mr Chauvin had consciously taken the chance of causing death or injury through his negligent actions. The defence will point to Floyd's health issues or drug consumption as a likely cause of death - although the judge has already written that the prosecution only has to prove Mr Chauvin's actions were a ""substantial causal factor"". The defence will also argue Mr Chauvin was authorised to use force in his role as a police officer, in an attempt to undermine the accusation that he was trying to commit a felony. The prosecution will rely on the strong video evidence, pointing to the length of time Floyd's neck was pressed as passers-by pleaded for him, and alleging that the officer broke police department policy. It will also submit evidence of Mr Chauvin's actions in separate cases. This will include an instance where the officer restrained a female by placing his knee on her neck.

LiveLivePM to lead No 10 briefing as England schools return8 minutes ago,"UK PM Boris Johnson praises ""astonishing"" effort of teachers, staff and parents in No 10 news conference But ""emotional"" return of England's schools will have an impact on spread of virus, he warns England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries says declining rates are ""pleasing"" but ""new wave could easily take off again"" Millions of children in England are back in class after more than two months of home-schooling Primary schools have fully opened for all pupils, while secondary schools will have a phased return to class Secondary school pupils in England will take regular rapid Covid tests and need to wear masks in class 65 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test in the UK, while a further 4,712 people have tested positive, daily figures show Hundreds of thousands of care home residents in England will be able to receive indoor visits from a nominated friend or relative from today Scotland's first minister has said mass gatherings of Rangers fans celebrating the side's Premiership win were ""disgraceful"" Edited by Rob Corp and Paul Gribben Thanks for reading today's live updates on the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and across the globe. Today's updates were brought to you by Hamish Mackay, John Harrison, Alice Evans and Jennifer Scott. The editors were Rob Corp and Paul Gribben. Thanks for joining us. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic until tomorrow. But before we do, here's a re-cap of today's main headlines:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In the Covid briefing, the prime minister talked about a
âbig budget of riskâ from opening schools, adding transmission will inevitably
rise. While children are at incredibly low risk and evidence
suggests they are less susceptible to infection and transmit less - certainly
younger children - having millions mixing in school will of course lead to some
spread. Schools, after all, are not islands. Children go home and mix with
their families. During the November lockdown cases fell despite schools
being open. But modelling forecasts that may not be the case this time.
That is because of the new more contagious UK variant has become dominant since
then. Experts say this could pushthe R numberabove one, leading a growth in
cases. But the bigger question is whether this matters. With the
rollout of the vaccination programme â nearly half of adults have received
their first dose â the link between infection rates and serious illness has
begun to be broken. There are though still vulnerable people who are yet to be
vaccinated or are only just building up their immunity following a vaccination. This is why there is a delicate balance to be struck. Some
rise can be tolerated, but not too much. Many travel businesses continue to be ""excluded"" from government support despite not trading for almost a year due to Covid, according to an industry trade body. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) says tour operators, online travel companies and home-based workers are not eligible for government grants. As uncertainty over testing regimes and quarantine continues to hit bookings, ABTA is calling on the government to make support available for all travel businesses that have been forced to shut due to the pandemic. A number of travel firms have fallen into administration in the last year. In Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget last week, the government extended the furlough scheme, business rates relief and VAT reductions. It also extended grants for struggling retail businesses. But ABTA says: ""We urge the government to... make grants available to all travel businesses, not just those with retail premises, recognising that the reopening of overseas travel will come later than the other sectors and will likely be gradual."" Read the full story here. Noah painted the background for this piece, which was finished artist and NHS worker Freeman (@freeman_uk on Instagram) A 12-year-old boy's lockdown art project has raised about Â£100,000 for charity, after 250 artists came forward to help him. Noah, who hashydrocephalus,external, epilepsy and cerebral palsy, began painting on cardboard at home in Dedham, Essex, a year ago. His father posted on Instagram, asking artists to finish the pictures. They weredisplayed in a gallerybefore being auctioned for theColchester and Ipswich Hospitals Charity,external. Mr Jones sent the backgrounds that his son created to the artists, who finished them and posted them back. More than 200 pieces were then auctioned on eBay and raised more than Â£80,000, with the rest made up from book sales featuring the art and donations. Noah's father Nathan Jones says they had originally hoped to raise Â£500 and are ""absolutely stunned"" by the total. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked if
more money would be made available to help people deal with the financial
impact of having to self-isolate. âWhat weâre doing in addition to helping people to self-isolate - in addition to the Â£500 support and all the rest of it
- is giving money to councils. I have a figure of Â£170m in my head to help
them give people who really need it help to self-isolate,â he said. Weâre not sure where the Â£170m figure
comes from. However, we know that since the end of
September, the government has given councils Â£110m to fund the Test and Trace
Support Payment scheme. This scheme gives those on low-incomes a
Â£500 payment, if they can prove they will be financially affected if they have
to stay at home for the 10-day isolation period. We recently used a Freedom of Information request for figures on this for all councils in England and Wales. Their
responses showed that two-thirds of people who applied for the payment did not
get it. Councils and unions told us that the
criteria for getting the payment was too tough. You can find out more about this here. Queuing for Covid tests at the Harris Academy in Beckenham, south London The first day back at school for millions of children in Englandhas ""gone well"", say head teachers. They are reporting high levels of take-up of Covid tests and compliance with new rules on wearing masks in secondary school classrooms. Primary schools have opened in full, but most secondary schools are phasing a return to allow time for Covid tests. As we reported earlier, at a Downing Street news conference the prime minister described it as a ""big day and an emotional day"" for families. Indoor care home visits have resumed in England today and the BBC has been speaking to some of those affected. Beccy Pile, 48, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, spent an hour with her 23 year-old son today at his care home in Essex earlier. Luke has lived at the home for adults with learning
disabilities for the last three years - but Beccy has only managed to see him twice in the last year before today. âIt feels like itâs been forever since I last saw him,"" she says. ""It
was incredible. He was really excited and had tidied his flat. âWe had to stop ourselves from hugging each other because
thatâs not allowed yet but he has a sign for a hug where he puts his arms
across his chest which he did and he blew me lots of kisses. âThe visit was incredibly well-managed. I only had an hour
but it didnât feel like an hour because the home had everything ready. ""I had my
test in the car park half an hour before and as soon as it was negative I could
go in and spend my time with him. âI did have a moment where I thought âwhat if itâs positive
because Luke thinks Iâm coming?â I thought I might have to just see him through
the window or something but thankfully it was OK."" Boris Johnson has finished his Downing Street briefing. If you're just a joining us, here's a recap of what was said: Asked by the Metro about a proposed 1% pay rise for some NHS workers, the PM repeats his ""gratitude"" for the nursing profession during the pandemic. He says that rather than a greater pay rise -which is what the unions have called for- many nurses have told him they most want to solve staffing issues in the health service and boost the number of people training to be nurses. ""I understand of course that the whole sector has been under massive pressure,"" he says, adding that the government has been investing ""colossally"" to support the NHS during Covid. The next journalist points to reports about parents failing to give permission for testing their children, and asks if they are ""undermining the safety of their classmates"". Dr Harries says she does recognise that for many parents ""it is quite an unusual ask"" and ""it will take time for families to get used to that"". But she believes that, ""with time"", families will give their permission, as it will not just help students, but will be ""for their family's benefit as well"". The final question is away from Covid and about the ongoing post-Brexit issues with trade, especially in Northern Ireland. Asked if it was time he ""came clean"" that his Brexit deal was not as great as he claimed, Johnson sticks to his guns by backing it. He says there is ""no question"" that there have been ""teething problems"" - but he believes they can ""all be ironed out... with goodwill and imagination"". Next up is a question for Dr Jenny Harries, after unions said schools could close again in the near future. Asked if she agrees, she says ""hopefully not"" as education is ""critical"" - adding the public can be ""very optimistic"". But she warns there may be a short period with more students testing positive and being taken out of school, advising people to look to ""three or four weeks' time"" for an accurate reading of how it is going. The PM is then pressed again about Harry and Meghan, and asked if the Royal family is racist. Johnson jokingly praises the reporter for his ""determined attempt to involve me in this story"". ""But he adds: ""I really think when it comes to matters with the Royal family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing."" Ben Kentish of LBC asks whether lockdown could be eased a little earlier than the PM has set out in his roadmap, on the basis that the vaccine rollout is going so well. The PM says he agrees there are some ""encouraging signs"" in the data on vaccinations and declining case numbers, but that we must not forget there is a ""big budget of risk"" in reopening schools. He says ""the whole point"" of his cautious easing is to remember where we were last summer - when rates were relatively low - before a surge in cases in the autumn and winter. Johnson adds that he believes businesses would rather see a ""cautious and irreversible"" approach to easing measures than a ""hasty"" one that leads to them having to be closed down again. Harries adds that each stage of the roadmap involves waiting and checking, and ""we need that time period"" of four to five weeks of observation before moving on to the next phase. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent On International Women's Day, the prime minister says the burden of childcare and home-schooling has fallen
""disproportionately"" on women during the pandemic. Earlier, his spokeswoman told
reporters he was keen to hear from women in business how flexible working could
continue beyond the pandemic. Boris Johnson hosted a
virtual round table discussion with senior female business figures this
morning. But she said it was ""not
unreasonable"" to ask questions about the PM's attitude to
women given some of his past comments and work as a journalist. The BBC's Ben Wright asks if Johnson and Harries accept that infection rates will go up now that children in England are back in the classroom - and what would be an acceptable level. The PM says a risk of increased transmission now that schools are back is ""inevitable"". But he adds that immunity has ""bedded in"" for millions of people who have now had their first dose of the Covid vaccine, which means it's safe to continue with the reopening plans. As we approach the next steps of lockdown easing we must be ""very, very cautious,"" the PM warns. Harries adds that education is of public health importance ""just as much as Covid is"" so the UK should press on with getting children back to school. She adds that it will be difficult to tell what impact a return to schools has to the numbers, because social interaction will also increase as the roadmap continues. While the news conference is about the continuing pandemic, the PM is asked about the big story of the day -the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""I've always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country and  across the Commonwealth,"" he says. He says he's spent ""a long time"" not commenting on Royal Family matters and doesn't plan to make that change. The next question is on the rumoured spend of Â£200,000 on refurbishing the PM's Downing Street flat but Johnson does not reveal any details. He is then asked, with the vaccination programme significantly accelerated since his roadmap announced, would he consider speeding up exiting lockdown. Johnson says he understands ""the urgency that people feel"", but says the government must be ""driven by the data"". He says case rates are still very high and there are thousands still in hospital. Johnson says we must ""remain prudent"" and people would prefer ""security and certainty"" in the roadmap out of lockdown. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson is preparing
the public for a rise in coronavirus cases after the return of all pupils to
schools in England. He says the risk of increased
transmission is âinevitableâ, but that as the vaccine programme continued, immunity would be ""bedded in."" The key factor will be the
impact that has on the number of people admitted to hospital and in turn the
strain it puts on the NHS, which Dr Jenny Harries says would be ""considerably
less"". It's perhaps the first sign
of how the UK will manage and live with coronavirus cases long term after the
pandemic has passed. The press conference now moves to questions - starting with two from the public. The first - Arjun from Watford - asks about young people, saying they are at ""the bottom of the priority list"" and need more support. Johnson says ""the most important thing"" was getting young people back into school, which will make a ""massive difference"". For those thinking about jobs and their futures, he adds the government wants to ""give you the maximum possible help"" by supporting business. The second member of the public asks the PM about the much-rumoured vaccine passports and how under-16s might be able to travel. He says the government is looking at the way certificates could work, but adds they ""raise all sorts of issues"" around those who can't get vaccines, for example. Johnson says it is a ""novel"" idea for the UK, but says they may become part of our future. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the declining death and case rates in the UK are ""pleasing"" but should have ""some caution attached"". The case rate is still falling, she says, but is not uniform across the country. Harries says ""it's really important"" that everyone continues to practise social distancing and follows the rules in place. She adds that the case rate is back to around the levels the UK had in September, adding: ""This is a level at which a new wave could easily take off again from."" Boris Johnson says there now needs to be a ""concerted programme"" from the government to ensure it carries on with its ""cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom"". He says a quarter of the population has now been vaccinated and it has been at least three weeks since the most vulnerable had their first dose, giving him ""confidence"" in the first steps. As well as schools, changes today include being able to meet one to one outside, and for people to visit loved ones in care homes. Johnson warns, however, that this will have ""an impact on the spread of the virus"" - but promises that ""at all times, we will be driven by the data"" on opening up. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Skin colour remark 'not Queen nor Duke' - OprahPrince Harry said they were not the ones behind comments on ""how dark"" their baby would be, says TV host.","This video can not be played Oprah Winfrey: ""Neither his grandmother nor grandfather were part of those conversations [on skin colour]"". Oprah Winfrey has said Prince Harry clarified it was neither the Queen nor the Duke of Edinburgh who questioned what his son's skin colour would be. Winfrey told CBS News on Monday the prince ""did not tell me who was part of those conversations"". The revelation that a family member wondered ""how dark"" Archie's complexion might be came during a TV interview that aired overnight in the US. The Duchess of Sussex had described the remarks as a low point. ""He did not share the identity with me but he wanted to make sure I knew, and if I had an opportunity to share it, that it was not his grandmother or grandfather that were part of those conversations,"" Winfrey said. When asked for further details on Monday, Winfrey said she ""tried to get that answer on camera and off"" but the prince did not elaborate. She told CBS This Morning that she was shocked to hear about the skin colour remarks during the interview. ""Even on the take, you can hear me go, 'whoa I cannot believe you are saying this now'."" When asked why she thinks the couple agreed to speak with her, Winfrey said she felt they ""were ready to do it"" after having been ""lied about for a series of years"". ""I said to my team, the most important question to be answered here at the end of this show will be, 'why did they leave'?"" Winfrey said. ""And I think the stories of blindsiding the Queen were very damaging to them and also hurtful because they understood clearly that there had been months and months of preparation."" CBS has also shared new clips from the couple's three hour interview with the chat show host. In one, when asked by Winfrey if the couple left the UK because of racism, Prince Harry said that ""was a large part of it"". Harry: Tabloid racism 'large part' of why we left Meghan 'didn't want to be alive any more' 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' In another clip discussing how the UK press treated other members of the royal family, Meghan told Winfrey that ""rude and racist are not the same"". ""You've also had a press team that goes on the record to defend you especially when they know something's not true, and that didn't happen for us,"" the duchess said. Winfrey also asked Prince Harry if any family members had apologised to him for the reasons he felt he had to leave. Prince Harry replied, ""sadly not"".

Today's updates were brought to you by Hamish Mackay, John Harrison, Alice Evans and Jennifer Scott. The editors were Rob Corp and Paul Gribben. Thanks for joining us. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic until tomorrow. But before we do, here's a re-cap of today's main headlines:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In the Covid briefing, the prime minister talked about a
âbig budget of riskâ from opening schools, adding transmission will inevitably
rise. While children are at incredibly low risk and evidence
suggests they are less susceptible to infection and transmit less - certainly
younger children - having millions mixing in school will of course lead to some
spread. Schools, after all, are not islands. Children go home and mix with
their families. During the November lockdown cases fell despite schools
being open. But modelling forecasts that may not be the case this time.
That is because of the new more contagious UK variant has become dominant since
then. Experts say this could pushthe R numberabove one, leading a growth in
cases. But the bigger question is whether this matters. With the
rollout of the vaccination programme â nearly half of adults have received
their first dose â the link between infection rates and serious illness has
begun to be broken. There are though still vulnerable people who are yet to be
vaccinated or are only just building up their immunity following a vaccination. This is why there is a delicate balance to be struck. Some
rise can be tolerated, but not too much. Many travel businesses continue to be ""excluded"" from government support despite not trading for almost a year due to Covid, according to an industry trade body. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) says tour operators, online travel companies and home-based workers are not eligible for government grants. As uncertainty over testing regimes and quarantine continues to hit bookings, ABTA is calling on the government to make support available for all travel businesses that have been forced to shut due to the pandemic. A number of travel firms have fallen into administration in the last year. In Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget last week, the government extended the furlough scheme, business rates relief and VAT reductions. It also extended grants for struggling retail businesses. But ABTA says: ""We urge the government to... make grants available to all travel businesses, not just those with retail premises, recognising that the reopening of overseas travel will come later than the other sectors and will likely be gradual.""

Noah painted the background for this piece, which was finished artist and NHS worker Freeman (@freeman_uk on Instagram) A 12-year-old boy's lockdown art project has raised about Â£100,000 for charity, after 250 artists came forward to help him. Noah, who hashydrocephalus,external, epilepsy and cerebral palsy, began painting on cardboard at home in Dedham, Essex, a year ago. His father posted on Instagram, asking artists to finish the pictures. They weredisplayed in a gallerybefore being auctioned for theColchester and Ipswich Hospitals Charity,external. Mr Jones sent the backgrounds that his son created to the artists, who finished them and posted them back. More than 200 pieces were then auctioned on eBay and raised more than Â£80,000, with the rest made up from book sales featuring the art and donations. Noah's father Nathan Jones says they had originally hoped to raise Â£500 and are ""absolutely stunned"" by the total. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked if
more money would be made available to help people deal with the financial
impact of having to self-isolate. âWhat weâre doing in addition to helping people to self-isolate - in addition to the Â£500 support and all the rest of it
- is giving money to councils. I have a figure of Â£170m in my head to help
them give people who really need it help to self-isolate,â he said. Weâre not sure where the Â£170m figure
comes from. However, we know that since the end of
September, the government has given councils Â£110m to fund the Test and Trace
Support Payment scheme. This scheme gives those on low-incomes a
Â£500 payment, if they can prove they will be financially affected if they have
to stay at home for the 10-day isolation period. We recently used a Freedom of Information request for figures on this for all councils in England and Wales. Their
responses showed that two-thirds of people who applied for the payment did not
get it. Councils and unions told us that the
criteria for getting the payment was too tough. You can find out more about this here. Queuing for Covid tests at the Harris Academy in Beckenham, south London The first day back at school for millions of children in Englandhas ""gone well"", say head teachers. They are reporting high levels of take-up of Covid tests and compliance with new rules on wearing masks in secondary school classrooms. Primary schools have opened in full, but most secondary schools are phasing a return to allow time for Covid tests. As we reported earlier, at a Downing Street news conference the prime minister described it as a ""big day and an emotional day"" for families. Indoor care home visits have resumed in England today and the BBC has been speaking to some of those affected. Beccy Pile, 48, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, spent an hour with her 23 year-old son today at his care home in Essex earlier. Luke has lived at the home for adults with learning
disabilities for the last three years - but Beccy has only managed to see him twice in the last year before today. âIt feels like itâs been forever since I last saw him,"" she says. ""It
was incredible. He was really excited and had tidied his flat. âWe had to stop ourselves from hugging each other because
thatâs not allowed yet but he has a sign for a hug where he puts his arms
across his chest which he did and he blew me lots of kisses. âThe visit was incredibly well-managed. I only had an hour
but it didnât feel like an hour because the home had everything ready. ""I had my
test in the car park half an hour before and as soon as it was negative I could
go in and spend my time with him. âI did have a moment where I thought âwhat if itâs positive
because Luke thinks Iâm coming?â I thought I might have to just see him through
the window or something but thankfully it was OK."" Boris Johnson has finished his Downing Street briefing. If you're just a joining us, here's a recap of what was said: Asked by the Metro about a proposed 1% pay rise for some NHS workers, the PM repeats his ""gratitude"" for the nursing profession during the pandemic. He says that rather than a greater pay rise -which is what the unions have called for- many nurses have told him they most want to solve staffing issues in the health service and boost the number of people training to be nurses. ""I understand of course that the whole sector has been under massive pressure,"" he says, adding that the government has been investing ""colossally"" to support the NHS during Covid. The next journalist points to reports about parents failing to give permission for testing their children, and asks if they are ""undermining the safety of their classmates"". Dr Harries says she does recognise that for many parents ""it is quite an unusual ask"" and ""it will take time for families to get used to that"". But she believes that, ""with time"", families will give their permission, as it will not just help students, but will be ""for their family's benefit as well"". The final question is away from Covid and about the ongoing post-Brexit issues with trade, especially in Northern Ireland. Asked if it was time he ""came clean"" that his Brexit deal was not as great as he claimed, Johnson sticks to his guns by backing it. He says there is ""no question"" that there have been ""teething problems"" - but he believes they can ""all be ironed out... with goodwill and imagination"". Next up is a question for Dr Jenny Harries, after unions said schools could close again in the near future. Asked if she agrees, she says ""hopefully not"" as education is ""critical"" - adding the public can be ""very optimistic"". But she warns there may be a short period with more students testing positive and being taken out of school, advising people to look to ""three or four weeks' time"" for an accurate reading of how it is going. The PM is then pressed again about Harry and Meghan, and asked if the Royal family is racist. Johnson jokingly praises the reporter for his ""determined attempt to involve me in this story"". ""But he adds: ""I really think when it comes to matters with the Royal family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing."" Ben Kentish of LBC asks whether lockdown could be eased a little earlier than the PM has set out in his roadmap, on the basis that the vaccine rollout is going so well. The PM says he agrees there are some ""encouraging signs"" in the data on vaccinations and declining case numbers, but that we must not forget there is a ""big budget of risk"" in reopening schools. He says ""the whole point"" of his cautious easing is to remember where we were last summer - when rates were relatively low - before a surge in cases in the autumn and winter. Johnson adds that he believes businesses would rather see a ""cautious and irreversible"" approach to easing measures than a ""hasty"" one that leads to them having to be closed down again. Harries adds that each stage of the roadmap involves waiting and checking, and ""we need that time period"" of four to five weeks of observation before moving on to the next phase. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent On International Women's Day, the prime minister says the burden of childcare and home-schooling has fallen
""disproportionately"" on women during the pandemic. Earlier, his spokeswoman told
reporters he was keen to hear from women in business how flexible working could
continue beyond the pandemic. Boris Johnson hosted a
virtual round table discussion with senior female business figures this
morning. But she said it was ""not
unreasonable"" to ask questions about the PM's attitude to
women given some of his past comments and work as a journalist. The BBC's Ben Wright asks if Johnson and Harries accept that infection rates will go up now that children in England are back in the classroom - and what would be an acceptable level. The PM says a risk of increased transmission now that schools are back is ""inevitable"". But he adds that immunity has ""bedded in"" for millions of people who have now had their first dose of the Covid vaccine, which means it's safe to continue with the reopening plans. As we approach the next steps of lockdown easing we must be ""very, very cautious,"" the PM warns. Harries adds that education is of public health importance ""just as much as Covid is"" so the UK should press on with getting children back to school. She adds that it will be difficult to tell what impact a return to schools has to the numbers, because social interaction will also increase as the roadmap continues. While the news conference is about the continuing pandemic, the PM is asked about the big story of the day -the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""I've always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country and  across the Commonwealth,"" he says. He says he's spent ""a long time"" not commenting on Royal Family matters and doesn't plan to make that change. The next question is on the rumoured spend of Â£200,000 on refurbishing the PM's Downing Street flat but Johnson does not reveal any details. He is then asked, with the vaccination programme significantly accelerated since his roadmap announced, would he consider speeding up exiting lockdown. Johnson says he understands ""the urgency that people feel"", but says the government must be ""driven by the data"". He says case rates are still very high and there are thousands still in hospital. Johnson says we must ""remain prudent"" and people would prefer ""security and certainty"" in the roadmap out of lockdown. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson is preparing
the public for a rise in coronavirus cases after the return of all pupils to
schools in England. He says the risk of increased
transmission is âinevitableâ, but that as the vaccine programme continued, immunity would be ""bedded in."" The key factor will be the
impact that has on the number of people admitted to hospital and in turn the
strain it puts on the NHS, which Dr Jenny Harries says would be ""considerably
less"". It's perhaps the first sign
of how the UK will manage and live with coronavirus cases long term after the
pandemic has passed. The press conference now moves to questions - starting with two from the public. The first - Arjun from Watford - asks about young people, saying they are at ""the bottom of the priority list"" and need more support. Johnson says ""the most important thing"" was getting young people back into school, which will make a ""massive difference"". For those thinking about jobs and their futures, he adds the government wants to ""give you the maximum possible help"" by supporting business. The second member of the public asks the PM about the much-rumoured vaccine passports and how under-16s might be able to travel. He says the government is looking at the way certificates could work, but adds they ""raise all sorts of issues"" around those who can't get vaccines, for example. Johnson says it is a ""novel"" idea for the UK, but says they may become part of our future. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the declining death and case rates in the UK are ""pleasing"" but should have ""some caution attached"". The case rate is still falling, she says, but is not uniform across the country. Harries says ""it's really important"" that everyone continues to practise social distancing and follows the rules in place. She adds that the case rate is back to around the levels the UK had in September, adding: ""This is a level at which a new wave could easily take off again from."" Boris Johnson says there now needs to be a ""concerted programme"" from the government to ensure it carries on with its ""cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom"". He says a quarter of the population has now been vaccinated and it has been at least three weeks since the most vulnerable had their first dose, giving him ""confidence"" in the first steps. As well as schools, changes today include being able to meet one to one outside, and for people to visit loved ones in care homes. Johnson warns, however, that this will have ""an impact on the spread of the virus"" - but promises that ""at all times, we will be driven by the data"" on opening up. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Fears for 5,000 steel jobs as lender nears collapseThe main backer of the UK's third-largest steelmaker is to go into administration, the BBC has learned.Business","Sanjeev Gupta, who has been called the ""saviour of steel"" The principal financial backer of one of the UK's largest industrial groups has fallen into administration. Specialist bank Greensill Capital was the main lender to businessman Sanjeev Gupta's sprawling empire, which includes Liberty Steel. The appointment of administrators to Greensill puts 5,000 jobs at risk at Liberty Steel and other firms. In a court filing, Greensill said Mr Gupta's operations were in ""financial difficulty"" and defaulting on debt. Mr Gupta declined to comment on the claims, but his business GFG Alliance earlier said that it had adequate funding for its current needs. Union officials are to hold crisis talks with the steel magnate on Tuesday. Liberty owns 12 steel plants in the UK including in Rotherham, Motherwell, Stocksbridge, Newport and Hartlepool. The Community union said: ""Sanjeev Gupta needs to tell us exactly what the administration means for Liberty's UK businesses and how he plans to protect jobs. The future of Liberty's strategic steel assets must be secured and we are ready to work with all stakeholders to find a solution."" A spokesperson for Grant Thornton said its insolvency practitioners Chris Laverty, Trevor O'Sullivan and Will Stagg had been appointed as joint administrators of Greensill Capital and Greensill Capital Management Company. ""The joint administrators are in continued discussion with an interested party in relation to the purchase of certain Greensill Capital assets. As these discussions remain ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,"" the spokesperson added. Mr Gupta, who has been called the ""saviour of steel"", has defied pessimists in the industry for years by buying up seemingly unloved industrial assets. These included steel and aluminium plants that many thought could not be run profitably in the face of cut price competition from China. The BBC understands that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng held an emergency meeting on Sunday with the chief executive of Liberty Steel UK, John Ferriman. They discussed contingency plans in the event that Greensill went bust. It is understood the options did not include nationalisation. Further meetings are expected later on Monday. Mr Kwarteng also chaired a meeting of UK steel executives on Friday at which the future of Liberty, owned by Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance, was brought up, However, it was not discussed in any detail with this wider group, which included union bosses. Liberty Steel is the UK's third-largest steelmaker, employing 3,000 people at 11 sites. Another 2,000 people in engineering businesses within the group are also involved. That's a substantial chunk of the 32,000 people who work in the industry. Employment and output have fallen significantly for the steel industry over the last four decades. In its heyday as the state-owned British Steel Corporation in the early 1970s, it had 10 times as many workers. The whole UK steel industry has gone through a chequered period of ownership since it was privatised in the 1980s. However, the sector is still considered important by government ministers, regional politicians and business leaders. Many of Liberty Steel's assets were part of Tata Steel's UK business until they changed hands for Â£100m in 2017. When Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance snapped them up, he was hailed as saving thousands of UK jobs. But his empire has often been criticised for its complicated structure and lack of transparent accounting. With news of the financial problems facing Greensill Capital, one of Mr Gupta's key sources of finance, those criticisms are now coming home to roost. Greensill, run by former investment banker Lex Greensill, counts former Prime Minister David Cameron among its paid advisers. The BBC has approached Mr Cameron for comment. The company specialises in short-term supply chain financing to provide capital for businesses around the world. However, it too has been accused of opaque accounting. Greensill's heavy exposure to Mr Gupta's business has prompted Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to Â£10bn worth of funds held as security. Their heavy exposure to each other has proved disastrous for both Greensill and Gupta. Mr Gupta's financing requirements constituted more than 50% of Greensill's lending volumes. While figures are not available for the proportion of his funding that Mr Gupta raised from Greensill, sources close to Greensill put his funding needs from the firm at $70m a day. A spokesman for Mr Gupta said Liberty's operations were ""running as normal"", had adequate funding for their current needs and that the refinancing plans were progressing. It added that a recent upturn in global steel prices was beneficial for the company's prospects. Liberty is a major supplier to the public, including hydro-power contracts in Scotland and steel contracts for the Ministry of Defence. The government said it was ""monitoring the situation closely"". ""This is a deeply concerning situation and a very worrying time for Liberty Steel workers,"" said Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow minister for business and consumers. ""It's vital that the government acts with the urgency required and doesn't wash their hands of the situation.""

As we approach the next steps of lockdown easing we must be ""very, very cautious,"" the PM warns. Harries adds that education is of public health importance ""just as much as Covid is"" so the UK should press on with getting children back to school. She adds that it will be difficult to tell what impact a return to schools has to the numbers, because social interaction will also increase as the roadmap continues. While the news conference is about the continuing pandemic, the PM is asked about the big story of the day -the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""I've always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country and  across the Commonwealth,"" he says. He says he's spent ""a long time"" not commenting on Royal Family matters and doesn't plan to make that change. The next question is on the rumoured spend of Â£200,000 on refurbishing the PM's Downing Street flat but Johnson does not reveal any details. He is then asked, with the vaccination programme significantly accelerated since his roadmap announced, would he consider speeding up exiting lockdown. Johnson says he understands ""the urgency that people feel"", but says the government must be ""driven by the data"". He says case rates are still very high and there are thousands still in hospital. Johnson says we must ""remain prudent"" and people would prefer ""security and certainty"" in the roadmap out of lockdown. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson is preparing
the public for a rise in coronavirus cases after the return of all pupils to
schools in England. He says the risk of increased
transmission is âinevitableâ, but that as the vaccine programme continued, immunity would be ""bedded in."" The key factor will be the
impact that has on the number of people admitted to hospital and in turn the
strain it puts on the NHS, which Dr Jenny Harries says would be ""considerably
less"". It's perhaps the first sign
of how the UK will manage and live with coronavirus cases long term after the
pandemic has passed. The press conference now moves to questions - starting with two from the public. The first - Arjun from Watford - asks about young people, saying they are at ""the bottom of the priority list"" and need more support. Johnson says ""the most important thing"" was getting young people back into school, which will make a ""massive difference"". For those thinking about jobs and their futures, he adds the government wants to ""give you the maximum possible help"" by supporting business. The second member of the public asks the PM about the much-rumoured vaccine passports and how under-16s might be able to travel. He says the government is looking at the way certificates could work, but adds they ""raise all sorts of issues"" around those who can't get vaccines, for example. Johnson says it is a ""novel"" idea for the UK, but says they may become part of our future. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the declining death and case rates in the UK are ""pleasing"" but should have ""some caution attached"". The case rate is still falling, she says, but is not uniform across the country. Harries says ""it's really important"" that everyone continues to practise social distancing and follows the rules in place. She adds that the case rate is back to around the levels the UK had in September, adding: ""This is a level at which a new wave could easily take off again from."" Boris Johnson says there now needs to be a ""concerted programme"" from the government to ensure it carries on with its ""cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom"". He says a quarter of the population has now been vaccinated and it has been at least three weeks since the most vulnerable had their first dose, giving him ""confidence"" in the first steps. As well as schools, changes today include being able to meet one to one outside, and for people to visit loved ones in care homes. Johnson warns, however, that this will have ""an impact on the spread of the virus"" - but promises that ""at all times, we will be driven by the data"" on opening up. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Fears for 5,000 steel jobs as lender nears collapseThe main backer of the UK's third-largest steelmaker is to go into administration, the BBC has learned.","Sanjeev Gupta, who has been called the ""saviour of steel"" The principal financial backer of one of the UK's largest industrial groups has fallen into administration. Specialist bank Greensill Capital was the main lender to businessman Sanjeev Gupta's sprawling empire, which includes Liberty Steel. The appointment of administrators to Greensill puts 5,000 jobs at risk at Liberty Steel and other firms. In a court filing, Greensill said Mr Gupta's operations were in ""financial difficulty"" and defaulting on debt. Mr Gupta declined to comment on the claims, but his business GFG Alliance earlier said that it had adequate funding for its current needs. Union officials are to hold crisis talks with the steel magnate on Tuesday. Liberty owns 12 steel plants in the UK including in Rotherham, Motherwell, Stocksbridge, Newport and Hartlepool. The Community union said: ""Sanjeev Gupta needs to tell us exactly what the administration means for Liberty's UK businesses and how he plans to protect jobs. The future of Liberty's strategic steel assets must be secured and we are ready to work with all stakeholders to find a solution."" A spokesperson for Grant Thornton said its insolvency practitioners Chris Laverty, Trevor O'Sullivan and Will Stagg had been appointed as joint administrators of Greensill Capital and Greensill Capital Management Company. ""The joint administrators are in continued discussion with an interested party in relation to the purchase of certain Greensill Capital assets. As these discussions remain ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,"" the spokesperson added. Mr Gupta, who has been called the ""saviour of steel"", has defied pessimists in the industry for years by buying up seemingly unloved industrial assets. These included steel and aluminium plants that many thought could not be run profitably in the face of cut price competition from China. The BBC understands that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng held an emergency meeting on Sunday with the chief executive of Liberty Steel UK, John Ferriman. They discussed contingency plans in the event that Greensill went bust. It is understood the options did not include nationalisation. Further meetings are expected later on Monday. Mr Kwarteng also chaired a meeting of UK steel executives on Friday at which the future of Liberty, owned by Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance, was brought up, However, it was not discussed in any detail with this wider group, which included union bosses. Liberty Steel is the UK's third-largest steelmaker, employing 3,000 people at 11 sites. Another 2,000 people in engineering businesses within the group are also involved. That's a substantial chunk of the 32,000 people who work in the industry. Employment and output have fallen significantly for the steel industry over the last four decades. In its heyday as the state-owned British Steel Corporation in the early 1970s, it had 10 times as many workers. The whole UK steel industry has gone through a chequered period of ownership since it was privatised in the 1980s. However, the sector is still considered important by government ministers, regional politicians and business leaders. Many of Liberty Steel's assets were part of Tata Steel's UK business until they changed hands for Â£100m in 2017. When Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance snapped them up, he was hailed as saving thousands of UK jobs. But his empire has often been criticised for its complicated structure and lack of transparent accounting. With news of the financial problems facing Greensill Capital, one of Mr Gupta's key sources of finance, those criticisms are now coming home to roost. Greensill, run by former investment banker Lex Greensill, counts former Prime Minister David Cameron among its paid advisers. The BBC has approached Mr Cameron for comment. The company specialises in short-term supply chain financing to provide capital for businesses around the world. However, it too has been accused of opaque accounting. Greensill's heavy exposure to Mr Gupta's business has prompted Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to Â£10bn worth of funds held as security. Their heavy exposure to each other has proved disastrous for both Greensill and Gupta. Mr Gupta's financing requirements constituted more than 50% of Greensill's lending volumes. While figures are not available for the proportion of his funding that Mr Gupta raised from Greensill, sources close to Greensill put his funding needs from the firm at $70m a day. A spokesman for Mr Gupta said Liberty's operations were ""running as normal"", had adequate funding for their current needs and that the refinancing plans were progressing. It added that a recent upturn in global steel prices was beneficial for the company's prospects. Liberty is a major supplier to the public, including hydro-power contracts in Scotland and steel contracts for the Ministry of Defence. The government said it was ""monitoring the situation closely"". ""This is a deeply concerning situation and a very worrying time for Liberty Steel workers,"" said Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow minister for business and consumers. ""It's vital that the government acts with the urgency required and doesn't wash their hands of the situation.""

Oprah Winfrey has said Prince Harry clarified it was neither the Queen nor the Duke of Edinburgh who questioned what his son's skin colour would be. Winfrey told CBS News on Monday the prince ""did not tell me who was part of those conversations"". The revelation that a family member wondered ""how dark"" Archie's complexion might be came during a TV interview that aired overnight in the US. The Duchess of Sussex had described the remarks as a low point. ""He did not share the identity with me but he wanted to make sure I knew, and if I had an opportunity to share it, that it was not his grandmother or grandfather that were part of those conversations,"" Winfrey said. When asked for further details on Monday, Winfrey said she ""tried to get that answer on camera and off"" but the prince did not elaborate. She told CBS This Morning that she was shocked to hear about the skin colour remarks during the interview. ""Even on the take, you can hear me go, 'whoa I cannot believe you are saying this now'."" When asked why she thinks the couple agreed to speak with her, Winfrey said she felt they ""were ready to do it"" after having been ""lied about for a series of years"". ""I said to my team, the most important question to be answered here at the end of this show will be, 'why did they leave'?"" Winfrey said. ""And I think the stories of blindsiding the Queen were very damaging to them and also hurtful because they understood clearly that there had been months and months of preparation."" CBS has also shared new clips from the couple's three hour interview with the chat show host.

Harry: Tabloid racism 'large part' of why we left Meghan 'didn't want to be alive any more' 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' In another clip discussing how the UK press treated other members of the royal family, Meghan told Winfrey that ""rude and racist are not the same"". ""You've also had a press team that goes on the record to defend you especially when they know something's not true, and that didn't happen for us,"" the duchess said. Winfrey also asked Prince Harry if any family members had apologised to him for the reasons he felt he had to leave. Prince Harry replied, ""sadly not"".

BP staff set to work from home two days a weekThe oil giant told staff last month that the new model will start for office-based staff this summer.Business,"BP has told office-based staff they will be expected to spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease. The oil giant said in meetings last month that most would be asked to work from home 40% of the time, or two days a week for full-time employees. The new ""hybrid"" work model will affect 25,000 BP staff, with 6,000 in the UK. It comes as part of a cost-cutting drive for the firm, which sawthousands of job cuts announced last year. BP informed staff of the changes in ""town hall"" meetings in February, and suggested that it would offer a ""more flexible, engaging and dynamic way of working"". Many of its office-based UK employees have been working from home full-time since the start of the pandemic. They were also expected to bear the brunt of redundancies announced in last June. 'People are tired of working from home' Can my boss force me to go to work? Bank boss rejects work from home as the 'new normal' In the government's roadmap,externalfor ending coronavirus restrictions, it recommends that people in England continue to work from home where possible. It is hoped, however, that all legal limits on social contact can be removed from 21 June. BP's new policy is expected to come into force this summer, after teams have discussed on a case-by-case basis how often and which days they will commute in.

The boss of insurance firm Phoenix Group told the BBC's Today programme on Monday that its staff would continue working from home for the foreseeable future. Chief executive Andy Briggs said: ""The vast majority of our colleagues are working from home. ""We look forward to getting back into the office in due course, but our business has been able to operate very well working from home, so we're continuing to do that at the moment... although many of us are pleased to see our children go back to school."" Lloyds Banking Group is also set to reduce its office space by 20% over two years after a staff survey found that nearly 80% wanted to work at home for at least three days a week. HSBC has announced a 40% cut in its office footprint too. Paul Hubble spent five hours a day commuting to London from Eastbourne in East Sussex Paul Hubble used to have to leave his home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, at 06:10 to get to his desk at Barclays' London headquarters in Canary Wharf by 09:00 - a morning commute of two-and-a-half hours. He had to leave just before 17:00 if he wanted to make it home for 1930. But since home-working became the norm for Barclays employees, Paul says he can get more done. ""I now have more time for myself but also can be more productive in that I can start work early and finish work later,"" he told the BBC. Plus he saves Â£6,000 a year on his rail season ticket. It also means he can make time for a mid-afternoon dog walk, which he says is a ""great way of recharging the batteries"".

Its survey of 4,000 people between 24 and 28 February found that 39% of adults said they were exclusively working outside the home, compared with 32% who were only working from home.

LiveLiveMeghan: Royal had concerns about son's skin colour7 minutes ago,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were interviewed by Oprah Winfrey for a two-hour CBS primetime special Meghan says one member of the Royal Family had concerns about how ""dark"" her son Archie's skin would be Winfrey clarifies that neither the Queen nor the Duke of Edinburgh were part of that conversation In unaired footage, Prince Harry says racism from the tabloid press that filtered into the rest of society was a ""large part"" of why they left the UK He says he has now been ""cut off"" financially, which is why the couple sought Netflix and Spotify deals Prince Harry reveals their new baby - due in the summer - is a girl In January 2020 the couple had an invitation to visit the Queen at Sandringham suddenly withdrawn by her private secretary, he says Meghan says she found life within the Royal Family so difficult that at times she ""didn't want to be alive any more"" But she talks about contact with the family - she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month At a government Covid briefing, Boris Johnson refuses to comment, but says he has the ""highest admiration for the Queen"" Oprah with Meghan and Harry: A Primetime Special, drew more than 17m viewers in the US The interview is being broadcast in the UK on ITV and on ITV Hub, courtesy of Harpo Productions/CBS Edited by Paul Gribben We're signing off for the night, butyou can head over to our main story for more detailsabout Harry and Meghan's interview. Today's updates were written by Alice Evans, Hazel Shearing, Jen Meierhans, Ashitha Nagesh and Emma Saunders. They were edited by Claire Heald, Sarah Fowler, Vanessa Barford, Paul Gribben and Chris Lansdown. That brings Harry and Meghan's highly anticipated interview with Oprah to a close. We've heard about the details of the interview throughout the course of the day because it aired in the US overnight, but this was the first time it was shown to UK audiences. So, here aresome of the key things you need to know: In the final instalment of the interview, Oprah asks Harry what ""delights"" him now in his new life in California. Harry replies that he loves his ""outdoor space"", taking Archie out on the back of his bike, something he was ""never able to do"". The couple laugh about Archie's most-recent favourite word being ""hydrate"" - with other top choices including ""palm tree"". Oprah asks if Meghan got her happy ending with Prince Harry after all. âGreater than any fairytale that youâve ever read,"" she says. By leaving the Royal Family, she says, ""I think [Harry] saved all of us. He ultimately called it. He made a decision that saved my life and saved all of us. ""But you need to want to be saved.â Harry and Meghan are asked whether they have any regrets. Meghan says she has one - ""believing them when they said I would be protected"". She says she believed that. But she says now, they have not just survived ""but are thriving"". Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent This is about as bad it might have been for the Royal Family, barring direct criticism of the Queen. Harry portrays his family as cold and unsympathetic, unable to relate emotionally, obsessed with who is going to pay for what. Itâs clear that relationships were and in some cases, still are, dreadful. Oprah asks Harry about Meghan's earlier comments that an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be ""That conversation, I am never going to share,"" Harry replies. ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he says, adding that this conversation took place ""right at the beginning"" of his relationship with Meghan. Oprah asks what the exact questions were in that conversation. Harry says he's not comfortable sharing that but suggests a few moments later that it was along the lines of: ""What will the kids look like?"" Oprah said earlier today that Prince Harry has clarified thatthe family member was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. Oprah asks Prince Harry what his relationship with his family is like now. He says he has spoken to the Queen, his grandmother, more in the last year than he has for many, many years and they have a really good relationship. ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be."" Asked about his relationship with his father, Prince Charles - heir to the throne - Harry pauses for a moment. ""There's a lot to work through there,"" he says. ""I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like... and Archie's his grandson. ""But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship."" Asked about the relationship with his brother, Prince William, Harry says he loves him ""to bits"" and they have been through ""hell together"". ""But we were on different paths,"" he adds. The Duke of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Prince of Wales pictured in 2019 Prince Harry says the Netflix and the Spotify deals he and Meghan have made recently were ""never part of the plan"". He says that came from when his family ""literally cut me off financially"" in the first quarter of 2020, and he had to pay for his family's security. He says the money that his late mother left him was the only way he and Meghan ""were able to do this"". Harry draws parallels between the treatment of Meghan and his mother, Princess Diana. âYou know, for me, I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you with my wife by my side,â he says. âBecause I can't begin to imagine what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself all those years ago, because it has been unbelievably tough for the two of us - but at least we had each other."" Harry's late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, relinquished the Her Royal Highness title at the time of her divorce from the Prince of Wales in August 1996. She died the following year in a car crash in Paris. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes when the accident happened. Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Trapped. Thatâs the word Harry used to describe his life in the Royal Family. Thatâs the impression he gave very often when out and about. But he goes on â he says his brother William, his father Charles, they too are trapped. And he feels compassion for them. It is a velvet-covered dagger into the institution he walked away (or, in his words, stepped back) from. You can read Jonny's full analysis here. Oprah asks Meghan and Harry about one of the prevailing storylines about the royal couple: that Meghan orchestrated their departure from the Royal Family, in what the tabloids branded as ""Megxit"". ""Can you imagine how little sense that makes?"" Meghan replies. ""I left everything for him."" She continues: ""Our plan was to do this forever."" Oprah turns to Harry, asking if he would have stepped back from his life in the Royal Family if it were not for Meghan. ""The answer is no. I wouldnât have been able to,"" he says. ""I myself was trapped."" Oprah pushes back - asking how a ""literal prince"" could be ""trapped"". I was ""trapped within the system"", Harry replies. ""My father and my brother - they are trapped. They donât get to leave - and I have huge compassion for that."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Harry looks so relaxed, so happy, so comfortable. Such a change from the deeply unhappy man he appeared to be in the final year in the UK. Meghan and Harry both come across very sympathetically, speaking without rancour but with the utmost clarity about a time in their lives they both clearly bitterly regret. This is explosive stuff â raw, revealing and hugely damaging for the Palace. Giving further details about his disappointment that his family did not show Meghan public support, Harry says: ""I also am acutely aware of where my family stands, and how scared they are of the tabloids turning on them."" He says there was an ""invisible contract"" between the Royal Family and UK tabloids - where if royals give access to reporters, they will get better press. ""There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations."" Oprah asks about how Harry and Meghan dealt with Meghan experiencing suicidal thoughts. ""I had no idea what to do, I wasn't prepared for that, I went to a very dark place as well,"" he says. Harry says he did not tell anyone in the family because ""that's just not a conversation that would be had"". ""I guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them,"" he says, adding that it's a very trapping environment. ""I didn't have anyone to turn to,"" he adds. ""For the family, they very much have this mentality of, 'this is just how it is. This is how it's meant to be, you can't change it, we've all been through it'. ""But what was different for me, was the race element. Because it wasn't just about her, it was about what she represents. He adds that for Meghan and Harry, ""and the specifics around her race"", it was an opportunity for the Royal Family ""to show some public support"". He says the ""most telling"" parts - and ""saddest parts"" - was that more than 70 MPs came out and condemned the colonial undertones of headlines and news articles. ""Yet no-one from my family ever said anything over those three years,"" he says. ""That hurts."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Just slipped into the conversation, as he listed the calls that he made to his family to talk about his future, is that Harryâs father - Prince Charles - stopped taking his calls. Did Harry mean to let that slip? Who knows? But it is an insight into how bad things got, maybe still are, in private relations inside the Royal Family. Harry says his biggest concern while living in Canada was that their security was going to be removed and people knew their location. He adds in a jibe at the Daily Mail newspaper at this point - saying that people knew their exact location ""courtesy of the Daily Mail"". He says the Palace's justification for removing security was ""a change in status""- but Harry says he ""pushed back"" and asked whether there had been a change of threat or risk, to which the Palace said no. They decided to move to California because they felt they were not safe in Canada. Oprah asks them what was the tipping point to their decision to step back as senior royals. ""It was desperate,"" says Harry. ""I went to all the places which I thought I should go to to ask for help, we both did, separately and together. Oprah asks: ""So you left because you were asking for help but couldn't get it?"", ""Yeah, basically,"" says Harry. ""But we never left,"" he says. ""We never left the family,"" adds Meghan, saying they only wanted to have a type of role that already exists - a non-senior royal. Harry says they wanted to ""take a breath"" from this ""constant barrage"". ""Meghan
clearly felt that the Palace was against her. That it didn't care. That it
didn't relate to the kind of pain that she was in."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond is on the latest Newscast podcast talking through
what the interview tells us about some of the relationships in the Royal
Family. Hear the full conversation now on BBC Sounds. Harry denies ever ""blindsiding"" his grandmother, the Queen, with his family's departure from senior royal duties. ""Iâve never blindsided my grandmother, I have too much respect for her,"" Harry tells Oprah. He says he had three telephone calls with the Queen ahead of the first statement announcing he and Meghan would be stepping back. He spoke with his father twice, he says, ""before he stopped taking my calls"". Why did Prince Charles stop speaking to Harry, Oprah asks. ""Because by that point I took matters into my own hands,"" Harry replies. ""It's really sad that it's gotten to this point, but I've got to do something for my own mental health, my wife's and for Archie's as well, because I could see where this was headed."" Harry said he and Meghan wanted to ""take a breath"" from ""the constant barrage"" the couple were facing as working royals. ""My biggest concern was history repeating itself,"" he tells Oprah. ""And what I was seeing was history repeating itself."" But he said this time it was ""far more dangerous"" compared to his mother's situation, taking into account the race and social media dimensions. He said he asked for help to ""call the dogs off"" but said none was given, and was instead told continuously ""this is how it is"". The Prince and Princess of Wales with Harry Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent The allegation that there were discussions in the Palace about how dark Meghanâs first baby might be is a devastating one. This is heading into ""worst-case scenario"" territory for the Palace. It is worth remembering we are currently only getting one side of the story. And Meghan has not revealed who said that to Harry. But it is a horrible allegation for the Palace to deal with. Now it's time for Prince Harry to join Meghan and Oprah. And no sooner has he sat down than they announce they are having a baby girl. Harry says his first thought was ""amazing"" and feeling ""grateful"". ""We've got our family,"" he says - ""the four of us and our two dogs"". They confirm that two children ""is it"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Meghan 'didn't want to be alive any more'In a deeply personal TV interview, Meghan tells Oprah Winfrey that she did not get help when she asked for it.","The interview took place in the garden of a house near where the couple live in Montecito, west of Los Angeles The Duchess of Sussex has said she found life within the British Royal Family so difficult that at times she ""didn't want to be alive any more"". In a deeply personal TV interview, Meghan told Oprah Winfrey that she did not get help when she asked for it. She said a low point was when Harry was asked by an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be. Oprah latersaid Harry had told her it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh who made the comment. The highly-anticipated interview with Oprah, which the couple were not paid for, aired overnight in the US. LIVE: Latest reaction to the interview 12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' During the two-hour CBS special, to be screened in the UK on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday night and on ITV Hub, Courtesy of Harpo Productions/CBS, the couple covered a range of topics, including racism, mental health, their relationship with the media and Royal Family dynamics. In other key revelations: The couple announced their second child, which is due in the summer, is a girl They exchanged vows in a ceremony led by the Archbishop of Canterbury in their ""backyard"" three days before they were legally married at their public wedding in May 2018 Harry said his brother and father were ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family He said his family cut him off financially at the beginning of last year and his father stopped taking his calls But Harry said he loved his brother ""to bits"" and wanted to heal his relationship with both him and his father Meghan said she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month The couple moved to California after formally stepping down from royal duties in March 2020, and it was announced last month that they would not be returning as working members of the Royal Family. Meghan referred to the Duchess of Cambridge as ""Kate"" during the interview Meghan said that she started to feel lonely when limits were placed on what she could do, revealing that at one point she did not leave the house for months. At one point she thought she ""could not feel lonelier"", she told Oprah. Asked by Oprah if she was thinking of self-harm and having suicidal thoughts at some stage,  the 39-year-old replied: ""Yes. This was very, very clear. Very clear and very scary. I didn't know who to turn to in that."" Meghan said that she felt ""haunted"" by a photograph from an official event she attended with Harry at the Royal Albert Hall while she was pregnant. ""Right before we had to leave for that (event), I had just had that conversation with Harry that morning,"" Meghan said. Winfrey asked: ""That you don't want to be alive any more?"" ""Yeah,"" Meghan confirmed. She said that she attended the event with Harry that night because she felt she could not be ""left alone"" and recalled Harry gripping her hand tightly while in attendance at the Royal Albert Hall. Harry and Meghan attended the premiere of Cirque du Soleil's Totem at the Royal Albert Hall in January 2019 Oprah also asked the duchess why she thought the Royal Family did not make her son Archie a prince - which Meghan said she wanted so that he would get police protection. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children do not automatically become princes or princesses because of a rule that has been in place since 1917 - unless the Queen steps in. ""In those months when I was pregnant, all around this same time so we have in tandem the conversation of he won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title, and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,"" Meghan said. She said the remarks about skin colour were made to Harry and he relayed them to her. Asked by Oprah whether there were concerns that her child would be ""too brown"" and that would be a problem, Meghan said: ""If that is the assumption you are making, that is a pretty safe one."" When pressed, she refused to reveal who the individual was, saying: ""I think that would be very damaging to them."" The couple's first child, Archie, was born in May 2019 Harry also refused to give further details, saying: ""That conversation, I am never going to share."" ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he added. The 36-year-old prince said that none of his relatives spoke out in support of Meghan following the racism he said his wife faced from the media. ""No-one from my family ever said anything over those three years. That hurts,"" Harry said. Meghan and Harry have upended the narrative created by Britain's bestselling newspapers. They have revealed the terrible strains inside the palace. They have drawn a picture of unfeeling individuals lost in an uncaring institution. They have spoken of racism within the Royal Family. This was a devastating interview. But Harry describing his brother and father as ""trapped"", and Meghan revealing that she repeatedly sought help within the palace only to be rebuffed, is a body blow to the institution. It's not at all clear if and how the palace will respond. Many of the revelations are so personal that getting any reaction seems unlikely. The Queen has made clear repeatedly the affection in which the couple are still held. As for the newspapers that the couple so despise - will they change their tune? It is not in their nature. There were pages of bile in some Sunday newspapers prior to the interview. Meghan and Harry have given up on getting a fair hearing from many of the most popular publications. It seems highly unlikely that they will see anything published that will make them change their minds. During the interview, the Royal Family were also accused of failing to protect the duke and duchess, with Meghan saying the situation ""started to really worsen"" after the couple married in May 2018. ""I came to understand that not only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family. ""But they weren't willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband."" She was referencing rumours that she had made the Duchess of Cambridge cry during a disagreement about flower girl dresses - a story that prompted a flurry of tabloid stories. Meghan said the opposite happened. She added that Catherine later apologised, bringing flowers and a note to make amends. Royal Family tree and line of succession In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together Joining his wife and Oprah for the second half of the interview, Harry talked about his relationship with the rest of his family. He said his relationship with his grandmother, the Queen, was ""really good"" and that the two of them speak often. However, his relationship with his father, the Prince of Wales, has suffered. Harry said that he feels ""really let down"" by his father. He added that he will always love him, but ""there's a lot of hurt that's happened"". He described his father and his brother as ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family. ""They don't get to leave,"" he added. Of Prince William, he said they were on ""different paths"". This video can not be played Dean Stott, a friend of Prince Harry, suggested that he didn't think the Royal Family had ""a voice"" The interview aired while Harry's grandfather, Prince Philip,was recovering in hospital after a heart procedure- although it was recorded before Prince Philip was admitted. When he went into hospital, Meghan said she phoned the Queen ""just to check in"". She said the monarch had ""always been wonderful to me"" and recalled her sharing her blanket while travelling together between visits. Harry also revealed that his family had cut him off financially at the beginning of last year, after the couple announced their intention to step back as senior royals. He said deals withNetflixandSpotifywere ""never part of the plan"" but they needed them to pay for security staff. In new footage not included in the original interview,Prince Harry was asked if the couple left the UK because of racism, and replied: ""It was a large part of it."" He recalled a conversation he had with someone with media connections who advised him not to take on the British tabloid press. He said he was told he had to understand that the UK was ""very bigoted"". But Harry recalled that he immediately responded: ""The UK is not bigoted, the UK press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids."" The prince told Oprah: ""But unfortunately if the source of info is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Meghan's allegations about racism and lack of mental health support should be taken ""very seriously"". Asked whether Boris Johnson agreed with this, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was ""a matter for the palace"" and Mr Johnson had not seen the interview.

"Skin colour remark 'not Queen nor Duke' - OprahThe prince said his grandparents were not the ones behind comments ""how dark"" their baby would be, says TV host.US & Canada","This video can not be played Oprah Winfrey: ""Neither his grandmother nor grandfather were part of those conversations [on skin colour]"". Oprah Winfrey has said Prince Harry clarified it was neither the Queen nor the Duke of Edinburgh who questioned what his son's skin colour would be. Winfrey told CBS News on Monday the prince ""did not tell me who was part of those conversations"". The revelation that a family member wondered ""how dark"" Archie's complexion might be came during a TV interview that aired overnight in the US. The Duchess of Sussex had described the remarks as a low point. ""He did not share the identity with me but he wanted to make sure I knew, and if I had an opportunity to share it, that it was not his grandmother or grandfather that were part of those conversations,"" Winfrey said. When asked for further details on Monday, Winfrey said she ""tried to get that answer on camera and off"" but the prince did not elaborate. She told CBS This Morning that she was shocked to hear about the skin colour remarks during the interview. ""Even on the take, you can hear me go, 'whoa I cannot believe you are saying this now'."" When asked why she thinks the couple agreed to speak with her, Winfrey said she felt they ""were ready to do it"" after having been ""lied about for a series of years"". ""I said to my team, the most important question to be answered here at the end of this show will be, 'why did they leave'?"" Winfrey said. ""And I think the stories of blindsiding the Queen were very damaging to them and also hurtful because they understood clearly that there had been months and months of preparation."" CBS has also shared new clips from the couple's three hour interview with the chat show host. In one, when asked by Winfrey if the couple left the UK because of racism, Prince Harry said that ""was a large part of it"". Harry: Tabloid racism 'large part' of why we left Meghan 'didn't want to be alive any more' 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' In another clip discussing how the UK press treated other members of the royal family, Meghan told Winfrey that ""rude and racist are not the same"". ""You've also had a press team that goes on the record to defend you especially when they know something's not true, and that didn't happen for us,"" the duchess said. Winfrey also asked Prince Harry if any family members had apologised to him for the reasons he felt he had to leave. Prince Harry replied, ""sadly not"".

Deliveroo boss: 'I was never into start-ups'Will Shu's comments come as the food delivery firm sets out flotation plans but reports another loss.Business,"Deliveroo's chief executive, Will Shu, founded the business in 2013 ""I never set out to be a founder or a CEO.  I was never into start-ups,"" says Will Shu, founder of food delivery chain, Deliveroo. His comments came as the firm set out plans to issue shares to the public which could value it at about Â£7bn. Deliveroo has not yet made a profit and it reported a Â£223.7m loss for last year, despite a surge in sales. The float will see the busiest riders share in a Â£16m fund, and customers will also get the chance to buy shares. Deliveroo is making Â£50m worth of shares available to customers who will be given the opportunity to buy up to Â£1,000 worth of shares each, although if demand is high they may see their orders scaled back. Mr Shu's letter, contained in the official notice of the intention to float, also says: ""I'm not one of those Silicon Valley types with a million ideas. I had one idea. ""At the end of the day, I started the business because I wanted something better than what was available to me. ""Today, the business is so, so much bigger than I ever would have thought possible."" Deliveroo said that last year, its gross transaction value - the total amount of transactions it processes on its platform - jumped by 64.3% to Â£4.1bn from Â£2.5bn in 2019. However, the business remains loss-making, although its underlying loss for 2020 reduced to Â£223.7m from Â£317.3m in 2019. Demand for takeaway meals has soared during the coronavirus pandemic, after lockdown measures were first implemented a year ago and restaurants have been forced to close. Restrictions on hospitality businesses in England are currently set to start to ease on 12 April at the earliest. Anna Macdonald, fund manager at Amati Global Investors, told the BBC's Today programme: ""Losses have actually been mounting at Deliveroo over the last few years, but given the environment for tech listings at the moment, that doesn't seem to put too many investors off who are prescribing quite a hefty valuation for the company. ""There's no doubt that it's done tremendously well during lockdown and the founder Will Shu says in the last six months to the end of 2020 it was operating profitably. But, yes, there's a good deal of hope in the share price valuation."" As part of the flotation, riders in Deliveroo's 12 markets who have worked with the firm for at least a year will be paid a bonus of either Â£10,000, Â£1,000, Â£500 and Â£200 depending on the number of orders they have delivered. How can a company that lost over Â£200m in a year when trading conditions could not have been more favourable be worth so many billions? That's the question many will be asking when trying to work out why Deliveroo is expected to hit that valuation when it makes its stock market debut in London. The answer, of course, is that stock markets are all about pricing future profits, or at least in Deliveroo's case, the hope of future profits. The online food delivery service has grown quickly during the pandemic - sales last year were more than Â£4bn, nearly two-thirds up on 2019 - and it has been able to reduce its annual loss. It is also investing heavily in technology and geographical expansion, and is eager to show investors that it has now honed its model and operating systems to the point that they can be quickly introduced into many more markets. This promise of rapid growth and eventual bumper profits is what will drive Deliveroo's share price when it eventually comes to market. The challenge for its management team, led by founder Will Shu, is turning the promise into reality. The shares will be listed on the London Stock Exchange, where Will Shu is planning to maintain a firmer grip on how the company is run than has been traditional for London-listed companies. Under a proposed dual-class share structure, each share Mr Shu will hold will carry 20 times the voting power of ordinary shares. A recent government-commissioned review of the UK's listing rulesrecommended a number of measuresto make the country a more attractive place for companies to float. The review, led by former European Commissioner Lord Hill, recommended allowing companies with dual-class share structures  to be allowed in the premium listing segment of the London Stock Exchange, which allows them to be included in FTSE indexes. A decision on any changes to the current system will be made by the Financial Conduct Authority but will not come until the end of this year. Major tech companies such as Facebook and Google-owner Alphabet have so-called dual-class shares. Susannah Streeter, share analyst for stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said that because of the proposed dual-class share structure, people ""need to be aware if they invest under these terms they don't have the same voting rights as they would do if they owned shares in other companies listed on the London market"". She added that there were other factors for potential investors to consider. ""Competition in the sector is fierce, and Deliveroo competes with Uber Eats, Just Eat and a host of others,"" she said. ""Profitability can be tough and margins tend to be slim thanks to competition and high variable costs. ""There is of course a risk that demand for home deliveries will wane once the pandemic has eased. It's likely that the public will be desperate to eat out as soon as they can.""

Masks and rapid tests as England schools return,"UK PM Boris Johnson praises ""astonishing"" effort of teachers, staff and parents in No 10 news conference But ""emotional"" return of England's schools will have an impact on spread of virus, he warns England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries says declining rates are ""pleasing"" but ""new wave could easily take off again"" Millions of children in England are back in class after more than two months of home-schooling Primary schools have fully opened for all pupils, while secondary schools will have a phased return to class Secondary school pupils in England will take regular rapid Covid tests and need to wear masks in class 65 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test in the UK, while a further 4,712 people have tested positive, daily figures show Hundreds of thousands of care home residents in England will be able to receive indoor visits from a nominated friend or relative from today Scotland's first minister has said mass gatherings of Rangers fans celebrating the side's Premiership win were ""disgraceful"" Edited by Rob Corp and Paul Gribben Thanks for reading today's live updates on the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and across the globe. Today's updates were brought to you by Hamish Mackay, John Harrison, Alice Evans and Jennifer Scott. The editors were Rob Corp and Paul Gribben. Thanks for joining us. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic until tomorrow. But before we do, here's a re-cap of today's main headlines:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In the Covid briefing, the prime minister talked about a
âbig budget of riskâ from opening schools, adding transmission will inevitably
rise. While children are at incredibly low risk and evidence
suggests they are less susceptible to infection and transmit less - certainly
younger children - having millions mixing in school will of course lead to some
spread. Schools, after all, are not islands. Children go home and mix with
their families. During the November lockdown cases fell despite schools
being open. But modelling forecasts that may not be the case this time.
That is because of the new more contagious UK variant has become dominant since
then. Experts say this could pushthe R numberabove one, leading a growth in
cases. But the bigger question is whether this matters. With the
rollout of the vaccination programme â nearly half of adults have received
their first dose â the link between infection rates and serious illness has
begun to be broken. There are though still vulnerable people who are yet to be
vaccinated or are only just building up their immunity following a vaccination. This is why there is a delicate balance to be struck. Some
rise can be tolerated, but not too much. Many travel businesses continue to be ""excluded"" from government support despite not trading for almost a year due to Covid, according to an industry trade body. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) says tour operators, online travel companies and home-based workers are not eligible for government grants. As uncertainty over testing regimes and quarantine continues to hit bookings, ABTA is calling on the government to make support available for all travel businesses that have been forced to shut due to the pandemic. A number of travel firms have fallen into administration in the last year. In Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget last week, the government extended the furlough scheme, business rates relief and VAT reductions. It also extended grants for struggling retail businesses. But ABTA says: ""We urge the government to... make grants available to all travel businesses, not just those with retail premises, recognising that the reopening of overseas travel will come later than the other sectors and will likely be gradual.""

Noah painted the background for this piece, which was finished artist and NHS worker Freeman (@freeman_uk on Instagram) A 12-year-old boy's lockdown art project has raised about Â£100,000 for charity, after 250 artists came forward to help him. Noah, who hashydrocephalus,external, epilepsy and cerebral palsy, began painting on cardboard at home in Dedham, Essex, a year ago. His father posted on Instagram, asking artists to finish the pictures. They weredisplayed in a gallerybefore being auctioned for theColchester and Ipswich Hospitals Charity,external. Mr Jones sent the backgrounds that his son created to the artists, who finished them and posted them back. More than 200 pieces were then auctioned on eBay and raised more than Â£80,000, with the rest made up from book sales featuring the art and donations. Noah's father Nathan Jones says they had originally hoped to raise Â£500 and are ""absolutely stunned"" by the total. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked if
more money would be made available to help people deal with the financial
impact of having to self-isolate. âWhat weâre doing in addition to helping people to self-isolate - in addition to the Â£500 support and all the rest of it
- is giving money to councils. I have a figure of Â£170m in my head to help
them give people who really need it help to self-isolate,â he said. Weâre not sure where the Â£170m figure
comes from. However, we know that since the end of
September, the government has given councils Â£110m to fund the Test and Trace
Support Payment scheme. This scheme gives those on low-incomes a
Â£500 payment, if they can prove they will be financially affected if they have
to stay at home for the 10-day isolation period. We recently used a Freedom of Information request for figures on this for all councils in England and Wales. Their
responses showed that two-thirds of people who applied for the payment did not
get it. Councils and unions told us that the
criteria for getting the payment was too tough. You can find out more about this here. Queuing for Covid tests at the Harris Academy in Beckenham, south London The first day back at school for millions of children in Englandhas ""gone well"", say head teachers. They are reporting high levels of take-up of Covid tests and compliance with new rules on wearing masks in secondary school classrooms. Primary schools have opened in full, but most secondary schools are phasing a return to allow time for Covid tests. As we reported earlier, at a Downing Street news conference the prime minister described it as a ""big day and an emotional day"" for families. Indoor care home visits have resumed in England today and the BBC has been speaking to some of those affected. Beccy Pile, 48, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, spent an hour with her 23 year-old son today at his care home in Essex earlier. Luke has lived at the home for adults with learning
disabilities for the last three years - but Beccy has only managed to see him twice in the last year before today. âIt feels like itâs been forever since I last saw him,"" she says. ""It
was incredible. He was really excited and had tidied his flat. âWe had to stop ourselves from hugging each other because
thatâs not allowed yet but he has a sign for a hug where he puts his arms
across his chest which he did and he blew me lots of kisses. âThe visit was incredibly well-managed. I only had an hour
but it didnât feel like an hour because the home had everything ready. ""I had my
test in the car park half an hour before and as soon as it was negative I could
go in and spend my time with him. âI did have a moment where I thought âwhat if itâs positive
because Luke thinks Iâm coming?â I thought I might have to just see him through
the window or something but thankfully it was OK."" Boris Johnson has finished his Downing Street briefing. If you're just a joining us, here's a recap of what was said: Asked by the Metro about a proposed 1% pay rise for some NHS workers, the PM repeats his ""gratitude"" for the nursing profession during the pandemic. He says that rather than a greater pay rise -which is what the unions have called for- many nurses have told him they most want to solve staffing issues in the health service and boost the number of people training to be nurses. ""I understand of course that the whole sector has been under massive pressure,"" he says, adding that the government has been investing ""colossally"" to support the NHS during Covid. The next journalist points to reports about parents failing to give permission for testing their children, and asks if they are ""undermining the safety of their classmates"". Dr Harries says she does recognise that for many parents ""it is quite an unusual ask"" and ""it will take time for families to get used to that"". But she believes that, ""with time"", families will give their permission, as it will not just help students, but will be ""for their family's benefit as well"". The final question is away from Covid and about the ongoing post-Brexit issues with trade, especially in Northern Ireland. Asked if it was time he ""came clean"" that his Brexit deal was not as great as he claimed, Johnson sticks to his guns by backing it. He says there is ""no question"" that there have been ""teething problems"" - but he believes they can ""all be ironed out... with goodwill and imagination"". Next up is a question for Dr Jenny Harries, after unions said schools could close again in the near future. Asked if she agrees, she says ""hopefully not"" as education is ""critical"" - adding the public can be ""very optimistic"". But she warns there may be a short period with more students testing positive and being taken out of school, advising people to look to ""three or four weeks' time"" for an accurate reading of how it is going. The PM is then pressed again about Harry and Meghan, and asked if the Royal family is racist. Johnson jokingly praises the reporter for his ""determined attempt to involve me in this story"". ""But he adds: ""I really think when it comes to matters with the Royal family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing."" Ben Kentish of LBC asks whether lockdown could be eased a little earlier than the PM has set out in his roadmap, on the basis that the vaccine rollout is going so well. The PM says he agrees there are some ""encouraging signs"" in the data on vaccinations and declining case numbers, but that we must not forget there is a ""big budget of risk"" in reopening schools. He says ""the whole point"" of his cautious easing is to remember where we were last summer - when rates were relatively low - before a surge in cases in the autumn and winter. Johnson adds that he believes businesses would rather see a ""cautious and irreversible"" approach to easing measures than a ""hasty"" one that leads to them having to be closed down again. Harries adds that each stage of the roadmap involves waiting and checking, and ""we need that time period"" of four to five weeks of observation before moving on to the next phase. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent On International Women's Day, the prime minister says the burden of childcare and home-schooling has fallen
""disproportionately"" on women during the pandemic. Earlier, his spokeswoman told
reporters he was keen to hear from women in business how flexible working could
continue beyond the pandemic. Boris Johnson hosted a
virtual round table discussion with senior female business figures this
morning. But she said it was ""not
unreasonable"" to ask questions about the PM's attitude to
women given some of his past comments and work as a journalist. The BBC's Ben Wright asks if Johnson and Harries accept that infection rates will go up now that children in England are back in the classroom - and what would be an acceptable level. The PM says a risk of increased transmission now that schools are back is ""inevitable"". But he adds that immunity has ""bedded in"" for millions of people who have now had their first dose of the Covid vaccine, which means it's safe to continue with the reopening plans. As we approach the next steps of lockdown easing we must be ""very, very cautious,"" the PM warns. Harries adds that education is of public health importance ""just as much as Covid is"" so the UK should press on with getting children back to school. She adds that it will be difficult to tell what impact a return to schools has to the numbers, because social interaction will also increase as the roadmap continues. While the news conference is about the continuing pandemic, the PM is asked about the big story of the day -the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""I've always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country and  across the Commonwealth,"" he says. He says he's spent ""a long time"" not commenting on Royal Family matters and doesn't plan to make that change. The next question is on the rumoured spend of Â£200,000 on refurbishing the PM's Downing Street flat but Johnson does not reveal any details. He is then asked, with the vaccination programme significantly accelerated since his roadmap announced, would he consider speeding up exiting lockdown. Johnson says he understands ""the urgency that people feel"", but says the government must be ""driven by the data"". He says case rates are still very high and there are thousands still in hospital. Johnson says we must ""remain prudent"" and people would prefer ""security and certainty"" in the roadmap out of lockdown. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson is preparing
the public for a rise in coronavirus cases after the return of all pupils to
schools in England. He says the risk of increased
transmission is âinevitableâ, but that as the vaccine programme continued, immunity would be ""bedded in."" The key factor will be the
impact that has on the number of people admitted to hospital and in turn the
strain it puts on the NHS, which Dr Jenny Harries says would be ""considerably
less"". It's perhaps the first sign
of how the UK will manage and live with coronavirus cases long term after the
pandemic has passed. The press conference now moves to questions - starting with two from the public. The first - Arjun from Watford - asks about young people, saying they are at ""the bottom of the priority list"" and need more support. Johnson says ""the most important thing"" was getting young people back into school, which will make a ""massive difference"". For those thinking about jobs and their futures, he adds the government wants to ""give you the maximum possible help"" by supporting business. The second member of the public asks the PM about the much-rumoured vaccine passports and how under-16s might be able to travel. He says the government is looking at the way certificates could work, but adds they ""raise all sorts of issues"" around those who can't get vaccines, for example. Johnson says it is a ""novel"" idea for the UK, but says they may become part of our future. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the declining death and case rates in the UK are ""pleasing"" but should have ""some caution attached"". The case rate is still falling, she says, but is not uniform across the country. Harries says ""it's really important"" that everyone continues to practise social distancing and follows the rules in place. She adds that the case rate is back to around the levels the UK had in September, adding: ""This is a level at which a new wave could easily take off again from."" Boris Johnson says there now needs to be a ""concerted programme"" from the government to ensure it carries on with its ""cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom"". He says a quarter of the population has now been vaccinated and it has been at least three weeks since the most vulnerable had their first dose, giving him ""confidence"" in the first steps. As well as schools, changes today include being able to meet one to one outside, and for people to visit loved ones in care homes. Johnson warns, however, that this will have ""an impact on the spread of the virus"" - but promises that ""at all times, we will be driven by the data"" on opening up. Â© 2025 BBC.

Crowds of celebrating Rangers fans 'disgraceful',"Crowds gathered in George Square to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership Police say arrests were made and fines issued after crowds of fans gathered to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership. Large numbers of supporters made their way to Ibrox Stadium and Glasgow's George Square to mark the achievement despite warnings to stay at home. Nicola Sturgeon said the crowds were ""infuriating and disgraceful"" and could delay the end of the Covid lockdown. Rangerstook the title after Celtic failed to beat Dundee United. The result gave Rangers an unassailable 20-point lead and the title for the first time in 10 years. Under current guidance, public gatherings are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. Football games are taking place behind closed doors with no fans in the stadium. However, following Sunday's game, crowds of fans took to the streets, as some let off flares while others chanted and waved flags outside the club ground. In Glasgow city centre fans flocked to George Square to celebrate being crowned Scottish champions. In a tweet, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Rangers on the title win, but added: ""Gathering in crowds just now risks lives, and could delay exit from lockdown for everyone else."" ""If those gathering care at all about the safety of others & the country, they will go home,"" she said. In a later tweet she said: ""I share folks' anger at this."" She added it was ""infuriating and disgraceful"" to see the crowds ""risk our progress"" after everyone complying with lockdown rules has made ""so many sacrifices"". Allow Twitter content?

Ch Supt Mark Sutherland said officers attended gatherings at both George Square and outside Ibrox stadium. Arrests were made and fixed penalty notices issued for breaches of the Covid restrictions, disorder incidents and the use of pyrotechnic devices, he added. In a statement published shortly before 21:00, he urged fans to make their way home. The PA news agency reported that by 21:30 police officers had encircled a depleting group of fans at the base of the Scott Monument in George Square. Last Maythousands of Liverpool fans flouted social distancing guidelinesand gathered outside Anfield to celebrate the club's first Premier league title in 30 years. And in Novemberhundreds of Celtic supporters defied the level four restrictions and converged on Celtic Park to call for the removal of the club's then manager Neil Lennon. David Hamilton, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said he was ""appalled"" by the scenes. He also told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that officers, many of whom have not been vaccinated, were put in ""jeopardy"" by the supporters' actions. Mr Hamilton said he understood why people were frustrated by the Police Scotland response but said that was an operational matter for the force, which would have considered factors such as wider public order issues and road safety. He highlighted that it can take up to 20 minutes to issue a fixed penalty fine for breaches of the Covid restrictions. Mr Hamilton said: ""If we were to ticket everybody in George Square yesterday we would still be doing it just now."" But he also criticised the club for being ""silent"" and failing to address the mass gatherings on its social media accounts. He added: ""There is a responsibility to the club here. It should not take the government to have to ask the club to tell people to go home. ""That should have been something the club should have taken on themselves proactively."" The club tweeted or retweeted more than 50 times in the hours after they were crowned champions but did not address the mass gathering of fans. Social psychology expert Prof Stephen Reicher said the celebrations were ""completely predictable"" and ""in some ways encouraged"". The St Andrews University academic said it was ""disappointing that the club did not have a dialogue with the fans about how one can celebrate but in ways that are safe, in ways that don't endanger the public, that don't endanger and, indeed, don't endanger Scottish football"". He warned that it undermined the argument for safely reopening mass events including the Euros championship in Scotland. Glasgow Kelvin MSP Sandra White described the celebrations as ""absolute chaos"" and questioned what plans were in place to prevent mass gatherings. She told Good Morning Scotland: ""They [the fans] should never have been allowed to leave Ibrox and march into the city centre in large numbers. It could have been stopped there and then. ""People have lost loved ones and people can't visit loved ones and yet this is being facilitated."" Rangers fans in Northern Ireland also breached lockdown rules, with a large crowd gathering on Belfast's Shankill Road to celebrate on Sunday evening. Police Service Northern Ireland urged people to celebrate""at home safely and within the current health regulations"",external. Earlier on Sunday Scotland's justice secretary urged fans not to put lives at risk by flouting lockdown rules. Humza Yousaf also warned that Uefa would be paying ""close attention"" in anticipation of theEuropean Championships coming to Scotland. This video can not be played 'From 10 years of misery to this... bouncing' - Rangers fans celebrate at Ibrox Following their win, some Rangers players made their way to the fence to celebrate in sight of fans outside. Speaking onBBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross called the actions of fans outside Ibrox ""completely wrong"". He added: ""We've all done so much to get the virus rates down. ""I understand passions run high with football fans, but it clearly didn't match what we expect people to do during a Covid period, while many people still can't even leave their homes.""

Meghan: Royal had concerns about son's skin colour,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were interviewed by Oprah Winfrey for a two-hour CBS primetime special Meghan says one member of the Royal Family had concerns about how ""dark"" her son Archie's skin would be Winfrey clarifies that neither the Queen nor the Duke of Edinburgh were part of that conversation In unaired footage, Prince Harry says racism from the tabloid press that filtered into the rest of society was a ""large part"" of why they left the UK He says he has now been ""cut off"" financially, which is why the couple sought Netflix and Spotify deals Prince Harry reveals their new baby - due in the summer - is a girl In January 2020 the couple had an invitation to visit the Queen at Sandringham suddenly withdrawn by her private secretary, he says Meghan says she found life within the Royal Family so difficult that at times she ""didn't want to be alive any more"" But she talks about contact with the family - she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month At a government Covid briefing, Boris Johnson refuses to comment, but says he has the ""highest admiration for the Queen"" Oprah with Meghan and Harry: A Primetime Special, drew more than 17m viewers in the US The interview is being broadcast in the UK on ITV and on ITV Hub, courtesy of Harpo Productions/CBS Edited by Paul Gribben We're signing off for the night, butyou can head over to our main story for more detailsabout Harry and Meghan's interview. Today's updates were written by Alice Evans, Hazel Shearing, Jen Meierhans, Ashitha Nagesh and Emma Saunders. They were edited by Claire Heald, Sarah Fowler, Vanessa Barford, Paul Gribben and Chris Lansdown. That brings Harry and Meghan's highly anticipated interview with Oprah to a close. We've heard about the details of the interview throughout the course of the day because it aired in the US overnight, but this was the first time it was shown to UK audiences. So, here aresome of the key things you need to know: In the final instalment of the interview, Oprah asks Harry what ""delights"" him now in his new life in California. Harry replies that he loves his ""outdoor space"", taking Archie out on the back of his bike, something he was ""never able to do"". The couple laugh about Archie's most-recent favourite word being ""hydrate"" - with other top choices including ""palm tree"". Oprah asks if Meghan got her happy ending with Prince Harry after all. âGreater than any fairytale that youâve ever read,"" she says. By leaving the Royal Family, she says, ""I think [Harry] saved all of us. He ultimately called it. He made a decision that saved my life and saved all of us. ""But you need to want to be saved.â Harry and Meghan are asked whether they have any regrets. Meghan says she has one - ""believing them when they said I would be protected"". She says she believed that. But she says now, they have not just survived ""but are thriving"". Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent This is about as bad it might have been for the Royal Family, barring direct criticism of the Queen. Harry portrays his family as cold and unsympathetic, unable to relate emotionally, obsessed with who is going to pay for what. Itâs clear that relationships were and in some cases, still are, dreadful. Oprah asks Harry about Meghan's earlier comments that an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be ""That conversation, I am never going to share,"" Harry replies. ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he says, adding that this conversation took place ""right at the beginning"" of his relationship with Meghan. Oprah asks what the exact questions were in that conversation. Harry says he's not comfortable sharing that but suggests a few moments later that it was along the lines of: ""What will the kids look like?"" Oprah said earlier today that Prince Harry has clarified thatthe family member was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. Oprah asks Prince Harry what his relationship with his family is like now. He says he has spoken to the Queen, his grandmother, more in the last year than he has for many, many years and they have a really good relationship. ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be."" Asked about his relationship with his father, Prince Charles - heir to the throne - Harry pauses for a moment. ""There's a lot to work through there,"" he says. ""I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like... and Archie's his grandson. ""But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship."" Asked about the relationship with his brother, Prince William, Harry says he loves him ""to bits"" and they have been through ""hell together"". ""But we were on different paths,"" he adds. The Duke of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Prince of Wales pictured in 2019 Prince Harry says the Netflix and the Spotify deals he and Meghan have made recently were ""never part of the plan"". He says that came from when his family ""literally cut me off financially"" in the first quarter of 2020, and he had to pay for his family's security. He says the money that his late mother left him was the only way he and Meghan ""were able to do this"". Harry draws parallels between the treatment of Meghan and his mother, Princess Diana. âYou know, for me, I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you with my wife by my side,â he says. âBecause I can't begin to imagine what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself all those years ago, because it has been unbelievably tough for the two of us - but at least we had each other."" Harry's late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, relinquished the Her Royal Highness title at the time of her divorce from the Prince of Wales in August 1996. She died the following year in a car crash in Paris. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes when the accident happened. Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Trapped. Thatâs the word Harry used to describe his life in the Royal Family. Thatâs the impression he gave very often when out and about. But he goes on â he says his brother William, his father Charles, they too are trapped. And he feels compassion for them. It is a velvet-covered dagger into the institution he walked away (or, in his words, stepped back) from. You can read Jonny's full analysis here. Oprah asks Meghan and Harry about one of the prevailing storylines about the royal couple: that Meghan orchestrated their departure from the Royal Family, in what the tabloids branded as ""Megxit"". ""Can you imagine how little sense that makes?"" Meghan replies. ""I left everything for him."" She continues: ""Our plan was to do this forever."" Oprah turns to Harry, asking if he would have stepped back from his life in the Royal Family if it were not for Meghan. ""The answer is no. I wouldnât have been able to,"" he says. ""I myself was trapped."" Oprah pushes back - asking how a ""literal prince"" could be ""trapped"". I was ""trapped within the system"", Harry replies. ""My father and my brother - they are trapped. They donât get to leave - and I have huge compassion for that."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Harry looks so relaxed, so happy, so comfortable. Such a change from the deeply unhappy man he appeared to be in the final year in the UK. Meghan and Harry both come across very sympathetically, speaking without rancour but with the utmost clarity about a time in their lives they both clearly bitterly regret. This is explosive stuff â raw, revealing and hugely damaging for the Palace. Giving further details about his disappointment that his family did not show Meghan public support, Harry says: ""I also am acutely aware of where my family stands, and how scared they are of the tabloids turning on them."" He says there was an ""invisible contract"" between the Royal Family and UK tabloids - where if royals give access to reporters, they will get better press. ""There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations."" Oprah asks about how Harry and Meghan dealt with Meghan experiencing suicidal thoughts. ""I had no idea what to do, I wasn't prepared for that, I went to a very dark place as well,"" he says. Harry says he did not tell anyone in the family because ""that's just not a conversation that would be had"". ""I guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them,"" he says, adding that it's a very trapping environment. ""I didn't have anyone to turn to,"" he adds. ""For the family, they very much have this mentality of, 'this is just how it is. This is how it's meant to be, you can't change it, we've all been through it'. ""But what was different for me, was the race element. Because it wasn't just about her, it was about what she represents. He adds that for Meghan and Harry, ""and the specifics around her race"", it was an opportunity for the Royal Family ""to show some public support"". He says the ""most telling"" parts - and ""saddest parts"" - was that more than 70 MPs came out and condemned the colonial undertones of headlines and news articles. ""Yet no-one from my family ever said anything over those three years,"" he says. ""That hurts."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Just slipped into the conversation, as he listed the calls that he made to his family to talk about his future, is that Harryâs father - Prince Charles - stopped taking his calls. Did Harry mean to let that slip? Who knows? But it is an insight into how bad things got, maybe still are, in private relations inside the Royal Family. Harry says his biggest concern while living in Canada was that their security was going to be removed and people knew their location. He adds in a jibe at the Daily Mail newspaper at this point - saying that people knew their exact location ""courtesy of the Daily Mail"". He says the Palace's justification for removing security was ""a change in status""- but Harry says he ""pushed back"" and asked whether there had been a change of threat or risk, to which the Palace said no. They decided to move to California because they felt they were not safe in Canada. Oprah asks them what was the tipping point to their decision to step back as senior royals. ""It was desperate,"" says Harry. ""I went to all the places which I thought I should go to to ask for help, we both did, separately and together. Oprah asks: ""So you left because you were asking for help but couldn't get it?"", ""Yeah, basically,"" says Harry. ""But we never left,"" he says. ""We never left the family,"" adds Meghan, saying they only wanted to have a type of role that already exists - a non-senior royal. Harry says they wanted to ""take a breath"" from this ""constant barrage"". ""Meghan
clearly felt that the Palace was against her. That it didn't care. That it
didn't relate to the kind of pain that she was in."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond is on the latest Newscast podcast talking through
what the interview tells us about some of the relationships in the Royal
Family. Hear the full conversation now on BBC Sounds. Harry denies ever ""blindsiding"" his grandmother, the Queen, with his family's departure from senior royal duties. ""Iâve never blindsided my grandmother, I have too much respect for her,"" Harry tells Oprah. He says he had three telephone calls with the Queen ahead of the first statement announcing he and Meghan would be stepping back. He spoke with his father twice, he says, ""before he stopped taking my calls"". Why did Prince Charles stop speaking to Harry, Oprah asks. ""Because by that point I took matters into my own hands,"" Harry replies. ""It's really sad that it's gotten to this point, but I've got to do something for my own mental health, my wife's and for Archie's as well, because I could see where this was headed."" Harry said he and Meghan wanted to ""take a breath"" from ""the constant barrage"" the couple were facing as working royals. ""My biggest concern was history repeating itself,"" he tells Oprah. ""And what I was seeing was history repeating itself."" But he said this time it was ""far more dangerous"" compared to his mother's situation, taking into account the race and social media dimensions. He said he asked for help to ""call the dogs off"" but said none was given, and was instead told continuously ""this is how it is"". The Prince and Princess of Wales with Harry Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent The allegation that there were discussions in the Palace about how dark Meghanâs first baby might be is a devastating one. This is heading into ""worst-case scenario"" territory for the Palace. It is worth remembering we are currently only getting one side of the story. And Meghan has not revealed who said that to Harry. But it is a horrible allegation for the Palace to deal with. Now it's time for Prince Harry to join Meghan and Oprah. And no sooner has he sat down than they announce they are having a baby girl. Harry says his first thought was ""amazing"" and feeling ""grateful"". ""We've got our family,"" he says - ""the four of us and our two dogs"". They confirm that two children ""is it"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Welsh roads 60% busier than first lockdownTraffic on Welsh roads has increased compared with previous lockdowns, government data shows.WalesComments","Cardiff has seen one of the highest increases in south Wales All parts of Wales have seen a rise in road traffic in recent weeks, compared with the first national lockdown. Some areas recorded almost double the amount of vehicles, Traffic Wales and Welsh Government figures reveal. There has been a 62% rise in road use across Wales over the most recent six weeks compared with the first six full weeks of restrictions from March 2020. This is despite almost identical restrictions, with people asked to avoid all non-essential travel. Traffic data is recorded by the Welsh Government at specific points on roads, including main routes like the M4 and A55. Figures for 2020 and up to 20 February 2021 have been obtained by BBC Wales and from them we can get an indication of the traffic picture throughout the country. Newport saw the lowest increase in traffic in Wales, with just over 420,000 (30%) more vehicles recorded. This goes against the trend in the rest of south Wales, with every other site recording a increase higher than 70%. Newport: 30% Swansea: 72% Magor: 75% Cardiff: 81% Beulah, near Llanwrtyd Wells in Powys saw an increase of 58% - the lowest figure outside the M4. Beulah: 58% Wrexham: 64% Southgate near Aberystwyth: 70% Dolgellau, Gwynedd: 79% Conwy: 94% This recent increase follows an initial dip over the Christmas period, which saw the lowest traffic levels of 2020. The traffic levels we are seeing now were not reached last year until the very end of June, 14 weeks after the first restrictions were put in place. During summer the amount of road traffic recovered to levels seen before any restrictions were in place. However each subsequent lockdown is seeming to have less of an effect on the numbers. Prof Stuart Cole, emeritus professor of transport at the University of South Wales, said people were ""overcoming the scare that was put about"" during the first lockdown, but added that commuting was likely to fall because of homeworking. ""People just think 'well this is really efficient, I can talk to anybody just as efficiently'. So I think the new market's going to be leisure for the trains,"" he said. John Parkinson, head of psychology at Bangor University, said while he acknowledged the impact of ""lockdown fatigue,"" he thought people's intentions to follow the rules remained ""incredibly high."" ""If you have an end-point it should help people, it helps planning, commitment, and it helps motivation. But he said as vaccination rates rose, there could be a belief that ""it must be safe now"". ""So I imagine that could have a negative impact on compliance to rules."" Conwy has seen one of the largest traffic increases in Wales, with just under the double the amount of traffic recorded. Data released by Google allows us to calculate changes in travel behaviour of communities over time, compared to a baseline figure taken in January-February 2020. Using this data for Conwy, we can see that the number of people visiting parks and outdoor recreation areas has often reached levels higher than even before the pandemic. The amount of people visiting supermarkets has stayed at around the same level. However visits to retail and hospitality destinations in general have recently seen levels almost 80% lower than pre-lockdown numbers. Forecasts suggest public transport usage will take years to recover One striking decrease in behaviour, seen throughout Wales, is the decrease in people using public transport, with many regions showing more than a 60% reduction, potentially leading to inflated road traffic. Prof Cole said he thought messaging about avoiding public transport would have a lasting impact on passenger numbers. ""You believe [the government] when they say the scientists have said to stay at home, you must not travel on public transport, public transport is dangerous. ""That will be in people's minds for quite some time,"" he said. He said reassuring people public transport is safe would take a lot of time, with the most optimistic forecasts showing figures returning to 80% of the pre-pandemic level over the next three years, and only then with no restrictions in place.

The hunt for impartial jurors in George Floyd trial,"Derek Chauvin faces trial after posting a $1m (Â£720,000) bail in October It was video footage seen across the world - Derek Chauvin with his knee pressed on the neck of George Floyd for about nine minutes before he died. Now the former US police officer faces trial on second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. Three other dismissed officers will stand trial together later this year, but proceedings in Mr Chauvin's trial will start on Monday, when jury selection begins. Live updates on murder trial A pool of eligible local citizens has been called to appear by Hennepin County in Minnesota. From them, a jury of 12 and four alternates will be selected. It could take weeks. Although it is highly unlikely potential jurors will have no prior knowledge of the case - George Floyd's death in May last year in Minneapolis inspired weeks of global protests - they will be questioned to determine whether they will be able to judge Derek Chauvin fairly. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life How are African-Americans treated under the law? 'Stop yelling', officer told gasping George Floyd The prosecution and defence can both ask Judge Peter Cahill to dismiss a potential juror ""for cause"" if they perceive bias. The prosecution can also dismiss nine potential jurors - and the defence team 15 - without giving any reason, although this can be objected to. This video can not be played George Floyd death: Whatâs changed, 100 days later? Once 16 people have been approved, the jury can be seated. The trial itself will not begin until 29 March. Each potential juror has already been asked to fill in a 16-page questionnaire about the case. The main thrust is to determine familiarity with the case and issues such as a potential juror's own interactions with law enforcement. Key questions include: How many times did you see the video of George Floyd's death? Did you participate in marches against police brutality and, if so, did you carry a sign? What are your views of the group Blue Lives Matter (the movement supporting police) - favourable or unfavourable? Do you believe our criminal justice system works? How potential jurors respond can lead to either defence or prosecution dismissing them. The case prompted a wave of calls for the officers to face justice, so will be closely watched Prof Valerie Hans, a jury researcher based at Cornell Law School, says the questionnaire is more detailed and personal than most pre-trial documents, and asks about their ""deepest attitudes on some of the most important political and social topics of the day"". Prof Hans says the aim for the two teams is to get ""a sense of whether or not a prospective juror will be open to the kinds of arguments that they intend to make over the course of the trial"". The selection process is different from the UK. Jury trials there are less common, and jurors - picked at random - don't know which trial they will serve on until they've been sworn in. Jurors can only be dismissed by a judge in very specific circumstances. In cases involving issues such as racism, the selection process can be seen as hugely important to the outcome of the trial and how fair it is perceived. A lack of diversity could lead to questions about the legitimacy of the verdict. The jury pool in Hennepin County was 80% white and 8% black in the financial year to September 2020, the New York Times reported, a bigger gap than for Minneapolis as a whole (64% to 19%). The vetting system does try to ensure that a cross-section of society is represented, but at the same time, both defence and prosecution will be looking for jurors that will bring them a favourable outcome. In high-stakes trials, they often use special consultants who look at factors such as the jurors' backgrounds and even their body language. Prof Hans says the judge will need to keep a close eye on patterns emerging among dismissals of potential jurors by the prosecution or defence, as this cannot be done on race grounds. Security has been upped around where the trial will take place In general terms, legal experts say white jurors are less likely to convict law enforcement officials, although it is in unclear how much of this has changed following the worldwide reaction to the Floyd case. The chosen jurors will be partially sequestered, or isolated, during the trial and fully sequestered once deliberation starts. They will also remain anonymous until the judge allows their identities to be made public. It's not uncommon for US jurors to speak out about their deliberations afterwards, and in some infamous examples, like the OJ Simpson trial, some have even gone on to write books about their experiences. Derek Chauvin faces a long trial - it could take weeks just to select jurors The high-profile video of George Floyd's death brought an outpouring of anger in the US and beyond, but securing a legal conviction is another matter. The first issue is the charges. To convict of second-degree murder, jurors must find that Mr Chauvin had committed, or was trying to commit, a felony that caused the death. Second-degree manslaughter would mean Mr Chauvin had consciously taken the chance of causing death or injury through his negligent actions. The defence will point to Floyd's health issues or drug consumption as a likely cause of death - although the judge has already written that the prosecution only has to prove Mr Chauvin's actions were a ""substantial causal factor"". The defence will also argue Mr Chauvin was authorised to use force in his role as a police officer, in an attempt to undermine the accusation that he was trying to commit a felony. The prosecution will rely on the strong video evidence, pointing to the length of time Floyd's neck was pressed as passers-by pleaded for him, and alleging that the officer broke police department policy. It will also submit evidence of Mr Chauvin's actions in separate cases. This will include an instance where the officer restrained a female by placing his knee on her neck.

New guidance to help flat owners stuck in 'limbo',"People in flats with and without cladding have been left unable to move without the safety checks New guidance has been released aimed at reducing the number of wall safety surveys being requested by banks and building societies on blocks of flats. Thousands of flat owners have been unable to sell or remortgage because they cannot get the checks done. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said it would help lenders save time when the inspections were not needed. Most lenders are likely to follow the advice but there is no guarantee. The checks were first developed to assess the potential financial impact of cladding on high-rise flats, after 72 people died at Grenfell Tower. To begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected. Cladding rules: 'I wish I hadn't bought my flat' Safety checks eased to help flat owners 'in limbo' But after the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers. Hundreds of thousands of leaseholders have since been asked for EWS1 external wall safety forms when they sell or remortgage. This requires a specialist survey - but there haven't been enough qualified surveyors to do the checks, leaving thousands of owners ""in limbo"", according to the government. Some owners have also reported being asked for EWS1s when there appears to be little or no flammable materials attached to their building. RICS said its new guidance would clarify types of properties which will, and will not, require additional inspections to speed up mortgage approvals. It said the guidance was the result of ""painstaking"" consultation with valuers, leaseholders, lenders' fire safety experts and government. ""This announcement is a crucial step in unlocking the market, by ensuring that only those buildings where there are risks of costly remediation as a result of safety concerns from cladding are subject to additional checks,"" said Dame Janet Paraskeva, chair of the RICS Standards & Regulation Board. ""The guidance is anticipated to result in a reduction in the number of EWS1 requests which will therefore allow more focus on the assessments of higher risk buildings, which should speed up the overall process whilst ensuring appropriate protection for lenders and purchasers."" Some flat owners feel stuck ""in limbo"", Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has said Last year the government tried to solve the backlog by saying that flats in buildings without cladding would no longer need EWS1 checks. But mortgage lenders refused to recognise the directive. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said RICS' new guidance would mean ""nearly 500,000 leaseholders will no longer need an EWS1 form - helping homeowners to sell or re-mortgage more quickly and easily"". He added that the government had paid for an additional 500 surveyors to be trained to carry out EWS1 checks when they are necessary. ""The government has also provided an unprecedented investment of Â£5bn to protect leaseholders from the costs of cladding remediation,"" he said. In a joint statement, UK Finance and the Building Societies Association, which represent lenders, said that they expected many lenders to follow the guidance ""which should see the number of EWS1 requests fall"". But they added that it was still a decision ""for each lender to make based on their own risk appetite"". RICS said it would work with the government and other stakeholders to ensure the guidance is implemented by 5 April. It will also publish advice for buyers and sellers about the risks associated with multi-story, multi occupancy buildings. Holly hadn't expected difficulties with EWS1 NHS worker Holly Ciesielczuk bought 75% of her first-floor flat in Redbridge in March 2019, under shared ownership. But when she tried to borrow more money to increase her share of ownership a year later, she hit a stumbling block. Following their initial survey, her mortgage lender requested an EWS1 form, which can be obtained following an assessment of a building's external walls. The reason Holly was given by her lender was that a balcony on the building had a wooden floor. However, she says her housing association would not agree to an EWS1 because, it said, the building was not high enough to meet the criteria. The lender refused a mortgage without it, as did the next bank she tried. The combination of this and her partner's cancer diagnosis took its toll. ""I properly broke down. If I knew how much stress this was going to cause, I would never have bought my flat,"" she told the BBC. She remains unable to get a new mortgage but holds out hope. ""Naively or optimistically, I hope the guidance will provide clarity about whether I will be able to get a mortgage,"" Holly says.

BP staff set to work from home two days a weekThe oil giant told staff last month that the new model will start for office-based staff this summer.,"BP has told office-based staff they will be expected to spend two days a week working from home after lockdown restrictions ease. The oil giant said in meetings last month that most would be asked to work from home 40% of the time, or two days a week for full-time employees. The new ""hybrid"" work model will affect 25,000 BP staff, with 6,000 in the UK. It comes as part of a cost-cutting drive for the firm, which sawthousands of job cuts announced last year. BP informed staff of the changes in ""town hall"" meetings in February, and suggested that it would offer a ""more flexible, engaging and dynamic way of working"". Many of its office-based UK employees have been working from home full-time since the start of the pandemic. They were also expected to bear the brunt of redundancies announced in last June. 'People are tired of working from home' Can my boss force me to go to work? Bank boss rejects work from home as the 'new normal' In the government's roadmap,externalfor ending coronavirus restrictions, it recommends that people in England continue to work from home where possible. It is hoped, however, that all legal limits on social contact can be removed from 21 June. BP's new policy is expected to come into force this summer, after teams have discussed on a case-by-case basis how often and which days they will commute in.

Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy BP is the latest firm to commit to a new model with the pandemic having shaken up working patterns for many, previously office-based, staff. The boss of insurance firm Phoenix Group told the BBC's Today programme on Monday that its staff would continue working from home for the foreseeable future. Chief executive Andy Briggs said: ""The vast majority of our colleagues are working from home. ""We look forward to getting back into the office in due course, but our business has been able to operate very well working from home, so we're continuing to do that at the moment... although many of us are pleased to see our children go back to school."" Lloyds Banking Group is also set to reduce its office space by 20% over two years after a staff survey found that nearly 80% wanted to work at home for at least three days a week. HSBC has announced a 40% cut in its office footprint too. Paul Hubble spent five hours a day commuting to London from Eastbourne in East Sussex Paul Hubble used to have to leave his home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, at 06:10 to get to his desk at Barclays' London headquarters in Canary Wharf by 09:00 - a morning commute of two-and-a-half hours. He had to leave just before 17:00 if he wanted to make it home for 1930. But since home-working became the norm for Barclays employees, Paul says he can get more done. ""I now have more time for myself but also can be more productive in that I can start work early and finish work later,"" he told the BBC. Plus he saves Â£6,000 a year on his rail season ticket. It also means he can make time for a mid-afternoon dog walk, which he says is a ""great way of recharging the batteries"". However, others such as investment bankGoldman Sachs have rejected remote workingas the ""new normal"", with chairman and chief executive, David Solomon, calling it an ""aberration"". Last month, Barclays' chief executive Jes Staley said that working from home was ""not sustainable"". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: ""It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have."" According to thelatest data from the Office for National Statistics,external, the number of employees returning to work full-time is gradually increasing. Its survey of 4,000 people between 24 and 28 February found that 39% of adults said they were exclusively working outside the home, compared with 32% who were only working from home. The figures show about 10% are combining home-working and going in to the office. The peak of this trend came at the end of last September at 14%.

Crowds of celebrating Rangers fans 'disgraceful'Nicola Sturgeon joins criticism of crowds who gathered to celebrate Rangers' Premiership win.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Crowds gathered in George Square to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership Police say arrests were made and fines issued after crowds of fans gathered to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership. Large numbers of supporters made their way to Ibrox Stadium and Glasgow's George Square to mark the achievement despite warnings to stay at home. Nicola Sturgeon said the crowds were ""infuriating and disgraceful"" and could delay the end of the Covid lockdown. Rangerstook the title after Celtic failed to beat Dundee United. The result gave Rangers an unassailable 20-point lead and the title for the first time in 10 years. Under current guidance, public gatherings are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. Football games are taking place behind closed doors with no fans in the stadium. However, following Sunday's game, crowds of fans took to the streets, as some let off flares while others chanted and waved flags outside the club ground. In Glasgow city centre fans flocked to George Square to celebrate being crowned Scottish champions. In a tweet, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Rangers on the title win, but added: ""Gathering in crowds just now risks lives, and could delay exit from lockdown for everyone else."" ""If those gathering care at all about the safety of others & the country, they will go home,"" she said. In a later tweet she said: ""I share folks' anger at this."" She added it was ""infuriating and disgraceful"" to see the crowds ""risk our progress"" after everyone complying with lockdown rules has made ""so many sacrifices"". Allow Twitter content?

Ch Supt Mark Sutherland said officers attended gatherings at both George Square and outside Ibrox stadium. Arrests were made and fixed penalty notices issued for breaches of the Covid restrictions, disorder incidents and the use of pyrotechnic devices, he added. In a statement published shortly before 21:00, he urged fans to make their way home. The PA news agency reported that by 21:30 police officers had encircled a depleting group of fans at the base of the Scott Monument in George Square. Last Maythousands of Liverpool fans flouted social distancing guidelinesand gathered outside Anfield to celebrate the club's first Premier league title in 30 years. And in Novemberhundreds of Celtic supporters defied the level four restrictions and converged on Celtic Park to call for the removal of the club's then manager Neil Lennon. David Hamilton, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said he was ""appalled"" by the scenes. He also told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that officers, many of whom have not been vaccinated, were put in ""jeopardy"" by the supporters' actions. Mr Hamilton said he understood why people were frustrated by the Police Scotland response but said that was an operational matter for the force, which would have considered factors such as wider public order issues and road safety. He highlighted that it can take up to 20 minutes to issue a fixed penalty fine for breaches of the Covid restrictions. Mr Hamilton said: ""If we were to ticket everybody in George Square yesterday we would still be doing it just now."" But he also criticised the club for being ""silent"" and failing to address the mass gatherings on its social media accounts. He added: ""There is a responsibility to the club here. It should not take the government to have to ask the club to tell people to go home. ""That should have been something the club should have taken on themselves proactively."" The club tweeted or retweeted more than 50 times in the hours after they were crowned champions but did not address the mass gathering of fans. Social psychology expert Prof Stephen Reicher said the celebrations were ""completely predictable"" and ""in some ways encouraged"". The St Andrews University academic said it was ""disappointing that the club did not have a dialogue with the fans about how one can celebrate but in ways that are safe, in ways that don't endanger the public, that don't endanger and, indeed, don't endanger Scottish football"". He warned that it undermined the argument for safely reopening mass events including the Euros championship in Scotland. Glasgow Kelvin MSP Sandra White described the celebrations as ""absolute chaos"" and questioned what plans were in place to prevent mass gatherings. She told Good Morning Scotland: ""They [the fans] should never have been allowed to leave Ibrox and march into the city centre in large numbers. It could have been stopped there and then. ""People have lost loved ones and people can't visit loved ones and yet this is being facilitated."" Rangers fans in Northern Ireland also breached lockdown rules, with a large crowd gathering on Belfast's Shankill Road to celebrate on Sunday evening. Police Service Northern Ireland urged people to celebrate""at home safely and within the current health regulations"",external. Earlier on Sunday Scotland's justice secretary urged fans not to put lives at risk by flouting lockdown rules. Humza Yousaf also warned that Uefa would be paying ""close attention"" in anticipation of theEuropean Championships coming to Scotland. This video can not be played 'From 10 years of misery to this... bouncing' - Rangers fans celebrate at Ibrox Following their win, some Rangers players made their way to the fence to celebrate in sight of fans outside. Speaking onBBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross called the actions of fans outside Ibrox ""completely wrong"". He added: ""We've all done so much to get the virus rates down. ""I understand passions run high with football fans, but it clearly didn't match what we expect people to do during a Covid period, while many people still can't even leave their homes.""

"Women set for 'Â£100,000 pension pay gap' with men","Mothers face more insecure and lower-paid work after having children, official figures suggest. Women with dependent children are seven times more likely to work part-time than men,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS),external. More than 15% of mums also say they are economically inactive because of caring responsibilities, versus 1.9% of dads. One analyst said ""millions of mums"" were being forced to ""pay the price"" of a less secure career. The new research found that while mums who are employed were more likely to work part-time, only 25% of mothers with a one-year-old worked full-time. More than nine in 10 of the women in part-time work surveyed by the ONS said that they did not want a full-time job. This video can not be played ""I would like to work. However, I'm still taking care of my grandson at home"" But Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that there was a clear financial cost associated with the decision to work part-time or take a career break. ""This doesn't just take a toll during the early years with young children, but throughout the rest of their working life,"" she said. ""Not only do they receive lower pay, but later in life, if someone needs to stop work to look after someone else in the family - such as grandchildren or elderly parents - the job typically falls to the lower-earning mum."" The new figures from the ONS found that employment among mothers fluctuates as children get older and peaks at the age of 15 at 82.1%, before falling back again. ""This insecurity feeds into women's ability and willingness to put money aside for the long term. It's one reason why women overwhelmingly favour cash Isas and men are more likely to put money into a stocks-and-shares Isa or a pension,"" Ms Coles added. Separate research published on Monday by Scottish Widows has found that the average woman in her 20s today will retire with Â£100,000 less in her pension than her male peers. The pension firm said that women would have to work an extra 37 years if they wanted to close the gap. It blamed their lower average earnings, the higher probability of working part-time and heavier childcare burden. According to the research, over the first 15 years of their careers, women on average save about Â£2,200 a year, compared to Â£3,300 for men. The difference widens over a lifetime as wage increases lead to ""significant inequalities in retirement income"", it said. However, it added that if women increased their pensions contributions at the start of their careers by 5%, they could close the gap almost completely by the time they retired. Women's work during the pandemic Women retirees win Â£2.7bn for underpaid pensions Jackie Leiper, managing director of pensions at Scottish Widows, said: ""We know that young women have been some of the hardest hit by the short-term financial impact of the pandemic and this has only exacerbated the challenge of reaching pensions parity. ""At the same time, caring responsibilities and high childcare costs are keeping women out of the workforce, lowering their contributions and denting their pension pots."" A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""Our ground-breaking pension reforms, including automatic enrolment, have helped millions more women save into a pension, many for the first time. ""Pension participation among eligible women working in the private sector has risen from 40% in 2012, to 86% in 2019.""

Starlings stop man's car in 'impressive' displayEcologist Jamie Kingscott took a photograph of thousands of starlings as they surrounded his car.,"Jamie Kingscott said he hopes his photo will inspire more people to take an interest in wildlife An ecologist who photographed thousands of starlings as they surrounded his car has said ""you can't help but be slightly impressed"" by the birds. Jamie Kingscott, 26, from Puriton, was on his way to work on the Somerset Levels when the birds flew directly across the road in front of him. He said: ""There was several thousand of them. They were all over the place. ""They lend themselves to impressive photography. They show off to the camera quite nicely."" Mr Kingscott took the photo on his way to work at Secret World Wildlife Rescue Mr Kingscott, who works for Secret World Wildlife Rescue as a wildlife release co-ordinator, said that unlike in a standard murmuration, the birds were very low to the ground. ""They crossed the road in front of me and then turned and crossed back over, so I just stopped the car and watched,"" he said. ""I fumbled around for my phone to try and catch something of it and that was the only photo I managed. ""Then I put it on twitter and it's gone mad, it has about 3,000 likes."" He added: ""They were really low, so less of the standard murmuration, but they did do a bit of a flourish to show off, and they came right over the bonnet... it was quite something."" Mr Kingscott said that he often makes a ""special effort"" to see the stunning winter murmurations, but the fact they ""came to see me on my way to work, was quite nice of them"".

Today's updates were brought to you by Hamish Mackay, John Harrison, Alice Evans and Jennifer Scott. The editors were Rob Corp and Paul Gribben. Thanks for joining us. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic until tomorrow. But before we do, here's a re-cap of today's main headlines:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In the Covid briefing, the prime minister talked about a
âbig budget of riskâ from opening schools, adding transmission will inevitably
rise. While children are at incredibly low risk and evidence
suggests they are less susceptible to infection and transmit less - certainly
younger children - having millions mixing in school will of course lead to some
spread. Schools, after all, are not islands. Children go home and mix with
their families. During the November lockdown cases fell despite schools
being open. But modelling forecasts that may not be the case this time.
That is because of the new more contagious UK variant has become dominant since
then. Experts say this could pushthe R numberabove one, leading a growth in
cases. But the bigger question is whether this matters. With the
rollout of the vaccination programme â nearly half of adults have received
their first dose â the link between infection rates and serious illness has
begun to be broken. There are though still vulnerable people who are yet to be
vaccinated or are only just building up their immunity following a vaccination. This is why there is a delicate balance to be struck. Some
rise can be tolerated, but not too much. Many travel businesses continue to be ""excluded"" from government support despite not trading for almost a year due to Covid, according to an industry trade body. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) says tour operators, online travel companies and home-based workers are not eligible for government grants. As uncertainty over testing regimes and quarantine continues to hit bookings, ABTA is calling on the government to make support available for all travel businesses that have been forced to shut due to the pandemic. A number of travel firms have fallen into administration in the last year. In Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget last week, the government extended the furlough scheme, business rates relief and VAT reductions. It also extended grants for struggling retail businesses. But ABTA says: ""We urge the government to... make grants available to all travel businesses, not just those with retail premises, recognising that the reopening of overseas travel will come later than the other sectors and will likely be gradual."" Read the full story here. Noah painted the background for this piece, which was finished artist and NHS worker Freeman (@freeman_uk on Instagram) A 12-year-old boy's lockdown art project has raised about Â£100,000 for charity, after 250 artists came forward to help him. Noah, who hashydrocephalus,external, epilepsy and cerebral palsy, began painting on cardboard at home in Dedham, Essex, a year ago. His father posted on Instagram, asking artists to finish the pictures. They weredisplayed in a gallerybefore being auctioned for theColchester and Ipswich Hospitals Charity,external. Mr Jones sent the backgrounds that his son created to the artists, who finished them and posted them back. More than 200 pieces were then auctioned on eBay and raised more than Â£80,000, with the rest made up from book sales featuring the art and donations. Noah's father Nathan Jones says they had originally hoped to raise Â£500 and are ""absolutely stunned"" by the total. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked if
more money would be made available to help people deal with the financial
impact of having to self-isolate. âWhat weâre doing in addition to helping people to self-isolate - in addition to the Â£500 support and all the rest of it
- is giving money to councils. I have a figure of Â£170m in my head to help
them give people who really need it help to self-isolate,â he said. Weâre not sure where the Â£170m figure
comes from. However, we know that since the end of
September, the government has given councils Â£110m to fund the Test and Trace
Support Payment scheme. This scheme gives those on low-incomes a
Â£500 payment, if they can prove they will be financially affected if they have
to stay at home for the 10-day isolation period. We recently used a Freedom of Information request for figures on this for all councils in England and Wales. Their
responses showed that two-thirds of people who applied for the payment did not
get it. Councils and unions told us that the
criteria for getting the payment was too tough. You can find out more about this here. Queuing for Covid tests at the Harris Academy in Beckenham, south London The first day back at school for millions of children in Englandhas ""gone well"", say head teachers. They are reporting high levels of take-up of Covid tests and compliance with new rules on wearing masks in secondary school classrooms. Primary schools have opened in full, but most secondary schools are phasing a return to allow time for Covid tests. As we reported earlier, at a Downing Street news conference the prime minister described it as a ""big day and an emotional day"" for families. Indoor care home visits have resumed in England today and the BBC has been speaking to some of those affected. Beccy Pile, 48, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, spent an hour with her 23 year-old son today at his care home in Essex earlier. Luke has lived at the home for adults with learning
disabilities for the last three years - but Beccy has only managed to see him twice in the last year before today. âIt feels like itâs been forever since I last saw him,"" she says. ""It
was incredible. He was really excited and had tidied his flat. âWe had to stop ourselves from hugging each other because
thatâs not allowed yet but he has a sign for a hug where he puts his arms
across his chest which he did and he blew me lots of kisses. âThe visit was incredibly well-managed. I only had an hour
but it didnât feel like an hour because the home had everything ready. ""I had my
test in the car park half an hour before and as soon as it was negative I could
go in and spend my time with him. âI did have a moment where I thought âwhat if itâs positive
because Luke thinks Iâm coming?â I thought I might have to just see him through
the window or something but thankfully it was OK."" Boris Johnson has finished his Downing Street briefing. If you're just a joining us, here's a recap of what was said: Asked by the Metro about a proposed 1% pay rise for some NHS workers, the PM repeats his ""gratitude"" for the nursing profession during the pandemic. He says that rather than a greater pay rise -which is what the unions have called for- many nurses have told him they most want to solve staffing issues in the health service and boost the number of people training to be nurses. ""I understand of course that the whole sector has been under massive pressure,"" he says, adding that the government has been investing ""colossally"" to support the NHS during Covid. The next journalist points to reports about parents failing to give permission for testing their children, and asks if they are ""undermining the safety of their classmates"". Dr Harries says she does recognise that for many parents ""it is quite an unusual ask"" and ""it will take time for families to get used to that"". But she believes that, ""with time"", families will give their permission, as it will not just help students, but will be ""for their family's benefit as well"". The final question is away from Covid and about the ongoing post-Brexit issues with trade, especially in Northern Ireland. Asked if it was time he ""came clean"" that his Brexit deal was not as great as he claimed, Johnson sticks to his guns by backing it. He says there is ""no question"" that there have been ""teething problems"" - but he believes they can ""all be ironed out... with goodwill and imagination"". Next up is a question for Dr Jenny Harries, after unions said schools could close again in the near future. Asked if she agrees, she says ""hopefully not"" as education is ""critical"" - adding the public can be ""very optimistic"". But she warns there may be a short period with more students testing positive and being taken out of school, advising people to look to ""three or four weeks' time"" for an accurate reading of how it is going. The PM is then pressed again about Harry and Meghan, and asked if the Royal family is racist. Johnson jokingly praises the reporter for his ""determined attempt to involve me in this story"". ""But he adds: ""I really think when it comes to matters with the Royal family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing."" Ben Kentish of LBC asks whether lockdown could be eased a little earlier than the PM has set out in his roadmap, on the basis that the vaccine rollout is going so well. The PM says he agrees there are some ""encouraging signs"" in the data on vaccinations and declining case numbers, but that we must not forget there is a ""big budget of risk"" in reopening schools. He says ""the whole point"" of his cautious easing is to remember where we were last summer - when rates were relatively low - before a surge in cases in the autumn and winter. Johnson adds that he believes businesses would rather see a ""cautious and irreversible"" approach to easing measures than a ""hasty"" one that leads to them having to be closed down again. Harries adds that each stage of the roadmap involves waiting and checking, and ""we need that time period"" of four to five weeks of observation before moving on to the next phase. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent On International Women's Day, the prime minister says the burden of childcare and home-schooling has fallen
""disproportionately"" on women during the pandemic. Earlier, his spokeswoman told
reporters he was keen to hear from women in business how flexible working could
continue beyond the pandemic. Boris Johnson hosted a
virtual round table discussion with senior female business figures this
morning. But she said it was ""not
unreasonable"" to ask questions about the PM's attitude to
women given some of his past comments and work as a journalist. The BBC's Ben Wright asks if Johnson and Harries accept that infection rates will go up now that children in England are back in the classroom - and what would be an acceptable level. The PM says a risk of increased transmission now that schools are back is ""inevitable"". But he adds that immunity has ""bedded in"" for millions of people who have now had their first dose of the Covid vaccine, which means it's safe to continue with the reopening plans. As we approach the next steps of lockdown easing we must be ""very, very cautious,"" the PM warns. Harries adds that education is of public health importance ""just as much as Covid is"" so the UK should press on with getting children back to school. She adds that it will be difficult to tell what impact a return to schools has to the numbers, because social interaction will also increase as the roadmap continues. While the news conference is about the continuing pandemic, the PM is asked about the big story of the day -the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""I've always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country and  across the Commonwealth,"" he says. He says he's spent ""a long time"" not commenting on Royal Family matters and doesn't plan to make that change. The next question is on the rumoured spend of Â£200,000 on refurbishing the PM's Downing Street flat but Johnson does not reveal any details. He is then asked, with the vaccination programme significantly accelerated since his roadmap announced, would he consider speeding up exiting lockdown. Johnson says he understands ""the urgency that people feel"", but says the government must be ""driven by the data"". He says case rates are still very high and there are thousands still in hospital. Johnson says we must ""remain prudent"" and people would prefer ""security and certainty"" in the roadmap out of lockdown. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson is preparing
the public for a rise in coronavirus cases after the return of all pupils to
schools in England. He says the risk of increased
transmission is âinevitableâ, but that as the vaccine programme continued, immunity would be ""bedded in."" The key factor will be the
impact that has on the number of people admitted to hospital and in turn the
strain it puts on the NHS, which Dr Jenny Harries says would be ""considerably
less"". It's perhaps the first sign
of how the UK will manage and live with coronavirus cases long term after the
pandemic has passed. The press conference now moves to questions - starting with two from the public. The first - Arjun from Watford - asks about young people, saying they are at ""the bottom of the priority list"" and need more support. Johnson says ""the most important thing"" was getting young people back into school, which will make a ""massive difference"". For those thinking about jobs and their futures, he adds the government wants to ""give you the maximum possible help"" by supporting business. The second member of the public asks the PM about the much-rumoured vaccine passports and how under-16s might be able to travel. He says the government is looking at the way certificates could work, but adds they ""raise all sorts of issues"" around those who can't get vaccines, for example. Johnson says it is a ""novel"" idea for the UK, but says they may become part of our future. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the declining death and case rates in the UK are ""pleasing"" but should have ""some caution attached"". The case rate is still falling, she says, but is not uniform across the country. Harries says ""it's really important"" that everyone continues to practise social distancing and follows the rules in place. She adds that the case rate is back to around the levels the UK had in September, adding: ""This is a level at which a new wave could easily take off again from."" Boris Johnson says there now needs to be a ""concerted programme"" from the government to ensure it carries on with its ""cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom"". He says a quarter of the population has now been vaccinated and it has been at least three weeks since the most vulnerable had their first dose, giving him ""confidence"" in the first steps. As well as schools, changes today include being able to meet one to one outside, and for people to visit loved ones in care homes. Johnson warns, however, that this will have ""an impact on the spread of the virus"" - but promises that ""at all times, we will be driven by the data"" on opening up. Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveSchools back as England starts easing lockdown4 minutes ago,"UK PM Boris Johnson praises ""astonishing"" effort of teachers, staff and parents in No 10 news conference But ""emotional"" return of England's schools will have an impact on spread of virus, he warns England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries says declining rates are ""pleasing"" but ""new wave could easily take off again"" Millions of children in England are back in class after more than two months of home-schooling Primary schools have fully opened for all pupils, while secondary schools will have a phased return to class Secondary school pupils in England will take regular rapid Covid tests and need to wear masks in class 65 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test in the UK, while a further 4,712 people have tested positive, daily figures show Hundreds of thousands of care home residents in England will be able to receive indoor visits from a nominated friend or relative from today Scotland's first minister has said mass gatherings of Rangers fans celebrating the side's Premiership win were ""disgraceful"" Edited by Rob Corp and Paul Gribben Thanks for reading today's live updates on the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and across the globe. Today's updates were brought to you by Hamish Mackay, John Harrison, Alice Evans and Jennifer Scott. The editors were Rob Corp and Paul Gribben. Thanks for joining us. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic until tomorrow. But before we do, here's a re-cap of today's main headlines:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent In the Covid briefing, the prime minister talked about a
âbig budget of riskâ from opening schools, adding transmission will inevitably
rise. While children are at incredibly low risk and evidence
suggests they are less susceptible to infection and transmit less - certainly
younger children - having millions mixing in school will of course lead to some
spread. Schools, after all, are not islands. Children go home and mix with
their families. During the November lockdown cases fell despite schools
being open. But modelling forecasts that may not be the case this time.
That is because of the new more contagious UK variant has become dominant since
then. Experts say this could pushthe R numberabove one, leading a growth in
cases. But the bigger question is whether this matters. With the
rollout of the vaccination programme â nearly half of adults have received
their first dose â the link between infection rates and serious illness has
begun to be broken. There are though still vulnerable people who are yet to be
vaccinated or are only just building up their immunity following a vaccination. This is why there is a delicate balance to be struck. Some
rise can be tolerated, but not too much. Many travel businesses continue to be ""excluded"" from government support despite not trading for almost a year due to Covid, according to an industry trade body. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) says tour operators, online travel companies and home-based workers are not eligible for government grants. As uncertainty over testing regimes and quarantine continues to hit bookings, ABTA is calling on the government to make support available for all travel businesses that have been forced to shut due to the pandemic. A number of travel firms have fallen into administration in the last year. In Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget last week, the government extended the furlough scheme, business rates relief and VAT reductions. It also extended grants for struggling retail businesses. But ABTA says: ""We urge the government to... make grants available to all travel businesses, not just those with retail premises, recognising that the reopening of overseas travel will come later than the other sectors and will likely be gradual.""

Noah painted the background for this piece, which was finished artist and NHS worker Freeman (@freeman_uk on Instagram) A 12-year-old boy's lockdown art project has raised about Â£100,000 for charity, after 250 artists came forward to help him. Noah, who hashydrocephalus,external, epilepsy and cerebral palsy, began painting on cardboard at home in Dedham, Essex, a year ago. His father posted on Instagram, asking artists to finish the pictures. They weredisplayed in a gallerybefore being auctioned for theColchester and Ipswich Hospitals Charity,external. Mr Jones sent the backgrounds that his son created to the artists, who finished them and posted them back. More than 200 pieces were then auctioned on eBay and raised more than Â£80,000, with the rest made up from book sales featuring the art and donations. Noah's father Nathan Jones says they had originally hoped to raise Â£500 and are ""absolutely stunned"" by the total. You can read the full story here. Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked if
more money would be made available to help people deal with the financial
impact of having to self-isolate. âWhat weâre doing in addition to helping people to self-isolate - in addition to the Â£500 support and all the rest of it
- is giving money to councils. I have a figure of Â£170m in my head to help
them give people who really need it help to self-isolate,â he said. Weâre not sure where the Â£170m figure
comes from. However, we know that since the end of
September, the government has given councils Â£110m to fund the Test and Trace
Support Payment scheme. This scheme gives those on low-incomes a
Â£500 payment, if they can prove they will be financially affected if they have
to stay at home for the 10-day isolation period. We recently used a Freedom of Information request for figures on this for all councils in England and Wales. Their
responses showed that two-thirds of people who applied for the payment did not
get it. Councils and unions told us that the
criteria for getting the payment was too tough. You can find out more about this here. Queuing for Covid tests at the Harris Academy in Beckenham, south London The first day back at school for millions of children in Englandhas ""gone well"", say head teachers. They are reporting high levels of take-up of Covid tests and compliance with new rules on wearing masks in secondary school classrooms. Primary schools have opened in full, but most secondary schools are phasing a return to allow time for Covid tests. As we reported earlier, at a Downing Street news conference the prime minister described it as a ""big day and an emotional day"" for families. Indoor care home visits have resumed in England today and the BBC has been speaking to some of those affected. Beccy Pile, 48, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, spent an hour with her 23 year-old son today at his care home in Essex earlier. Luke has lived at the home for adults with learning
disabilities for the last three years - but Beccy has only managed to see him twice in the last year before today. âIt feels like itâs been forever since I last saw him,"" she says. ""It
was incredible. He was really excited and had tidied his flat. âWe had to stop ourselves from hugging each other because
thatâs not allowed yet but he has a sign for a hug where he puts his arms
across his chest which he did and he blew me lots of kisses. âThe visit was incredibly well-managed. I only had an hour
but it didnât feel like an hour because the home had everything ready. ""I had my
test in the car park half an hour before and as soon as it was negative I could
go in and spend my time with him. âI did have a moment where I thought âwhat if itâs positive
because Luke thinks Iâm coming?â I thought I might have to just see him through
the window or something but thankfully it was OK."" Boris Johnson has finished his Downing Street briefing. If you're just a joining us, here's a recap of what was said: Asked by the Metro about a proposed 1% pay rise for some NHS workers, the PM repeats his ""gratitude"" for the nursing profession during the pandemic. He says that rather than a greater pay rise -which is what the unions have called for- many nurses have told him they most want to solve staffing issues in the health service and boost the number of people training to be nurses. ""I understand of course that the whole sector has been under massive pressure,"" he says, adding that the government has been investing ""colossally"" to support the NHS during Covid. The next journalist points to reports about parents failing to give permission for testing their children, and asks if they are ""undermining the safety of their classmates"". Dr Harries says she does recognise that for many parents ""it is quite an unusual ask"" and ""it will take time for families to get used to that"". But she believes that, ""with time"", families will give their permission, as it will not just help students, but will be ""for their family's benefit as well"". The final question is away from Covid and about the ongoing post-Brexit issues with trade, especially in Northern Ireland. Asked if it was time he ""came clean"" that his Brexit deal was not as great as he claimed, Johnson sticks to his guns by backing it. He says there is ""no question"" that there have been ""teething problems"" - but he believes they can ""all be ironed out... with goodwill and imagination"". Next up is a question for Dr Jenny Harries, after unions said schools could close again in the near future. Asked if she agrees, she says ""hopefully not"" as education is ""critical"" - adding the public can be ""very optimistic"". But she warns there may be a short period with more students testing positive and being taken out of school, advising people to look to ""three or four weeks' time"" for an accurate reading of how it is going. The PM is then pressed again about Harry and Meghan, and asked if the Royal family is racist. Johnson jokingly praises the reporter for his ""determined attempt to involve me in this story"". ""But he adds: ""I really think when it comes to matters with the Royal family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing."" Ben Kentish of LBC asks whether lockdown could be eased a little earlier than the PM has set out in his roadmap, on the basis that the vaccine rollout is going so well. The PM says he agrees there are some ""encouraging signs"" in the data on vaccinations and declining case numbers, but that we must not forget there is a ""big budget of risk"" in reopening schools. He says ""the whole point"" of his cautious easing is to remember where we were last summer - when rates were relatively low - before a surge in cases in the autumn and winter. Johnson adds that he believes businesses would rather see a ""cautious and irreversible"" approach to easing measures than a ""hasty"" one that leads to them having to be closed down again. Harries adds that each stage of the roadmap involves waiting and checking, and ""we need that time period"" of four to five weeks of observation before moving on to the next phase. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent On International Women's Day, the prime minister says the burden of childcare and home-schooling has fallen
""disproportionately"" on women during the pandemic. Earlier, his spokeswoman told
reporters he was keen to hear from women in business how flexible working could
continue beyond the pandemic. Boris Johnson hosted a
virtual round table discussion with senior female business figures this
morning. But she said it was ""not
unreasonable"" to ask questions about the PM's attitude to
women given some of his past comments and work as a journalist. The BBC's Ben Wright asks if Johnson and Harries accept that infection rates will go up now that children in England are back in the classroom - and what would be an acceptable level. The PM says a risk of increased transmission now that schools are back is ""inevitable"". But he adds that immunity has ""bedded in"" for millions of people who have now had their first dose of the Covid vaccine, which means it's safe to continue with the reopening plans. As we approach the next steps of lockdown easing we must be ""very, very cautious,"" the PM warns. Harries adds that education is of public health importance ""just as much as Covid is"" so the UK should press on with getting children back to school. She adds that it will be difficult to tell what impact a return to schools has to the numbers, because social interaction will also increase as the roadmap continues. While the news conference is about the continuing pandemic, the PM is asked about the big story of the day -the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""I've always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country and  across the Commonwealth,"" he says. He says he's spent ""a long time"" not commenting on Royal Family matters and doesn't plan to make that change. The next question is on the rumoured spend of Â£200,000 on refurbishing the PM's Downing Street flat but Johnson does not reveal any details. He is then asked, with the vaccination programme significantly accelerated since his roadmap announced, would he consider speeding up exiting lockdown. Johnson says he understands ""the urgency that people feel"", but says the government must be ""driven by the data"". He says case rates are still very high and there are thousands still in hospital. Johnson says we must ""remain prudent"" and people would prefer ""security and certainty"" in the roadmap out of lockdown. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson is preparing
the public for a rise in coronavirus cases after the return of all pupils to
schools in England. He says the risk of increased
transmission is âinevitableâ, but that as the vaccine programme continued, immunity would be ""bedded in."" The key factor will be the
impact that has on the number of people admitted to hospital and in turn the
strain it puts on the NHS, which Dr Jenny Harries says would be ""considerably
less"". It's perhaps the first sign
of how the UK will manage and live with coronavirus cases long term after the
pandemic has passed. The press conference now moves to questions - starting with two from the public.

The hunt for impartial jurors in George Floyd trialThe trial of Derek Chauvin over the death of George Floyd puts the US jury system under the spotlight.,"Derek Chauvin faces trial after posting a $1m (Â£720,000) bail in October It was video footage seen across the world - Derek Chauvin with his knee pressed on the neck of George Floyd for about nine minutes before he died. Now the former US police officer faces trial on second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. Three other dismissed officers will stand trial together later this year, but proceedings in Mr Chauvin's trial will start on Monday, when jury selection begins. Live updates on murder trial A pool of eligible local citizens has been called to appear by Hennepin County in Minnesota. From them, a jury of 12 and four alternates will be selected. It could take weeks. Although it is highly unlikely potential jurors will have no prior knowledge of the case - George Floyd's death in May last year in Minneapolis inspired weeks of global protests - they will be questioned to determine whether they will be able to judge Derek Chauvin fairly. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life How are African-Americans treated under the law? 'Stop yelling', officer told gasping George Floyd The prosecution and defence can both ask Judge Peter Cahill to dismiss a potential juror ""for cause"" if they perceive bias. The prosecution can also dismiss nine potential jurors - and the defence team 15 - without giving any reason, although this can be objected to. This video can not be played George Floyd death: Whatâs changed, 100 days later? Once 16 people have been approved, the jury can be seated. The trial itself will not begin until 29 March. Each potential juror has already been asked to fill in a 16-page questionnaire about the case. The main thrust is to determine familiarity with the case and issues such as a potential juror's own interactions with law enforcement. Key questions include: How many times did you see the video of George Floyd's death? Did you participate in marches against police brutality and, if so, did you carry a sign? What are your views of the group Blue Lives Matter (the movement supporting police) - favourable or unfavourable? Do you believe our criminal justice system works? How potential jurors respond can lead to either defence or prosecution dismissing them. The case prompted a wave of calls for the officers to face justice, so will be closely watched Prof Valerie Hans, a jury researcher based at Cornell Law School, says the questionnaire is more detailed and personal than most pre-trial documents, and asks about their ""deepest attitudes on some of the most important political and social topics of the day"". Prof Hans says the aim for the two teams is to get ""a sense of whether or not a prospective juror will be open to the kinds of arguments that they intend to make over the course of the trial"". The selection process is different from the UK. Jury trials there are less common, and jurors - picked at random - don't know which trial they will serve on until they've been sworn in. Jurors can only be dismissed by a judge in very specific circumstances. In cases involving issues such as racism, the selection process can be seen as hugely important to the outcome of the trial and how fair it is perceived. A lack of diversity could lead to questions about the legitimacy of the verdict. The jury pool in Hennepin County was 80% white and 8% black in the financial year to September 2020, the New York Times reported, a bigger gap than for Minneapolis as a whole (64% to 19%). The vetting system does try to ensure that a cross-section of society is represented, but at the same time, both defence and prosecution will be looking for jurors that will bring them a favourable outcome. In high-stakes trials, they often use special consultants who look at factors such as the jurors' backgrounds and even their body language. Prof Hans says the judge will need to keep a close eye on patterns emerging among dismissals of potential jurors by the prosecution or defence, as this cannot be done on race grounds. Security has been upped around where the trial will take place In general terms, legal experts say white jurors are less likely to convict law enforcement officials, although it is in unclear how much of this has changed following the worldwide reaction to the Floyd case. The chosen jurors will be partially sequestered, or isolated, during the trial and fully sequestered once deliberation starts. They will also remain anonymous until the judge allows their identities to be made public. It's not uncommon for US jurors to speak out about their deliberations afterwards, and in some infamous examples, like the OJ Simpson trial, some have even gone on to write books about their experiences. Derek Chauvin faces a long trial - it could take weeks just to select jurors The high-profile video of George Floyd's death brought an outpouring of anger in the US and beyond, but securing a legal conviction is another matter. The first issue is the charges. To convict of second-degree murder, jurors must find that Mr Chauvin had committed, or was trying to commit, a felony that caused the death. Second-degree manslaughter would mean Mr Chauvin had consciously taken the chance of causing death or injury through his negligent actions. The defence will point to Floyd's health issues or drug consumption as a likely cause of death - although the judge has already written that the prosecution only has to prove Mr Chauvin's actions were a ""substantial causal factor"". The defence will also argue Mr Chauvin was authorised to use force in his role as a police officer, in an attempt to undermine the accusation that he was trying to commit a felony. The prosecution will rely on the strong video evidence, pointing to the length of time Floyd's neck was pressed as passers-by pleaded for him, and alleging that the officer broke police department policy. It will also submit evidence of Mr Chauvin's actions in separate cases. This will include an instance where the officer restrained a female by placing his knee on her neck.

The Meghan and Harry story,"The pair were first pictured together at the 2017 Invictus Games after months avoiding the cameras Meghan Markle was the American actress, with a passion for humanitarian and feminist causes. Harry was the rebel prince turned soldier, considered the world's most eligible bachelor. In the summer of 2016, the two were brought together on a blind date by a mutual friend in London. ""Beautiful"" Meghan ""just tripped and fell into my life"",Harry later told the press,and he knew immediately she was ""the one"". After just two dates, the new couple went on holiday together to Botswana, camping out under the stars. They fell in love ""so incredibly quickly"", proof the ""stars were aligned"", said Harry. To the British press, their romance was catnip. Here was a golden couple who were able to draw vast crowds, speak the language of younger generations and sprinkle royal stardust on any cause. For months the couple avoided the cameras and it wasn't until the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto that the the two were first photographed holding hands in public, smiling and laughing. Royals 'hurt' over Sussexes' announcement Royal Family tree and line of succession Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? But there had been signs early on that the fairytale was some way off a ""happily ever after"". When Harry first confirmed the relationship in late 2016, it came with a stark attack on the media, accusing them of subjecting his girlfriend to ""a wave of abuse and harassment"". He spoke of nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers, attempts by reporters and photographers to get into Meghan's home and the ""bombardment"" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life. It was a problem that was only going to get worse. Despite that - or perhaps because of that - the two grew ever closer and in September 2017, Meghan declared to Vanity Fair magazine: ""Personally, I love a great love story."" The two of them had been enjoying a special time together and were really happy and in love, she said. The media was now on high alert for the sound of royal wedding bells - and they didn't have to wait long. This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan Markle posed for the cameras in the garden at Kensington Palace In November 2017, Harry got down on one knee to propose to Meghan as they made roast chicken together at their home in Kensington Palace. Harry had designed the ring, made with two diamonds which had belonged to his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. At the centre was a diamond from Botswana. The couple shared their story in a candid interview with the BBC, and appearing brimming with positivity for the future. They revealed Meghan would give up acting to focus on causes close to her heart, working alongside her husband-to-be. ""I know that she will be unbelievably good at the job part of it,"" said Harry. Things began to shift as preparations got under way for a May 2018 wedding in Windsor. This video can not be played Highlights from the wedding ceremony It quickly became clear that this was a royal couple who wanted to do things differently - their way. The wedding, which much of the world tuned in to watch, had all the traditions - a stunning dress, cheeky bridesmaids and heartfelt vows. But, as our royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said at the time, the service with its gospel choir, young black cellist and breathtaking address from Bishop Curry, marked it out as a modern, diverse wedding for a modern, diverse couple, which seemed to point to a different future for the Royal Family. Married life brought with it new titles - the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and a new home at Windsor in Frogmore Cottage. During a trip to Merseyside, the duchess told well-wishers she was six months pregnant and did not know if it was a boy or a girl In October of that year, the couple embarked on their first royal tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, over 16 days. It was there that they shared the news that they were expecting their first baby. Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, seventh in line to throne and the Queen's eighth great-grandchild, was born on 6 May 2019. To Harry, who was by Meghan's side at the birth, little Archie was ""absolutely to die for"". Throughout Meghan's pregnancy, the continual redrawing of battlelines had gone on between the press and the couple. This was to be no repeat of the Duchess of Cambridge's birth with the circus of journalists and photographers lying in wait outside hospital doors for days on end. The press had been told there would be no information about the birth, beyond that it was happening. Such scrutiny and pressure proved to be a struggle for the newly-wed Meghan during her pregnancy and in early motherhood, she later admitted in an ITV documentary filmed during their tour of southern Africa in September. ""Not many people have asked if I'm OK,"" she said, looking lost. She spoke of her vulnerability during pregnancy and the challenges of having a new-born - ""it's a lot"". Asked if she could cope, she said she had long told Harry it was not enough to just survive - ""that's not the point of life - you have got to thrive"". Archie was christened in a private ceremony, from which the press and the public were excluded There were further signs that the couple were not happy, when the prince opened up about his mental health. He said it was under constant management and he lived with the pressures of avoiding a repeat of the past that took his mother, the Princess of Wales, from him. She died in a car crash in Paris when Harry was just 12. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes. ""Everything that she went through, and what happened to her, is incredibly important every single day, and that is not me being paranoid,"" he said. ""Part of this job is putting on a brave face but, for me and my wife, there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue,"" he added. It has also been suggested the scrutiny of Meghan has been greater because of her African-American heritage. Former US presidential candidateHillary Clinton said she wanted to hug Meghanfor the British media's ""racist"" treatment of her, while Harry hashighlighted how ""unconscious bias""can lead to racist behaviour even if people do not consider themselves to be racist. Their struggles were shared in an interview while touring southern Africa The couple's frustration and anger with some sections of the press has gone from being a matter between the palace and editors into the full glare of the public spotlight. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters and Harry filed proceedings at the High Court against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking. As such a dramatic year came to a close, the royal couple took an extended break from royal duties over Christmas, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia. It gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped theirbombshell announcement. Neither Harry's father, Prince Charles, nor his older brother, Prince William, with whom Harry has said he has ""good days"" and ""bad days"", were consulted. Harry and Meghan were, they told their Instagram followers, planning to leave their royal duties - and the royal purse - behind. They hope their next chapter, spent in North America as well as the UK, will see the two of them, together with baby Archie, make their own path to the future.

In pictures: Harry and Meghan,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The couple said last year that they would step back as ""senior"" royals, and work to become financially independent. In 2016, Kensington Palace released a statement confirming Harry had been dating US actress Meghan Markle ""for a few months"". They were pictured in public for the first time in Toronto, attending a wheelchair tennis match during the 2017 Invictus Games. They announced their engagement a few weeks after being first pictured together. Meghan told BBC News that Harry's proposal was ""just an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic"". In February 2018, the couple took part in their first joint engagement with Prince Harry's brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. As Meghan joined their Royal Foundation charity, Harry joked the foursome were now ""stuck together"". The couple were married at Windsor Castle, on 19 May 2018, with 1,200 public invitations to the grounds of the castle. They travelled through the town in a horse-drawn carriage. Up to 100,000 well-wishers lined the route as the duke and duchess travelled through Windsor. The couple exchanged vows and rings before the Queen and 600 guests at St George's Chapel. The couple kissed on the steps of St George's Chapel. The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal Family attended the wedding. The newlyweds held hands after the ceremony. In June 2018, the Queen and the duchess were seen at their first royal engagement together, as they officially opened the Mersey Gateway Bridge and Chester's Storyhouse Theatre. That autumn, Kensington Palace revealed the duchess was pregnant and the couple's baby was due in the spring. Shortly after the announcement, they embarked on their first official overseas tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. On one of their engagements, the couple posed with OneWave, a surfing community group that raises awareness of mental health and wellbeing, at Bondi Beach, in Sydney, Australia On 6 May, 2019, Meghan gave birth to a boy, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, who became seventh in line to the throne. Harry told reporters: ""It's been the most amazing experience I could ever possibly imagine"". In June 2019, the couple announced they were splitting from the charity they shared with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to set up their own foundation. Last autumn, Archie travelled with the couple to southern Africa on their first royal tour as a family, and was a big hit with Archbishop Desmond Tutu. An image of a beaming Prince Harry holding his son while on an extended stay in Canada was released by the couple as part of an Instagram compilation summing up their year. Following their trip, the couple were pictured in January on a visit to Canada House. In February, the couple announced that they are expecting their second child.

11 things we learned,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's much-anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey has aired in the US and the UK - with the couple sharing their side of the story about life in the Royal Family. The couple spoke about their relationships with other royals, racism and how their mental health suffered. Meghan spoke with Oprah for most of the interview, before being joined by Prince Harry. One of the biggest allegations from the interview was that there were ""several conversations"" within the Royal Family about how dark Meghan and Harry's baby might be. ""In those months when I was pregnant [there were] concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,"" said Meghan. She said the conversations were with Harry, who relayed them to her. Both she and Harry refused to say which royal said it. ""That conversation, I am never going to share,"" said Harry. ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked."" Harry also said that it hurt him that his family never spoke out about the ""colonial undertones"" of news headlines and articles. The couple's first child, Archie, was born in May 2019 One storythat circulated in the newspapers a few years ago,externalwas that the Duchess of Cambridge was left in tears by Meghan in the run-up to the wedding in a row over flower girl dresses. But Meghan told Oprah the reverse was true. ""A few days before the wedding [Kate] was upset about the flower girl dresses and it made me cry,"" Meghan said. She said Kate later apologised and brought flowers and a note to make amends. ""I'm not sharing that piece about Kate to be disparaging about her,"" Meghan said. She said Kate was ""a good person"" and hoped that she would have wanted the false stories corrected. The media ""really seemed to want a narrative of a hero and a villain,"" said Meghan Meghan spoke about how lonely she felt after joining the Royal Family and the loss of her freedom. ""When I joined that family, that was the last time until we came here that I saw my passport, my driver's licence, my keys, all that gets turned over,"" she said. She said her mental health got so bad that she ""didn't want to be alive any more"". ""I went to the institution and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help, said I had never felt that way before and need to go somewhere, and I was told that I couldn't, that it wouldn't be good for the institution."" She said she went to ""one of the most senior people"" within the institution and then to the palace human resources department. ""Nothing was ever done,"" she added. Princess Diana's name came up many times throughout the interview - with similarities drawn between their experiences of being in the Royal Family. ""I didn't even know who to turn to,"" said Meghan, of the time when she was struggling. ""One of the people I reached out to who's continued to be a friend and confidante was one of my husband's mom's best friends. ""Because it's like who else could understand what it's actually like on the inside?"" Oprah asked Harry about his relationships with his family and especially with his father, the Prince of Wales, and brother, the Duke of Cambridge. At one point after stepping back as senior royals, Harry said Charles ""stopped taking my calls"". ""I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like and Archie's his grandson. ""But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship."" On William, Harry said he loved him to bits and they have been through hell together. ""But we were on different paths."" Harry said he has a ""really good"" relationship with his grandmother and he has spoken to her more in the past year - including video calls with Archie - than he has for many years. ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be."" Meghan also praised the Queen and said she gave her some beautiful jewellery for the couple's first joint engagement together as well as sharing a blanket with her to keep warm while travelling together. Harry denied ever ""blindsiding"" the Queen when he stepped down as a senior royal In the first quarter of 2020, Harry said his family ""literally cut me off financially"". He said the Netflix and Spotify deals that he and Meghan have struck to make shows and podcasts were never part of the plan but ""I had to afford security for us"". ""But I've got what my mum left me and without that we wouldn't have been able to do this."" The couple reveal that, after they were cut off, American billionaire and media mogul Tyler Perry provided Harry and Meghan with a home and security last year when they moved from Canada to southern California. Meghan said that the evening after she told Harry that she was feeling suicidal, they had to attend an official event at the Royal Albert Hall. Meghan spoke about a photo that has haunted her because of what it reminded her of. ""You've no idea what's going on for someone behind closed doors,"" said the duchess She said a friend had commented how great the couple looked but she added: ""That picture, if you zoom in, what I see is how tightly his knuckles are gripped around mine,"" she told Oprah, as she became emotional. ""We are smiling and doing our job but we're both just trying to hold on. ""Every time those lights went down in that royal box, I was just weeping."" Talking about the first time she met the Queen, Meghan said she was surprised to learn she had to curtsy. She said she thought it was just ""part of the fanfare"" and didn't happen inside the Royal Family She described having to quickly practise curtsying before an impromptu lunch with the Queen. ""I said: 'It's your grandmother,"" said Meghan. ""He said: 'It's the Queen.'"" Meghan added that she hadn't done any research on the family before joining - and insisted she had never looked up her husband online while they were dating. Millions of people watched Harry and Meghan tie the knot at Windsor Castle in 2018. That ceremony was when they were legally married - but the couple revealed they also exchanged vows in front of the Archbishop of Canterbury three days before. Meghan said: ""We called the archbishop and we just said, 'look, this thing, this spectacle is for the world but we want our union between us... just the two of us in our backyard'."" Harry spoke about Archie, and the joy he gets from taking him out on bike rides. The interview included a clip of the toddler playing on the beach with his parents. The couple joked that his favourite word for the past few weeks has been ""hydrate"", and Harry said whenever anyone leaves the house, Archie tells them ""drive safe"". Archie - who will be two years old in May - now says words like palm tree and house, said Harry The couple confirm they're expecting a baby girl in the summer. Harry said it was ""amazing"", adding: ""What more can you ask for?"" - but said they would be done after baby number two arrives. Towards the end of the interview, Oprah asked if Meghan had got her happy ending with Prince Harry after all. ""Greater than any fairytale that you've ever read,"" she said.

LiveLiveMeghan drops race bombshell in Oprah TV interview4 minutes ago,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were interviewed by Oprah Winfrey for a two-hour CBS primetime special Meghan says one member of the Royal Family had concerns about how ""dark"" her son Archie's skin would be Winfrey clarifies that neither the Queen nor the Duke of Edinburgh were part of that conversation In unaired footage, Prince Harry says racism from the tabloid press that filtered into the rest of society was a ""large part"" of why they left the UK He says he has now been ""cut off"" financially, which is why the couple sought Netflix and Spotify deals Prince Harry reveals their new baby - due in the summer - is a girl In January 2020 the couple had an invitation to visit the Queen at Sandringham suddenly withdrawn by her private secretary, he says Meghan says she found life within the Royal Family so difficult that at times she ""didn't want to be alive any more"" But she talks about contact with the family - she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month At a government Covid briefing, Boris Johnson refuses to comment, but says he has the ""highest admiration for the Queen"" Oprah with Meghan and Harry: A Primetime Special, drew more than 17m viewers in the US The interview is being broadcast in the UK on ITV and on ITV Hub, courtesy of Harpo Productions/CBS Edited by Paul Gribben We're signing off for the night, butyou can head over to our main story for more detailsabout Harry and Meghan's interview. Today's updates were written by Alice Evans, Hazel Shearing, Jen Meierhans, Ashitha Nagesh and Emma Saunders. They were edited by Claire Heald, Sarah Fowler, Vanessa Barford, Paul Gribben and Chris Lansdown. That brings Harry and Meghan's highly anticipated interview with Oprah to a close. We've heard about the details of the interview throughout the course of the day because it aired in the US overnight, but this was the first time it was shown to UK audiences. So, here aresome of the key things you need to know: In the final instalment of the interview, Oprah asks Harry what ""delights"" him now in his new life in California. Harry replies that he loves his ""outdoor space"", taking Archie out on the back of his bike, something he was ""never able to do"". The couple laugh about Archie's most-recent favourite word being ""hydrate"" - with other top choices including ""palm tree"". Oprah asks if Meghan got her happy ending with Prince Harry after all. âGreater than any fairytale that youâve ever read,"" she says. By leaving the Royal Family, she says, ""I think [Harry] saved all of us. He ultimately called it. He made a decision that saved my life and saved all of us. ""But you need to want to be saved.â Harry and Meghan are asked whether they have any regrets. Meghan says she has one - ""believing them when they said I would be protected"". She says she believed that. But she says now, they have not just survived ""but are thriving"". Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent This is about as bad it might have been for the Royal Family, barring direct criticism of the Queen. Harry portrays his family as cold and unsympathetic, unable to relate emotionally, obsessed with who is going to pay for what. Itâs clear that relationships were and in some cases, still are, dreadful. Oprah asks Harry about Meghan's earlier comments that an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be ""That conversation, I am never going to share,"" Harry replies. ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he says, adding that this conversation took place ""right at the beginning"" of his relationship with Meghan. Oprah asks what the exact questions were in that conversation. Harry says he's not comfortable sharing that but suggests a few moments later that it was along the lines of: ""What will the kids look like?"" Oprah said earlier today that Prince Harry has clarified thatthe family member was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. Oprah asks Prince Harry what his relationship with his family is like now. He says he has spoken to the Queen, his grandmother, more in the last year than he has for many, many years and they have a really good relationship. ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be."" Asked about his relationship with his father, Prince Charles - heir to the throne - Harry pauses for a moment. ""There's a lot to work through there,"" he says. ""I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like... and Archie's his grandson. ""But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship."" Asked about the relationship with his brother, Prince William, Harry says he loves him ""to bits"" and they have been through ""hell together"". ""But we were on different paths,"" he adds. The Duke of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Prince of Wales pictured in 2019 Prince Harry says the Netflix and the Spotify deals he and Meghan have made recently were ""never part of the plan"". He says that came from when his family ""literally cut me off financially"" in the first quarter of 2020, and he had to pay for his family's security. He says the money that his late mother left him was the only way he and Meghan ""were able to do this"". Harry draws parallels between the treatment of Meghan and his mother, Princess Diana. âYou know, for me, I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you with my wife by my side,â he says. âBecause I can't begin to imagine what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself all those years ago, because it has been unbelievably tough for the two of us - but at least we had each other."" Harry's late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, relinquished the Her Royal Highness title at the time of her divorce from the Prince of Wales in August 1996. She died the following year in a car crash in Paris. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes when the accident happened. Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Trapped. Thatâs the word Harry used to describe his life in the Royal Family. Thatâs the impression he gave very often when out and about. But he goes on â he says his brother William, his father Charles, they too are trapped. And he feels compassion for them. It is a velvet-covered dagger into the institution he walked away (or, in his words, stepped back) from. You can read Jonny's full analysis here. Oprah asks Meghan and Harry about one of the prevailing storylines about the royal couple: that Meghan orchestrated their departure from the Royal Family, in what the tabloids branded as ""Megxit"". ""Can you imagine how little sense that makes?"" Meghan replies. ""I left everything for him."" She continues: ""Our plan was to do this forever."" Oprah turns to Harry, asking if he would have stepped back from his life in the Royal Family if it were not for Meghan. ""The answer is no. I wouldnât have been able to,"" he says. ""I myself was trapped."" Oprah pushes back - asking how a ""literal prince"" could be ""trapped"". I was ""trapped within the system"", Harry replies. ""My father and my brother - they are trapped. They donât get to leave - and I have huge compassion for that."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Harry looks so relaxed, so happy, so comfortable. Such a change from the deeply unhappy man he appeared to be in the final year in the UK. Meghan and Harry both come across very sympathetically, speaking without rancour but with the utmost clarity about a time in their lives they both clearly bitterly regret. This is explosive stuff â raw, revealing and hugely damaging for the Palace. Giving further details about his disappointment that his family did not show Meghan public support, Harry says: ""I also am acutely aware of where my family stands, and how scared they are of the tabloids turning on them."" He says there was an ""invisible contract"" between the Royal Family and UK tabloids - where if royals give access to reporters, they will get better press. ""There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations."" Oprah asks about how Harry and Meghan dealt with Meghan experiencing suicidal thoughts. ""I had no idea what to do, I wasn't prepared for that, I went to a very dark place as well,"" he says. Harry says he did not tell anyone in the family because ""that's just not a conversation that would be had"". ""I guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them,"" he says, adding that it's a very trapping environment. ""I didn't have anyone to turn to,"" he adds. ""For the family, they very much have this mentality of, 'this is just how it is. This is how it's meant to be, you can't change it, we've all been through it'. ""But what was different for me, was the race element. Because it wasn't just about her, it was about what she represents. He adds that for Meghan and Harry, ""and the specifics around her race"", it was an opportunity for the Royal Family ""to show some public support"". He says the ""most telling"" parts - and ""saddest parts"" - was that more than 70 MPs came out and condemned the colonial undertones of headlines and news articles. ""Yet no-one from my family ever said anything over those three years,"" he says. ""That hurts."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Just slipped into the conversation, as he listed the calls that he made to his family to talk about his future, is that Harryâs father - Prince Charles - stopped taking his calls. Did Harry mean to let that slip? Who knows? But it is an insight into how bad things got, maybe still are, in private relations inside the Royal Family. Harry says his biggest concern while living in Canada was that their security was going to be removed and people knew their location. He adds in a jibe at the Daily Mail newspaper at this point - saying that people knew their exact location ""courtesy of the Daily Mail"". He says the Palace's justification for removing security was ""a change in status""- but Harry says he ""pushed back"" and asked whether there had been a change of threat or risk, to which the Palace said no. They decided to move to California because they felt they were not safe in Canada. Oprah asks them what was the tipping point to their decision to step back as senior royals. ""It was desperate,"" says Harry. ""I went to all the places which I thought I should go to to ask for help, we both did, separately and together. Oprah asks: ""So you left because you were asking for help but couldn't get it?"", ""Yeah, basically,"" says Harry. ""But we never left,"" he says. ""We never left the family,"" adds Meghan, saying they only wanted to have a type of role that already exists - a non-senior royal. Harry says they wanted to ""take a breath"" from this ""constant barrage"". ""Meghan
clearly felt that the Palace was against her. That it didn't care. That it
didn't relate to the kind of pain that she was in."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond is on the latest Newscast podcast talking through
what the interview tells us about some of the relationships in the Royal
Family. Hear the full conversation now on BBC Sounds. Harry denies ever ""blindsiding"" his grandmother, the Queen, with his family's departure from senior royal duties. ""Iâve never blindsided my grandmother, I have too much respect for her,"" Harry tells Oprah. He says he had three telephone calls with the Queen ahead of the first statement announcing he and Meghan would be stepping back. He spoke with his father twice, he says, ""before he stopped taking my calls"". Why did Prince Charles stop speaking to Harry, Oprah asks. ""Because by that point I took matters into my own hands,"" Harry replies. ""It's really sad that it's gotten to this point, but I've got to do something for my own mental health, my wife's and for Archie's as well, because I could see where this was headed."" Harry said he and Meghan wanted to ""take a breath"" from ""the constant barrage"" the couple were facing as working royals. ""My biggest concern was history repeating itself,"" he tells Oprah. ""And what I was seeing was history repeating itself."" But he said this time it was ""far more dangerous"" compared to his mother's situation, taking into account the race and social media dimensions. He said he asked for help to ""call the dogs off"" but said none was given, and was instead told continuously ""this is how it is"". The Prince and Princess of Wales with Harry Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent The allegation that there were discussions in the Palace about how dark Meghanâs first baby might be is a devastating one. This is heading into ""worst-case scenario"" territory for the Palace. It is worth remembering we are currently only getting one side of the story. And Meghan has not revealed who said that to Harry. But it is a horrible allegation for the Palace to deal with. Now it's time for Prince Harry to join Meghan and Oprah. And no sooner has he sat down than they announce they are having a baby girl. Harry says his first thought was ""amazing"" and feeling ""grateful"". ""We've got our family,"" he says - ""the four of us and our two dogs"". They confirm that two children ""is it"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Meghan 'didn't want to be alive anymore'In a deeply personal TV interview, Meghan tells Oprah Winfrey that she did not get help when she asked for it.","The interview took place in the garden of a house near where the couple live in Montecito, west of Los Angeles The Duchess of Sussex has said she found life within the British Royal Family so difficult that at times she ""didn't want to be alive any more"". In a deeply personal TV interview, Meghan told Oprah Winfrey that she did not get help when she asked for it. She said a low point was when Harry was asked by an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be. Oprah latersaid Harry had told her it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh who made the comment. The highly-anticipated interview with Oprah, which the couple were not paid for, aired overnight in the US. LIVE: Latest reaction to the interview 12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' During the two-hour CBS special, to be screened in the UK on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday night and on ITV Hub, Courtesy of Harpo Productions/CBS, the couple covered a range of topics, including racism, mental health, their relationship with the media and Royal Family dynamics. In other key revelations: The couple announced their second child, which is due in the summer, is a girl They exchanged vows in a ceremony led by the Archbishop of Canterbury in their ""backyard"" three days before they were legally married at their public wedding in May 2018 Harry said his brother and father were ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family He said his family cut him off financially at the beginning of last year and his father stopped taking his calls But Harry said he loved his brother ""to bits"" and wanted to heal his relationship with both him and his father Meghan said she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month The couple moved to California after formally stepping down from royal duties in March 2020, and it was announced last month that they would not be returning as working members of the Royal Family. Meghan referred to the Duchess of Cambridge as ""Kate"" during the interview Meghan said that she started to feel lonely when limits were placed on what she could do, revealing that at one point she did not leave the house for months. At one point she thought she ""could not feel lonelier"", she told Oprah. Asked by Oprah if she was thinking of self-harm and having suicidal thoughts at some stage,  the 39-year-old replied: ""Yes. This was very, very clear. Very clear and very scary. I didn't know who to turn to in that."" Meghan said that she felt ""haunted"" by a photograph from an official event she attended with Harry at the Royal Albert Hall while she was pregnant. ""Right before we had to leave for that (event), I had just had that conversation with Harry that morning,"" Meghan said. Winfrey asked: ""That you don't want to be alive any more?"" ""Yeah,"" Meghan confirmed. She said that she attended the event with Harry that night because she felt she could not be ""left alone"" and recalled Harry gripping her hand tightly while in attendance at the Royal Albert Hall. Harry and Meghan attended the premiere of Cirque du Soleil's Totem at the Royal Albert Hall in January 2019 Oprah also asked the duchess why she thought the Royal Family did not make her son Archie a prince - which Meghan said she wanted so that he would get police protection. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children do not automatically become princes or princesses because of a rule that has been in place since 1917 - unless the Queen steps in. ""In those months when I was pregnant, all around this same time so we have in tandem the conversation of he won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title, and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,"" Meghan said. She said the remarks about skin colour were made to Harry and he relayed them to her. Asked by Oprah whether there were concerns that her child would be ""too brown"" and that would be a problem, Meghan said: ""If that is the assumption you are making, that is a pretty safe one."" When pressed, she refused to reveal who the individual was, saying: ""I think that would be very damaging to them."" The couple's first child, Archie, was born in May 2019 Harry also refused to give further details, saying: ""That conversation, I am never going to share."" ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he added. The 36-year-old prince said that none of his relatives spoke out in support of Meghan following the racism he said his wife faced from the media. ""No-one from my family ever said anything over those three years. That hurts,"" Harry said. Meghan and Harry have upended the narrative created by Britain's bestselling newspapers. They have revealed the terrible strains inside the palace. They have drawn a picture of unfeeling individuals lost in an uncaring institution. They have spoken of racism within the Royal Family. This was a devastating interview. But Harry describing his brother and father as ""trapped"", and Meghan revealing that she repeatedly sought help within the palace only to be rebuffed, is a body blow to the institution. It's not at all clear if and how the palace will respond. Many of the revelations are so personal that getting any reaction seems unlikely. The Queen has made clear repeatedly the affection in which the couple are still held. As for the newspapers that the couple so despise - will they change their tune? It is not in their nature. There were pages of bile in some Sunday newspapers prior to the interview. Meghan and Harry have given up on getting a fair hearing from many of the most popular publications. It seems highly unlikely that they will see anything published that will make them change their minds. During the interview, the Royal Family were also accused of failing to protect the duke and duchess, with Meghan saying the situation ""started to really worsen"" after the couple married in May 2018. ""I came to understand that not only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family. ""But they weren't willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband."" She was referencing rumours that she had made the Duchess of Cambridge cry during a disagreement about flower girl dresses - a story that prompted a flurry of tabloid stories. Meghan said the opposite happened. She added that Catherine later apologised, bringing flowers and a note to make amends. Royal Family tree and line of succession In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together Joining his wife and Oprah for the second half of the interview, Harry talked about his relationship with the rest of his family. He said his relationship with his grandmother, the Queen, was ""really good"" and that the two of them speak often. However, his relationship with his father, the Prince of Wales, has suffered. Harry said that he feels ""really let down"" by his father. He added that he will always love him, but ""there's a lot of hurt that's happened"". He described his father and his brother as ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family. ""They don't get to leave,"" he added. Of Prince William, he said they were on ""different paths"". This video can not be played Dean Stott, a friend of Prince Harry, suggested that he didn't think the Royal Family had ""a voice"" The interview aired while Harry's grandfather, Prince Philip,was recovering in hospital after a heart procedure- although it was recorded before Prince Philip was admitted. When he went into hospital, Meghan said she phoned the Queen ""just to check in"". She said the monarch had ""always been wonderful to me"" and recalled her sharing her blanket while travelling together between visits. Harry also revealed that his family had cut him off financially at the beginning of last year, after the couple announced their intention to step back as senior royals. He said deals withNetflixandSpotifywere ""never part of the plan"" but they needed them to pay for security staff. In new footage not included in the original interview,Prince Harry was asked if the couple left the UK because of racism, and replied: ""It was a large part of it."" He recalled a conversation he had with someone with media connections who advised him not to take on the British tabloid press. He said he was told he had to understand that the UK was ""very bigoted"". But Harry recalled that he immediately responded: ""The UK is not bigoted, the UK press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids."" The prince told Oprah: ""But unfortunately if the source of info is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Meghan's allegations about racism and lack of mental health support should be taken ""very seriously"". Asked whether Boris Johnson agreed with this, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was ""a matter for the palace"" and Mr Johnson had not seen the interview.

Meghan 'didn't want to be alive anymore',"The interview took place in the garden of a house near where the couple live in Montecito, west of Los Angeles The Duchess of Sussex has said she found life within the British Royal Family so difficult that at times she ""didn't want to be alive any more"". In a deeply personal TV interview, Meghan told Oprah Winfrey that she did not get help when she asked for it. She said a low point was when Harry was asked by an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be. Oprah latersaid Harry had told her it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh who made the comment. The highly-anticipated interview with Oprah, which the couple were not paid for, aired overnight in the US. LIVE: Latest reaction to the interview 12 things we learned from Meghan's Oprah interview 'Royalty is not a shield from the despair of racism' During the two-hour CBS special, to be screened in the UK on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday night and on ITV Hub, Courtesy of Harpo Productions/CBS, the couple covered a range of topics, including racism, mental health, their relationship with the media and Royal Family dynamics. In other key revelations: The couple announced their second child, which is due in the summer, is a girl They exchanged vows in a ceremony led by the Archbishop of Canterbury in their ""backyard"" three days before they were legally married at their public wedding in May 2018 Harry said his brother and father were ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family He said his family cut him off financially at the beginning of last year and his father stopped taking his calls But Harry said he loved his brother ""to bits"" and wanted to heal his relationship with both him and his father Meghan said she phoned the Queen after Prince Philip went into hospital last month The couple moved to California after formally stepping down from royal duties in March 2020, and it was announced last month that they would not be returning as working members of the Royal Family. Meghan referred to the Duchess of Cambridge as ""Kate"" during the interview Meghan said that she started to feel lonely when limits were placed on what she could do, revealing that at one point she did not leave the house for months. At one point she thought she ""could not feel lonelier"", she told Oprah. Asked by Oprah if she was thinking of self-harm and having suicidal thoughts at some stage,  the 39-year-old replied: ""Yes. This was very, very clear. Very clear and very scary. I didn't know who to turn to in that."" Meghan said that she felt ""haunted"" by a photograph from an official event she attended with Harry at the Royal Albert Hall while she was pregnant. ""Right before we had to leave for that (event), I had just had that conversation with Harry that morning,"" Meghan said. Winfrey asked: ""That you don't want to be alive any more?"" ""Yeah,"" Meghan confirmed. She said that she attended the event with Harry that night because she felt she could not be ""left alone"" and recalled Harry gripping her hand tightly while in attendance at the Royal Albert Hall. Harry and Meghan attended the premiere of Cirque du Soleil's Totem at the Royal Albert Hall in January 2019 Oprah also asked the duchess why she thought the Royal Family did not make her son Archie a prince - which Meghan said she wanted so that he would get police protection. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children do not automatically become princes or princesses because of a rule that has been in place since 1917 - unless the Queen steps in. ""In those months when I was pregnant, all around this same time so we have in tandem the conversation of he won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title, and also concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he was born,"" Meghan said. She said the remarks about skin colour were made to Harry and he relayed them to her. Asked by Oprah whether there were concerns that her child would be ""too brown"" and that would be a problem, Meghan said: ""If that is the assumption you are making, that is a pretty safe one."" When pressed, she refused to reveal who the individual was, saying: ""I think that would be very damaging to them."" The couple's first child, Archie, was born in May 2019 Harry also refused to give further details, saying: ""That conversation, I am never going to share."" ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he added. The 36-year-old prince said that none of his relatives spoke out in support of Meghan following the racism he said his wife faced from the media. ""No-one from my family ever said anything over those three years. That hurts,"" Harry said. Meghan and Harry have upended the narrative created by Britain's bestselling newspapers. They have revealed the terrible strains inside the palace. They have drawn a picture of unfeeling individuals lost in an uncaring institution. They have spoken of racism within the Royal Family. This was a devastating interview. But Harry describing his brother and father as ""trapped"", and Meghan revealing that she repeatedly sought help within the palace only to be rebuffed, is a body blow to the institution. It's not at all clear if and how the palace will respond. Many of the revelations are so personal that getting any reaction seems unlikely. The Queen has made clear repeatedly the affection in which the couple are still held. As for the newspapers that the couple so despise - will they change their tune? It is not in their nature. There were pages of bile in some Sunday newspapers prior to the interview. Meghan and Harry have given up on getting a fair hearing from many of the most popular publications. It seems highly unlikely that they will see anything published that will make them change their minds. During the interview, the Royal Family were also accused of failing to protect the duke and duchess, with Meghan saying the situation ""started to really worsen"" after the couple married in May 2018. ""I came to understand that not only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family. ""But they weren't willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband."" She was referencing rumours that she had made the Duchess of Cambridge cry during a disagreement about flower girl dresses - a story that prompted a flurry of tabloid stories. Meghan said the opposite happened. She added that Catherine later apologised, bringing flowers and a note to make amends. Royal Family tree and line of succession In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together Joining his wife and Oprah for the second half of the interview, Harry talked about his relationship with the rest of his family. He said his relationship with his grandmother, the Queen, was ""really good"" and that the two of them speak often. However, his relationship with his father, the Prince of Wales, has suffered. Harry said that he feels ""really let down"" by his father. He added that he will always love him, but ""there's a lot of hurt that's happened"". He described his father and his brother as ""trapped within the system"" of the Royal Family. ""They don't get to leave,"" he added. Of Prince William, he said they were on ""different paths"". This video can not be played Dean Stott, a friend of Prince Harry, suggested that he didn't think the Royal Family had ""a voice"" The interview aired while Harry's grandfather, Prince Philip,was recovering in hospital after a heart procedure- although it was recorded before Prince Philip was admitted. When he went into hospital, Meghan said she phoned the Queen ""just to check in"". She said the monarch had ""always been wonderful to me"" and recalled her sharing her blanket while travelling together between visits. Harry also revealed that his family had cut him off financially at the beginning of last year, after the couple announced their intention to step back as senior royals. He said deals withNetflixandSpotifywere ""never part of the plan"" but they needed them to pay for security staff. In new footage not included in the original interview,Prince Harry was asked if the couple left the UK because of racism, and replied: ""It was a large part of it."" He recalled a conversation he had with someone with media connections who advised him not to take on the British tabloid press. He said he was told he had to understand that the UK was ""very bigoted"". But Harry recalled that he immediately responded: ""The UK is not bigoted, the UK press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids."" The prince told Oprah: ""But unfortunately if the source of info is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Meghan's allegations about racism and lack of mental health support should be taken ""very seriously"". Asked whether Boris Johnson agreed with this, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was ""a matter for the palace"" and Mr Johnson had not seen the interview.

New guidance to help flat owners stuck in 'limbo'The recommendations aim to reduce the number of safety checks banks request on blocks of flats.Business,"People in flats with and without cladding have been left unable to move without the safety checks New guidance has been released aimed at reducing the number of wall safety surveys being requested by banks and building societies on blocks of flats. Thousands of flat owners have been unable to sell or remortgage because they cannot get the checks done. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said it would help lenders save time when the inspections were not needed. Most lenders are likely to follow the advice but there is no guarantee. The checks were first developed to assess the potential financial impact of cladding on high-rise flats, after 72 people died at Grenfell Tower. To begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected. Cladding rules: 'I wish I hadn't bought my flat' Safety checks eased to help flat owners 'in limbo' But after the government extended its advice to smaller properties in January 2020, mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range of sellers. Hundreds of thousands of leaseholders have since been asked for EWS1 external wall safety forms when they sell or remortgage. This requires a specialist survey - but there haven't been enough qualified surveyors to do the checks, leaving thousands of owners ""in limbo"", according to the government. Some owners have also reported being asked for EWS1s when there appears to be little or no flammable materials attached to their building. RICS said its new guidance would clarify types of properties which will, and will not, require additional inspections to speed up mortgage approvals. It said the guidance was the result of ""painstaking"" consultation with valuers, leaseholders, lenders' fire safety experts and government. ""This announcement is a crucial step in unlocking the market, by ensuring that only those buildings where there are risks of costly remediation as a result of safety concerns from cladding are subject to additional checks,"" said Dame Janet Paraskeva, chair of the RICS Standards & Regulation Board. ""The guidance is anticipated to result in a reduction in the number of EWS1 requests which will therefore allow more focus on the assessments of higher risk buildings, which should speed up the overall process whilst ensuring appropriate protection for lenders and purchasers."" Some flat owners feel stuck ""in limbo"", Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has said Last year the government tried to solve the backlog by saying that flats in buildings without cladding would no longer need EWS1 checks. But mortgage lenders refused to recognise the directive. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said RICS' new guidance would mean ""nearly 500,000 leaseholders will no longer need an EWS1 form - helping homeowners to sell or re-mortgage more quickly and easily"". He added that the government had paid for an additional 500 surveyors to be trained to carry out EWS1 checks when they are necessary. ""The government has also provided an unprecedented investment of Â£5bn to protect leaseholders from the costs of cladding remediation,"" he said. In a joint statement, UK Finance and the Building Societies Association, which represent lenders, said that they expected many lenders to follow the guidance ""which should see the number of EWS1 requests fall"". But they added that it was still a decision ""for each lender to make based on their own risk appetite"". RICS said it would work with the government and other stakeholders to ensure the guidance is implemented by 5 April. It will also publish advice for buyers and sellers about the risks associated with multi-story, multi occupancy buildings. Holly hadn't expected difficulties with EWS1 NHS worker Holly Ciesielczuk bought 75% of her first-floor flat in Redbridge in March 2019, under shared ownership. But when she tried to borrow more money to increase her share of ownership a year later, she hit a stumbling block. Following their initial survey, her mortgage lender requested an EWS1 form, which can be obtained following an assessment of a building's external walls. The reason Holly was given by her lender was that a balcony on the building had a wooden floor. However, she says her housing association would not agree to an EWS1 because, it said, the building was not high enough to meet the criteria. The lender refused a mortgage without it, as did the next bank she tried. The combination of this and her partner's cancer diagnosis took its toll. ""I properly broke down. If I knew how much stress this was going to cause, I would never have bought my flat,"" she told the BBC. She remains unable to get a new mortgage but holds out hope. ""Naively or optimistically, I hope the guidance will provide clarity about whether I will be able to get a mortgage,"" Holly says.

Today's updates were written by Alice Evans, Hazel Shearing, Jen Meierhans, Ashitha Nagesh and Emma Saunders. They were edited by Claire Heald, Sarah Fowler, Vanessa Barford, Paul Gribben and Chris Lansdown. That brings Harry and Meghan's highly anticipated interview with Oprah to a close. We've heard about the details of the interview throughout the course of the day because it aired in the US overnight, but this was the first time it was shown to UK audiences. So, here aresome of the key things you need to know: In the final instalment of the interview, Oprah asks Harry what ""delights"" him now in his new life in California. Harry replies that he loves his ""outdoor space"", taking Archie out on the back of his bike, something he was ""never able to do"". The couple laugh about Archie's most-recent favourite word being ""hydrate"" - with other top choices including ""palm tree"". Oprah asks if Meghan got her happy ending with Prince Harry after all. âGreater than any fairytale that youâve ever read,"" she says. By leaving the Royal Family, she says, ""I think [Harry] saved all of us. He ultimately called it. He made a decision that saved my life and saved all of us. ""But you need to want to be saved.â Harry and Meghan are asked whether they have any regrets. Meghan says she has one - ""believing them when they said I would be protected"". She says she believed that. But she says now, they have not just survived ""but are thriving"". Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent This is about as bad it might have been for the Royal Family, barring direct criticism of the Queen. Harry portrays his family as cold and unsympathetic, unable to relate emotionally, obsessed with who is going to pay for what. Itâs clear that relationships were and in some cases, still are, dreadful. Oprah asks Harry about Meghan's earlier comments that an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be ""That conversation, I am never going to share,"" Harry replies. ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he says, adding that this conversation took place ""right at the beginning"" of his relationship with Meghan. Oprah asks what the exact questions were in that conversation. Harry says he's not comfortable sharing that but suggests a few moments later that it was along the lines of: ""What will the kids look like?"" Oprah said earlier today that Prince Harry has clarified thatthe family member was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. Oprah asks Prince Harry what his relationship with his family is like now. He says he has spoken to the Queen, his grandmother, more in the last year than he has for many, many years and they have a really good relationship. ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be."" Asked about his relationship with his father, Prince Charles - heir to the throne - Harry pauses for a moment. ""There's a lot to work through there,"" he says. ""I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like... and Archie's his grandson. ""But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship."" Asked about the relationship with his brother, Prince William, Harry says he loves him ""to bits"" and they have been through ""hell together"". ""But we were on different paths,"" he adds. The Duke of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Prince of Wales pictured in 2019 Prince Harry says the Netflix and the Spotify deals he and Meghan have made recently were ""never part of the plan"". He says that came from when his family ""literally cut me off financially"" in the first quarter of 2020, and he had to pay for his family's security. He says the money that his late mother left him was the only way he and Meghan ""were able to do this"". Harry draws parallels between the treatment of Meghan and his mother, Princess Diana. âYou know, for me, I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you with my wife by my side,â he says. âBecause I can't begin to imagine what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself all those years ago, because it has been unbelievably tough for the two of us - but at least we had each other."" Harry's late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, relinquished the Her Royal Highness title at the time of her divorce from the Prince of Wales in August 1996. She died the following year in a car crash in Paris. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes when the accident happened. Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Trapped. Thatâs the word Harry used to describe his life in the Royal Family. Thatâs the impression he gave very often when out and about. But he goes on â he says his brother William, his father Charles, they too are trapped. And he feels compassion for them. It is a velvet-covered dagger into the institution he walked away (or, in his words, stepped back) from. You can read Jonny's full analysis here. Oprah asks Meghan and Harry about one of the prevailing storylines about the royal couple: that Meghan orchestrated their departure from the Royal Family, in what the tabloids branded as ""Megxit"". ""Can you imagine how little sense that makes?"" Meghan replies. ""I left everything for him."" She continues: ""Our plan was to do this forever."" Oprah turns to Harry, asking if he would have stepped back from his life in the Royal Family if it were not for Meghan. ""The answer is no. I wouldnât have been able to,"" he says. ""I myself was trapped."" Oprah pushes back - asking how a ""literal prince"" could be ""trapped"". I was ""trapped within the system"", Harry replies. ""My father and my brother - they are trapped. They donât get to leave - and I have huge compassion for that."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Harry looks so relaxed, so happy, so comfortable. Such a change from the deeply unhappy man he appeared to be in the final year in the UK. Meghan and Harry both come across very sympathetically, speaking without rancour but with the utmost clarity about a time in their lives they both clearly bitterly regret. This is explosive stuff â raw, revealing and hugely damaging for the Palace. Giving further details about his disappointment that his family did not show Meghan public support, Harry says: ""I also am acutely aware of where my family stands, and how scared they are of the tabloids turning on them."" He says there was an ""invisible contract"" between the Royal Family and UK tabloids - where if royals give access to reporters, they will get better press. ""There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations."" Oprah asks about how Harry and Meghan dealt with Meghan experiencing suicidal thoughts. ""I had no idea what to do, I wasn't prepared for that, I went to a very dark place as well,"" he says. Harry says he did not tell anyone in the family because ""that's just not a conversation that would be had"". ""I guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them,"" he says, adding that it's a very trapping environment. ""I didn't have anyone to turn to,"" he adds. ""For the family, they very much have this mentality of, 'this is just how it is. This is how it's meant to be, you can't change it, we've all been through it'. ""But what was different for me, was the race element. Because it wasn't just about her, it was about what she represents. He adds that for Meghan and Harry, ""and the specifics around her race"", it was an opportunity for the Royal Family ""to show some public support"". He says the ""most telling"" parts - and ""saddest parts"" - was that more than 70 MPs came out and condemned the colonial undertones of headlines and news articles. ""Yet no-one from my family ever said anything over those three years,"" he says. ""That hurts."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Just slipped into the conversation, as he listed the calls that he made to his family to talk about his future, is that Harryâs father - Prince Charles - stopped taking his calls. Did Harry mean to let that slip? Who knows? But it is an insight into how bad things got, maybe still are, in private relations inside the Royal Family. Harry says his biggest concern while living in Canada was that their security was going to be removed and people knew their location. He adds in a jibe at the Daily Mail newspaper at this point - saying that people knew their exact location ""courtesy of the Daily Mail"". He says the Palace's justification for removing security was ""a change in status""- but Harry says he ""pushed back"" and asked whether there had been a change of threat or risk, to which the Palace said no. They decided to move to California because they felt they were not safe in Canada. Oprah asks them what was the tipping point to their decision to step back as senior royals. ""It was desperate,"" says Harry. ""I went to all the places which I thought I should go to to ask for help, we both did, separately and together. Oprah asks: ""So you left because you were asking for help but couldn't get it?"", ""Yeah, basically,"" says Harry. ""But we never left,"" he says. ""We never left the family,"" adds Meghan, saying they only wanted to have a type of role that already exists - a non-senior royal. Harry says they wanted to ""take a breath"" from this ""constant barrage"". ""Meghan
clearly felt that the Palace was against her. That it didn't care. That it
didn't relate to the kind of pain that she was in."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond is on the latest Newscast podcast talking through
what the interview tells us about some of the relationships in the Royal
Family. Hear the full conversation now on BBC Sounds. Harry denies ever ""blindsiding"" his grandmother, the Queen, with his family's departure from senior royal duties. ""Iâve never blindsided my grandmother, I have too much respect for her,"" Harry tells Oprah. He says he had three telephone calls with the Queen ahead of the first statement announcing he and Meghan would be stepping back. He spoke with his father twice, he says, ""before he stopped taking my calls"". Why did Prince Charles stop speaking to Harry, Oprah asks. ""Because by that point I took matters into my own hands,"" Harry replies. ""It's really sad that it's gotten to this point, but I've got to do something for my own mental health, my wife's and for Archie's as well, because I could see where this was headed."" Harry said he and Meghan wanted to ""take a breath"" from ""the constant barrage"" the couple were facing as working royals. ""My biggest concern was history repeating itself,"" he tells Oprah. ""And what I was seeing was history repeating itself."" But he said this time it was ""far more dangerous"" compared to his mother's situation, taking into account the race and social media dimensions. He said he asked for help to ""call the dogs off"" but said none was given, and was instead told continuously ""this is how it is"". The Prince and Princess of Wales with Harry Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent The allegation that there were discussions in the Palace about how dark Meghanâs first baby might be is a devastating one. This is heading into ""worst-case scenario"" territory for the Palace. It is worth remembering we are currently only getting one side of the story. And Meghan has not revealed who said that to Harry. But it is a horrible allegation for the Palace to deal with. Now it's time for Prince Harry to join Meghan and Oprah. And no sooner has he sat down than they announce they are having a baby girl. Harry says his first thought was ""amazing"" and feeling ""grateful"". ""We've got our family,"" he says - ""the four of us and our two dogs"". They confirm that two children ""is it"". Â© 2025 BBC.

We've heard about the details of the interview throughout the course of the day because it aired in the US overnight, but this was the first time it was shown to UK audiences. So, here aresome of the key things you need to know: In the final instalment of the interview, Oprah asks Harry what ""delights"" him now in his new life in California. Harry replies that he loves his ""outdoor space"", taking Archie out on the back of his bike, something he was ""never able to do"". The couple laugh about Archie's most-recent favourite word being ""hydrate"" - with other top choices including ""palm tree"". Oprah asks if Meghan got her happy ending with Prince Harry after all. âGreater than any fairytale that youâve ever read,"" she says. By leaving the Royal Family, she says, ""I think [Harry] saved all of us. He ultimately called it. He made a decision that saved my life and saved all of us. ""But you need to want to be saved.â Harry and Meghan are asked whether they have any regrets. Meghan says she has one - ""believing them when they said I would be protected"". She says she believed that. But she says now, they have not just survived ""but are thriving"". Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent This is about as bad it might have been for the Royal Family, barring direct criticism of the Queen. Harry portrays his family as cold and unsympathetic, unable to relate emotionally, obsessed with who is going to pay for what. Itâs clear that relationships were and in some cases, still are, dreadful. Oprah asks Harry about Meghan's earlier comments that an unnamed family member ""how dark"" their son Archie's skin might be ""That conversation, I am never going to share,"" Harry replies. ""At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked,"" he says, adding that this conversation took place ""right at the beginning"" of his relationship with Meghan. Oprah asks what the exact questions were in that conversation. Harry says he's not comfortable sharing that but suggests a few moments later that it was along the lines of: ""What will the kids look like?"" Oprah said earlier today that Prince Harry has clarified thatthe family member was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. Oprah asks Prince Harry what his relationship with his family is like now. He says he has spoken to the Queen, his grandmother, more in the last year than he has for many, many years and they have a really good relationship. ""She's my colonel-in-chief, right? She always will be."" Asked about his relationship with his father, Prince Charles - heir to the throne - Harry pauses for a moment. ""There's a lot to work through there,"" he says. ""I feel really let down because he's been through something similar, he knows what pain feels like... and Archie's his grandson. ""But at the same time, of course I will always love him but there's a lot of hurt that's happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship."" Asked about the relationship with his brother, Prince William, Harry says he loves him ""to bits"" and they have been through ""hell together"". ""But we were on different paths,"" he adds. The Duke of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Prince of Wales pictured in 2019 Prince Harry says the Netflix and the Spotify deals he and Meghan have made recently were ""never part of the plan"". He says that came from when his family ""literally cut me off financially"" in the first quarter of 2020, and he had to pay for his family's security. He says the money that his late mother left him was the only way he and Meghan ""were able to do this"". Harry draws parallels between the treatment of Meghan and his mother, Princess Diana. âYou know, for me, I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you with my wife by my side,â he says. âBecause I can't begin to imagine what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself all those years ago, because it has been unbelievably tough for the two of us - but at least we had each other."" Harry's late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, relinquished the Her Royal Highness title at the time of her divorce from the Prince of Wales in August 1996. She died the following year in a car crash in Paris. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes when the accident happened. Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Trapped. Thatâs the word Harry used to describe his life in the Royal Family. Thatâs the impression he gave very often when out and about. But he goes on â he says his brother William, his father Charles, they too are trapped. And he feels compassion for them. It is a velvet-covered dagger into the institution he walked away (or, in his words, stepped back) from. You can read Jonny's full analysis here. Oprah asks Meghan and Harry about one of the prevailing storylines about the royal couple: that Meghan orchestrated their departure from the Royal Family, in what the tabloids branded as ""Megxit"". ""Can you imagine how little sense that makes?"" Meghan replies. ""I left everything for him."" She continues: ""Our plan was to do this forever."" Oprah turns to Harry, asking if he would have stepped back from his life in the Royal Family if it were not for Meghan. ""The answer is no. I wouldnât have been able to,"" he says. ""I myself was trapped."" Oprah pushes back - asking how a ""literal prince"" could be ""trapped"". I was ""trapped within the system"", Harry replies. ""My father and my brother - they are trapped. They donât get to leave - and I have huge compassion for that."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Harry looks so relaxed, so happy, so comfortable. Such a change from the deeply unhappy man he appeared to be in the final year in the UK. Meghan and Harry both come across very sympathetically, speaking without rancour but with the utmost clarity about a time in their lives they both clearly bitterly regret. This is explosive stuff â raw, revealing and hugely damaging for the Palace. Giving further details about his disappointment that his family did not show Meghan public support, Harry says: ""I also am acutely aware of where my family stands, and how scared they are of the tabloids turning on them."" He says there was an ""invisible contract"" between the Royal Family and UK tabloids - where if royals give access to reporters, they will get better press. ""There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations."" Oprah asks about how Harry and Meghan dealt with Meghan experiencing suicidal thoughts. ""I had no idea what to do, I wasn't prepared for that, I went to a very dark place as well,"" he says. Harry says he did not tell anyone in the family because ""that's just not a conversation that would be had"". ""I guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them,"" he says, adding that it's a very trapping environment. ""I didn't have anyone to turn to,"" he adds. ""For the family, they very much have this mentality of, 'this is just how it is. This is how it's meant to be, you can't change it, we've all been through it'. ""But what was different for me, was the race element. Because it wasn't just about her, it was about what she represents. He adds that for Meghan and Harry, ""and the specifics around her race"", it was an opportunity for the Royal Family ""to show some public support"". He says the ""most telling"" parts - and ""saddest parts"" - was that more than 70 MPs came out and condemned the colonial undertones of headlines and news articles. ""Yet no-one from my family ever said anything over those three years,"" he says. ""That hurts."" Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Just slipped into the conversation, as he listed the calls that he made to his family to talk about his future, is that Harryâs father - Prince Charles - stopped taking his calls. Did Harry mean to let that slip? Who knows? But it is an insight into how bad things got, maybe still are, in private relations inside the Royal Family. Harry says his biggest concern while living in Canada was that their security was going to be removed and people knew their location. He adds in a jibe at the Daily Mail newspaper at this point - saying that people knew their exact location ""courtesy of the Daily Mail"". He says the Palace's justification for removing security was ""a change in status""- but Harry says he ""pushed back"" and asked whether there had been a change of threat or risk, to which the Palace said no. They decided to move to California because they felt they were not safe in Canada. Oprah asks them what was the tipping point to their decision to step back as senior royals. ""It was desperate,"" says Harry. ""I went to all the places which I thought I should go to to ask for help, we both did, separately and together. Oprah asks: ""So you left because you were asking for help but couldn't get it?"", ""Yeah, basically,"" says Harry. ""But we never left,"" he says. ""We never left the family,"" adds Meghan, saying they only wanted to have a type of role that already exists - a non-senior royal. Harry says they wanted to ""take a breath"" from this ""constant barrage"". ""Meghan
clearly felt that the Palace was against her. That it didn't care. That it
didn't relate to the kind of pain that she was in."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond is on the latest Newscast podcast talking through
what the interview tells us about some of the relationships in the Royal
Family. Hear the full conversation now on BBC Sounds. Harry denies ever ""blindsiding"" his grandmother, the Queen, with his family's departure from senior royal duties. ""Iâve never blindsided my grandmother, I have too much respect for her,"" Harry tells Oprah. He says he had three telephone calls with the Queen ahead of the first statement announcing he and Meghan would be stepping back. He spoke with his father twice, he says, ""before he stopped taking my calls"". Why did Prince Charles stop speaking to Harry, Oprah asks. ""Because by that point I took matters into my own hands,"" Harry replies. ""It's really sad that it's gotten to this point, but I've got to do something for my own mental health, my wife's and for Archie's as well, because I could see where this was headed."" Harry said he and Meghan wanted to ""take a breath"" from ""the constant barrage"" the couple were facing as working royals. ""My biggest concern was history repeating itself,"" he tells Oprah. ""And what I was seeing was history repeating itself."" But he said this time it was ""far more dangerous"" compared to his mother's situation, taking into account the race and social media dimensions. He said he asked for help to ""call the dogs off"" but said none was given, and was instead told continuously ""this is how it is"". The Prince and Princess of Wales with Harry Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent The allegation that there were discussions in the Palace about how dark Meghanâs first baby might be is a devastating one. This is heading into ""worst-case scenario"" territory for the Palace. It is worth remembering we are currently only getting one side of the story. And Meghan has not revealed who said that to Harry. But it is a horrible allegation for the Palace to deal with. Now it's time for Prince Harry to join Meghan and Oprah. And no sooner has he sat down than they announce they are having a baby girl. Harry says his first thought was ""amazing"" and feeling ""grateful"". ""We've got our family,"" he says - ""the four of us and our two dogs"". They confirm that two children ""is it"". Â© 2025 BBC.

NHS 1% pay rise is 'as much as we can give' - PMBoris Johnson defends his pay rise proposals after a warning nurses may quit for feeling undervalued.,"This video can not be played Prime Minister defends NHS 1% pay rise recommendation Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended plans to give some NHS staff in England a 1% pay rise, amid warnings that ""undervalued"" nurses could quit. The government is giving workers ""as much as we can"" in the ""tough times"" of the Covid pandemic, Mr Johnson said. The rise, which is being considered by an independent panel, would cover most hospital staff. Labour says the proposal goes against a government ""promise"" made last year to give NHS workers a 2.1% pay rise. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Chancellor Rishi Sunak had been ""cowardly"" when he ""sneaked"" out the announcement a day after his Budget. The Department of Health and Social Care has been under pressure to reconsider its pay proposal since last week, when it officially recommended the 1% rise to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries. Nurses have described the proposed pay rise as ""insulting"", with unions threatening strike action and warning that the ""pitiful"" rise may lead staff to quit their jobs - worsening staffing issues in the health service. 'Undervalued' nurses may quit over 1% rise - union Nurses prepare for strikes over 1% NHS pay rise Ministers will make their final decision in May after the independent panel makes its own pay recommendations. Asked about the proposed pay rise on a visit to a coronavirus vaccination centre in Brent in north London, Mr Johnson said: ""What we have done is try to give them as much as we can at the present time. ""Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze, we're in pretty tough times."" He added he was ""massively grateful"" to ""heroic"" health and social care workers during the pandemic. But the Royal College of Nursing reiterated its calls for the government to make a U-turn on the 1% offer. The union's general secretary, Dame Donna Kinnair, said: ""More of these warm words for nurses are not going to cut it."" The PM's comments are not the last word on pay. An independent review body will make its recommendations on NHS salaries in May. If it's worried about retention and recruitment of staff, it could say that pay should rise above 1%. The government would then have a dilemma - either to ignore the recommendation, or make cuts elsewhere to fund a bigger increase. But the review body could equally present a challenge to the opposition. The shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth condemned a 1% rise as ""a  disgrace"" but said Labour would ""honour whatever that review body recommends"". During the years of austerity, it wasn't uncommon for pay review bodies to act within constraints set by government. So if the independent panel were to support a 1% rise after all, the Labour leadership would need to rethink its position, or face a backlash from the unions. Labour's Mr Jonathan Ashworth said Conservative MPs had already voted for a pay rise of 2.1% for NHS workers when a long-term spending plan for the health service passed through the House of Commons in January 2020. ""Not only was it promised, it was budgeted for and it was legislated for - this is the law of the land,"" he said. ""That should be the basis for which negotiations and discussions are now entered into with the trade unions."" The Department of Health maintains that the assumption of a 2.1% pay rise was not enshrined in law, and the financial pressures from the pandemic could not have been foreseen. The Royal College of Nursing has centred its response to the pay proposals on the idea the rise would mean Â£3.50 more per week in take-home pay for experienced nurses The prime minister said the government had ""tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can"" to tackle Covid, and had provided Â£62bn to the health service on top of its usual annual allocation of Â£140bn. Pressed by the BBC's Andrew Marr on whether there could be a rethink on the pay rise, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""What the government has put forward has been passed to an independent review. ""We've put forward what we believe we can afford and [it] is part of a process and that [is] what will be looked at,"" he added. ""But really, our focus is on making sure we recover from this pandemic."" The lowest minimum full-time salary - for newly-employed drivers, housekeeping assistants, nursery assistants and domestic support workers - is Â£18,005 per year The starting salary for most newly-qualified nurses is Â£24,907 Staff in ""high-cost areas"", such as London, get extra payments A government spokesperson has previously said a 1% pay rise would be a ""real-terms increase"", as the latest official inflation figurewas 0.9%,external. Dame Donna has warned the rise would mean just Â£3.50 more per week in take-home pay for an experienced nurse. At least 1.3 million other public sector staff - including teachers, the armed forces, firefighters and police officers -are about to have their pay frozen for a year. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? The NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations. The Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will bedelayed until the summer,externalbecause of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an ""interim"" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement. NHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised aone-off Â£500 ""special recognition"" paymentin January, following a similar announcement in Scotland. The Welsh government has said it will not set a ""ceiling"" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22. THAT PETER CROUCH PODCAST:Crouchy and the boys discuss a footballerâs entourage...
