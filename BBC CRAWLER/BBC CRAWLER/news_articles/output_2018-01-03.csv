Major flaw in millions of Intel chips,"Millions of computers contain Intel chips A serious flaw in the design of Intel's chips will require Microsoft, Linux and Apple to update operating systems for computers around the world. It is believed to affect chips in millions of computers from the last decade. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it was aware of the issue and that patches were being produced. In response, Intel said the issue was not limited to its processors and that it was working on a fix. ""Based on analysis to date, many types of computing devices - with many different vendors' processors and operating systems - are susceptible to these exploits,"" itsaid in a statement,external. It said it was working to ""develop an industry-wide approach to resolve this issue promptly and constructively"". ""Intel has begun providing software and firmware updates to mitigate these exploits,"" it said. Often when researchers discover a security problem, they share the information with the affected company so the issue can be fixed. Typically, both parties agree not to publicise the problem until a fix has been implemented, so that criminals cannot take advantage of the issue. This time it looks like somebody jumped the gun and information was leaked before a software fix was ready for distribution. Intel said it had planned to share information next week, and several security researchers have tweeted that they have made a secrecy pact with the chip-maker. That leaves the company in an uncomfortable situation, with a widely-publicised problem before the fix is ready to go. Experts have said that the fix could slow down the performance of computers by up to 30% but Intel played this down, saying that ""for the average user, performance impacts should not be significant and will be mitigated over time"". In response to the news, the NCSC said: ""We are aware of reports about a potential flaw affecting some computer processors. At this stage there is no evidence of any malicious exploitation and patches are being produced for the major platforms."" ""The NCSC advises that all organisations and home users continue to protect their systems from threats by installing patches as soon as they become available."" Intel reveals credit card-sized modular computer Intel buys driverless car tech firm Mobileye The flaw is also likely to affect major cloud computing platforms such as Amazon, Microsoft Azure and Google, according toThe Register,external, which broke news of the bug. Shares in Intelwere down almost 6% in US trading after the issue was revealed, and ended the trading session close 3.4% lower. Experts advised caution on the issue. ""It is significant but whether it will be exploited widely is another matter,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. ""The actual flaw is being rather tightly kept under wraps but from what researchers have gleaned themselves, it's all to do with a flaw in the way certain Intel CPUs address certain types of memory. ""If it is really bad then it may allow an exploit to read parts of the computer memory that should never be reached."" Intel reveals credit card-sized computer.

UK family hopeful for dad in Ethiopian jail,"Andy Tsege has not seen his wife or three children since his arrest in 2014 The wife of a British man imprisoned in Ethiopia has said she feels ""optimistic"" after the government said it would free its political prisoners. Opposition activist Andargachew 'Andy' Tsege was seizednearly four years agoin Yemen and taken to Ethiopia. His wife Yemi Hailemariam, who lives in Islington, north London, told the BBC she is ""hopeful"" but has her doubts until she hears more. Ethiopia's Prime Ministermade the promiseon Wednesday. It was unclear from Hailemariam Desalegn's surprise announcement exactly who will be released or when it will happen. Mr Andargachew, a UK national, has been in prison in Ethiopia since being arrestedduring a stopover at a Yemen airportin June 2014. The father of three was sentenced to death while in exile for plotting a coup - which he denied. Mr Andargachew had been secretary-general of Ethiopia's banned Ginbot 7 movement. Ethiopia PM defends Andargachew Tsege arrest Ethiopia to release political prisoners Mr Andargachew's wife says her overall optimism about the prime minister's announcement is clouded by some doubt as it is unclear who will be released or when. She added that she saw it as a ""very credible"" announcement though. But she is keeping the news from her youngest children to prevent them from getting their hopes up. Mr Andargachew's youngest children are unaware of the announcement Mrs Yemi says she has not had direct contact with her husband since his arrest. ""All my information comes from the embassy,"" she said. ""It's just statements to see how well he is doing."" This video can not be played The family of London man Andy Tsege, who faces an Ethiopian death penalty, says more needs to be done to help him In his announcement on Wednesday, the Ethiopian prime minister also said the notorious Maekelawi detention centre, allegedly used as a torture chamber, will close. Mr Andargachew is being held in a different prison, Kality, which is also in the capital Addis Ababa. Mrs Yemi said the decision to close the Maekelawi detention centre was surprising and called it a ""major step"".

Storm Eleanor disruption after 100mph gusts,"This video can not be played Video footage shows stormy scenes in Ireland and the UK Thousands of homes lost power and travel was disrupted after Storm Eleanor battered the UK with gusts of up to 100mph (161kph). The Met Office said the strongest winds had now passed for the UK, where four people were injured by falling trees. Numerous road closures and public transport delays were caused by trees and debris during the storm. As the storm swept into France, a skier was killed by a falling tree in the Alps and 15 others injured elsewhere. In Cornwall, some residents have been advised to leave their homes at high tide because of a collapsed stone harbour wall in Portreath. The council says the advice is a precaution. In pictures: Storm Eleanor hits the UK Pregnant woman rescued as storm hits Storm Eleanor strikes in south-west Scotland Europe battered by Storm Eleanor Village at the centre of the storm The Met Office said that during the storm gusts of more than 70mph were recorded across much of the UK. The strongest gusts were 100mph recorded at Great Dun Fell in Cumbria at 01:00, 90mph at Orlock Head, Northern Ireland and 89mph on the Isle of Wight. More than 25,000 homes in Northern Ireland lost power but this has been restored to most of them,with fewer than 1,000 homes still without electricity. About 400 homes in Waleshave had power restored. Scottish and English provider SSE said it had restored power to 18,000 homes since midnight after outages caused by the storm. The Met Office said that during the storm gusts of more than 70mph were recorded across much of the UK In Worcestershire, a man was injured by a falling tree and another man was treated by paramedics after a tree fell on a car in Hensol, Vale of Glamorgan. In Hinton Admiral, Hampshire, two people were freed from a car, which had been struck by a tree during the heavy winds, at about 03:00. Both men were taken to hospital, since then the driver has been arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of drugs while at the wheel. The driver of a car struck by a tree in Hampshire was arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, after being rescued by police (L-R) Damage caused by the storm in Gateshead, Finsbury Park in London and in Margate, Kent A body was recovered on the coast of East Sussex at about 08:00, after the remains were spotted in the water. It was not known whether the person was swept into the water by the weather conditions. This video can not be played Fire crews were called to fix scaffolding outside a building near Oxford Circus in central London As the storm made landfall on mainland Europe, flights to the UK were affected. Dutch carrier KLM cancelled a number of flights between Amsterdam Schiphol airport and London Heathrow. Other flights between the Netherlands and Manchester, London City, Leeds Bradford and Southampton airports were delayed. Overturned vehicles led to closures on the A1M, M6 and M5, where a recovery operation was under way to clear up the contents of a lorry left spilled on the road. Several major bridges were closed due to high winds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Toby Young 'regrets' past comments,"Toby Young says he regrets ""politically incorrect"" remarks he made in the past and should be judged on his actions in promoting social mobility in education. The right wing journalist has faced a backlash on social media after it was announced he had been appointed to the board of a new university regulator. Left wing critics have attacked his suitability for the role. Boris Johnson has defended him but Tory MP Margot James said he was mistaken to appear to ""belittle sexist comments"". Following the furore over his appointment, Mr Young said he had deleted 40,000 tweets sent before 2017 because a ""handful of things"" dating back to 2009 were being ""wrongly misconstrued"" as evidence he was opposed to gender equality and LGBT rights. However, Labour said this was not sufficient action and his appointment should be revoked. ""If Theresa May doesn't rethink this appointment, the message she is sending to students is that under the Tories, misogyny and homophobia will not just be tolerated, but rewarded,"" said Dawn Butler, shadow minister for women and equalities. Students and academics have, meanwhile, taken to Twitter to also call for his removal, highlighting disparaging and crude remarks he has made about women's breasts in social media posts and a 1998 article for Gear magazine on ""being a lesbian for the night"".

An online petition calling for Mr Young to be sacked from his post because of past remarks has attracted more than 28,000 signatures. A lecturers' union has complained that Mr Young - who helped to found the West London Free School - has no relevant experience and that he had only been chosen because he is a ""Tory cheerleader"" and passionate supporter of the party's education policies. But ina staunch defence on his blog his suitability to join the board,externalof the Office for Students, Mr Young said he had championed meritocracy and rigour in education for decades and while he accepted that some of his past remarks had been in bad taste he rejected accusations of misogyny.

In a 2012 Spectator column,external, Mr Young hit out at the ""inclusivity"" agenda in schools, suggesting it meant ""wheelchair ramps, the complete works of Alice Walker in the school library (though no Mark Twain) and a Special Educational Needs Department that can cope with everything from Dyslexia to Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy."" He told the BBC that the article had been misunderstood and he had since made clear that he was not disparaging inclusion in the ""narrow sense of providing equal access to mainstream schools for people with disabilities"" but criticising the notion of ""a dumbed down, one-size-fits-all curriculum"". Given the volume of tweets he had sent over the years, he said it was ""not altogether surprising"" that anyone trawling through them had found some ""sophomoric"" remarks. ""I regret these, obviously. I hope people will judge me on my actions, not on silly things I've tweeted or written in my 30-year career as a journalist,"" he said. Defending his qualifications, he said he had been ""a passionate advocate"" of widening participation and increasing social mobility since the mid-1980s when, as a state school boy at Oxford, he first started visiting sixth forms in deprived parts of the country to try to persuade students to apply to elite universities. Business minister Margot James said that while she still believed Mr Young was a worthy candidate for the job she questioned how he had responded to criticism of his conduct on social media.

Boris Johnson - brother of Universities Minister Jo Johnson, who created the Office for Students to protect free speech on university campuses - said the ""outcry"" over Mr Young's appointment was ""ridiculous"". The foreign secretary, who worked with Mr Young when he was editor of the Spectator, said the writer's ""caustic wit"" was among the attributes that would make him an ""ideal man for the job,"" adding that he had the ""independence and rigour"" to stand up for students' interests. The Office for Students has been established to hold universities to account on issues like vice chancellors' pay and free speech on campus, with powers to fine universities which fail to meet the required standards. Mr Young is one of 15 board members,externalwho were selected following an open appointment process. Others on the board include lawyer Simon Levine, Boots executive Elizabeth Fagan and barrister and academic Carl Lygo.

Hunt sorry as A&Es struggle to cope,"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: I apologise for postponed operations Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has apologised to patients in England who have had their operations postponed. Non-urgent treatments had already been cancelled until mid-January, but NHS England said on Tuesday that would now be extended to the end of the month. It came after hospitals reported they were struggling to cope with the surge in patients being seen since Christmas. At least 17 hospital trusts - one in 10 - have declared a major incident in the last 24 hours, the BBC understands. Bosses said they had been forced into the move as patients were experiencing long waits in A&E and being left on trolleys in corridors because there were no beds available. Some ambulance services have even started asking 999 callers with less serious problems to make their own way to hospital so they can prioritise the most life-threatening calls. Of the decision to cancel operations, Mr Hunt said it was ""absolutely not what I want"". But he said the move was needed given the pressure hospitals were under. ""This is the busiest week of the year for the NHS."" And he also said the whole country was grateful for the work NHS staff were putting in working ""incredibly long hours through the night, beyond the call of duty in every possible way"". This video can not be played Theresa May: The NHS has been better prepared for this winter than ever before His thanks were echoed by Prime Minister Theresa May, who also denied the health service was in crisis. ""The NHS has been better prepared for this winter than ever before,"" she added.

Problems have also been reported in other parts of the UK. The Welsh government said the health service was facing ""significant pressure"". Meanwhile, in Scotlandthere has been a 20% jump in A&E attendances compared with the previous year, prompting an increase in patients waiting more than four hours, and in Northern Ireland the Antrim Area Hospital has been forced to bring in St John ambulance volunteers to help with a surge in demand. Winter pressure health campaign launched NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter People on beds 'as far as you could see' NHS England's Prof Keith Willett admitted the pressures were severe - the worst he had seen since the 1990s - but said plans were in place. As well as the cancelling of non-urgent treatments, such as knee and hip replacements, hospitals have been given the green light to put patients on mixed sex wards and to bring GPs into A&E to help deal with patients. ""A crisis is when you haven't got in place mitigations and you haven't got a plan to deal with it,"" Prof Willett said. ""We've gone into this winter in a way we've never prepared before."" This video can not be played NHS chief tells Today service is not in crisis but says they may need to cancel more operations in future But Prof Suzanne Mason, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the measures were ""too little too late"" as hospitals simply had no beds free and these treatments would have had to be cancelled anyway. She added: ""Patient safety is being compromised - there's no doubt about that.  When patients are in crowded emergency departments and staff cannot actually move between patients and provide the basic level of care that's required, then safety is compromised. ""Patients who spend many hours on a trolley - and these are often elderly patients - they are the sickest patients in our department. ""They are much more likely to have a poorer outcome and even die as a result of their experience in the emergency department. And that is a huge tragedy for us in our specialty and that's why we are so desperate to see things improve."" This video can not be played Dr Adrian Harrop: ""I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle"" Reports have emerged of serious problems in a number of places over the past 24 hours: Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre has asked patients to avoid its A&E after being deluged on Tuesday evening Southend Hospital said it was dealing with an ""internal critical incident"" with all its beds full, which has led them to call in extra staff A consultant at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust apologised for ""third world conditions"" in his hospital department Milton Keynes University Hospital is telling people only to attend for emergency treatment Two ambulance trusts in the east and north-east of England are on the highest alert A concentration of major incidents declared at hospitals across the West Country and south-east Doctors and nurses have also been speaking about the problems. Dr Adrian Harrop, an A&E doctor at Scarborough Hospital, said he felt he was ""fighting a losing battle"" as he was not able to do his job properly and care for his patients in the way he wanted. Mark Nevison, a senior nurse in the north-east, tweeted he had worked in A&E for 10 years and had ""never been so ashamed of the sub-standard care"" now being offered. Esther Herbert said she couldn't leave her mother before 06:30 the following morning Meanwhile, patients have been talking about their experiences. Esther Herbert accompanied her 87-year-old mother to Worcestershire Royal Hospital before Christmas. ""The doors opened and it was just a sea of people,"" she said. ""There were people on beds all the way down the corridor, as far as you could see."" Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has blamed the pressures on ""Tory underfunding"".

10 explosive claims from new Trump book,"Mr Trump sits at the White House Resolute Desk in the Oval Office Donald Trump was ""befuddled"" by his election win, did not enjoy his inauguration and was scared of the White House, according to a new book. Journalist Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House also purports to lift the lid on Ivanka Trump's secret presidential ambitions. The book details Mr Trump's regard for media titan Rupert Murdoch, though the admiration was apparently not mutual. The White House said the book was full of ""false and misleading accounts"". Michael Wolff says his work is based on more than 200 interviews and that he took up ""something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing"" following the president's inauguration for a close-up insight into the fledgling administration. Here are 11 of the book's revelations, with commentary from the BBC's Anthony Zurcher. According to the book, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon thought a meeting between Donald Trump Jr and a group of Russians was ""treasonous"". The Russians had offered Donald Trump Jr damaging information on Hillary Clinton at the June 2016 meeting. This video can not be played White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders explains why Mr Trump rounded on his former adviser Steve Bannon Wolff writes that Bannon told him of the meeting: ""The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn't have any lawyers. Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad s***, and I happen to think it's all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately."" Bannon reportedly said the Justice Department investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Moscow would focus on money laundering, adding: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" Anthony Zurcher:In just a few sentences, Bannon manages to detonate a bomb under the White House's efforts to downplay the significance of that fateful June meeting in Trump Tower and their attempt to dismiss Robert Mueller's inquiry as a partisan witchhunt. It's bad, Bannon is saying, and even more unforgivably it was stupid. Taking aim at Mr Trump's own family in the most personal terms makes it all the more biting. In an article for NYMag,externaladapted from his book, Wolff describes the amazement - and dismay - in the Trump camp at his November 2016 election win. ""Shortly after 8pm on Election Night, when the unexpected trend - Trump might actually win - seemed confirmed, Don Jr told a friend that his father, or DJT, as he calls him, looked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania was in tears - and not of joy. There was, in the space of little more than an hour, in Steve Bannon's not unamused observation, a befuddled Trump morphing into a disbelieving Trump and then into a horrified Trump. But still to come was the final transformation: Suddenly, Donald Trump became a man who believed that he deserved to be, and was wholly capable of being, the president of the United States."" AZ:This is decidedly different from what has been recited by the Trump circle since election night. While campaign hands - at least the less-than-dedicated ones - may have been positioning themselves for a soft landing after a defeat, Mr Trump and his close allies believed in their success. A ""horrified Trump"" was never part of the script. The president and first lady Wolff writes: ""Trump did not enjoy his own inauguration. He was angry that A-level stars had snubbed the event, disgruntled with the accommodations at Blair House, and visibly fighting with his wife, who seemed on the verge of tears. Throughout the day, he wore what some around him had taken to calling his golf face: angry and pissed off, shoulders hunched, arms swinging, brow furled, lips pursed."" But the first lady's office rejected the claims. Communications director Stephanie Grisham said in a statement: ""Mrs Trump supported her husband's decision to run for President and in fact, encouraged him to do so. She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did."" AZ:These words tell the same story as the viral video clip of a stone-faced Melania forcing a smile when the president looks her way. It also explains why Mr Trump was so insistent about the success of his inauguration and the size of his crowds. He felt slighted and aggrieved and was acting accordingly. According to another excerpt from the book, obtained by US media, Mr Trump used to boast that sleeping with his friends' wives made ""life worth living"". ""In pursuing a friend's wife, he would try to persuade the wife that her husband was perhaps not what she thought,""Wolff quotes a Trump friend as saying. He would invite the wife to secretly listen on speakerphone to a conversation that Mr Trump would have in his office with her husband, according to the book. Mr Trump would allegedly engage in sexual banter with the husband in the hope that he might say something indiscreet, asking questions such as:""Do you still like having sex with your wife? How often?"" Wolff writes: ""Trump, in fact, found the White House to be vexing and even a little scary. He retreated to his own bedroom - the first time since the Kennedy White House that a presidential couple had maintained separate rooms. In the first days, he ordered two television screens in addition to the one already there, and a lock on the door, precipitating a brief standoff with the Secret Service, who insisted they have access to the room."" AZ:For much of his adult life, Mr Trump has lived according to his own rules, as a real-estate tycoon whose wealth allowed his every whim or idiosyncrasy to be accommodated. Adjusting to the White House - which Bill Clinton once referred to as the ""crown jewel of the federal penitentiary system"" and Harry Truman called ""the great white jail"" - must have been quite a shock. Mr Trump's daughter and her husband Jared Kushner allegedly struck a deal that she might run for president in future, according to Wolff: Mr Trump pats his pregnant daughter Ivanka during his 2016 campaign ""Balancing risk against reward, both Jared and Ivanka decided to accept roles in the West Wing over the advice of almost everyone they knew. It was a joint decision by the couple, and, in some sense, a joint job. Between themselves, the two had made an earnest deal: If sometime in the future the opportunity arose, she'd be the one to run for president. The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump. Bannon, who had coined the term 'Jarvanka' that was now in ever greater use in the White House, was horrified when the couple's deal was reported to him."" AZ:The feud between Bannon and ""Jarvanka"" was no secret, and it certainly wasn't surprising. In a way, the couple represented to Bannon everything he's fighting against - East Coast elitism and entitlement. Yet, thanks to familial ties, they had the president's ear and - this new book claims - harboured dynastic hopes. The US first daughter poked fun at her father's alleged ""scalp-reduction surgery"", according to the book. ""She treated her father with a degree of detachment, even irony, going so far as to make fun of his comb-over to others. She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate - a contained island after scalp-reduction -surgery - surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The color, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men - the longer it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump's orange-blond hair color."" AZ:It wouldn't be particularly surprising if this is one of the anecdotes that Mr Trump finds most irksome. The president is proud of his hair, and once notably let late-night host Jimmy Fallon ruffle it to establish its authenticity. On windy days, Mr Trump usually wears a hat - the origin of the Make America Great Again ball cap - to ensure there are no coiffing malfunctions. The hair is as much a part of the Trump brand as big hotels and gold-plated escalators. Katie Walsh, the White House deputy chief of staff, asked Mr Kushner, the president's senior adviser, what the administration wanted to achieve. But according to the book, Mr Kushner did not have an answer. ""'Just give me the three things the president wants to focus on,' she [Katie Walsh] demanded. 'What are the three priorities of this White House?' It was the most basic question imaginable - one that any qualified presidential candidate would have answered long before he took up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Six weeks into Trump's presidency, Kushner was wholly without an answer. 'Yes,' he said to Walsh. 'We should probably have that conversation.'"" AZ:It often takes a new administration a bit of time to find its footing. In Mr Trump's case, the situation was particularly acute. Having campaigned on some clear policy items - strengthened borders, renegotiated trade deals, a sweeping tax cut and Obamacare repeal - prioritising was clearly a challenge. Once in the White House, he allowed Congress to kick off with healthcare reform, and the difficulties achieving that goal haunted the Trump presidency for nearly a year. Wolff, who previously wrote a biography of Rupert Murdoch, describes Mr Trump's high regard for the News Corp media titan. ""Rupert Murdoch, who had promised to pay a call on the president-elect, was running late. When some of the guests made a move to leave, an increasingly agitated Trump assured them that Rupert was on his way. 'He's one of the greats, the last of the greats,' Trump said. 'You have to stay to see him.' Not grasping that he was now the most powerful man in the world, Trump was still trying mightily to curry favor with a media mogul who had long disdained him as a charlatan and fool."" AZ:During the campaign, Mr Trump had at times feuded with Murdoch's Fox News - fighting with presenter Megyn Kelly, boycotting the network and skipping a Fox-broadcast primary debate. The president, however, is one of Fox News' biggest fans - and the network has become his greatest advocate since his inauguration. Mr Trump is said to regularly speak with Mr Murdoch on the phone But the admiration was not mutual, according to Wolff's account of a call between Mr Murdoch and Mr Trump about the president's meeting with Silicon Valley executives. Mr Trump is said to have told Mr Murdoch: ""'These guys really need my help. Obama was not very favorable to them, too much regulation. This is really an opportunity for me to help them.' 'Donald,' said Murdoch, 'for eight years these guys had Obama in their pocket. They practically ran the administration. They don't need your help.' 'Take this H-1B visa issue. They really need these H-1B visas.'Murdoch suggested that taking a liberal approach to H-1B visas, which open America's doors to select immigrants, might be hard to square with his promises to build a wall and close the borders. But Trump seemed unconcerned, assuring Murdoch, 'We'll figure it out.' 'What a f****** idiot,' said Murdoch, shrugging, as he got off the phone."" AZ:There's sometimes been a disconnect between Mr Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric and his action as a businessman, where his companies often relied on immigrant labour. Perhaps the president-elect was reflecting his business sensibilities. Or maybe, in this case, he was simply echoing the opinion of the last group of people who had met with him - a criticism that has been lobbed his way on more than one occasion. Michael Flynn emerges from a plea hearing in a Washington DC courtroom Former US National Security Adviser Mike Flynn knew that accepting money from Moscow for a speech could come back to haunt him, according to the book. Wolff writes that before the election Mr Flynn ""had been told by friends that it had not been a good idea to take $45,000 from the Russians for a speech. 'Well it would only be a problem if we won,' he assured them."" Mr Flynn has been indicted in the Justice Department special counsel's inquiry. AZ:Like Paul Manafort, Flynn was one of the members of the Trump campaign's inner circle whose prior affairs were not ordered in a way that would, shall we say, stand up to close legal scrutiny. If Mr Trump had been defeated, that probably wouldn't have mattered. Like the protagonists in the film The Producers, however, their success was their undoing. Russia-Trump: Who's who?

Bionic hand has a sense of touch,"This video can not be played Almerina Mascarello who lost her hand in an accident nearly 25 years ago said she now 'feels complete' Scientists in Rome have unveiled the first bionic hand with a sense of touch that can be worn outside a laboratory. The recipient, Almerina Mascarello, who lost her left hand in an accident nearly a quarter of a century ago, said ""it's almost like it's back again"". In 2014 the same international team produced the world's first feeling bionic hand. But the sensory and computer equipment it was linked to was too large to leave the laboratory. Now the technology is small enough to fit in a rucksack, making it portable. 3D printed bionic hands trial begins in Bristol Bionic hand 'sees and grabs' objects automatically The development team included engineers, neuroscientists, surgeons, electronics and robotics specialists from Italy, Switzerland and Germany. The prosthetic hand has sensors that detect information about whether an object is soft or hard. These messages are linked to a computer in a rucksack that converts these signals into a language the brain will understand. The information is relayed to Almerina's brain via tiny electrodes implanted in nerves in the upper arm. In tests Almerina - who was blindfolded - was able to tell whether the object she was picking up was hard or soft. She told me: ""The feeling is spontaneous as if it were your real hand; you're finally able to do things that before were difficult, like getting dressed, putting on shoes - all mundane but important things - you feel complete."" This represents another advance in neuroprosthetics, the interface between machine and the human body. Professor Silvestro Micera, a neuroengineer at EPFL in Lausanne and Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa told me: ""We are going more and more in the direction of science fiction movies like Luke Skywalker's bionic hand in Star Wars - a fully controlled, fully natural, sensorised prosthesis, identical to the human hand."" A robotic prosthesis better than the human hand is still a long way off, but the team believe it might eventually be a reality. Prof Paolo Rossini, a neurologist at University Hospital Agostino Gemelli, Rome said:  ""Once you can control a robotic prosthesis with your brain you can think about creating one that allows more complex movements than a hand with five fingers."" The researchers paid tribute to Almerina and the other amputees who joined the project. Almerina was able to keep the bionic hand for six months, but it has now been removed, as it is still a prototype. The scientific team say they hope to miniaturise the technology even further so that a sensory bionic hand can be commercialised. Almerina told me that when the bionic hand is perfected, she would like it back for good.

Begging crackdown call before royal wedding,"This video can not be played ""Medieval"": Find out what Windsor makes of the royal wedding row A council leader has called for action to tackle ""aggressive begging"" in Windsor, ahead of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Simon Dudley, of the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead, has called on the Berkshire police and crime commissioner (PCC) to address the issue ""urgently"". Mr Dudley said street begging created a ""hostile atmosphere"" for both residents and tourists,external. Windsor Homeless Project described the comments as ""abhorrent"". In December Mr Dudley tweeted about an ""epidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy,external"" in the town. He said he would be asking Thames Valley Police and the PCC to ""focus on dealing with this before the royal wedding"". He went on to describe how ""vagrancy and begging"" meant people were ""marching tourists to cash points to withdraw cash"" - although Thames Valley Policesaid it had received no such reports,external. Mr Dudley also said some people were earning hundreds of pounds a week targeting tourists and residents in Windsor. In his letter on Tuesday to PCC Anthony Stansfeld, the Conservative councillor said: ""The whole situation... presents a beautiful town in a sadly unfavourable light. He wrote: ""The level of tourist interest is set to multiply with the royal wedding in May 2018, and there are increased concerns from our residents about their safety."" The couple will marry at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in May He said many beggars were not homeless and called for ""immediate action, as this is a significant security concern, especially given the national importance of Windsor"". Windsor Homeless Project manager Murphy James said it was ""sickening"" that Mr Dudley had cited the royal wedding as a reason for his concerns. He said: ""If somebody is sleeping out on the street they are not there by choice; they are there because something has gone wrong. ""I went out on Christmas Day and there were 12 people laid out on Windsor High Street - they were not there by choice."" Mr Stansfeld said the council had not raised the issue with him on his last visit there but said supporting the homeless was a ""priority"". He also said protecting the public was ""of the utmost importance... and the force work day in and day out to keep people safe from harm and make the Thames Valley a safe place to live, work and visit"". Windsor has been described as a ""very special place"" for Prince Harry and Miss Markle, who have spent time there together since meeting in July 2016. They will marry at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 19 May.

How Trump cooled on Bannon,"Donald Trump appointed Mr Bannon as his campaign CEO in August 2016 and, following his victory, handed him a key White House role Steve Bannon was the driving force behind the right-wing Breitbart News website, and later became a key Donald Trump adviser before launching a podcast devoted to obliterating Democrats and Republicans who fail to fall in with the Maga - Make America Great Again - agenda. He was one of Mr Trump's closest confidants during the 2016 presidential campaign and in the White House the following year, His influence was so great that a Time magazine headline asked: ""Is Steve Bannon the Second Most Powerful Man in the World?"" But although he lasted just months in his Trump administration job and has been beset by legal problems, he remains a very influential figure on the hard right of the Republican party. His refusal to testify in front of a Congressional committee investigating the Capitol riot resulted in a conviction on two charges of contempt of Congress in 2022. Having failed in his appeals, he now faces a potential four-month jail sentence, just as his former boss heads into another presidential election campaign. Born in Virginia in 1953, Bannon spent four years in the US Navy before completing an MBA at Harvard. He went into investment banking and after a spell with Goldman Sachs moved into media financing, helping to get the comedy show Seinfeld, among others, off the ground. He shifted into film production, working in Hollywood before branching out into independent political documentary-making, paying homage to former president Ronald Reagan, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and the Tea Party movement. Through this work he met Andrew Breitbart, a staunchly conservative media entrepreneur who wanted to create a site that challenged what he saw as liberal-dominated mainstream media. When Breitbart died of a heart attack in 2012, Bannon took over as head of Breitbart News and drove it forward. One of Breitbart's many controversial headlines The site positioned itself as a bellicose, conspiracy-tinged outlet for right-wing Americans disillusioned with mainstream politicians. During the 2016 election campaign, the site was ardent in its support of Donald Trump. At the same time, Democrats and civil rights groups were accusing Bannon and his media outlet of allying themselves with white nationalists. Breitbart writers, while growing in influence in mainstream Republican circles, also at times maintained links to fringe far-right figures and spread conspiracy theories. Bannon himself hopped directly into the political fray in August 2016 when Mr Trump appointed him as his campaign CEO. Following his victory, Mr Trump handed Mr Bannon a key role as chief White House strategist. But Bannon left his post in August 2017 after months of reported power struggles with Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, as well as other high-level Trump advisers. Mr Trump had also reportedly grown weary of press leaks and of Bannon taking credit for his election victory. Bannon headed back to Breitbart, vowing to wage war on the president's opponents. Although they remained ideologically aligned, the two men occasionally clashed. Bannon criticised some of Mr Trump's decisions, including calling the firing of FBI director James Comey the worst mistake in ""modern political history"". And Bannon was quoted in a book as describing a meeting between Mr Trump's son and a group of Russians - an encounter that featured prominently in Mr Trump's impeachment trial - as ""treasonous"". The former president hit back. ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,"" he said at the time. Bannon swiftly recanted, but the damage was done. One of Breitbart News's major financial backers, Rebekah Mercer, cut him loose and days later he stepped down. In January 2018, Mr Trump took to Twitter to cheer the decision with a new moniker for his old ally. ""The Mercer Family recently dumped the leaker known as Sloppy Steve Bannon. Smart!"" he wrote. But both men remained committed to the Maga cause - and couldn't quite quit each other. But by August 2019 Mr Trump was describing Bannon as ""one of my best pupils"" and ""still a giant Trump fan"". Mr Bannon, pictured at President Trump's inauguration in 2017 While spending time trying to build links with other right-wing nationalist movements in Europe and around the world, Bannon, now 70, also found himself increasingly facing legal trouble. In 2020, he was indicted on charges of money laundering, fraud and conspiracy, accused of cheating donors to a private fundraiser designed to help build a wall on the US-Mexico border - one of Mr Trump's key policy goals. Prosecutors in New York alleged that he had lied to donors to the ""We Build the Wall"" project and diverted some of the money to two of his associates. He was spared federal charges by a Trump pardon, but still faces an indictment in New York state over the case. Bannon's podcast - started in 2019 and titled War Room - became a key Maga media outlet, and one that spread Mr Trump's false theories of voter fraud prior to the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021. He was said to have been an unofficial adviser to Mr Trump at the time, which earned him the Congressional subpoena which he resisted. In July 2022 he was found guilty of two counts of contempt of Congress and was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $6,500 (Â£5,200). He was allowed to remain free pending appeal, which was rejected by a federal court Friday. And while he could end up in jail at a crucial political period, he has continued to pump out War Room episodes - several each day - boosting the pro-Trump Maga hard right.

In July 2022 he was found guilty of two counts of contempt of Congress and was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $6,500 (Â£5,200). He was allowed to remain free pending appeal, which was rejected by a federal court Friday. And while he could end up in jail at a crucial political period, he has continued to pump out War Room episodes - several each day - boosting the pro-Trump Maga hard right.

People on beds 'as far as you could see',"Yvonne Beer is 87 and suffers from dementia An 87-year-old woman who waited 10 hours in hospital to see a doctor had to be tied into a wheelchair after her bed was taken away, say her family. Yvonne Beer was taken to Worcestershire Royal Hospital on 1 December with breathing difficulties. She arrived at the hospital at about 16:00 GMT, but was not settled on a ward until 06:30 the following morning, her daughter said. Tens of thousands of operationshave been delayed due to winter pressures. Midlands Live: Far right group suspects arrested; chef quits over 'spiked vegan' post ""The doors opened and it was just a sea of people,"" said her daughter Esther Herbert, who lives in Astwood Bank near Redditch. ""There were people on beds all the way down the corridor, as far as you could see."" Esther Herbert said she couldn't leave her mother before 06:30 the following morning Ms Herbert said her mother, who suffers from dementia, was transferred from a trolley to a wheelchair to use the toilet, and when she returned the trolley had been removed. For four hours she had to be strapped into a wheelchair, using a scarf to stop her falling out when asleep, before a bed became available. It was not until 02:00, that she was seen by a doctor in the corridor, and then a further four and a half hours before she was settled on a ward and Ms Herbert felt able to leave. ""I daren't leave her before that,"" Ms Herbert said.  ""She would have been really confused and upset."" Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said it was under considerable pressure over Christmas Each year the NHS comes under increased pressure in the winter, largely as a result of an increase in certain illnesses over this period, such as flu. Non-urgent operations and procedures have been cancelled or deferred until the end of the month as the service struggles to cope. At least 16 hospitals have declared major incidents and Dr Richard Fawcett, whose Twitter profile lists him as a consultant at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust,apologised via Twitter for ""third world conditions"",externalin his hospital department. Ms Beer was discharged later that day, but was still struggling to breathe.  Ms Herbert insisted her mother went to a different hospital, where she stayed for eight days. The 87-year-old is now in ""a much better state"". Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said it was under considerable pressure over Christmas and was encouraging people to consider alternatives to A&E if they need urgent care. Whilst it would not comment on individual cases, a spokesperson said: ""We recognise that any time spent waiting can be very distressing and apologise to patients who may have to wait longer that we aim for.""

'Hero' admits stealing from blast victims,"This video can not be played Chris Parker was interviewed by reporters in the aftermath of the attack A homeless man who stole a purse and a phone from victims of the Manchester Arena attack has admitted theft. Chris Parker, 33, was initially dubbed a hero after claiming he comforted a seriously injured girl. CCTV footage played to Manchester Crown Court showed him wandering between stricken victims. He kept returning to injured Pauline Healey, whose granddaughter lay dying nearby, before leaning over her and taking her handbag to steal her purse. The footage showed paramedics and police trying to resuscitate victims close by as he did so. Within hours of taking the purse, he was using Mrs Healey's bank card at a local fast food restaurant. Salman Abedi detonated a homemade bomb at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May, killing 22 people and injuring many more. Parker's trial was due to start on Tuesday, but was delayed after he failed to appear. He was found hiding in a loft of a house in Halifax, West Yorkshire, where he was arrested. The court heard that following his arrest, he had received death threats while on remand in HMP Manchester. Salman Abedi detonated a home-made bomb in the foyer of the arena on 22 May last year He pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and one of fraud after admitting using a debit card from the stolen purse. Parker pleaded not guilty to five counts relating to the attempted theft of a coat and bag discarded in the chaos following the attack, and the use of Mrs Healey's bank cards in the days after. When the story of Parker's ""heroism"" was originally reported, a member of the public was so moved by his actions, heset up an appeal on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe. Michael Johns' appeal page stated that he hoped the campaign would ""go some way to helping Chris off the streets and also show our gratitude for his actions"". Set up with the aim of raising Â£1,000, the appeal drew an ""unprecedented"" response and gathered more than Â£52,000. A spokesman for the site said that following Parker's guilty pleas, the money would no longer be paid out to him. He said the company was ""in full control of the funds donated"" and the donations ""will be refunded"". Louise Brandon, prosecuting, said as he had ""admitted stealing items belonging to victims"" and using a bank card, she would not ""seek a trial on the remaining counts"". Prosecutors said it was clear the defendant provided ""some limited assistance"" to people injured at the entrance to the venue's foyer, but he ""equally"" took the opportunity to commit the thefts. John Broadley, defending, asked for pre-sentence reports on Parker, who has previous theft and shoplifting convictions dating from 2000 to February of last year. He said of Parker: ""All he can do in the circumstances is first of all plead guilty and apologise for his appalling behaviour that evening."" Judge David Hernandez said a custodial sentence was ""most likely"". Parker, now of Halifax, will remain in custody until he is sentenced on 30 January.

Iran protests over says top general,"This video can not be played Iran protests: Why people have taken to the streets The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards has declared the defeat of the ""sedition"" in the country, referring to a wave of anti-government protests. Maj Gen Mohammad Ali Jafari made the announcement as tens of thousands of people attended pro-government rallies called to counter the unrest. It began last Thursday in the city of Mashhad and has seen 21 people killed. The protests were initially against price rises and corruption, but turned to wider anti-government sentiment. They have been the largest since the disputed 2009 presidential election. Gen Jafari said: ""Today, we can say that this is the end of the 96 sedition,"" referring to the current year - 1396 - in the Persian calendar. He said ""security preparedness and people's vigilance"" had led to the defeat of ""enemies"" and that the Guards had only intervened in a ""limited"" way in three provinces. He added: ""There were a maximum of 1,500 people in each place and the number of troublemakers did not exceed 15,000 people nationwide."" Gen Jafari said the total number of protesters had not exceeded 15,000 nationwide The general blamed anti-revolutionary agents, pro-monarchists and forces which he said had been ""announced by [US-ex Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton to create riot, anarchy, insecurity and intrigue in Iran"".

Meanwhile three members of the security services have been killed in Piranshahr, an area in West Azerbaijan province which borders Iraqi Kurdistan, according to a statement by the Revolutionary Guards.

Murder suspect may have had two knives,"This video can not be played Ch Supt Christy Mangan outlined the sequence of events A teenager arrested after one man was murdered and two others were injured in the Republic of Ireland may have had least two knives, police have said. A man from Japan died after he was stabbed in Dundalk, County Louth. A second man was stabbed nearby and a third victim was hit with a fence pole. A Garda (police) spokesman said the attacks seemed ""random and unprovoked"" and no motive has yet been established. When asked if it was terror-related, he said that was ""a line of inquiry"". The 18-year-old man who has been arrested on suspicion of murder is from Egypt, a garda press conference was told. The first attack happened at Avenue Road, Dundalk, shortly before 09:00 local time on Wednesday. The Dundalk stabbing incident has left one man dead The 24-year-old Japanese man was on his way to work when he was stabbed to death in the street. Shortly over half and hour later, a man was stabbed at Coes Road in Dundalk and a few minutes after that, the third man was hit with the pole at Seatown Place. Both men injured in the later attacks are Irish and their injuries are not thought to be life threatening. Addressing the press conference, Ch Supt Christy Mangan said gardaÃ­ were trying to establish how the murder suspect ""arrived in this jurisdiction"" and would be speaking to Egyptian authorities regarding his movements. The officer also confirmed that the 18-year-old had been in contact with gardaÃ­ from the Immigration Section on New Year's Day regarding a possible application for residency in the Republic of Ireland. At that time, he added, there was no indication that the teenager was involved in any type of criminality. Outlining the incidents on Wednesday morning, Ch Supt Mangan said that a call was received from ambulance control to Drogheda Garda station at about 09:00 local time reporting that a man had been found with a stab wound at Avenue Road. GardaÃ­ arrived at the scene seven minutes later and found the stabbed man in a ""unresponsive state"". At 09:32 local time, another call was received about a second incident at Coes Road in Dundalk, also reporting that a man had been stabbed. At about 09.40 local time, Dundalk garda station received a 999 call telling them a man had been hit with a pole at Seatown Place. The suspect is being held at Dundalk Garda Station Mr Mangan said that minutes later, an officer observed a person carrying a fencing post and acting in a suspicious manner. A man was arrested at Inner Relief Road at 09:45 local time. Mr Mangan told the press conference that detectives were satisfied at present that the suspect had acted alone and there was a possibility that he had been ""carrying at least two knives"".

Two men plead not guilty to terror charges,"The British far-right group was banned last year Two men, including a British soldier, have pleaded not guilty to a number of terror charges. Lance Corporal Mikko Vehvilainen, 33 and Alexander Deakin, 22, are also accused of being members of the banned neo-Nazi group National Action. Both denied possessing documents that could be useful to someone planning an act of terror. But appearing at Birmingham Crown Court, neither men entered a plea with regard to membership of the group. National Action was the first extreme right-wing group to be outlawed in the UK. It was added to a list of proscribed groups in 2016. Mr Deakin, of Great Barr, Birmingham, also pleaded not guilty to distributing a terrorist publication. And L/Cpl Vehvilainen, from Sennybridge Camp in Powys, entered not guilty pleas to two counts of posting material online that was threatening, abusive or insulting, thereby stirring up racial hatred. The next hearing has been scheduled for 19 February, with a trial set to begin in March.

Carson Allen died three hours after being born at Nottingham City Hospital in July, 2013. An inquest in 2014 recorded a verdict of accidental death, with thecoroner criticising the hospital trustfor its ""woefully inadequate"" investigation. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust has now settled a claim of clinical negligence. Live updates and more from the East Midlands The trust has agreed to pay Carson's family an undisclosed sum. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust apologised to Carson Allen's family for ""shortfalls in our care"" Claire Smith, Carson's mother, said she only found during the post-mortem examination that the cut to her son's head was caused by a scalpel and described the hospital's care as ""absolutely horrendous"". ""As if losing my baby wasn't enough, I have been put through hell fighting for the reassurance that I could not have prevented my baby son's death,"" she said. ""It has been the worst experience of my life and I doubt my family will ever get over our loss."" Dr Lucy Kean, head of service for obstetrics and gynaecology at the trust, apologised for the ""shortfalls"" in Carson's care.

Far-right group suspects arrested,"This video can not be played What is National Action? Six people have been arrested on suspicion of being members of the banned far-right group National Action. Five men from Cambridge, Banbury, Wolverhampton, Leicester and Stockport, and a woman from Banbury were detained by police earlier. All six are being held at a police station in the West Midlands. Police said the suspects, aged between 21 and 37, were detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act as part of a planned operation. They were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism, namely on suspicion of being a member of a proscribed organisation, National Action. The six arrested people are: A 26-year-old man from Cambridge A 21-year-old man and a 37-year-old woman both from Banbury, Oxfordshire A 28-year-old man from Wolverhampton A 26-year-old man from Leicester A 24-year-old man from Stockport West Midlands Police said the arrests were intelligence-led and carried out in conjunction with a number of other counter-terrorism units across England. ""There was no threat to public safety,"" a force spokesperson said. A number of properties are also being searched as part of the operation. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent National Action became the first British neo-Nazi group to be banned after Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was promoting violence and acts of terrorism. Members and supporters applauded the murder of Jo Cox MP by a white supremacist - and the group had carried out a series of small, but confrontational, demonstrations in towns and cities throughout England. One of its most notorious events saw masked members - many of them very young men - gathering outside York Minster to make Hitler salutes. Since it was banned, detectives have been carrying out more and more investigations into the group which, to all intents and purposes, has organised itself in a similar way to the banned al Muhajiroun network - the extremist Islamist youth movement. Both have used social media to target young people, attracting them with a simplistic us-and-them message designed to make them angry. Approximately a fifth of the 400 terrorism-related arrests in the year to the end of last September were categorised by police as ""domestic"" extremism, which includes suspected far-right activity. Since National Action was banned just over a year ago there have been more than a dozen arrests. A small number of prosecutions relating to the group will soon come to trial.

General says Iran 'sedition' defeated,"This video can not be played Iran protests: Why people have taken to the streets The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards has declared the defeat of the ""sedition"" in the country, referring to a wave of anti-government protests. Maj Gen Mohammad Ali Jafari made the announcement as tens of thousands of people attended pro-government rallies called to counter the unrest. It began last Thursday in the city of Mashhad and has seen 21 people killed. The protests were initially against price rises and corruption, but turned to wider anti-government sentiment. They have been the largest since the disputed 2009 presidential election. Gen Jafari said: ""Today, we can say that this is the end of the 96 sedition,"" referring to the current year - 1396 - in the Persian calendar. He said ""security preparedness and people's vigilance"" had led to the defeat of ""enemies"" and that the Guards had only intervened in a ""limited"" way in three provinces. He added: ""There were a maximum of 1,500 people in each place and the number of troublemakers did not exceed 15,000 people nationwide."" Gen Jafari said the total number of protesters had not exceeded 15,000 nationwide The general blamed anti-revolutionary agents, pro-monarchists and forces which he said had been ""announced by [US-ex Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton to create riot, anarchy, insecurity and intrigue in Iran"". The ""enemies"" had tried to pose ""cultural, economic and security threats against Islamic Iran"", he said. Telegram under fire as Iran clamps down on protests The symbol of Iran's protests? Why are there protests in Iran? Iran's Revolutionary Guards take lead on foreign affairs His comments echoed those by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday, which also blamed unspecified ""enemies"" and which analysts believed referred to the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia. But the general also blamed a ""former official"" for the protests, in a comment analysts believe referred to ex-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has been critical of government officials, in particular Judiciary Chief Sadegh Amoli Larijani, in recent weeks. State television broadcast some of the pro-government rallies live. Among those holding events were the cities of Kermanshah, Ilam and Gorgan. This video can not be played Pro-government rallies have been held in a number of cities Some marchers carried Iranian flags and images of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In the city of Qom, marchers chanted ""death to American mercenaries"". Chants elsewhere included ""the blood in our veins is a gift to our leader"" and ""the seditionist rioters should be executed"". Reuters news agency is reporting fresh protests after nightfall on Wednesday in the city of Malayer in western Hamadan province, with protesters chanting: ""People are begging, the supreme leader is acting like God!"" Video on social media showed protesters in Nowshahr in the north chanting ""death to the dictator"", a phrase that has been used against Ayatollah Khamenei, the agency reported. Another video showed a building burning in Gohardasht. An unpredictable challenge for Iran Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' Associated Press said other video had emerged on Wednesday of protesters tearing down images of the ayatollah in Noor Abad, 360km (225 miles) south-west of Tehran, although it was unclear when the footage was shot. Meanwhile three members of the security services have been killed in Piranshahr, an area in West Azerbaijan province which borders Iraqi Kurdistan, according to a statement by the Revolutionary Guards. However, the area occasionally sees clashes with Kurdish separatists based in Iraq, and the attack is not thought to be linked to the recent protests.

Two men plead not guilty to terror charge,"The British far-right group was banned last year Two men, including a British soldier, have pleaded not guilty to a number of terror charges. Lance Corporal Mikko Vehvilainen, 33 and Alexander Deakin, 22, are also accused of being members of the banned neo-Nazi group National Action. Both denied possessing documents that could be useful to someone planning an act of terror. But appearing at Birmingham Crown Court, neither men entered a plea with regard to membership of the group. National Action was the first extreme right-wing group to be outlawed in the UK. It was added to a list of proscribed groups in 2016. Mr Deakin, of Great Barr, Birmingham, also pleaded not guilty to distributing a terrorist publication. And L/Cpl Vehvilainen, from Sennybridge Camp in Powys, entered not guilty pleas to two counts of posting material online that was threatening, abusive or insulting, thereby stirring up racial hatred. The next hearing has been scheduled for 19 February, with a trial set to begin in March.

'Spiked vegan' chef offers resignation,"Mike Gayle and Laura Goodman own Italian restaurant Carlini in Albrighton, Shropshire A chef who claimed that she ""spiked a vegan"" has offered her resignation. Laura Goodman, co-owner and head chef at Carlini in Shropshire, faced a backlash over her comments on Facebook about a ""pious, judgmental"" vegan. Her fiancÃ© and business partner, Michael Gale, said she had received death threats. Mr Gale told the BBC: ""She recognises she needs some time away from the business to clear her head and think about what happened."" A spokesperson for the restaurant, in Albrighton, said: ""Laura Goodman has today tendered her resignation from Carlini and the board of directors are currently considering their options"". The spokesperson added that she would not be working while ""this process is being completed"". The year veganism went mainstream Midlands Live: Far right group suspects arrested; More than 1,900 homes without power due to Storm Eleanor Ms Goodman made the comments in a Facebook group called ""The Boring Group"", in the early hours of Saturday. The posts have since been removed. She has told the BBC she is ""deeply sorry"" for her remarks and ""deeply distressed"" about the response to them. People responded to her comments, describing them as ""spiteful"", ""mean"", ""terrible"" and ""disgusting"". There has also been a surge in negative reviews of Carlini on Google, leading to the restaurant's rating falling to one star. Mr Gale said his fiancÃ©e would ""take some time off"" and ""consider her options"". He previously said ""spiked"" had been ""poorly chosen"" language and that Ms Goodman had not ""fully realised the consequence of what it meant"". Mr Gale said that the couple ""totally understand"" the anger caused, but pointed out that no meat was used in any of the dishes. He explained his fiancÃ©e's posts by saying she had designed a special vegan menu for a party of diners, one of whom then ordered a pizza containing cheese. The couple have another restaurant in Shifnal, Shropshire. Both have been closed and will reopen later this week.

First polar bear born in UK for 25 years,"This video can not be played UK's first polar bear cub in 25 years born in Highlands A female polar bear at a Scottish animal park has given birth to a cub, says the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. (RZSS). It is the first polar bear to be born in the UK in 25 years. The mother bear, Victoria, is one of three adult polar bears at the Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS said ""high-pitched noises"" made by the cub could be heard from Victoria's maternity den just before Christmas. The last polar bear cubs born in the UK were twins at Flamingo Land in Yorkshire on 8 December 1992. The effort to breed polar bears in Scotland How do you find a mate for a polar bear? Arktos, the male bear Victoria mated with, is one of the park's other adult bears. He is in a separate enclosure from the female bear. Victoria's enclosure is closed to the public. This video can not be played The sound of a newly-born polar bear cub Una Richardson, the park's head keeper responsible for carnivores, said: ""We first heard promising noises in the week before Christmas and these have now continued into the new year. ""Because we don't have sight inside her cubbing box we can't be sure if Victoria has had more than one cub, but we can confirm the birth. ""While we are absolutely thrilled, we are not celebrating prematurely as polar bear cubs have a high mortality rate in the first weeks of life due to their undeveloped immune system and the mother's exaggerated need for privacy, with any disturbance risking the cub being killed or abandoned."" Victoria was brought to the Highland Wildlife Park, which also has two male bears, last year The park's male polar bears Arktos, left, and Walker She added: ""We will continue to monitor Victoria and very much hope for the best possible news when she emerges around March. ""Until then, Victoria's enclosure will be closed to the public and keeper activity will be at a minimum to give her offspring every chance of survival."" Wildlife conservation group Born Free has criticised the keeping of polar bears in zoos, saying the animals are ""ill-suited"" to zoo environments. Its president, Will Travers, said: ""At a time when the zoo community should be phasing out the keeping of polar bears in captivity, the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland has decided to row against the tide. ""From a welfare point of view, the enclosure at the Highland Wildlife Park may be significantly better than the blue-rinse concrete pits that people so often associate with polar bears in zoos, but we contend that our efforts on behalf of this species should be focused on mitigating the impacts of human-induced climate change and securing the species in the wild, not subjecting another polar bear to a lifetime in captivity."" On Tuesday, a zoo in Berlin said thata polar bear cub born at the site 26 days earlier had died. Polar bears mate between March and June Females normally give birth to one or two cubs in November or December Newborn polar bear cubs are blind, about 30cm long and weigh little more than a guinea pig.

Chef quits over 'spiked vegan' post,"Mike Gayle and Laura Goodman own Italian restaurant Carlini in Albrighton, Shropshire A chef who claimed that she ""spiked a vegan"" has offered her resignation. Laura Goodman, co-owner and head chef at Carlini in Shropshire, faced a backlash over her comments on Facebook about a ""pious, judgmental"" vegan. Her fiancÃ© and business partner, Michael Gale, said she had received death threats. Mr Gale told the BBC: ""She recognises she needs some time away from the business to clear her head and think about what happened."" A spokesperson for the restaurant, in Albrighton, said: ""Laura Goodman has today tendered her resignation from Carlini and the board of directors are currently considering their options"". The spokesperson added that she would not be working while ""this process is being completed"". The year veganism went mainstream Midlands Live: Far right group suspects arrested; More than 1,900 homes without power due to Storm Eleanor Ms Goodman made the comments in a Facebook group called ""The Boring Group"", in the early hours of Saturday. The posts have since been removed. She has told the BBC she is ""deeply sorry"" for her remarks and ""deeply distressed"" about the response to them. People responded to her comments, describing them as ""spiteful"", ""mean"", ""terrible"" and ""disgusting"". There has also been a surge in negative reviews of Carlini on Google, leading to the restaurant's rating falling to one star. Mr Gale said his fiancÃ©e would ""take some time off"" and ""consider her options"". He previously said ""spiked"" had been ""poorly chosen"" language and that Ms Goodman had not ""fully realised the consequence of what it meant"". Mr Gale said that the couple ""totally understand"" the anger caused, but pointed out that no meat was used in any of the dishes. He explained his fiancÃ©e's posts by saying she had designed a special vegan menu for a party of diners, one of whom then ordered a pizza containing cheese. The couple have another restaurant in Shifnal, Shropshire. Both have been closed and will reopen later this week.

Trump to Kim: My button's bigger than yours,"The feud between the US president and North Korean leader has become increasingly personal US President Donald Trump has boasted that his nuclear button is ""much bigger"" and ""more powerful"" than North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's. Mr Trump's tweet is the latest contribution to an increasingly personalised feud between the nuclear-armed leaders. Mr Kim threatened earlier this week that his nuclear launch button was ""always on my table"". Unsurprisingly, Mr Trump's unorthodox words sent social media into a frenzy. It ended a quick-fire day of tweeting by Mr Trump in which he took credit for a lack of plane crashes, announced awards for ""corrupt media"" and threatened to pull aid from Palestinians for failing to show ""appreciation or respect"".

Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation North Korea crisis in 300 words A history of North Korea at the Olympics Just asPresident Trump's unorthodox Twitter habits have puzzled observers in the past, the latest tweet is again redefining what is considered a diplomatic or presidential tone.

Mr Trump's latest comment states the obvious: a US president has immediate access to the nuclear codes. However,the real process of launching a nuclear attackdoes not involve any button-pressing. After high-level consultations, the president would exchange codes with top military officials. They are printed on a card known as ""the biscuit"", which he carries wherever he goes.

At least that's what US media reported after seeing said button in action during interviews. North Korea claims it has nuclear weapons and could strike the US, but whileanalysts agree that Pyongyang has nuclear weapons, it is not clear whether it has the technology to use them in anger. Meanwhile, in contrast to the bickering on Twitter,the North has just reopened a telephone hotline to the South. The latest outburst came a day after Mr Kim's speech, to which President Trump initially reacted with caution. ""Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!"", he tweeted. But his later remark left some social media users questioning if the president had been watching Fox News - which had covered the topic a few minutes before.  He is known to be a fan of the channel and often tweets along. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nine inmates escape from Berlin prison,"Prisoners can be seen escaping from a shaft in the wall on the left in this video-surveillance footage Berlin authorities are the target of ridicule and disbelief after nine prisoners escaped or absconded from one prison in the space of five days. Six remain on the run from PlÃ¶tzensee jail after four separate incidents. Last Thursday, four inmates used an angle grinder and hammer from the prison workshop to break through a ventilation shaft. They then crept under the perimeter fence. Despite CCTV capturing the escape, it was 41 minutes before it was noticed. Two of the four prisoners - who were serving sentences for theft, aggravated assault and extortion - are reported to be still at large. Berlin's Senator of Justice Dirk Behrendt has so far faced down calls for him to resign, saying he has assembled a commission of experts to eliminate vulnerabilities in the prison system. In the other incidents: On Friday 29 December, it emerged that a prisoner had failed to return from day release on Thursday On Monday 1, January authorities disclosed that two prisoners had escaped overnight through the window of a neighbouring cell - one returned voluntarily On Tuesday 2 January, Mr Behrendt revealed two more prisoners had escaped over the weekend, though it is unclear whether they broke out or failed to return from day release. The incidents were mocked by some on Twitter. ""PlÃ¶tzensee jail is like the Berghain [famed Berlin nightclub]. It is easier to get out than in,"" quipped one.,external Another commentator joked that in light of their ""speedy planning and implementation of a construction project"",those who escaped last Thursday should immediately be put in charge of the building of the long-delayed Berlin Brandenburg Airport,external. By Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin It's ""open house"" at Berlin's prisons, mocked one politician. ""This jail is like a hostel, where you can come and go whenever you want,"" tweeted another. Nine prison escapes in five days from the same prison is something of a record. So opposition politicians are calling for Berlin's Senator of Justice Dirk Behrendt to be sacked. In his defence, technically speaking not all of the cases were breakouts: Some inmates were serving open-prison sentences with minimal supervision. But some of them even opted to climb out of the window, rather than simply not return from permitted appointments, leading to questions about the building's security. And in the most spectacular case, CCTV cameras filmed prisoners hammering their way through a ventilation shaft - but the alarm was still raised too late. While in opposition Mr Behrendt, who's from the Green Party, earned respect for fighting for better conditions in Berlin's prisons. When he was put in charge of jails last year promised a more human approach to prisoners. Now conservative opponents are accusing him of simply being too lenient instead. Security measures in the prison, which permits inmates to leave the jail on day release in order to work, are less stringent than in other jails. But opponents of Mr Behrendt lined up to call for his resignation nonetheless. Florian Graf, who leads the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin's state parliament, said he was a ""dilettante"", while Joschka Langenbrinck, a deputy for the Social Democrats (SPD) bloc said the affair was a ""reason for a senator to resign"". Mr Behrendt's spokesperson pointed out there had been no overall increase in the number of breakouts under his tenure.

North Korea reopens hotline to South,"The hotline in the village of Panmunjom North Korea has reopened a hotline to South Korea, almost two years after it was disabled on the orders of leader Kim Jong-un. South Korea confirmed it had received a call from the North at 15:30 local time (06:30 GMT) on Wednesday. The North Korean leader had earlier said he was open to dialogue with Seoul and to sending a team to the Winter Olympics in the South next month. The two nations have not held high-level talks since December 2015. North Korea cut off the communications channel shortly afterwards, refusing to answer calls, according to officials in the South. A North Korean official announced the hotline's reopening in a televised statement. Instead of a senior newscaster, the chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, Ri Son-gwon, made the statement, saying he was speaking ""upon authorisation of Kim Jong-un"". The initial call was brief as checks are still being carried out on the line, according to South Korean officials. North Korea said the aim would be for the two nations to discuss the practical issues around sending a North Korean delegation to the Winter Games in Pyeongchang. What we know about the red and green phones Will North Korea compete at the Winter Olympics? A history of North Korea at the Olympics The press secretary for South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the restoration of this communications channel was ""very significant"". ""It creates an environment where communication will be possible at all times,"" he said. In the press, there was scepticism. ""Kim's New Year's address is a highly calculated move to fuel internal division in South Korea,"" said daily newspaper JoongAng Ilbo. ""Pyongyang may have decided on its peace offensive to buy time until the completion of its nuclear weapons programme."" Hankyoreh newspaper also voiced caution: ""Kim has not budged an inch from his previous reckless and hard-line stance on the development of nuclear weapons and missiles."" But the ""surprising New Year's address could open the door to peace"", it added. According to the South Korean Unification Ministry, there are a total of 33 direct lines that North and South Korea once used to communicate with each other. This particular phone line, established in 1971, is based in Panmunjom. The border village, in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ), is where the Koreas have historically held talks. This video can not be played Take a tour of Panmunjom In a New Year's Day speech, Mr Kim spoke of lowering tensionsand of melting ""frozen North-South relations"". He said attending the Games would be ""a good opportunity to show unity of the people"" in North Korea. South Korea had already indicated that the North's participation in the Games would be welcomed. Seoul offered high-level talks in response, with President Moon Jae-in calling it a ""groundbreaking chance"" to improve relations. It is not yet clear whether North Korea will accept that offer, but the opening of the hotline will allow for preliminary discussions to be held. North Korea cut off communications on the hotline in 2016, following a row over the Kaesong industrial complex. Kaesong was the last major point of co-operation between the Koreas The complex was a joint economic venture between the two Koreas, but the South suspended the project in response to a nuclear weapons test by the North. In China in late December, according to North Korean leadership specialist Michael Madden. A North Korean vice-minister of athletics was sent to interact with his South Korean counterparts, who may or may not have been acting on President Moon's instructions, he says, adding that this might ease the higher-level talks. North Korea has come under increasing international pressure in the past year over its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea crisis in 300 words President Moon said the North's continuing tests would be the backdrop to any new discussions about the Olympics. At the same time as offering an apparent olive branch to the South, Mr Kim used his speech to repeat threats against the US, saying a nuclear launch button was always on his table. US state department spokesman Heather Nauert said that Mr Kim's latest move ""may be trying to drive a wedge of some sort between the two nations - between our nation and the Republic of Korea [South Korea]"". Washington has encouraged all countries to isolate North Korea. The South says it has discussed its latest steps with the US.

Festive joy for Next as sales rise,"Sales at Next have unexpectedly risen over the Christmas period, prompting the fashion retailer to raise its profit forecast. Cold weather boosted trade ahead of Christmas, sending full-price sales up 1.5% - far better than the 0.3% fall it had expected. A 13.6% rise in online sales offset a 6.1% decline in store sales in the 54 days to 24 December. As a result Next said annual profits were expected to rise by Â£8m to Â£725m. That remained considerably lower than the Â£790.2 million for the year to January 2017. Shares rose 7.5% to Â£48.38, valuing the company at just over Â£7bn.. The retailer warned that many of the challenges it faced last year, such as subdued consumer demand and lower spending on clothing, would persist in 2018. However, chief executive Lord Wolfson said the retailer was now much more optimistic about its prospects compared with this time last year when it issued a profit warning. He also argued that declining in-store sales did not mean the death of the high street. ""Retail will remain challenging and the shift from retail to online will continue, but half of our online orders are delivered to a store, so this is not the end of the high street as some people have said,"" Lord Wolfson said. Analysisby Business Editor, Simon Jack You don't have to be a Next shareholder to find something to cheer about in the retailer's sales update. Perhaps the most interesting thing for a wider audience was the chief executive's comments on inflation. Lord Wolfson said that inflation in clothing prices would fall to 2% in the first half of this year and disappear completely in the second. Back in March 2017, the retailer warned it might have to put prices up by 5% because the sharp fall in the pound after the EU referendum raised the price of imported goods. Next subsequently revised that figure down and today's comments are the clearest indication yet that the inflationary impact of that fall are working their way out of the system. That is good news for everyone - whether or not you shop at Next. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said the sales split between online and stores was ""again stark"", with sales at Next stores down 7.2% for the entire year, while online rose by 10.4%. Retail consultant Mary Portas told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Next's heavy investment in its online operation had paid off. ""Online is going to be about 30% of our sales in the next five years and the big retailers who have invested in that during the past few years are starting to see the results, but it doesn't bode well for the high street,"" she said. Richard Lim of Retail Economics said the fashion clothing market was becoming more competitive because of more nimble online players such as Asos and Boohoo, a prolonged period of sales kicked off by Black Friday and an increase in operating costs. Next was the first retailer to report the results of its Christmas trading, with a host of others following throughout January, including Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Ted Baker, Tesco, Marks and Spencer, John Lewis and Debenhams next week.

"We each streamed 1,036 songs last year","Ed Sheeran, Stormzy and Dua Lipa had some of the most popular tracks of 2017 UK music fans streamed more music than ever before in 2017 - an astonishing total of 68.1 billion songs. That's the equivalent of everyone in the country playing 1,036 tracks, or almost three continuous days of music, on sites like Apple Music and Spotify. A huge proportion of those streams were of Ed Sheeran - who had four of the Top 10 biggest singles of the year. Trade body the BPI says streaming now accounts for more than half (50.4%) of all music consumption in the UK. The figure is up from 36.4% last year - with a record 1.5 billion streams served in one week last December. To put that in context, we are now streaming more songs in a single week than we did in the first six months of 2012. Ed Sheeran is number one for Christmas Despacito breaks global streaming record Who is releasing new music in 2018? If anything, though, the BPI is actually underplaying the success of streaming, as it relies on data from the Official Charts Company, which does not currently count music played on YouTube towards its figures. It has been estimated,externalthat if YouTube was included, the number of streams accessed by music fans in the UK would double. Allow YouTube content?

Overall, sales of music generated Â£1.2 billion for the UK economy last year, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association. In total, 135.1 million albums were sold last year, (including 68 million ""streaming equivalent albums"" - where 1,000 streams counts as one ""sale""), an increase of 9.5%. Vinyl continued to grow in popularity, with 4.1 million LPs purchased in 2017. Again, Ed Sheeran was the most popular artist on the format - closely followed by Liam Gallagher and Amy Winehouse's Back To Black, which featured in the top five vinyl albums for the third year in a row. However, vinyl only accounts for 3% of the overall music market, and its success is in stark contrast to the decline in CDs and downloads. CD sales, which peaked at 162.4 million in 2004, now languish at 41.6 million. Digital downloads are also on the way out, with just 13.8 million albums bought on stores like iTunes and Amazon last year, a drop of 23%. Overall, music consumption was up by 8.7% - the fastest rise since 1998. Sales and streams contributed Â£1.2 billion to the UK economy, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA). Apart from Sheeran, the UK's biggest artists included Rag N Bone Man, whose album Human shifted more than 885,000 copies by the end of the year. Little Mix's Glory Days continued to sell well, while Pink and Drake were the best-selling international artists. It was also a better year for new artists after a dismal 2016, where only one British debut album (Bradley Walsh's Chasing Dreams) went gold. 2017 saw the likes of Dua Lipa, Stormzy, Harry Styles and J Hus achieve the 100,000 sales milestone. Overall, the entertainment industry enjoyed a bumper year in 2017, with sales of video games, films, TV programmes, and music all recording growth for the fifth consecutive year. Disney had the two biggest-selling film titles of the year - with the live action remake of Beauty And The Beast and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story collectively selling more than 2.9 million copies, according to the British Association for Screen Entertainment. DVDs and Blu-Rays both saw a double-digit decline in sales, but revenues from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon grew by 22.2%, and now account for more than 70% of the video market. According to ERA, the entertainment market as a whole reached a ""new all-time-high"", generating Â£7.24 billion last year. CEO Kim Bayley called it ""an historic result"" driven by new technology and innovation. ""New digital services are bringing ever increasing numbers of the UK population back to entertainment with 24/7 access to the music, video and games they want,"" she said.

Bus plunges off cliff in Peru killing 48,"This video can not be played Peru Pasamayo: Bus plunges off cliff At least 48 people have been killed after a coach plummeted 100m (330ft) down a cliff and landed upside down on a beach in Peru, officials say. The health ministry said six people had survived the accident, one of whom had jumped from the bus before it fell. The accident happened on a notorious stretch of road known as Curva del Diablo (devil's bend) in Pasamayo, north of the capital Lima. The coach, with more than 50 people on board, collided with a lorry. Transit police said the lorry driver had been detained for questioning. The bus, which belongs to the San MartÃ­n de Porres transport company, was travelling to Lima from Huacho, about 130km (80 miles) north of the capital. The stretch of road winding alongside the Pacific Ocean where the accident happened is considered one of the most dangerous in Peru. It has no barriers separating it from a sheer drop to the ocean and the sea spray and frequent fog can make it particularly slippery. The bus company that said its driver was very experienced and was travelling with an assistant. The company also said that the bus had passed a mechanical check before leaving Huacho. Footage showed rescue workers struggling to reach the bus, with a helicopter winching down some emergency workers while others were lowered down the cliff with ropes. The coach fell 100m down a cliff after colliding with a truck Rescue workers were lowered onto the beach by helicopters The coach landed on its roof Five people have been pulled from the wreckage alive - a sixth managed to jump out of a window Rescue work had to be halted overnight as the tide rose and engulfed parts of the coach. A Peruvian navy boat helped get the rescuers off the beach. Local media reported that one of the passengers managed to survive by jumping out of the coach before it plunged down the cliff. The doctor in the hospital where 24-year-old MÃ¡ximo JimÃ©nez Vilcayaure was being treated for a broken arm said the man had jumped out of a window with seconds to spare. Five other survivors were pulled from the wreckage and are being treated for multiple fractures. Twenty-four bodies have so far been recovered. Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said it was ""painful for the whole country to suffer an accident of this magnitude"". He sent a message of ""deep solidarity"" to the families of the victims.

Trump threatens to halt Palestinian aid,"Mr Trump's comments suggest he is planning to pull Palestinian aid funding The US may stop aid payments to Palestinians who are ""no longer willing to talk peace"", President Trump said. On Twitter, Mr Trump said the United States received ""no appreciation or respect"" in return for its aid. He also said his controversial recognition of the contested city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital took the hugely divisive issue ""off the table"" for new peace talks. Palestinians had said the move showed the US could not be a neutral broker. Soon after Washington's decision was announced in December,Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not accept any US peace plan for the Middle East. The decision on Jerusalem was also overwhelmingly condemned at the United Nations, where 128 countries voted against Mr Trump's fulfilment of a campaign promise. The US president was following up earlier comments about aid payments to Pakistan, in which he said the US had received only ""lies and deceit"" in exchange for billions of dollars in aid.

Mr Trump's tweets followed remarks from Nikki Haley, the US envoy to the United Nations, in which she said the US would stop contributing to the UN's relief agency for Palestinian refugees. The agency runs education, health, and social programmes. The United States is its largest governmental donor, handing over almost $370m (Â£270m) in 2016. Speaking at a news conference, Ms Haley said: ""The president has basically said that he doesn't want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians are agreeing to come back to the negotiation table."" The United Nations' overwhelming condemnation was ""not helpful"", Ms Haley said She said the UN's vote to condemn Mr Trump's Jerusalem decision was ""not helpful to the situation"". ""The Palestinians now have to show their will that they want to come to the table. As of now, they're not coming to the table but they asked for aid. ""We're not giving the aid, we're going to make sure that they come to the table,"" she said. The withdrawal of aid is likely to have a significant impact on the UN agency's work,as the US contributes almost 30% of its overall funding,external.

Crowded hospitals âput patients at riskâ,"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: I apologise for postponed operations Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has apologised to patients in England who have had their operations postponed. Non-urgent treatments had already been cancelled until mid-January, but NHS England said on Tuesday that would now be extended to the end of the month. It came after hospitals reported they were struggling to cope with the surge in patients being seen since Christmas. At least 17 hospital trusts - one in 10 - have declared a major incident in the last 24 hours, the BBC understands. Bosses said they had been forced into the move as patients were experiencing long waits in A&E and being left on trolleys in corridors because there were no beds available. Some ambulance services have even started asking 999 callers with less serious problems to make their own way to hospital so they can prioritise the most life-threatening calls. Of the decision to cancel operations, Mr Hunt said it was ""absolutely not what I want"". But he said the move was needed given the pressure hospitals were under. ""This is the busiest week of the year for the NHS."" And he also said the whole country was grateful for the work NHS staff were putting in working ""incredibly long hours through the night, beyond the call of duty in every possible way"". This video can not be played Theresa May: The NHS has been better prepared for this winter than ever before His thanks were echoed by Prime Minister Theresa May, who also denied the health service was in crisis. ""The NHS has been better prepared for this winter than ever before,"" she added.

Problems have also been reported in other parts of the UK. The Welsh government said the health service was facing ""significant pressure"". Meanwhile, in Scotlandthere has been a 20% jump in A&E attendances compared with the previous year, prompting an increase in patients waiting more than four hours, and in Northern Ireland the Antrim Area Hospital has been forced to bring in St John ambulance volunteers to help with a surge in demand. Winter pressure health campaign launched NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter People on beds 'as far as you could see' NHS England's Prof Keith Willett admitted the pressures were severe - the worst he had seen since the 1990s - but said plans were in place. As well as the cancelling of non-urgent treatments, such as knee and hip replacements, hospitals have been given the green light to put patients on mixed sex wards and to bring GPs into A&E to help deal with patients. ""A crisis is when you haven't got in place mitigations and you haven't got a plan to deal with it,"" Prof Willett said. ""We've gone into this winter in a way we've never prepared before."" This video can not be played NHS chief tells Today service is not in crisis but says they may need to cancel more operations in future But Prof Suzanne Mason, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the measures were ""too little too late"" as hospitals simply had no beds free and these treatments would have had to be cancelled anyway. She added: ""Patient safety is being compromised - there's no doubt about that.  When patients are in crowded emergency departments and staff cannot actually move between patients and provide the basic level of care that's required, then safety is compromised. ""Patients who spend many hours on a trolley - and these are often elderly patients - they are the sickest patients in our department. ""They are much more likely to have a poorer outcome and even die as a result of their experience in the emergency department. And that is a huge tragedy for us in our specialty and that's why we are so desperate to see things improve."" This video can not be played Dr Adrian Harrop: ""I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle"" Reports have emerged of serious problems in a number of places over the past 24 hours: Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre has asked patients to avoid its A&E after being deluged on Tuesday evening Southend Hospital said it was dealing with an ""internal critical incident"" with all its beds full, which has led them to call in extra staff A consultant at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust apologised for ""third world conditions"" in his hospital department Milton Keynes University Hospital is telling people only to attend for emergency treatment Two ambulance trusts in the east and north-east of England are on the highest alert A concentration of major incidents declared at hospitals across the West Country and south-east Doctors and nurses have also been speaking about the problems. Dr Adrian Harrop, an A&E doctor at Scarborough Hospital, said he felt he was ""fighting a losing battle"" as he was not able to do his job properly and care for his patients in the way he wanted. Mark Nevison, a senior nurse in the north-east, tweeted he had worked in A&E for 10 years and had ""never been so ashamed of the sub-standard care"" now being offered. Esther Herbert said she couldn't leave her mother before 06:30 the following morning Meanwhile, patients have been talking about their experiences. Esther Herbert accompanied her 87-year-old mother to Worcestershire Royal Hospital before Christmas. ""The doors opened and it was just a sea of people,"" she said. ""There were people on beds all the way down the corridor, as far as you could see."" Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has blamed the pressures on ""Tory underfunding"".

US scorns Iran's protest accusation,"This video can not be played Iran protests: Why people are taking to the streets The US has branded as ""complete nonsense"" Iran's accusation that its enemies have been behind a wave of violent protests sweeping the country. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had made the accusation in his first comments on the protests. US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley said the protests were ""spontaneous"", adding that the US planned to call an emergency UN meeting on the situation. The unrest began last Thursday and has seen 21 people killed. The demonstrations, which started in the city of Mashhad, were initially against price rises and corruption, but then began to express wider anti-government sentiment. Why are there protests in Iran? An unpredictable challenge for Iran Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' Meanwhile, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. Mr Macron called for ""restraint"" and it was decided that a visit by France's foreign minister due this week should be postponed, In a post on his official website, Iran's supreme leader had said: ""In recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence services to create troubles for the Islamic Republic.""

Ms Haley said the accusation was ""ridiculous"". She added: ""The people of Iran are crying out for freedom, All freedom-loving people must stand with their cause."" She said the US would call for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the anti-government protests. This video can not be played Nikki Haley: ""We must not be silent on Iran protests"" The BBC's Nada Tawfik in New York says the Security Council deals with international threats to peace and security and it is unclear if there would be enough support among council members for such a meeting. Ms Haley continued: ""The freedoms that are enshrined in the United Nations charter are under attack in Iran. Dozens have already been killed. Hundreds have been arrested. ""If the Iranian dictatorship's history is any guide, we can expect more outrageous abuses in the days to come."" Iran's Revolutionary Guards take lead on foreign affairs US warns Iran: The world is watching Who is Hassan Rouhani? The US stance to the unrest, which has included a string of tweets from President Donald Trump, has drawn an angry response from the Iranian leadership. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, said Mr Trump should focus on ""the domestic issues of his own country, such as daily killings of dozens of people... and the existence of millions of homeless and hungry people"". Even a group of reformist and moderate MPs accused the US of trying to take advantage of the situation. There were reports on social media late on Tuesday of more unrest, although it is not possible to confirm it independently or the exact timing. The reports spoke of: Burning buildings in the town of Behbahan Protests spreading to the north-western city of Tabriz Police firing tear gas to break up protests in the south-western city of Ahvaz Unrest in Gohardasht and Eslamabad-e-Gharb Unconfirmed video footage on social media showed protesters and security forces on the streets of the city of Hamedan; flash bombs or grenades being thrown in Rasht and street fires in Karaj. More than 450 arrests have been made in Tehran alone over the past three days. By Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor When the protests started last Thursday, they were about the current economic crisis but as they spread, pent-up frustrations spilled out and politics became a big part of them. President Rouhani has been widely criticised. He has disappointed voters who hoped he would do more to turn round an economy that has been damaged by years of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. Iran's role in conflicts across the Middle East has also been criticised as it is an expensive foreign policy at a time when people in Iran are getting poorer. Leading figures in the Islamic Republic have also been targeted by protesters, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. He has responded by blaming foreigners. Iran has suffered in the past from foreign interference, so his words will strike a chord among some - and could also signal a much tougher response from the security forces. The demonstrations do not seem to have recognisable leaders, unlike the last big protests after the disputed presidential election in 2009. At that time, the elite of the Islamic Republic was divided. It is not at the moment, so that will make it harder for the protests to be sustained, and they may run out of steam. But the fact they are happening at all is very significant. They show how discontented Iranians are with increasing poverty, after years of repression. They are the largest since the disputed 2009 presidential election. Mass demonstrations then - referred to as the Green Movement - were held by millions of opposition supporters against the victory of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. At least 30 people were killed and thousands arrested in the wave of protests, which drew the largest crowds in Iran since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Dating website's 'scientific' match ad banned,"A dating website's claim that it used a ""scientifically proven matching system"" to pair up those looking for love, has been banned. An advert for eHarmony on the London Underground in July read: ""It's time science had a go at love."" The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) called the claim ""misleading"". The online matchmaker said while it ""respectfully disagrees"" with the ruling, it will make its advertising ""as clear as possible"". The website was unable to offer the ASA any evidence that customers had a greater chance of finding love, despite claiming that its ""scientifically proven matching system decodes the mystery of compatibility and chemistry"". ""Imagine being able to stack the odds of finding lasting love entirely in your favour,"" the advert read. The initial complaint was lodged by Lord Lipsey, the joint chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Statistics and a former member of the ASA council. He said the phrase 'scientifically proven' should only be used in claims that are ""just that"" and not ""crude puffery designed to lure in those longing for love"". ""This is a new form of fake news which the ASA has rightly slapped down,"" he added. But the website said it matched singles using ""sophisticated matching standards designed by PhD psychologists"". 'Irresponsible' advert featuring parkour runner banned Ikea apologises for 'sexist' China advert What are online dating sites doing to keep us safe? It uses an algorithm which requires users to complete questionnaires to determine their personality traits, values and interests. The service, which claims to be known as ""the brains behind the butterflies"", matches users to those whose responses complemented their own preferences. The algorithm is data driven; using statistical models made from the information of more than 50,000 married couples. Romain Bertrand, managing director at eHarmony UK, said the service was conceived on the premise that ""science and research could be harnessed to help people find love"". The company believed consumers would understand its advert to mean that its scientific approach could potentially work for them - not that it would guarantee love. But the ASA concluded that consumers would interpret the claim ""scientifically proven matching system"" to mean that scientific studies had found that the website offered users a significantly greater chance of finding lasting love than what could be achieved if they did not use the service.

Freed Canadian hostage arrested for assault,"Joshua Boyle is facing 15 criminal charges A Canadian man who was held hostage for five years by a Taliban-linked insurgent group has been arrested. Joshua Boyle, 34, is facing a total of 15 charges including assault and unlawful confinement. There is a publication ban on any information that would identify any alleged victim or witness. Mr Boyle appeared in court on Wednesday in Ottawa via video link and remains in custody. He is next due in court on 8 January. Pakistani soldiers rescued Mr Boyle, his US wife, Caitlan Coleman, and their children in October. The couple were kidnapped in Afghanistan in 2012 and had three children while in captivity. The story behind the couple's kidnapping Canadian media said the offences were alleged to have happened since Mr Boyle's return to Ottawa. He faces eight assault charges, two sexual assault charges, two unlawful confinement charges, one count of misleading police, uttering death threats and causing someone to take a noxious substance. ""Mr Boyle is presumed innocent,"" his lawyer Eric Granger said in an email to the BBC. ""He's never been in trouble before. No evidence has been provided yet, which is typical at this early stage. We look forward to receiving the evidence and defending him against these charges."" Canadian reports said the alleged offences took place between 14 October and 30 December. The couple were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012 by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network. After their release, Mr Boyle told the media that their captors had killed a fourth child and said they had raped his wife. The couple have been living in Canada since their rescue. In December, the family met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and images of the meeting were shared on the Boyle's Twitter account.

Queen takes part in coronation documentary,"The Queen sits with the St Edward's Crown as she recalls her coronation The Queen will share memories of her coronation when she makes a rare appearance in a television documentary. In the hour-long BBC programme - The Coronation - the Queen talks with royal commentator Alastair Bruce about the ceremony in 1953. She also discusses the day in 1937 when, aged 11, she watched the coronation of her father George VI. ""I've seen one coronation, and been the recipient in the other, which is pretty remarkable,"" she says. Queen Elizabeth II with Prince Philip after her coronation in 1953 The Queen ascended to the throne at the age of 25. The glittering ceremony caught the imagination of a nation still in the grip of post-war austerity. The film hears from others who took part, including a 12-year-old choirboy who found himself singing solo when when his colleagues - overwhelmed by the occasion - lost their voices. Does The Crown cost more than the Queen? Terror attack cities praised by Queen Coronation mementos on display The documentary also tells the story of the Crown Jewels that are associated with the ceremony, including the orb, sceptres, sword, spurs and ring. The BBC's director of content, Charlotte Moore, said: ""It is a real honour to have Her Majesty the Queen revealing her intimate knowledge of the Crown Jewels - and fond childhood memories from when her father was crowned King George VI in this very special film for BBC One. ""In her own words, the Queen will bring to life the enduring symbolic importance of the coronation ceremonies for modern audiences to enjoy."" Princess Elizabeth, then 11, with her mother following the coronation of King George VI in 1937 The main elements of the occasion have remained largely unchanged for a millennium. The coronation is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with regalia, and crowned with the St Edward's Crown - made of gold and decorated with precious and semi-precious stones. The best-known item, the Imperial State Crown, is worn at the end of the coronation service and at the State Opening of Parliament.

Far right group suspects arrested,"This video can not be played What is National Action? Six people have been arrested on suspicion of being members of the banned far-right group National Action. Five men from Cambridge, Banbury, Wolverhampton, Leicester and Stockport, and a woman from Banbury were detained by police earlier. All six are being held at a police station in the West Midlands. Police said the suspects, aged between 21 and 37, were detained under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act as part of a planned operation. They were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism, namely on suspicion of being a member of a proscribed organisation, National Action. The six arrested people are: A 26-year-old man from Cambridge A 21-year-old man and a 37-year-old woman both from Banbury, Oxfordshire A 28-year-old man from Wolverhampton A 26-year-old man from Leicester A 24-year-old man from Stockport West Midlands Police said the arrests were intelligence-led and carried out in conjunction with a number of other counter-terrorism units across England. ""There was no threat to public safety,"" a force spokesperson said. A number of properties are also being searched as part of the operation. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent National Action became the first British neo-Nazi group to be banned after Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was promoting violence and acts of terrorism. Members and supporters applauded the murder of Jo Cox MP by a white supremacist - and the group had carried out a series of small, but confrontational, demonstrations in towns and cities throughout England. One of its most notorious events saw masked members - many of them very young men - gathering outside York Minster to make Hitler salutes. Since it was banned, detectives have been carrying out more and more investigations into the group which, to all intents and purposes, has organised itself in a similar way to the banned al Muhajiroun network - the extremist Islamist youth movement. Both have used social media to target young people, attracting them with a simplistic us-and-them message designed to make them angry. Approximately a fifth of the 400 terrorism-related arrests in the year to the end of last September were categorised by police as ""domestic"" extremism, which includes suspected far-right activity. Since National Action was banned just over a year ago there have been more than a dozen arrests. A small number of prosecutions relating to the group will soon come to trial.

Ryanair passenger takes emergency exit,"This video can not be played The passenger was later arrested A Ryanair passenger, fed up with waiting to leave a plane in Spain, got in trouble after taking the emergency exit and waiting on the wing. His flight from London had been delayed one hour on departure, and passengers were reportedly kept on board for 30 minutes at Malaga. The man, reportedly a Polish national in his 50s, sat on the wing for some time before being talked back inside. He was later arrested by airport security. Video footage taken by another passenger shows the man setting his hand luggage down before perching on the wing's edge as a number of people can be heard laughing in the background. The unusual incident happened on flight FR8164 from Stansted to Malaga on New Year's Day. The Daily Mail spoke with two other passengers on board the flight,external, one of whom said it was ""surreal"" when the man activated the emergency exit, announcing: ""I'm going via the wing"". But it also quoted another passenger, Raj Mistry, who said the man had been suffering from asthma and was struggling to breathe. A spokesman for Ryanair called the event an ""airport security breach"". ""Malaga airport police immediately arrested the passenger in question and since this was a breach of Spanish safety and security regulations, it is being dealt with by the Spanish authorities,"" he said. It is not the first time a Ryanair passenger has taken to the tarmac in Spain. In 2016, one passenger in Madrid jumped from a disconnected bridge and sprinted across the tarmactowards a Ryanair plane in an attempt to catch a flight to Gran Canaria.

Hospitals to delay non-urgent operations,"Tens of thousands of non-urgent NHS operations and procedures in England may be deferred until 31 January, due to winter pressures. Officials also told hospitals to delay routine outpatient appointments to concentrate on emergency care. Separately, a doctor apologised on Twitter for ""third world conditions"" in the hospital where he works in Stoke. NHS England's acute care director said hospitals were being given the ""time and space"" to manage January pressures. Officials reiterated that cancer operations and time-critical procedures should go ahead as planned. The advice comes as Milton Keynes University Hospital is telling people only to attend for emergency treatment. BBC reporter Dominic Johnson said Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre is asking patients to avoid its emergency department as it is on black alert, after seeing 140 patients at its peak on Tuesday evening. He adds 80-100 patients is considered ""very busy"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two ambulance trusts in England, east and north-east, say they are on the highest alert. NHS England's National Emergency Pressures Panel, which met on Tuesday, said it had extended the deadline for deferral of all non-urgent inpatient elective care - such as hip or knee replacements - to 31 January, to free up capacity for the sickest of patients. NHS England also gave hospitals the green light to put patients in mixed sex wards. Director of acute care Professor Keith Willett said that the delay of non-urgent operations was not a crisis, and added the NHS in England was reacting to concerns from doctors and nurses over a rise in flu incidents, as well as predicted cold weather. He said: ""With the incidents of flu rising in the community and in our hospitals, and the pressures that we always see in the first few weeks of January... that it's important we give the hospitals time and space to manage the demand that we anticipate will come through."" Each year the service comes under increased pressure in the winter, largely as a result of an increase in certain illnesses over this period, such as flu. It is too early to judge how bad this year's pressures are compared with previous years. The NHS does release regular statistics, but these are not real-time - meaning there is always a lag of a week or two to learn the full picture. NHS Tracker: Check key targets in your area Winter pressure health campaign launched NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter Milton Keynes University Hospital said it was facing pressure as a result of ""very high numbers of patients seeking emergency medical care"". It said the hospital had opened an ""unprecedented number of escalation [extra] beds"" in order to provide care for acutely unwell patients and warned that patients attending its emergency department would be treated in order of clinical priority. The hospital's chief executive, Prof Joe Harrison, said: ""We are seeing very high numbers of very sick patients in the emergency department and fewer patients being able to be discharged - many because they also remain in need of acute care. ""I would urge people to avoid the hospital's emergency department unless it is a genuine emergency. ""Staff are working under incredible pressure to look after the patients in our care. I cannot overstate that. We are doing our best in extraordinarily difficult circumstances."" BBC News health editor Hugh Pym The NHS is always under great pressure in the New Year - with some patients holding off over the festive season before going into A&E. Hospitals have planned intensively for the higher anticipated demand over winter. But the service seems under even more strain than previous years. The fact that NHS England has felt the need to call for further restrictions on non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments underlines concerns at the highest level. It has decided to give the green light to hospitals to put patients in mixed sex wards if they have to. NHS England notes a higher number of flu cases and can only hope that its own warnings about a flu outbreak don't materialise. Meanwhile, Dr Richard Fawcett, whose Twitter profile lists him as a consultant at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, apologised via Twitter for ""third world conditions"" in his hospital department.

The hospital trust responded by saying it had been under ""severe and sustained pressure over the Christmas period"" and this had ""continued into the new year"". The trust's medical director, Dr John Oxtoby, added: ""Our staff want the very best for our patients and at times they find the situation frustrating, which can be reflected on social media. ""However, we are a leading trauma, stroke and cardiac centre and have been regularly praised by external independent commentators for the quality of compassionate care provided at our hospitals despite all our pressures."" Ambulance services in the north-east and east of England said they had reached their highest operational alert level - number four. The North East Ambulance Service said it had been hit by ""unprecedented levels of demand"" over the Christmas and new year period. It said it was ""asking some patients, where appropriate, if they have alternative transport options, such as a family member"". Between 23 December and 1 January, it took more than 40,000 NHS 111 calls and more than 16,000 999 calls - compared to around 28,000 NHS 111 calls and 15,000 999 calls in the same period last year. It advised members of the public to consult a GP, pharmacist, local walk-in centre or to call NHS 111 if they did not require emergency care. A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said it had been at level three since Friday. A spokesman added: ""We are experiencing a high call demand, but that is not unusual at this time of year."" A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said Northern Ireland used a different system. There are four major hospitals served by the ambulance service and GP and 999 calls are being redirected away from the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, County Down to the other three major hospitals, which are currently operating normally.

Struggling hospitals facing 'huge tragedy',"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: I apologise for postponed operations Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has apologised to patients in England who have had their operations postponed. Non-urgent treatments had already been cancelled until mid-January, but NHS England said on Tuesday that would now be extended to the end of the month. It came after hospitals reported they were struggling to cope with the surge in patients being seen since Christmas. At least 17 hospital trusts - one in 10 - have declared a major incident in the last 24 hours, the BBC understands. Bosses said they had been forced into the move as patients were experiencing long waits in A&E and being left on trolleys in corridors because there were no beds available. Some ambulance services have even started asking 999 callers with less serious problems to make their own way to hospital so they can prioritise the most life-threatening calls. Of the decision to cancel operations, Mr Hunt said it was ""absolutely not what I want"". But he said the move was needed given the pressure hospitals were under. ""This is the busiest week of the year for the NHS."" And he also said the whole country was grateful for the work NHS staff were putting in working ""incredibly long hours through the night, beyond the call of duty in every possible way"". This video can not be played Theresa May: The NHS has been better prepared for this winter than ever before His thanks were echoed by Prime Minister Theresa May, who also denied the health service was in crisis. ""The NHS has been better prepared for this winter than ever before,"" she added.

Problems have also been reported in other parts of the UK. The Welsh government said the health service was facing ""significant pressure"". Meanwhile, in Scotlandthere has been a 20% jump in A&E attendances compared with the previous year, prompting an increase in patients waiting more than four hours, and in Northern Ireland the Antrim Area Hospital has been forced to bring in St John ambulance volunteers to help with a surge in demand. Winter pressure health campaign launched NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter People on beds 'as far as you could see' NHS England's Prof Keith Willett admitted the pressures were severe - the worst he had seen since the 1990s - but said plans were in place. As well as the cancelling of non-urgent treatments, such as knee and hip replacements, hospitals have been given the green light to put patients on mixed sex wards and to bring GPs into A&E to help deal with patients. ""A crisis is when you haven't got in place mitigations and you haven't got a plan to deal with it,"" Prof Willett said. ""We've gone into this winter in a way we've never prepared before."" This video can not be played NHS chief tells Today service is not in crisis but says they may need to cancel more operations in future But Prof Suzanne Mason, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the measures were ""too little too late"" as hospitals simply had no beds free and these treatments would have had to be cancelled anyway. She added: ""Patient safety is being compromised - there's no doubt about that.  When patients are in crowded emergency departments and staff cannot actually move between patients and provide the basic level of care that's required, then safety is compromised. ""Patients who spend many hours on a trolley - and these are often elderly patients - they are the sickest patients in our department. ""They are much more likely to have a poorer outcome and even die as a result of their experience in the emergency department. And that is a huge tragedy for us in our specialty and that's why we are so desperate to see things improve."" This video can not be played Dr Adrian Harrop: ""I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle"" Reports have emerged of serious problems in a number of places over the past 24 hours: Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre has asked patients to avoid its A&E after being deluged on Tuesday evening Southend Hospital said it was dealing with an ""internal critical incident"" with all its beds full, which has led them to call in extra staff A consultant at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust apologised for ""third world conditions"" in his hospital department Milton Keynes University Hospital is telling people only to attend for emergency treatment Two ambulance trusts in the east and north-east of England are on the highest alert A concentration of major incidents declared at hospitals across the West Country and south-east Doctors and nurses have also been speaking about the problems. Dr Adrian Harrop, an A&E doctor at Scarborough Hospital, said he felt he was ""fighting a losing battle"" as he was not able to do his job properly and care for his patients in the way he wanted. Mark Nevison, a senior nurse in the north-east, tweeted he had worked in A&E for 10 years and had ""never been so ashamed of the sub-standard care"" now being offered. Esther Herbert said she couldn't leave her mother before 06:30 the following morning Meanwhile, patients have been talking about their experiences. Esther Herbert accompanied her 87-year-old mother to Worcestershire Royal Hospital before Christmas. ""The doors opened and it was just a sea of people,"" she said. ""There were people on beds all the way down the corridor, as far as you could see."" Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has blamed the pressures on ""Tory underfunding"".

Spotify sued over songwriter rights,"The Black Keys Spotify has been hit with a lawsuit that accuses the streaming service of infringing the rights of songwriters and publishers. Wixen Music Publishing is seeking damages of at least $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn) - $150,000 for more than 10,000 songs. The California company represents artists that include Janis Joplin, The Black Keys and Tom Petty. Spotify declined to comment. The firm has been trying to settle a class action lawsuit brought by songwriters. That lawsuit, which deals with similar copyright issues, was on course to being resolved in December. However, a group that included Wixen objected to the terms of the roughly $43m settlement, which they argued could yield less than $4 per song. Can songwriters survive in the age of music streaming? In recent years, Spotify has struck deals with major record labels, resolving potential copyright liabilities. The deals have been an important new source of revenue for the music industry, which has contracted sharply over the last 15 years. In its newlawsuit,external, filed at the end of December in a federal court in California, Wixen said Spotify failed to also address the claims of songwriters and publishers, which have separate rights to the compositions. Wixen said: ""As a result Spotify has built a billion dollar business on the backs of songwriters and publishers whose music Spotify is using, in many cases without obtaining and paying for the necessary licenses."" Spotify reached a reported $30m settlement with the National Music Publishers Association in 2016 over similar claims. But the issue continues to trouble the firm, which is gearing up to list its shares on the stock market. In addition to the new Wixen dispute and the pending class-action suit, Spotify also faces legal action filed by Bob Gaudio and Bluewater Music Corporation in July. Other firms have also filed lawsuits. In the July cases, Spotify has argued that the claims were invalid and its use of the music was allowed under implied licenses, among other reasons.

YouTuber 'ashamed' of his dead man video,"This video can not be played How Logan and Jake Paul became social media superstars An American YouTube star says he does not expect to be forgiven after he posted a video which showed the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. The video showed Logan Paul and friends discovering the body in the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, known to be a frequent site of suicides. It prompted a barrage of criticism onlinewith some comments calling it ""disrespectful"" and ""disgusting"". Paul took down the video and later apologised saying he was ""misguided"". ""I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don't expect to be forgiven,"" he said ina video apology posted to Twitter,external. ""I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently, but I didn't"", he said. ""I'm ashamed of myself,"" he added. ""I'm disappointed in myself."" The video was uploaded on Sunday and had millions of views on YouTube before it was taken down. Logan Paul, a huge internet personality, has more than 15 million subscribers on the website and a loyal fanbase of mainly tweens and teenagers. Allow Twitter content?

Japan has one of the highest rates of suicide in the developed world and Aokigahara has a particularly tragic reputation as a destination for people wanting to take their own lives. 'Pure trash': Twitter disgust over corpse video Why does Japan have such a high suicide rate? Data on the number of suicides there each year is not made public, to avoid publicising the site. Signs are posted in the forest urging people to seek medical help rather than take their lives. The 15-minute video is part of a series of posts from Japan where the US vlogger is on a trip with friends. They go on a visit to the forest intending to focus on the ""haunted"" aspect of it, he says in the video. After walking a short distance into the forest, the group come across a body. Paul is visibly shocked by the discovery but also makes jokes. The group is filmed approaching the body, which is shown in several close-ups where only the face is blurred out. A member of the group is heard off camera saying he ""doesn't feel good"". Paul then asks him: ""What, you never stand next to a dead guy?"" He then laughs. The identity of the deceased man is not known. YouTube star PewDiePie uses racial slur The five ways YouTubers make money Online comments have widely accused Paul of acting inappropriately and being disrespectful. A petition calling for his entire channel to be removed from YouTube has more than 45,000 signatures. In Japan, the reaction has been similar with many saying they are disgusted and appalled by the stupidity of his actions. Although some have pointed out that Japanese media have in the past sent camera crews and TV personalities to supposedly ""haunted"" locations. One Twitter user said it was more important to talk about the high rates of suicide in Japan. ""Even if we try to sweep it under the rug, it doesn't change the fact that Japan is a nation prominent for suicides where 20,000 to 30,000 people commit suicide every year,"" wrote Namaikinanamako.

""The uphill battle just got a whole lot harder,"" he said in atweet that drew support,externalfrom close to 3,000 Twitter users. His tweets have stirred a Twitter debate amongmany Japanese users,external, who wrote: ""Logan Paul should know I had friends that died in Aokigahara, in that forest. He is mocking me, my country, and my culture!"" Some of Paul's supporters insisted he should be forgiven for what they said was a mistake, with one tweeting: ""You still are the best out there and always will be"" with the hashtag #Logan_you_are_forgiven. But in an apology posted on his Twitter page, Paul, of Westlake, Ohio, said: ""For my fans who are defending my actions - please don't. They do not deserve to be defended."" He also said he wanted to ""make a positive ripple on the internet, not cause a monsoon of negativity"", by raising awareness of suicide and suicide prevention.

North Korea to reopen hotline to South,"The hotline in the village of Panmunjom North Korea has reopened a hotline to South Korea, almost two years after it was disabled on the orders of leader Kim Jong-un. South Korea confirmed it had received a call from the North at 15:30 local time (06:30 GMT) on Wednesday. The North Korean leader had earlier said he was open to dialogue with Seoul and to sending a team to the Winter Olympics in the South next month. The two nations have not held high-level talks since December 2015. North Korea cut off the communications channel shortly afterwards, refusing to answer calls, according to officials in the South. A North Korean official announced the hotline's reopening in a televised statement. Instead of a senior newscaster, the chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, Ri Son-gwon, made the statement, saying he was speaking ""upon authorisation of Kim Jong-un"". The initial call was brief as checks are still being carried out on the line, according to South Korean officials. North Korea said the aim would be for the two nations to discuss the practical issues around sending a North Korean delegation to the Winter Games in Pyeongchang. What we know about the red and green phones Will North Korea compete at the Winter Olympics? A history of North Korea at the Olympics The press secretary for South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the restoration of this communications channel was ""very significant"". ""It creates an environment where communication will be possible at all times,"" he said. In the press, there was scepticism. ""Kim's New Year's address is a highly calculated move to fuel internal division in South Korea,"" said daily newspaper JoongAng Ilbo. ""Pyongyang may have decided on its peace offensive to buy time until the completion of its nuclear weapons programme."" Hankyoreh newspaper also voiced caution: ""Kim has not budged an inch from his previous reckless and hard-line stance on the development of nuclear weapons and missiles."" But the ""surprising New Year's address could open the door to peace"", it added. According to the South Korean Unification Ministry, there are a total of 33 direct lines that North and South Korea once used to communicate with each other. This particular phone line, established in 1971, is based in Panmunjom. The border village, in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ), is where the Koreas have historically held talks. This video can not be played Take a tour of Panmunjom In a New Year's Day speech, Mr Kim spoke of lowering tensionsand of melting ""frozen North-South relations"". He said attending the Games would be ""a good opportunity to show unity of the people"" in North Korea. South Korea had already indicated that the North's participation in the Games would be welcomed. Seoul offered high-level talks in response, with President Moon Jae-in calling it a ""groundbreaking chance"" to improve relations. It is not yet clear whether North Korea will accept that offer, but the opening of the hotline will allow for preliminary discussions to be held. North Korea cut off communications on the hotline in 2016, following a row over the Kaesong industrial complex. Kaesong was the last major point of co-operation between the Koreas The complex was a joint economic venture between the two Koreas, but the South suspended the project in response to a nuclear weapons test by the North. In China in late December, according to North Korean leadership specialist Michael Madden. A North Korean vice-minister of athletics was sent to interact with his South Korean counterparts, who may or may not have been acting on President Moon's instructions, he says, adding that this might ease the higher-level talks. North Korea has come under increasing international pressure in the past year over its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea crisis in 300 words President Moon said the North's continuing tests would be the backdrop to any new discussions about the Olympics. At the same time as offering an apparent olive branch to the South, Mr Kim used his speech to repeat threats against the US, saying a nuclear launch button was always on his table. US state department spokesman Heather Nauert said that Mr Kim's latest move ""may be trying to drive a wedge of some sort between the two nations - between our nation and the Republic of Korea [South Korea]"". Washington has encouraged all countries to isolate North Korea. The South says it has discussed its latest steps with the US. Trump to Kim: My button's bigger than yours Does Donald Trump have a nuclear button? When Trump was handed the nuclear codes How would the US order a nuclear strike? Meanwhile, Mr Trump remains outspoken in his tweets. On Tuesday night,the US president boasted that his nuclear button was ""much bigger""and ""more powerful"" than the North Korean leader's.

Chef said she 'spiked' vegan mealTrading Standards said it is investigating following the Facebook post made by chef Laura Goodman.10h10 hours agoShropshire,"Mike Gayle and Laura Goodman co-own Italian restaurant Carlini in Albrighton, Shropshire An ""ill-judged"" Facebook comment in which a chef said she had ""spiked"" a diner's vegan meal has provoked an angry response from those fearing meat or other non-vegan food had been added. Shropshire Council said it was investigating complaints about Carlini in Albrighton, Shropshire. The restaurant denied anything untoward had been included in the food. Michael Gale, who co-owns the venue said ""spiked"" was ""poorly chosen"" language. Mr Gale, said his fiancÃ©e, Laura Goodman, had not ""fully realised the consequence of what it meant"". The year veganism went mainstream Midlands Live: Flood alerts issued as at least one person injured by fallen tree during storms Ms Goodman, also a co-owner of the restaurant, made the comments in a Facebook group called ""The Boring Group"" in the early hours of Saturday morning. The post initially mentioned a ""pious, judgemental vegan"", before Ms Goodman later wrote ""spiked a vegan a few hours ago"". The comments have since been removed. People responded to the post telling her that it was ""mean"" and ""disgusting and unacceptable"". Since the post was shared on social media, people have left angry reviews on Google causing the Italian restaurant in Albrighton, which has another branch in Shifnal, Shropshire, to be rated as one-star. Mr Gale added: ""In no way does this excuse the comment and we totally understand the anger it has subsequently caused. No meat was used in any of the dishes.""

Dozens killed in Peru coach cliff plunge,"This video can not be played Peru Pasamayo: Bus plunges off cliff At least 48 people have been killed after a coach plummeted 100m (330ft) down a cliff and landed upside down on a beach in Peru, officials say. The health ministry said six people had survived the accident, one of whom had jumped from the bus before it fell. The accident happened on a notorious stretch of road known as Curva del Diablo (devil's bend) in Pasamayo, north of the capital Lima. The coach, with more than 50 people on board, collided with a lorry. Transit police said the lorry driver had been detained for questioning. The bus, which belongs to the San MartÃ­n de Porres transport company, was travelling to Lima from Huacho, about 130km (80 miles) north of the capital. The stretch of road winding alongside the Pacific Ocean where the accident happened is considered one of the most dangerous in Peru. It has no barriers separating it from a sheer drop to the ocean and the sea spray and frequent fog can make it particularly slippery. The bus company that said its driver was very experienced and was travelling with an assistant. The company also said that the bus had passed a mechanical check before leaving Huacho. Footage showed rescue workers struggling to reach the bus, with a helicopter winching down some emergency workers while others were lowered down the cliff with ropes. The coach fell 100m down a cliff after colliding with a truck Rescue workers were lowered onto the beach by helicopters The coach landed on its roof Five people have been pulled from the wreckage alive - a sixth managed to jump out of a window Rescue work had to be halted overnight as the tide rose and engulfed parts of the coach. A Peruvian navy boat helped get the rescuers off the beach. Local media reported that one of the passengers managed to survive by jumping out of the coach before it plunged down the cliff. The doctor in the hospital where 24-year-old MÃ¡ximo JimÃ©nez Vilcayaure was being treated for a broken arm said the man had jumped out of a window with seconds to spare. Five other survivors were pulled from the wreckage and are being treated for multiple fractures. Twenty-four bodies have so far been recovered. Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said it was ""painful for the whole country to suffer an accident of this magnitude"". He sent a message of ""deep solidarity"" to the families of the victims.

Triple killer admits murdering ex-partnerTheodore Johnson already had convictions for killing two women he had been in relationships with.11h11 hours agoLondon,"Theodore Johnson beat Angela Best with a claw hammer and throttled her with a dressing gown cord A man who already had convictions for killing his wife and a former partner has pleaded guilty to murdering his ex-girlfriend. Theodore Johnson, 64, beat Angela Best with a claw hammer and throttled her with a dressing gown cord after she met another man, the Old Bailey heard. Johnson has two previous manslaughter convictions, for pushing his wife over a balcony in 1981 and strangling a partner in 1993. He will be sentenced on Friday. After attacking Ms Best, 51, at his Islington home on 15 December 2016, the garage worker threw himself in front of an express train. He survived but severed his right arm and left hand. Police only discovered Ms Best's body when they called at Johnson's north London flat to find his next of kin after the incident at Cheshunt railway station. The defendant, who now uses a wheelchair, pleaded guilty to murdering mother-of-four and grandmother Ms Best on the first day of his trial. Johnson's long-term relationship with Ms Best ended in 2016 when she met someone else. A post-mortem examination established her cause of death to be neck compression by strangulation with a ligature and blunt force trauma to the head. Johnson uses a wheelchair as a result of the injuries he sustained when trying to kill himself In 1981, Johnson was jailed for three years after he was found guilty of wife Yvonne Johnson's manslaughter. He hit her over the head with a vase during a row before pushing her over the balcony of their ninth-floor flat in Wolverhampton. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter, on the grounds of diminished responsibility, after attacking former partner Yvonne Bennett. He was sent to a secure hospital indefinitely after killing her while their baby daughter slept nearby. The couple, who had been living in Finsbury Park in north London, had recently separated after Ms Bennett had an affair. When she rejected a box of chocolates Johnson bought, he strangled her with a belt. Johnson phoned police to confess, tried to hang himself from a tree and then gave himself up, prosecutors said at the time. Doctors agreed he had been suffering from a depressive illness. Johnson met Ms Best after he was released from a psychiatric unit in the mid-1990s. She and her children had moved from Manchester to Tottenham, north London. Ms Best's two sisters were in court as Johnson entered his guilty plea. Speaking after the guilty plea, Det Sgt Danny Yeoman from the Met Police said: ""This was a vicious attack and I hope the conviction gives Angela's family some measure of comfort and closure."" The murder of Ms Best has raised questions about how Johnson was able to kill for a second and third time. Suzanne Jacob has questioned how it was possible that Johnson was able to kill three times The chief executive of domestic abuse charity Safe Lives, Suzanne Jacob, said she feared not enough information had been shared between police and mental health services to determine what kind of risk Johnson posed. ""Our hearts go out to Angela's family but also the families of the other two women,"" she said. ""After two such serious convictions, how was it possible that this was allowed to happen again? ""Multiple agencies are going to have to look at what they did and didn't do."" Assistant Chief Constable Jacqueline Sebire of Bedfordshire Police voiced the same concern. Shewrote on Twitter,external: ""We must look at ways to improve risk assessment and information sharing."" More than 100 women were killed last year by partners or ex-partners, according to Safe Lives.

Chef said she 'spiked' vegan mealTrading Standards said it is investigating following the Facebook post made by chef Laura Goodman.7h7 hours agoShropshire,"Mike Gayle and Laura Goodman co-own Italian restaurant Carlini in Albrighton, Shropshire An ""ill-judged"" Facebook comment in which a chef said she had ""spiked"" a diner's vegan meal has provoked an angry response from those fearing meat or other non-vegan food had been added. Shropshire Council said it was investigating complaints about Carlini in Albrighton, Shropshire. The restaurant denied anything untoward had been included in the food. Michael Gale, who co-owns the venue said ""spiked"" was ""poorly chosen"" language. Mr Gale, said his fiancÃ©e, Laura Goodman, had not ""fully realised the consequence of what it meant"". The year veganism went mainstream Midlands Live: Flood alerts issued as at least one person injured by fallen tree during storms Ms Goodman, also a co-owner of the restaurant, made the comments in a Facebook group called ""The Boring Group"" in the early hours of Saturday morning. The post initially mentioned a ""pious, judgemental vegan"", before Ms Goodman later wrote ""spiked a vegan a few hours ago"". The comments have since been removed. People responded to the post telling her that it was ""mean"" and ""disgusting and unacceptable"". Since the post was shared on social media, people have left angry reviews on Google causing the Italian restaurant in Albrighton, which has another branch in Shifnal, Shropshire, to be rated as one-star. Mr Gale added: ""In no way does this excuse the comment and we totally understand the anger it has subsequently caused. No meat was used in any of the dishes."" A spokesperson for the Food Standards Agency said: ""People should be confident about the food they buy and be able to choose according to their particular requirements, whether for diet and health or for personal taste and preference reasons.

Trump threatens stop to Palestinian aid,"Mr Trump's comments suggest he is planning to pull Palestinian aid funding The US may stop aid payments to Palestinians who are ""no longer willing to talk peace"", President Trump said. On Twitter, Mr Trump said the United States received ""no appreciation or respect"" in return for its aid. He also said his controversial recognition of the contested city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital took the hugely divisive issue ""off the table"" for new peace talks. Palestinians had said the move showed the US could not be a neutral broker. Soon after Washington's decision was announced in December,Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not accept any US peace plan for the Middle East. The decision on Jerusalem was also overwhelmingly condemned at the United Nations, where 128 countries voted against Mr Trump's fulfilment of a campaign promise. The US president was following up earlier comments about aid payments to Pakistan, in which he said the US had received only ""lies and deceit"" in exchange for billions of dollars in aid.

NHS patients facing delays for operations,"Tens of thousands of non-urgent NHS operations and procedures in England may be deferred until 31 January, due to winter pressures. Officials also told hospitals to delay routine outpatient appointments to concentrate on emergency care. Separately, a doctor apologised on Twitter for ""third world conditions"" in the hospital where he works in Stoke. NHS England's acute care director said hospitals were being given the ""time and space"" to manage January pressures. Officials reiterated that cancer operations and time-critical procedures should go ahead as planned. The advice comes as Milton Keynes University Hospital is telling people only to attend for emergency treatment. BBC reporter Dominic Johnson said Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre is asking patients to avoid its emergency department as it is on black alert, after seeing 140 patients at its peak on Tuesday evening. He adds 80-100 patients is considered ""very busy"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two ambulance trusts in England, east and north-east, say they are on the highest alert. NHS England's National Emergency Pressures Panel, which met on Tuesday, said it had extended the deadline for deferral of all non-urgent inpatient elective care - such as hip or knee replacements - to 31 January, to free up capacity for the sickest of patients. NHS England also gave hospitals the green light to put patients in mixed sex wards. Director of acute care Professor Keith Willett said that the delay of non-urgent operations was not a crisis, and added the NHS in England was reacting to concerns from doctors and nurses over a rise in flu incidents, as well as predicted cold weather. He said: ""With the incidents of flu rising in the community and in our hospitals, and the pressures that we always see in the first few weeks of January... that it's important we give the hospitals time and space to manage the demand that we anticipate will come through."" Each year the service comes under increased pressure in the winter, largely as a result of an increase in certain illnesses over this period, such as flu. It is too early to judge how bad this year's pressures are compared with previous years. The NHS does release regular statistics, but these are not real-time - meaning there is always a lag of a week or two to learn the full picture. NHS Tracker: Check key targets in your area Winter pressure health campaign launched NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter Milton Keynes University Hospital said it was facing pressure as a result of ""very high numbers of patients seeking emergency medical care"". It said the hospital had opened an ""unprecedented number of escalation [extra] beds"" in order to provide care for acutely unwell patients and warned that patients attending its emergency department would be treated in order of clinical priority. The hospital's chief executive, Prof Joe Harrison, said: ""We are seeing very high numbers of very sick patients in the emergency department and fewer patients being able to be discharged - many because they also remain in need of acute care. ""I would urge people to avoid the hospital's emergency department unless it is a genuine emergency. ""Staff are working under incredible pressure to look after the patients in our care. I cannot overstate that. We are doing our best in extraordinarily difficult circumstances."" BBC News health editor Hugh Pym The NHS is always under great pressure in the New Year - with some patients holding off over the festive season before going into A&E. Hospitals have planned intensively for the higher anticipated demand over winter. But the service seems under even more strain than previous years. The fact that NHS England has felt the need to call for further restrictions on non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments underlines concerns at the highest level. It has decided to give the green light to hospitals to put patients in mixed sex wards if they have to. NHS England notes a higher number of flu cases and can only hope that its own warnings about a flu outbreak don't materialise. Meanwhile, Dr Richard Fawcett, whose Twitter profile lists him as a consultant at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, apologised via Twitter for ""third world conditions"" in his hospital department.

The hospital trust responded by saying it had been under ""severe and sustained pressure over the Christmas period"" and this had ""continued into the new year"". The trust's medical director, Dr John Oxtoby, added: ""Our staff want the very best for our patients and at times they find the situation frustrating, which can be reflected on social media. ""However, we are a leading trauma, stroke and cardiac centre and have been regularly praised by external independent commentators for the quality of compassionate care provided at our hospitals despite all our pressures."" Ambulance services in the north-east and east of England said they had reached their highest operational alert level - number four. The North East Ambulance Service said it had been hit by ""unprecedented levels of demand"" over the Christmas and new year period. It said it was ""asking some patients, where appropriate, if they have alternative transport options, such as a family member"". Between 23 December and 1 January, it took more than 40,000 NHS 111 calls and more than 16,000 999 calls - compared to around 28,000 NHS 111 calls and 15,000 999 calls in the same period last year. It advised members of the public to consult a GP, pharmacist, local walk-in centre or to call NHS 111 if they did not require emergency care. A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said it had been at level three since Friday. A spokesman added: ""We are experiencing a high call demand, but that is not unusual at this time of year."" A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said Northern Ireland used a different system. There are four major hospitals served by the ambulance service and GP and 999 calls are being redirected away from the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, County Down to the other three major hospitals, which are currently operating normally.

AI could save heart and cancer patientsThe systems will save billions of pounds by enabling the diseases to be picked up much earlier.6h6 hours agoHealth,"Sir John Bell believes that artificial intelligence can save the NHS Researchers at an Oxford hospital have developed artificial intelligence (AI) that can diagnose scans for heart disease and lung cancer. The systems will save billions of pounds by enabling the diseases to be picked up much earlier. The heart disease technology will start to be available to NHS hospitals for free this summer. The government's healthcare tsar, Sir John Bell, has told BBC News that AI could ""save the NHS"". ""There is about Â£2.2bn spent on pathology services in the NHS. You may be able to reduce that by 50%. AI may be the thing that saves the NHS,"" he said. Currently cardiologists can tell from the timing of the heartbeat in scans if there is a problem. But even the best doctors get it wrong in one in five cases. Patients are either sent home and have a heart attack or they undergo an unnecessary operation. An artificial intelligence system developed at the John Radcliffe Hospital diagnoses heart scans much more accurately. It can pick up details in the scans that doctors can't see. It then gives a recommendation - positive - which means that it believes that there is a risk of the patient having a heart attack The system has been tested in clinical trials in six cardiology units. The results are due to be published this year in a peer-reviewed journal after they have been checked by experts, but Prof Paul Leeson, a cardiologist who developed the system, says that the data indicates that the system has greatly outperformed his fellow heart specialists. If confirmed, it will be available for free to NHS hospitals across the country. ""As cardiologists, we accept that we don't always get it right at the moment. But now there is a possibility that way may be able to do better."" The results from the clinical trials indicate that the system can do a lot better than consultants. There are 60,000 heart scans carried out each year and 12,000 of these are misdiagnosed. This is estimated to cost the NHS Â£600m in unnecessary operations and the treatment of people who had heart attacks following an all-clear scan. The AI system assesses the risk of heart disease and makes clinical recommendations The trial results suggest that the AI system could save the NHS more than Â£300m a year. The system, called Ultromics, was trained to identify potential problems by being fed the scans of 1,000 patients who Prof Leeson had treated over the past seven years, along with information about whether they went on to have heart problems. The lung cancer system can give very early warning of the disease. Another AI system is looking for signs of lung cancer. It searches for large clumps of cells called nodules. Doctors can't tell whether these clumps are harmless or will go on to become cancerous and so patients go on to have several more scans to see how the nodules develop. However, clinical trials have shown that this AI system can rule out the harmless cases - saving the NHS money and patients several months of anxiety. And it can also diagnose lung cancer much earlier. The system is also being commercialised by a start-up company called Optellum. Its chief science and technology officer, Dr Timor Kadir, says the resources freed up by the system could be redirected to early lung cancer screening, which would allow more than 4,000 cancer patients a year to be diagnosed much earlier and so have a greater chance of survival. ""Rather than focus on cost savings, within a resource-constrained system such as the NHS, we're really looking at how to offer better healthcare to more people for the same proportion of GDP. This is the potential of AI in the UK."" Dr Kadir estimates that the lung cancer diagnosis system could save Â£10bn if it was adopted in the US and the European Union.

""I've seen one coronation, and been the recipient in the other, which is pretty remarkable,"" she says. Queen Elizabeth II with Prince Philip after her coronation in 1953 The Queen ascended to the throne at the age of 25. The glittering ceremony caught the imagination of a nation still in the grip of post-war austerity. The film hears from others who took part, including a 12-year-old choirboy who found himself singing solo when when his colleagues - overwhelmed by the occasion - lost their voices. Does The Crown cost more than the Queen? Terror attack cities praised by Queen Coronation mementos on display The documentary also tells the story of the Crown Jewels that are associated with the ceremony, including the orb, sceptres, sword, spurs and ring. The BBC's director of content, Charlotte Moore, said: ""It is a real honour to have Her Majesty the Queen revealing her intimate knowledge of the Crown Jewels - and fond childhood memories from when her father was crowned King George VI in this very special film for BBC One. ""In her own words, the Queen will bring to life the enduring symbolic importance of the coronation ceremonies for modern audiences to enjoy."" Princess Elizabeth, then 11, with her mother following the coronation of King George VI in 1937 The main elements of the occasion have remained largely unchanged for a millennium. The coronation is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with regalia, and crowned with the St Edward's Crown - made of gold and decorated with precious and semi-precious stones. The best-known item, the Imperial State Crown, is worn at the end of the coronation service and at the State Opening of Parliament.

Chef said she 'spiked' vegan mealTrading Standards said it is investigating following the Facebook post made by chef Laura Goodman.3h3 hours agoShropshire,"Mike Gayle and Laura Goodman co-own Italian restaurant Carlini in Albrighton, Shropshire An ""ill-judged"" Facebook comment in which a chef said she had ""spiked"" a diner's vegan meal has provoked an angry response from those fearing meat or other non-vegan food had been added. Shropshire Council said it was investigating complaints about Carlini in Albrighton, Shropshire. The restaurant denied anything untoward had been included in the food. Michael Gale, who co-owns the venue said ""spiked"" was ""poorly chosen"" language. Mr Gale, said his fiancÃ©e, Laura Goodman, had not ""fully realised the consequence of what it meant"". The year veganism went mainstream Midlands Live: Flood alerts issued as at least one person injured by fallen tree during storms Ms Goodman, also a co-owner of the restaurant, made the comments in a Facebook group called ""The Boring Group"" in the early hours of Saturday morning. The post initially mentioned a ""pious, judgemental vegan"", before Ms Goodman later wrote ""spiked a vegan a few hours ago"". The comments have since been removed. People responded to the post telling her that it was ""mean"" and ""disgusting and unacceptable"". Since the post was shared on social media, people have left angry reviews on Google causing the Italian restaurant in Albrighton, which has another branch in Shifnal, Shropshire, to be rated as one-star. Mr Gale added: ""In no way does this excuse the comment and we totally understand the anger it has subsequently caused. No meat was used in any of the dishes."" A spokesperson for the Food Standards Agency said: ""People should be confident about the food they buy and be able to choose according to their particular requirements, whether for diet and health or for personal taste and preference reasons.

Dating website's 'scientific' match ad bannedThe claim from eHarmony has been called 'misleading' by the Advertising Standards Authority.4m5 minutes agoUK,"A dating website's claim that it used a ""scientifically proven matching system"" to pair up those looking for love, has been banned. An advert for eHarmony on the London Underground in July read: ""It's time science had a go at love."" The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) called the claim ""misleading"". The online matchmaker said while it ""respectfully disagrees"" with the ruling, it will make its advertising ""as clear as possible"". The website was unable to offer the ASA any evidence that customers had a greater chance of finding love, despite claiming that its ""scientifically proven matching system decodes the mystery of compatibility and chemistry"". ""Imagine being able to stack the odds of finding lasting love entirely in your favour,"" the advert read. The initial complaint was lodged by Lord Lipsey, the joint chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Statistics and a former member of the ASA council. He said the phrase 'scientifically proven' should only be used in claims that are ""just that"" and not ""crude puffery designed to lure in those longing for love"". ""This is a new form of fake news which the ASA has rightly slapped down,"" he added. But the website said it matched singles using ""sophisticated matching standards designed by PhD psychologists"". 'Irresponsible' advert featuring parkour runner banned Ikea apologises for 'sexist' China advert What are online dating sites doing to keep us safe? It uses an algorithm which requires users to complete questionnaires to determine their personality traits, values and interests. The service, which claims to be known as ""the brains behind the butterflies"", matches users to those whose responses complemented their own preferences. The algorithm is data driven; using statistical models made from the information of more than 50,000 married couples. Romain Bertrand, managing director at eHarmony UK, said the service was conceived on the premise that ""science and research could be harnessed to help people find love"". The company believed consumers would understand its advert to mean that its scientific approach could potentially work for them - not that it would guarantee love. But the ASA concluded that consumers would interpret the claim ""scientifically proven matching system"" to mean that scientific studies had found that the website offered users a significantly greater chance of finding lasting love than what could be achieved if they did not use the service.

Scotland braces for Eleanor's arrival,"Strong winds may coincide with high tide Residents of coastal towns in south-west Scotland have been warned of the danger of flooding. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said it was particularly concerned about communities around the Solway Firth. It said the danger was posed by high tide - at around midnight - combined with strong winds. Sepa has issuedflood warnings,externaland said the risk would last until Wednesday afternoon. Duty hydrology manager Vincent Fitzsimons said: ""The peak of the flooding is expected around high-tide midnight tonight, and then again early afternoon on Wednesday. ""The key concern is for a cluster of communities between the Isle of Whithorn and Kirkcudbright. ""In these areas we are expecting coastal flooding of properties, roads and other infrastructure."" Other areas being monitored by Sepa include Ayrshire and Arran, the Moray Firth and areas around the inner Firth of Forth. The Met Office forecasters has raised the level of its weather warning concerning the hazard posed by Storm Eleanor. The areas most affected, including those close to the Solway coast, are now subject to an amber warning. It said: ""Along west-facing coasts, injuries and danger to life is likely from large waves and beach material being thrown onto coastal roads, seafronts and properties."" Sepa issued a map highlighting the areas at risk Storm Eleanor comes just days after Storm Dylan, which was at its height on Hogmanay. The Met Office said: ""Storm Eleanor continues to develop and will move eastwards during Tuesday evening and there is now increased confidence of a spell of very strong winds affecting southern counties of Northern Ireland, which will then move eastwards across parts of southern Scotland and northern England overnight before clearing into the North Sea early on Wednesday morning. ""Gusts of 70 mph are likely quite widely, and 80-90 mph gusts are possible along exposed Irish Sea coasts.""

YouTuber 'ashamed' by his dead man video,"This video can not be played How Logan and Jake Paul became social media superstars An American YouTube star says he does not expect to be forgiven after he posted a video which showed the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. The video showed Logan Paul and friends discovering the body in the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, known to be a frequent site of suicides. It prompted a barrage of criticism onlinewith some comments calling it ""disrespectful"" and ""disgusting"". Paul took down the video and later apologised saying he was ""misguided"". ""I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don't expect to be forgiven,"" he said ina video apology posted to Twitter,external. ""I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently, but I didn't"", he said. ""I'm ashamed of myself,"" he added. ""I'm disappointed in myself."" The video was uploaded on Sunday and had millions of views on YouTube before it was taken down. Logan Paul, a huge internet personality, has more than 15 million subscribers on the website and a loyal fanbase of mainly tweens and teenagers. Allow Twitter content?

Japan has one of the highest rates of suicide in the developed world and Aokigahara has a particularly tragic reputation as a destination for people wanting to take their own lives. 'Pure trash': Twitter disgust over corpse video Why does Japan have such a high suicide rate? Data on the number of suicides there each year is not made public, to avoid publicising the site. Signs are posted in the forest urging people to seek medical help rather than take their lives. The 15-minute video is part of a series of posts from Japan where the US vlogger is on a trip with friends. They go on a visit to the forest intending to focus on the ""haunted"" aspect of it, he says in the video. After walking a short distance into the forest, the group come across a body. Paul is visibly shocked by the discovery but also makes jokes. The group is filmed approaching the body, which is shown in several close-ups where only the face is blurred out. A member of the group is heard off camera saying he ""doesn't feel good"". Paul then asks him: ""What, you never stand next to a dead guy?"" He then laughs. The identity of the deceased man is not known. YouTube star PewDiePie uses racial slur The five ways YouTubers make money Online comments have widely accused Paul of acting inappropriately and being disrespectful. A petition calling for his entire channel to be removed from YouTube has more than 45,000 signatures. In Japan, the reaction has been similar with many saying they are disgusted and appalled by the stupidity of his actions. Although some have pointed out that Japanese media have in the past sent camera crews and TV personalities to supposedly ""haunted"" locations. One Twitter user said it was more important to talk about the high rates of suicide in Japan. ""Even if we try to sweep it under the rug, it doesn't change the fact that Japan is a nation prominent for suicides where 20,000 to 30,000 people commit suicide every year,"" wrote Namaikinanamako.

Some of Paul's supporters insisted he should be forgiven for what they said was a mistake, with one tweeting: ""You still are the best out there and always will be"" with the hashtag #Logan_you_are_forgiven. But in an apology posted on his Twitter page, Paul, of Westlake, Ohio, said: ""For my fans who are defending my actions - please don't. They do not deserve to be defended.""

Many killed in Peru coach cliff plunge,"This video can not be played Peru Pasamayo: Bus plunges off cliff At least 48 people have been killed after a coach plummeted 100m (330ft) down a cliff and landed upside down on a beach in Peru, officials say. The health ministry said six people had survived the accident, one of whom had jumped from the bus before it fell. The accident happened on a notorious stretch of road known as Curva del Diablo (devil's bend) in Pasamayo, north of the capital Lima. The coach, with more than 50 people on board, collided with a lorry. Transit police said the lorry driver had been detained for questioning. The bus, which belongs to the San MartÃ­n de Porres transport company, was travelling to Lima from Huacho, about 130km (80 miles) north of the capital. The stretch of road winding alongside the Pacific Ocean where the accident happened is considered one of the most dangerous in Peru. It has no barriers separating it from a sheer drop to the ocean and the sea spray and frequent fog can make it particularly slippery. The bus company that said its driver was very experienced and was travelling with an assistant. The company also said that the bus had passed a mechanical check before leaving Huacho. Footage showed rescue workers struggling to reach the bus, with a helicopter winching down some emergency workers while others were lowered down the cliff with ropes. The coach fell 100m down a cliff after colliding with a truck Rescue workers were lowered onto the beach by helicopters The coach landed on its roof Five people have been pulled from the wreckage alive - a sixth managed to jump out of a window Rescue work had to be halted overnight as the tide rose and engulfed parts of the coach. A Peruvian navy boat helped get the rescuers off the beach. Local media reported that one of the passengers managed to survive by jumping out of the coach before it plunged down the cliff. The doctor in the hospital where 24-year-old MÃ¡ximo JimÃ©nez Vilcayaure was being treated for a broken arm said the man had jumped out of a window with seconds to spare. Five other survivors were pulled from the wreckage and are being treated for multiple fractures. Twenty-four bodies have so far been recovered. Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said it was ""painful for the whole country to suffer an accident of this magnitude"". He sent a message of ""deep solidarity"" to the families of the victims.
