Pair guilty over takeaway allergy death,"Megan Lee died two days after she was admitted to Royal Blackburn Hospital Two men have been found guilty of the manslaughter of a 15-year-old girl who suffered an allergic reaction to a takeaway meal. Megan Leedied after eating food containing peanutsfrom the Royal Spice takeaway in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire. Owner Mohammed Abdul Kuddus, 40, and Harun Rashid, 38, denied manslaughter by gross negligence. After the verdicts, Megan's father Adam warned takeaway owners: ""Do not play Russian roulette with precious lives."" Manchester Crown Court previously heard the teenager suffered an acute asthma attack after eating food from the takeaway on 30 December 2016, which her friend had ordered with a note reading ""prawns, nuts"" to show her allergies. She died two days later having suffered irreversible brain damage. Harun Rashid (left) and Mohammed Kuddus will be sentenced on 7 November Judge Mrs Justice Yip released Kuddus and Rashid on bail to return for sentencing on 7 November. The judge said: ""The fact that I am granting bail should not be taken as an indication that there will be a non-custodial sentence. ""You need to prepare yourselves for a custodial sentence but I am allowing you to go home for now."" During the trial Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, described Megan's death as a ""disaster waiting to happen"" because of a ""litany of failings"" in the kitchen, including poor hygiene and no records of ingredients kept. Royal Spice takeaway was closed down following the death but later reopened under new ownership The meal, which included an onion bhaji, a seekh kebab and a Peshwari naan, was later found to have the ""widespread presence"" of peanut protein. Following her death a police inquiry was launched and on 6 January the restaurant was immediately closed down by Trading Standards and environmental hygiene officers. It later reopened under new management. The eight men and four women on the jury took about six hours of deliberations to reach their verdicts. Members of Megan's family were in tears in the public gallery as the two men were found guilty. In a statement read outside court, her parents Adam and Gemma Lee said: ""Our lives will never be the same. The loss of our beautiful daughter has completely devastated us. ""Megan's positive presence and infectious smile will forever be missed. ""It breaks our hearts that Megan didn't get the chance to sit her GCSE exams, something she had worked so incredibly hard for, to celebrate her 16th birthday or go to the school prom with her friends. ""Megan didn't get the opportunity to fulfil her ambition of working in musical theatre, to explore the world, fall in love or have children of her own. ""It's these thoughts that cause great sadness, because nobody deserved it more than Megan."" Rashid, of Rudd Street, Haslingden, who had claimed he was merely a delivery driver at the restaurant at the time, was also found guilty of failing to discharge a general duty of employers, contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act, and another count of failing to put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure or procedures in contravention of European Union food safety regulations. Kuddus, of Belper Street, Blackburn, had already pleaded guilty to those two charges on behalf of himself and Royal Spice Takeaway Ltd. The men made no comment as they were approached by media while leaving court. Det Ch Insp Mark Vaughton of Lancashire Police, said there had been a ""casual disregard for customer safety"" that was ""blatant and widespread"" at the takeaway. He added: ""This was a tragedy waiting to happen, and one to which these defendants had given little or no thought. ""Tragic as the circumstances are, they are circumstances that could have been prevented. The working practices in the Royal Spice takeaway were such that it was only a matter of time. ""I can only imagine how difficult it has been for Megan's parents, brother, family and friends. My thoughts are with them and will continue to be."" Lancashire County Council deputy leader Albert Atkinson said: ""I would like this to be a warning to all food businesses to make sure they do everything in their power to get food safety right.""

Osborne 'ignored child poverty warning',"George Osborne stuck with a public sector pay cap, despite being warned by civil servants it could trap some children in poverty, it has emerged. The former chancellor limited pay rises to 1% a year until 2019, in his 2015 Budget statement. Internal documents seen by the BBC reveal he was told the move would hit low income families. Mr Osborne said the National Living Wage - introduced in the same Budget - boosted the income of the lowest paid. Hammond urged to 'stump up cash' in Budget 'Don't ignore the children', government urged 'Biggest pay rise in decade for 1m workers' The Treasury has released advice given by officials to ministers in 2015 after a request under the Freedom of Information Act by the GMB trade union. The analysis, seen by the BBC, spells out bluntly the predicted consequences of a squeeze on public sector pay. The document says protections for the lowest paid would help reduce the impact - but the plan would amount to a real-terms pay cut for many. ""Public sector workers' take home pay is not likely to keep pace with inflation,"" it says, adding ""this could increase financial pressure on families of public sector workers, which may have a negative impact on family relationships."" The document concludes: ""This policy will make it more difficult for low income families with children to access essential goods, and will therefore make it harder for the government to hit the Child Poverty Act targets."" Despite this warning, the then Chancellor George Osborneannounced a fresh clampdown on public sector pay,externalin his first Conservative Budget, after five years of coalition. Mr Osborne did thoughannounce what he called a ""National Living Wage"", starting at Â£7.20 and rising to Â£9 an hour by 2020,  to replace the Â£6.50 minimum wage, in the same Budget. Mr Osborne's civil servants told him this ""could mitigate"" the impact of the wage squeeze for some. ""This damning document is a mark of shame on ministers who imposed years of real-term pay cuts on our members in the full knowledge that it would condemn families and children to poverty,"" Rehana Azam, the GMB National Secretary said. George Osborne told the BBC: ""We know from the financial crisis that low income families suffer most when countries lose control of their public spending. ""The Treasury advice was clear that introducing the Living Wage would help protect the low paid from necessary savings in public spending. ""Official data on wages over the last couple of years shows clearly that the protection worked and the wages of the lowest paid have risen fastest."" The internal advice released under FOI points out that while the public sector workforce has many characteristics that are very similar to the workforce as a whole, ""there are a higher proportion of female workers than across the whole economy"" and ""a slightly higher proportion of disabled people than the working population"". When he delivered his 2015 Budget to the Commons,Mr Osborne told MPs:,external""There is a simple trade-off between pay and jobs in many public services. ""I know there has already been a period of restraint, but we said last autumn that we would need to find commensurate savings in this Parliament. ""So to ensure we have public services we can afford, and protect more jobs, we will continue recent public sector pay awards with a rise of 1% per year for the next four years."" In March of this year, when the UK eliminated the deficit on its day-to-day budget, the target originally set by Mr Osborne when he imposed cuts on public services in 2010,he tweeted,external: ""We got there in the end - a remarkable national effort."" By then, though, government policy had already begun to switch focus. In the aftermath of the 2017 general election, when the Conservatives lost their Commons majority and Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party performed better than many had expected, there was much talk of the impact of austerity on voters' choices. One of those raising the issue was MP Gavin Barwell, who lost his seat and was one of a number of Conservatives who concluded Labour had ""tapped into"" concerns about the impact of years of public sector pay restraint. Days after the Conservatives' disastrous general election result, Mr Barwell was appointed Prime Minister Theresa May's chief of staff. Not long after, Mr Osborne's public sector pay cap was dropped.

Mexico makes offer to caravan migrants,"A number of children are travelling with the migrant caravan Mexico has offered temporary work permits to migrants who register for asylum, as a big caravan of Central American migrants makes its way through the country toward the US. The plan also envisages temporary ID cards, medical care and schooling. But to qualify, migrants must remain in Mexico's southern Chiapas and Oaxaca states. The US has warned that about 800 troops may be sent to the US-Mexico borderto stop the migrant caravan. ""I am bringing out the military for this National Emergency,"" US President Donald Trump tweeted earlier this week. ""They [the migrants] will be stopped!"" The president also threatened to cut aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. The mid-term elections are less than two weeks away and critics say Mr Trump has used the threat of illegal immigration to fire up his supporters. However, the caravan, which set off from Honduras several weeks ago, is still more than 1,000 miles away from Mexico's northern border with the US. What is the migrant caravan heading to US? Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' Fake news follows migrant caravan The scheme, announced by President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, covers Central Americans who have officially asked for refugee status in Mexico or are planning to do so in the near future. It is called EstÃ¡s en Tu Casa (""You're in Your Home"" in Spanish). Many from the migrant caravan are forced to sleep rough during their journey ""Today, Mexico extends you its hand,"" President PeÃ±a Nieto said. But he added: ""This plan is only for those who comply with Mexican laws, and it's a first step towards a permanent solution for those who are granted refugee status in Mexico."" The plan envisages: Temporary ID cards and work permits Medical care Schooling for migrants' children Housing in local hostels But President PeÃ±a Nieto failed to explain what would happen to the migrants if they chose to carry on regardless. The Mexican authorities are coming under increasing pressure from the Trump administration to find a solution to this caravan, reports the BBC's Central America correspondent Will Grant in the town of Arriaga, Chiapas. The authorities are trying to tread a balance between placating the US and giving a green light to travel to potential future caravans, our correspondent adds. The caravan is presently in Arriaga. Most migrants said they had no intention of abandoning their plans to head to the US. ""The majority plan to cross the border. And that's my intention, too,"" JosÃ© Santos, from Honduras, told the BBC. ""Because, yes, while life here is calmer than at home, it's still not like the US where it would get better. That's the goal: to have a better life."" Meanwhile, Anna Lisset VelÃ¡zquez, also from Honduras, told the BBC: ""It's a kind offer - but it's not the plan that we have, to stay here halfway up."" However, another migrant described Mr PeÃ±a Nieto's proposal as a decent ""plan B"". ""Because we can't go back to Honduras. So as a second choice, we'd be better off here,"" Greville Juan Villanova said. A spokesman for the United Nations said more than 7,000 people had joined the migrant caravan as of 22 October, citing estimates from the International Organization for Migration. But the group has split up, which makes it difficult to determine the exact number. The migrants say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. On Thursday, Mr Trump once again urged the migrants to stay away, tweeting: ""To those in the caravan, turn around, we are not letting people into the United States illegally."" This video can not be played Trump and the facts about the migrant caravan Many of the migrants say they plan to seek asylum in the US. There is a legal obligation under international law to hear asylum claims from migrants who have arrived in the US if they say they fear violence in their home countries. But in June, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that victims of domestic abuse and gang violence would no longer generally qualify for asylum in the US. Those seeking asylum must be fleeing due to a serious fear of persecution in their home country. Under international law, these are considered refugees. If an asylum seeker enters the US illegally, they are still entitled to have their claim heard. Economic migrants are those seeking a better quality of life - and even if they are fleeing devastating poverty,they are not considered refugees and do not have the same protections,external.

Polls suggest Irish vote to scrap blasphemy,"This video can not be played 'We can achieve so much together' Michael D Higgins has been re-elected as Irish president after receiving 56% of the country's election vote. Businessman Peter Casey came second with 23.1%, while none of the other four candidates polled more than 10%. Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was ""disappointed"", but felt it was wrong for Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael to ""sit on the sidelines"" in the election. Fitting words needed from 'poet president' Who is Michael D Higgins? Voters also supportedthe proposal to remove blasphemy as an offence from the Constitution, with 64.85% voting yes. Mr Higgins, the first incumbent in 50 years to face a challenge in his bid for a second term, won with 822,566 votes. Londonderry businessman Peter Casey took significantly more votes than the final opinion polls of the campaign had predicted. His final tally was 342,727. Peter Casey is a former Dragons' Den investor Sinn FÃ©in MEP Liadh Ni Riada got 93,987 votes - 6.4% of the total votes polled. ""I am not sorry that we had an election - I think it was wrong for Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael to sit on the sidelines,"" Ms McDonald told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme. ""We decided to challenge in the election - the other parties didn't."" Mary Lou McDonald accused Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael of sitting ""on the sidelines"" She added: ""I think my leadership would have rightly been called into question if I fell in line with MicheÃ¡l Martin and Leo Varadkar. ""Of course I'm disappointed. I would have liked a better showing for Liadh [Ni Riada]but that was not to be. ""You learn from every contest. You learn from every encounter that you have with the electorate and we'll certainly learn from this.""

Speaking after his win, Mr Higgins said he accepted his mandate with ""humility, determination and excitement"". ""People are interested in ideas that are sincere and constructive,"" he said. ""For words matter, words can hurt, words can heal, words can empower, words can divide. ""And the words and ideas I have used in this campaign reflect a vision for Ireland based on four strands. ""Equal and together, strong sustainable communities, sharing history - shaping the future and Ireland's voice matters."" Peter Casey is a former Dragons' Den investor Taking to the podium after Mr Higgins, second-placed Mr Casey said the last time he had stood in an election to the Irish Senate he got just 14 votes. ""Somebody worked it out there - it's about 23,000 per cent improvement,"" he joked. Sinn FÃ©in MEP Liadh Ni Riada said she hoped it was the last Irish presidential election in which people in Northern Ireland could not vote. Turnout was reported to be low in many areas of the country. More than 3.2 million people were eligible to cast their ballots in the election and referendum. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar congratulated Mr Higgins on his predicted win on Saturday morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Man dies in fall as armed raiders break in,"Sheiku Adams died after falling out of the window of his third-floor flat in Camden A man has died in a fall from a third-floor flat after knife-wielding burglars broke into his home, police said. Sheiku Adams, 49, was pronounced dead in hospital at 23:56 BST on Thursday after he was found outside Denyer House in Highgate Road, Camden, north London.

Fracking suspended following earthquake,"Shale company Cuadrilla has been fracking at the Preston New Road site since 15 October Operations have been suspended at the UK's only active shale gas fracking site following an earthquake - just 11 days after it was given the go ahead. Energy firm Cuadrilla said it would halt fracking at the Lancashire site for 18 hours after a tremor of 0.8 magnitude was recorded. Drilling for shale gas at Preston New Road, Little Plumpton, started on 15 October after a legal challenge failed. Cuadrilla chief executive Francis Egan said people should not be concerned. Fracking in Lancashire was stopped in 2011 after beinglinked with earthquakes. The seismic activity was detected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) at about 12:36 BST and is classed as a ""red"" event on the traffic light monitoring system regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority. Any tremor measuring 0.5 or above means fracking must be temporarily stopped while tests are carried out. Mr Egan said the 0.5 level was ""far below anything that can be felt or cause damage or harm."" He added: ""It is an extraordinarily conservative figure far below the 2.5 in Europe or 4 in Canada."" Mr Egan said he expected more incidents to be recorded because of the sensitivity of the recording equipment the company was using at the site in Lancashire. A Cuadrilla spokesman added: ""All the relevant regulators were informed without delay and we have verified that the well integrity is intact. ""As per the hydraulic fracture plan in place at Preston New Road, work will now pause for at least 18 hours and is expected to recommence on Saturday morning."" What is fracking? Fracking given go-ahead by government Fracking gear brought to first UK wells A 2.3 magnitude tremor on the Fylde coast seven years ago was probably caused by shale gas test drilling,a study found. Cuadrilla said earlier this month it would spend at least three months fracking two horizontal wells and then test to see if the gas flow was commercially viable. Anti-fracking campaigners had tried to stop the process with an injunction bid but failed.

'Nazi' accused admits being a racist,"Adam Thomas said his son's middle name Adolf reflected his ""interest and admiration"" for Hitler A father on trial accused of being a ""fanatical"" neo-Nazi terrorist has admitted being a racist. Adam Thomas, 22, also told a court he gave his baby son the middle name Adolf to reflect his ""admiration"" for Hitler. He admitted posing for photographs in Ku Klux Klan robes with his newborn son but said it ""was just play"". Mr Thomas, along with partner Claudia Patatas, 38, and Daniel Bogunovic, 27, denies being a member of banned far-right group National Action. Giving evidence at Birmingham Crown Court, Mr Thomas was asked by his barrister Frida Hussain: ""Are you a racist?"" ""Yes,"" he replied. He said chat groups where he had made anti-Semitic and racist remarks to other alleged National Action members were with people who ""shared interests"" and not intended for public consumption. Adam Thomas said he first discovered a ""fascination"" with Ku Kux Klan aged 11 and by 13 he discovered the National Front The security guard told jurors he was brought up by his maternal grandparents in Birmingham but saw his mother, father and stepfather, who he described as ""common racists"". From the age of five, his stepfather, who was in the ""white power"" band Screwdriver, which had ""very racist views"", would shave his head. He said his paternal grandfather had ""a positive view of Hitler and the Nazis"" and used to deliver a ""Hitler salute"" when he visited as a boy. Asked about hischild's middle name, he said: ""It definitely doubles up as the name of Adolf Hitler. ""It's undeniable and I don't make a secret of it. It does reflect an interest in that topic and admiration for what it represents."" He told the court how at school his racist views led to a counter-extremism mentor taking him to see a Holocaust survivor. ""Well, she told me she was evacuated from Germany to Britain and I couldn't see that as being a Holocaust survivor, at the time."" Adam Thomas described this image of him posing in front of a KKK flag with a knife and and an anarchist's book as ""a bit of silliness"" Ms Frida asked: ""Did you tell her to her face?"" ""I did, yes,"" he replied. During a search of his home police found KKK robes, which Mr Thomas admitted belonged to him.

Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh, leading the investigation, said: ""Tragically a man has lost his life in what appears to have started as an aggravated burglary and ended in his death, after he fell from a third-floor window. ""It is very early in the investigation, but I believe two men forced their way into the flat armed with at least one knife. ""This appears to be a targeted attack. We are appealing to any local residents who saw two men loitering around the area before 21:00 to come forward."" Mr Adams's next-of-kin have been informed of his death.

Green hits back at Hain for injunction breach,"This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Sir Philip Green has said it was ""outrageous"" for Lord Hain to name him as the man who prevented the Telegraph publishing allegations of sexual and racial harassment. He said the Labour peer also failed to disclose his financial links to the law firm representing the newspaper. Sir Philip has denied the allegations and said he would lodge a formal complaint with the House of Lords. Lord Hain said he ""resolutely"" stands by what he said in the Lords. The peer, who has insisted naming the retail tycoon was in the public interest, said in response to the criticism from Sir Philip: ""I stand resolutely by what I've said and neither retract nor apologise for standing up for human rights."" He described Sir Philips's complaint as a ""malevolent diversion"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a statement to the BBC, Sir Philip said: ""As many people have said, Lord Hain's blatant disregard of a judgement made by three senior judges is outrageous."" Sir Philip has been the centre of an eight-month investigation by the Daily Telegraph. The paper says that former employees of the businessman have accused him of sexual and racial harassment. But the Court of Appeal granted Sir Philip an injunction, preventing the paper from naming him. Businesses face boycott over claims Sir Philip named in Lords On Wednesday theTelegraph reported ""a leading businessman"" was granted an injunction.,external The paper said interviews with five members of staff revealed that alleged victims had been paid ""substantial sums"" in return for legal commitments - non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) - not to discuss their alleged experiences. NDAs are used to prevent people from discussing confidential information and keep trade secrets private, but have also been used to keep allegations of wrongdoing out of the press. Sir Philip has ""categorically and wholly"" denied allegations of ""unlawful sexual or racist behaviour"". This video can not be played Lord Hain said the details were ""clearly in the public interest"" Although the press were gagged, MPs and peers are protected from being prosecuted over statements made in the Commons or Lords under Parliamentary privilege.

The Telegraph and the media at large were then entitled to report Lord Hain's statement in Parliament, even though the injunction had been issued by the courts. Lord Hain defends naming Sir Philip The former Neath MP was criticised by some Parliamentarians over his decision to flout the court's ruling. Former Lord Chief Justice Baron Judge said: ""The consequences are so serious. Whatever we think of Sir Philip... he's entitled to go to a court as much as anybody else."" Sir Philip has said in a statement that he ""wholly and categorically"" denies any allegation of ""unlawful sexual or racist behaviour"". On Friday he said he had been advised that Lord Hain's actions are likely to have breached the House of Lords Code of Conduct.

Sir Philip also said that if Lord Hain had read the judgement in the case - as he says the peer should have done if he is talking about it - he would have seen the firm's name on the first page. Gordon Dadds said Lord Hain had not obtained any information from it regarding the case, ""including any information which would enable him to identify Philip Green as having any involvement in it"".

Hain 'arrogant' for naming Topshop boss,"This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Naming Sir Philip Green as the man who prevented a newspaper publishing allegations of sexual and racial harassment was ""arrogant"", former Attorney General Dominic Grieve says. Mr Grieve told the BBC that Lord Hain undermined the rule of law and ""abused"" his parliamentary privilege. Lord Hain defended revealing the name, saying he had received ""overwhelming support - particularly from women"". Sir Philip says he ""categorically and wholly"" denies the allegations. The BBC's Emma Simpson spoke to one former top executive who said he was ""genuinely shocked"" at the allegations. The executive said he had never heard or seen a hint of any sexual harassment or racial abuse - but he said Sir Philip could be ""very, very aggressive"" and ""rude to everyone"". The Daily Telegraph first reported on the injunction on Wednesday, sayinga ""leading businessman"" had won a legal battle,externalto stop the newspaper printing ""confidential information"" from five employees. It has now written to Sir Philip's lawyers,asking him to drop the injunction,externalas he has now issued a statement himself and the whole matter has had ""very wide coverage"". Sir Philip, pictured with daughter Chloe, wife Tina and F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, at Cannes Film Festival last year This would allow reporters at the Telegraph to publish allegations from those who entered non-disclosure agreements. The newspaper has said ""substantial sums"" were paid to five members of Sir Philip's staff in settlement agreements which included a legal commitment not to discuss their alleged experiences. NDAs: What are non-disclosure agreements? Lord Hain identified the retail tycoon on Thursday using parliamentary privilege, which protects MPs and peers from being prosecuted for libel over statements made in the Commons or Lords. But former Lord Chief Justice and life peer Baron Judge said he was ""disappointed"" in Lord Hain's decision and said he thought ""he was wrong"". He added: ""The consequences are so serious. Whatever we think of Sir Philip... he's entitled to go to a court as much as anybody else."" He believes Parliamentary code of practice should be looked at to make it ""categorically clear"" that a member of Parliament should not use their privilege to ""interfere with the processes of the court and the administration of justice"". It has since emerged the peer is aglobal and government adviser at Gordon Dadds,external, the law firm used by the Telegraph. In a statement, Gordon Dadds said Lord Hain had not obtained any information from them regarding the case, ""including any information which would enable him to identify Philip Green as having any involvement in it"". Lord Hain ""categorically"" denied that he was aware of the law firm's work with the Telegraph and said the firm played ""absolutely no part"" in his decision to name Sir Philip. This video can not be played Lord Hain says he stands by his decision to name Sir Philip Green, who denies the claims Mr Grieve told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""We can't operate a democratic free society when peers or MPs decide to take the law into their own hands."" The legal process has been turned into ""what looks like a political witch hunt"", he added. The injunction against the Telegraph was only an interim one, and judges had not even made their final decision before Lord Hain intervened, he said. Parliamentary privilege is ""very important"" but ""open to abuse"", said Mr Grieve, adding: ""I can't see - looking at this particular matter - that Peter Hain can argue that he hasn't abused it."" Meanwhile,pledges to boycott Sir Philip's stores, including Topshop, have been made on social media. Profile: 'High Street king' to 'face of capitalism' Sir Philip Green named over harassment claims This video can not be played Does parliamentary privilege undermine the law? The Telegraph says it spent eight months investigating allegations of bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment. After he was contacted for comment in July, Sir Philip and a number of senior staff applied for an injunction to stop details being published, the Telegraph said. A High Court judge refused to grant the gagging order the following month, but Appeal Court judges ruled in Sir Philip's favour on Tuesday this week. The BBC has not been able to verify the allegations contained in the Telegraph's report. While the Court of Appeal's temporary order banning the naming of Sir Philip remains in force, Lord Hain told the House of Lords he ""felt it was his duty"" to identify the Topshop boss and that it was in the public interest. The former Neath MP said he had been contacted by someone ""intimately involved in the case"" and, given the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) ""to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying"", he felt he should speak out. Speaking later on BBC Newsnight, Lord Hain denied he was undermining a decision of the courts, saying: ""I considered it extremely seriously before I said it."" ""I'm not disputing judges' responsibilities or timing or anything like that. That's a matter for the judiciary,"" he said. ""I'm discharging my function as a parliamentarian - and what concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse."" Labour MP Jess Phillips said Lord Hain was right to name Sir Philip, adding: ""I think that he wouldn't have taken the decision lightly at all. Parliamentary privilege is used in vanishingly rare situations."" Sir Philip is also a regular at London Fashion Week, seen here in 2015 There have been calls for Arcadia chairman Sir Philip to lose his knighthood if the allegations are proved to be correct, from MPs including Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable. And Birkenhead MP Frank Field, who led condemnation of Sir Philipover the BHS pension fund scandal, said: ""The charge sheet against the knighthood is growing."" Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokeswoman said the Honours Forfeiture Committee, which would decide on such a matter, is independent of government and ""constantly reviewing evidence in relation to matters like this"". She added that Mrs May has been clear on the wider issue that ""bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace is against the law and that kind of behaviour can't be tolerated"". Sir Philip Green was knighted in 2006 for services to the retail industry Sir Philip said in a statement on Thursday night that he would not comment on anything that happened in court or was said in Parliament. ""To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations,"" he said. Sir Philip said he and his company, Arcadia, ""take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated. ""Arcadia employs more than 20,000 people and in common with many large businesses sometimes receives formal complaints from employees. ""In some cases these are settled with the agreement of all parties and their legal advisers. These settlements are confidential so I cannot comment further on them.""

Chancellor plans High Street rates relief,"Former High Street shops could be turned into housing under the chancellor's plan Chancellor Philip Hammond is set to announce a Â£1.5bn boost to small High Street UK retailers in the Budget. The financial package will include Â£900m in business rates relief for nearly 500,000 small businesses and a pot of Â£650m to rejuvenate high streets and their transport links. Planning rules will also be eased to allow home-building on empty sites. In one example, a pub in Sheffield with a rateable value of Â£37,750 will save Â£6,178 in business rates next year. A newsagent in Birmingham with a rateable value of Â£14,250 will save Â£1,749. Business groups welcomed the plans but Labour said the rates relief did not go far enough. The Treasury said its new business rates relief, targeted at small retailers, could knock a third off their bills and that 90% of them would benefit from the proposals. To qualify as a small retailer, business premises must have a rateable value of Â£51,000 or less. While the funding is for the whole of the UK, it will be up to the individual nations' parliaments to decide exactly how to use the cash. A tax on non-domestic properties, like shops and pubs Based on a property's ""rateable value"", which is linked to rental value Separate to corporation tax, which is linked to profits Mr Hammond will set out the government's future spending plans on Monday afternoon. The British Chambers of Commerce said the pledge to reduce rates bills for small retailers was welcome after an ""alarming number"" of High Street firms closed this year. Hannah Essex, the business lobby group's co-executive director of policy and campaigns, said: ""While there are long-term structural changes taking place, including changes to consumer habits, the tipping point for many of these firms has been the unnecessarily large burden that business rates place on them. ""Therefore, this short-term reduction in rates will be very welcome news to those on the High Street who require urgent respite,"" Ms Essex added. Chancellor Philip Hammond will deliver his next Budget on Monday afternoon The Treasury estimated 496,000 small retailers would benefit from immediate business rates relief. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour's shadow business secretary said of the plan: ""Small businesses need support, but the retail sector as a whole is struggling. ""100,000 retail jobs have been lost in the last three years yet not a single M&S, Debenhams or House or Fraser - anchor stores bringing in footfall and benefiting all traders - would have been saved by today's announcement."" Ms Long-Bailey said the chancellor's plan did nothing to address the underlying imbalance between brick-and-mortar retailers and online sellers. The chancellor's Â£650m injection, to be introduced over the next four years and called the Future High Streets Fund, will allow towns and cities to ""redevelop under-used retail space into homes and offices, providing help to restore High Street properties and put historic buildings back into use"". Helen Dickinson, head of the British Retail Consortium said: ""Retailers welcome the measures announced by the Treasury to invest new funding to boost high streets and town centres and facilitate re-invention of many to modern and diverse destinations."" By Joe Miller, BBC business correspondent It's been a bruising year for Britain's retailers - and small business owners have been quick to blame the steep rises in business rates that followed the latest revaluation of the tax in 2017. Chief executives of large firms such as Tesco have also been critical, saying they are forced to pay more than online competitors such as Amazon, which are often based in warehouses outside of city centres, where rents are cheaper. The chancellor's response will be an immediate reduction of the levy for small firms in England, as well as a commitment of Â£650m to local authorities, which they can use to improve transport facilities and restore dilapidated or historic buildings in city and town centres. Under the Barnet formula, some of the Â£1.5bn set aside to help High Streets will go to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but business rates are devolved, and it will be up to individual nations' parliaments to decide exactly how to spend the money. Nonetheless, business groups have cautiously welcomed the announcement. But the British Retail Consortium is not the only organisation to warn that with the majority of Britain's three million retail workers employed in bigger firms - including troubled chains like House of Fraser - wholesale reform of the tax system is needed. As yet - there is no indication that the Treasury is considering a longer term fix.

Abused child was jailed for sex with men,"One victim said staff at Beechwood Community Home in Mapperley ""picked out boys to be gagged"" and abused A care home abuse survivor jailed as a teenager for having sex with men has told an inquiry the authorities meant to care for him ""destroyed"" his life. The man, known as P16, said he was jailed as a boy after performing sex acts on older men for money. The CPS called his prosecution ""shocking"". Another care resident said he was made to join ""masturbation competitions"". The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) hearings into care in Nottinghamshire ended on Friday. It is part of a wider inquiry led by Professor Alexis Jay into child sexual abuse in England and Wales. P16 said he reported being physically and sexually abused by a resident at his children's home to staff, but they ""swept it under the carpet"". He began long distance running to get away from the abuse but ended up being paid to perform sex acts on older men in toilets, which he did not see as abuse at the time because of what he had already suffered. When arrested by police he again disclosed the abuse from the resident, but pleaded guilty to charges because social workers told him it would mean ""I could go home sooner"". In a statement read to the inquiry, P16 said: ""I was prosecuted when older men paid for me to have sex with them in a public toilet. I was only 15 or 16. ""I can't get my head round it, I never could."" He was detained until he was 18. Professor Alexis Jay is leading the inquiry P16 said the convictions were wrongly recorded, remain on his records and have seen him ""persecuted"" as an adult. He said: ""Those convictions have followed me around for a long time. They were mistakenly shared as convictions against children when they weren't, I was the child."" Ed Brown QC, for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), described P16's prosecution as ""shocking"" and ""truly dreadful"", but added it pre-dated the existence of the CPS. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The inquiry also heard written statements from other survivors of abuse. They disclosed being physically and sexually abused by staff and residents in children's homes and foster care across Nottinghamshire. One victim, D37, said staff at Beechwood Community Home in Mapperley ""picked out boys to be gagged"" and abused, adding he was also raped and ""forced to participate in masturbation competitions with other boys and members of staff on multiple occasions"". ""I remember winning one of those,"" the statement said. ""I thought it was good. I thought I had won something, I had achieved something. Because of my childhood I thought it was normal."" The final day of IICSA's Nottinghamshire hearings, being held at The Oval cricket ground in London, heard calls from abuse survivors for changes to the system. David Hollas, an advocate for members of the Nottingham Child Sexual Abuse Survivors Group, said improved police contact and therapeutic support was ""a starting point"", but he described the litigation system for victims as ""broken"" and demanded further improvements. ""Words and apologies are cheap - it's action that is needed,"" he said. In their closing statements to the inquiry, public bodies apologised for failings and spoke about reforms they have made. Andrew Sharland QC, for Nottinghamshire County Council, said it was ""profoundly sorry"" large numbers of children were abused by its employees and then ""far too often"" not believed by social workers and others. He said a ""pervading culture of disbelief"" of children ""no longer exists"", adding all settlements over civil claims would come with a personal apology. Samantha Leek QC, representing Nottinghamshire Police, said the force ""will re-examine their own systems and practices"" following the evidence put to the inquiry. She said it acknowledged officers had not properly scrutinised claims of abuse in the past, but said it would ensure complainants are ""taken seriously, kept informed and supported and treated with respect"". Steven Ford QC, on behalf of Nottingham City Council, said the authority accepted failings happened historically and ""in the very recent past"", but said factors such as reduced staff turnover and fewer agency workers had improved its care services. But Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, representing dozens of inquiry participants, said survivors had been ""frustrated"" by Nottingham City Council's ""evasive"" responses, and criticised the number of ""non-apology apologies"" issued ""repeatedly"" by its staff. She said victims appreciated efforts by Nottinghamshire Police and Nottinghamshire County Council to address issues, but had ""real concern"" about Nottingham City Council's approach to the inquiry.

She said Mr Trump had told her: ""I'm going to leave the room to make myself look better, because if we do this interview now everyone is just going to be staring at you and not listening to me."" After pretending to gag she added: ""It's because he thought that would be the best way to disarm me. ""He thought as a female journalist, he thought that was the best thing to say to me rather than: 'Oh, I watched your piece on mobile phone insurance last week.""' McGovern said she was unruffled by his comments and told him:  ""Aye love, I've heard better lines than that down Club Bongo."" In the interview McGovern grilled Mr Trump about his status as a business tycoon, his previous bid for the US presidency in 2012, and whether his wealth made him happy.

Man mistaken for 'scarecrow' run over,"Laurence John had been walking home from the Yew Tree Pub A woman who ran over a man lying in the road after she mistook him for a ""scarecrow"" has been jailed. Marian Watt, 60, drove over 55-year-old Laurence John outside a pub in Alresford, Hampshire in November 2017. Winchester Crown Court heard she had stopped but thought he was ""a Guy Fawkes guy or a scarecrow"" so drove on. He suffered multiple injuries. She was jailed for a year after being found guilty of causing serious injury by dangerous driving last month. Watt, of South Town Road, Alton, was also banned from driving for two years. The court heard Mr John ""wasn't drunk but at most a little merry"" when he left the Yew Tree to walk home alone on 25 November 2017. Christopher Amis, prosecuting, said: ""For some reason, which even now remains unclear, Mr John ended up lying prone in the middle of the very dark road on what was a very cold night."" Mr Amis said Watt was driving home in her Toyota Land Cruiser after having dinner with friends. He told the court Watt's account was that she stopped and got out of the car when she came across Mr John lying in the road. ""But [she] thought what she was looking at was a Guy Fawkes' guy or a scarecrow or something of that sort simply lying in the road."" She then drove over Mr John, dragging him 23ft (7m) down the road. He suffered multiple fractures and injuries as a result and spent four months in hospital. Sentencing, Judge Keith Cutler described Watt as a ""pillar of the community and church"" who had made a ""dreadful, inexplicable and horrific decision"". ""That decision was found by the jury as one that no careful or competent driver would have done, no sensible driver would have done."" PC Dave Mitchell, of Hampshire Constabulary, said the crash had ""tragic and far reaching consequences"" for the victim.

Cot designer jailed over baby's death,"A judge said Craig Williams held a ""significant responsibility"" for Oscar Abbey's death A bed firm boss who designed a cot in which a seven-month-old baby ""choked to death"" has been jailed for three years and four months. Craig Williams's Playtime Beds Ltd sold the cot bed where Oscar Abbey got stuck trying to crawl through a gap. Oscar's lifeless body was found by his parents caught in the bed at their home in York on 3 November 2016. Williams, 37, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to two charges at Leeds Crown Court. The father of three admitted a health and safety failing to discharge the employer's general duty and a fraud charge. A jury in his trial was asked to return a not guilty verdict to gross negligence manslaughter. Judge Martin Spencer said Williams, of Park View Road, had a ""significant responsibility"" for Oscar's death, less than a week after he first started using the bed. The judge told Williams: ""You should bear the brunt of that responsibility for the rest of your life."" Williams's employee, Joseph Bruce, 31, of Kimberworth Park Road, Rotherham, was jailed for six months after admitting fraud. Employee Joseph Bruce was jailed for six months after admitting fraud Oscar's parents, Charlie and Shannon Abbey, paid Â£655 including delivery costs for the cot bed, which featured a slide. Prosecutor John Elvidge QC told the court Williams had assured them it was suitable for children aged six or seven months. Oscar had effectively ""choked to death"" after ""wriggling his body through the holes at the front of his cot bed"", jurors heard. More news from Yorkshire Mr Elvidge said Williams had demonstrated ""an utterly indifferent attitude towards the safety of small children, even after he had been visited by police in relation to Oscar's death"". Williams had continued to make the beds and did not modify his designs, the court heard. They went on to sell the same cots after Oscar's death under a new company, Magical Dream Beds. Oscar Abbey died of positional asphyxia after he got his head stuck, the court heard Judge Spencer said: ""It is pure fortune that no other child did die, and that is no thanks to [Williams] or Mr Bruce."" Williams had shown a ""flagrant disregard"" for adhering to safety regulations and had committed a ""wicked fraud"" by continuing to sell beds, the judge added. Following sentencing, North Yorkshire Police said the pair were ""solely motivated by money and were willing to sacrifice children's safety in the pursuit of it"". Det Supt Nigel Costello described them as ""selfish and callous individuals"". In a statement read during the trial, Mr Abbey, 24, said he found his son trapped face-down in the front of the cot. ""It looked like he'd tried to crawl out backwards but his head was stuck,"" he said.

Road rage driver jailed for cyclist punch,"Mr Marshall had multiple injuries following the attack A road rage motorist who punched a cyclist into oncoming traffic has been jailed for two years. Darren Hefferman, 38, overtook cyclist Gareth Marshall on Beaufort Hill, Ebbw Vale, but the victim shouted for more room as Hefferman passed him. Newport Crown Court heard Hefferman waited for Mr Marshall a short distance later, got out of his car and hit him - causing him to get trapped under a van. He pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm following the 11 January attack. The court heard Mr Marshall suffered multiple injuries, including a broken collar bone, multiple broken ribs, a damaged lung, shattered pelvis and dislocated hip. Darren Hefferman was told his behaviour was ""arrogant, stupid and impatient"" Sentencing Hefferman, Judge Richard Williams said: ""Your behaviour was arrogant, stupid and impatient. It shows a total lack of self control. ""Mr Marshall will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of his life. ""This incident arose because of your total lack of ability to control your temper. Confrontations like this between road users have to be deterred."" Gareth Marshall said he has been left ""unable to do the simplest of things"" since the attack Jamie Dewar, senior Crown prosecutor at CPS Wales, said: ""He chose to stop his vehicle, chose to get out and chose to assault another road user, resulting in dreadful injuries. ""The CPS would like to thank the members of the public who gave details of what happened. The strength of evidence presented resulted in an early guilty plea."" In a victim impact statement, Mr Marshall, from Brynmawr, said he had lost fitness and confidence, and was ""unable to do the simplest of things"". ""I dream of death or falling or being chased by a car that is trying to kill me,"" he said. X-rays show the level of work Mr Marshall needed to repair his pelvis Outside court, Mr Marshall added: ""I can't thank the NHS enough for saving me and fixing me. ""Mentally you need to be strong to get over it but you'll always be looking over your shoulder from the day when the gentleman attacked me.""

ÃÂ£350m loan for London Crossrail delay,"The government has announced it will make Â£350m available to the Mayor of London to support the Crossrail project A Â£350m bailout of the delayed Crossrail project has been announced by the government. Londonâs Â£15bn route, to be known as the Elizabeth line, had been due to open in December,but will now be launched in autumn 2019. Transport for London said it would miss out on Â£20m in revenue, but the total cost of the delay could be far higher. Rail Minister Jo Johnson, said the loan ""will ensure that full momentum is maintained behind Crossrail"". The scheme, Europe's biggest infrastructure project, is currently runningalmost Â£600m over budget,and the loan has not come without criticism. Chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee Caroline Pidgeon called the loan ""only a sticking plaster to keep the project going"". ""Londoners need to know what work is left to open the line, how much this will cost and ultimately who will pick up the tab,"" she said. When open, the project will help ease London's chronic congestion by connecting major landmarks such as Heathrow Airport and the Canary Wharf business district. Trains will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west through 13 miles of new tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, when fully operational. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes and described the 10-year project as ""hugely complex"". The firm said ""further time"" was required for testing, and that contractors needed to complete work in the central tunnels and to develop ""railways systems software"". The ""interim"" loan will be made available to the Mayor of London following an independent review of Crossrail's governance and a separate review on Crossrail's finances by accountancy firm KPMG. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""This agreement is the result of positive discussions between City Hall, Transport for London, the Treasury and the Department for Transport and will allow Crossrail Ltd to continue their construction work and the testing process."" London's Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown, said the money would ""enable Crossrail Ltd to continue its construction work and vital testing at pace to open the Elizabeth line to passengers as quickly as possible"". The Elizabeth Line had been due to open in December 2018 ""The funding will go towards Crossrail Ltd completing the final fit out of the tunnels, work on stations and the extensive safety and reliability testing needed for the new systems,"" he said. An estimated 200m passengers will use the new undergound line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. Leader of London Assembly Conservatives Gareth Bacon blamed Mr Khan for the delay. ""Crossrail is a subsidiary of TfL and it is a sad state of affairs when the government has to bail out the mayor who was apparently asleep on the job,"" he added. However, Rail Minister Mr Johnson added: ""This project is already delivering benefits for the whole of the UK through its cross-country supply chain and its UK built train fleet. ""A further update will be provided once the discussions on the financing arrangements have concluded.""

"Abused child was jailed for sex with menAn abuse inquiry hears how care home children began to believe their suffering was ""normal"".Nottingham","One victim said staff at Beechwood Community Home in Mapperley ""picked out boys to be gagged"" and abused A care home abuse survivor jailed as a teenager for having sex with men has told an inquiry the authorities meant to care for him ""destroyed"" his life. The man, known as P16, said he was jailed as a boy after performing sex acts on older men for money. The CPS called his prosecution ""shocking"". Another care resident said he was made to join ""masturbation competitions"". The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) hearings into care in Nottinghamshire ended on Friday. It is part of a wider inquiry led by Professor Alexis Jay into child sexual abuse in England and Wales. P16 said he reported being physically and sexually abused by a resident at his children's home to staff, but they ""swept it under the carpet"". He began long distance running to get away from the abuse but ended up being paid to perform sex acts on older men in toilets, which he did not see as abuse at the time because of what he had already suffered. When arrested by police he again disclosed the abuse from the resident, but pleaded guilty to charges because social workers told him it would mean ""I could go home sooner"". In a statement read to the inquiry, P16 said: ""I was prosecuted when older men paid for me to have sex with them in a public toilet. I was only 15 or 16. ""I can't get my head round it, I never could."" He was detained until he was 18. Professor Alexis Jay is leading the inquiry P16 said the convictions were wrongly recorded, remain on his records and have seen him ""persecuted"" as an adult. He said: ""Those convictions have followed me around for a long time. They were mistakenly shared as convictions against children when they weren't, I was the child."" Ed Brown QC, for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), described P16's prosecution as ""shocking"" and ""truly dreadful"", but added it pre-dated the existence of the CPS. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The inquiry also heard written statements from other survivors of abuse. They disclosed being physically and sexually abused by staff and residents in children's homes and foster care across Nottinghamshire. One victim, D37, said staff at Beechwood Community Home in Mapperley ""picked out boys to be gagged"" and abused, adding he was also raped and ""forced to participate in masturbation competitions with other boys and members of staff on multiple occasions"". ""I remember winning one of those,"" the statement said. ""I thought it was good. I thought I had won something, I had achieved something. Because of my childhood I thought it was normal."" The final day of IICSA's Nottinghamshire hearings, being held at The Oval cricket ground in London, heard calls from abuse survivors for changes to the system. David Hollas, an advocate for members of the Nottingham Child Sexual Abuse Survivors Group, said improved police contact and therapeutic support was ""a starting point"", but he described the litigation system for victims as ""broken"" and demanded further improvements. ""Words and apologies are cheap - it's action that is needed,"" he said. In their closing statements to the inquiry, public bodies apologised for failings and spoke about reforms they have made. Andrew Sharland QC, for Nottinghamshire County Council, said it was ""profoundly sorry"" large numbers of children were abused by its employees and then ""far too often"" not believed by social workers and others. He said a ""pervading culture of disbelief"" of children ""no longer exists"", adding all settlements over civil claims would come with a personal apology. Samantha Leek QC, representing Nottinghamshire Police, said the force ""will re-examine their own systems and practices"" following the evidence put to the inquiry. She said it acknowledged officers had not properly scrutinised claims of abuse in the past, but said it would ensure complainants are ""taken seriously, kept informed and supported and treated with respect"". Steven Ford QC, on behalf of Nottingham City Council, said the authority accepted failings happened historically and ""in the very recent past"", but said factors such as reduced staff turnover and fewer agency workers had improved its care services. But Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, representing dozens of inquiry participants, said survivors had been ""frustrated"" by Nottingham City Council's ""evasive"" responses, and criticised the number of ""non-apology apologies"" issued ""repeatedly"" by its staff. She said victims appreciated efforts by Nottinghamshire Police and Nottinghamshire County Council to address issues, but had ""real concern"" about Nottingham City Council's approach to the inquiry.

Arrest after Magna Carta theft attempt,"The hammer made three holes in the top layer of protective glass A hammer-wielding man has been arrested after an attempted smash and grab of a Magna Carta from its display at Salisbury Cathedral. Alarms went off when the would-be thief tried to break through the glass box which protects the charter on Thursday. The suspect was held on suspicion of attempted theft of the document - claimed to be the best preserved of four original Magna Cartas. It was not damaged and nobody was injured, police said. The man was wrestled to the ground by staff when he attempted to flee after the attempted raid at 16:45 BST, the Dean of Salisbury said. The Very Reverend Nick Papadopoulos said: ""There were people around so the cry went up, it was pretty thick glass so it hadn't yielded easily despite having a hammer hit it. ""It was a great shock but everyone responded magnificently, both our staff and volunteers and members of the public. ""They raised a cry and he did not get away."" The drama unfolded just before Evensong near to closing time at the visitor centre. Dean Papadopoulos added: ""He had been carrying a hammer so our guys were very courageous. ""They were able to restrain him and they held him for 12 minutes."" The Dean of Salisbury Cathedral described his staff as ""courageous"" after they restrained the man A silent alarm was activated which alerted staff to the disturbance, he added. A 45-year-old man is being held on suspicion of attempted theft, criminal damage and possession of an offensive weapon. He has been taken to Melksham police station where he is being questioned. Magna Carta is a charter of rights agreed by King John in 1215. It is considered one of Britain's most influential legal manuscripts. Several versions were sent around the country ""as evidence of the King's decision"", according to Salisbury Cathedral's website. Best-preserved Magna Carta on show Why are there so many Magna Cartas? Cathedral given Magna Carta on a coin Only four original copies survive today, and the cathedral is home to what isclaimed to be ""the most beautiful"". The charter was put on display at the cathedral three years ago as part of an exhibition funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The charter has been removed for safe-keeping while the case is refurbished, Dean Papadopoulos said. A facsimile copy of the charter will be displayed, and the visitor centre will re-open as soon as possible. The document is displayed at Chapter House at the cathedral Magna Carta outlined basic rights with the principle that no one was above the law, including the king. It charted the right to a fair trial, and limits on taxation without representation. It inspired a number of other documents, including the US Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Only three clauses are still valid - the one guaranteeing the liberties of the English Church; the clause confirming the privileges of the city of London and other towns; and the clause that states that no free man shall be imprisoned without the lawful judgement of his equals. The British Library has two copies of the 1215 Magna Carta. Source: The British Library The historical document is encased in two glass layers, Dean Papadopoulos added. ""The layer that is closest to the document itself was completely untouched by the individual concerned, but his hammer did do some damager to the initial glass screen."" Two copies of the Magna Carta that date from 1215 are held by the British Library and go on regular display there. The Salisbury copy went on display in 2015 in the 13th Century Chapter House at the cathedral.

Killer given whole life jail for sex crimes,"Killer John Taylor was given a whole life jail term for the historical sex attacks A convicted killer has been handed a whole-life sentence after he admitted a series of ""vile and sadistic"" sex attacks against women and children. John Taylor was serving a minimum of 30 years for the abduction and murder of 16-year-old Leanne Tiernan in 2000. The 62-year-old was told on Friday he would spend the rest of his life in prison for 16 offences against five victims between 1977 and 1996. Leeds Crown Court heard the attacks had been ""callous and ferocious"". They included an indecent assault on a seven-year-old girl after she was tied to the drainpipe of a church in Bramley, Leeds, in 1984. Taylor also confessed to holding a knife to the throat of a 27-year-old woman while she was walking with her three children and forcing her to perform a sex act on him. The offences came to light after a cold case review and advances in DNA sciences. Judge Mairs said Taylor was responsible for a ""20-year campaign of rape and sexual assaults against children and women, fuelled by a sadistic desire to inflict pain for sexual gratification"". He said: ""The trauma, fear and nightmares that would have engendered in that child [in the church yard] are beyond comprehension."" The victim herself told the court: ""When I heard about Leanne Tiernan I felt guilty. I wondered what if I had reported sooner what Taylor did to me."" Leanne was abducted while on a shopping trip in Leeds. Her body was body was found eight months later by a dog walker in woods north of Otley, about 16 miles from her house in Bramley. Taylor had strangled her to satisfy his ""perverted cravings"", the judge said in 2002. He was given two further life sentences in 2003 after admitting the rape of two women in the 1980s. A whole-life term means there is no chance of parole or conditional release during the prisoner's lifetime. Det Supt Jim Dunkerley, from West Yorkshire Police, said: ""Hopefully today's sentences bring a degree of comfort to his victims who have been through a horrific ordeal. ""I do though want to pay tribute to them for bravely coming forward and telling police what happened to them. ""Even if you were the victim of a serious crime decades ago we will do all we can to bring the offender or offenders to justice."" Taylor pleaded guilty to offences including two counts of rape, three counts of possession of an offensive weapon, three counts of indecent assault and kidnap.

Ryanair rant man says 'I'm no racist',"David Mesher has apologised, saying he had ""a fit of temper"" A Ryanair passenger who was filmed launching a tirade at an elderly woman on a flight has apologised and denied he is a racist. David Mesher was on a flight from Barcelona to Stansted on 19 October when he began insulting Delsie Gayle. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain he was ""not a racist person by any means"" and it was ""just a fit of temper at the time"". Mrs Gayle, 77, and her daughter Carol Gayle have rejected his apology. In the film - viewed on Facebook more than 1.8 million times - Mr Mesher can be heard using racial slurs to Delsie Gayle and threatening to ""push"" her to another seat. He also shouts at her: ""Don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow."" This video can not be played The row was captured by passenger David Lawrence, who spoke to BBC Radio 5 live about what happened Speaking on Friday, Mr Mesher, from Birmingham, said the dispute with Mrs Gayle began over getting to his seat. ""I probably lost my temper a bit and ordered her to get up,"" he said. ""I'm not a racist person by any means and it's just a fit of temper at the time, I think. ""I apologise for all the distress you've had there and since."" Delsie Gayle and daughter Carole have rejected David Mesher's apology Asked if she accepted the apology, Mrs Gayle said: ""I don't think so. You must forget and forgive but it's going to take a long time for me to get over what he has done to me."" Carol Gayle said: ""He says he wasn't racist; he wouldn't be saying words like that if he wasn't racist."" The pair have also renewed their criticism of Ryanair, saying they are still yet to hear from the budget airline. In a statement issued on Friday, the airline said it became aware of the incident late on 20 October and reported the video to Essex Police the following morning, together with the details of the passengers involved, and had written to Mrs Gayle the same morning. It said the company's Spanish cabin crew were aware of an argument between two passengers but were not aware of the racist comments until they were shown the video after the flight landed in London. The crew had followed company procedure to defuse an argument, which was to separate the passengers by offering to move one to alternative seating. Ryanair said Mrs Gayle was moved at her request, to a seat next to her daughter, and both passengers involved in the altercation confirmed they were ""OK"". The airline said it had written, both by email and letter, to Mrs Gayle to apologise. In the statement, Robin Kiely from Ryanair again apologised for the ""regrettable, and unacceptable remarks"" made to Mrs Gayle. ""We believe that by reporting this matter immediately to Essex Police, and by apologising in writing to this customer early on Sunday morning, Ryanair treated it with the urgency and seriousness it warranted,"" he said. Dion Dublin 'racially abused by woman' Snowboarder gets first Ellie Soutter grant Ross from Friends lookalike identified Officers from Essex Police are investigating and Mr Keily said Ryanair was giving the force its ""full co-operation and assistance"". The incident took place on the tarmac of Barcelona Airport before the plane departed for Stansted, and police have said they will pass on information to the Spanish authorities in due course, in line with national protocols. Officers from West Midlands Police have assisted Essex Police by speaking to Mr Mesher in his sheltered accommodation in Yardley Wood on Thursday. Ryanair has been criticised for its handling of the incident, with apetition,externalcalling for the airline to apologise and compensate Mrs Gayle gaining more than 304,000 signatures.

Â£350m loan for London Crossrail delay,"The government has announced it will make Â£350m available to the Mayor of London to support the Crossrail project A Â£350m bailout of the delayed Crossrail project has been announced by the government. Londonâs Â£15bn route, to be known as the Elizabeth line, had been due to open in December,but will now be launched in autumn 2019. Transport for London said it would miss out on Â£20m in revenue, but the total cost of the delay could be far higher. Rail Minister Jo Johnson, said the loan ""will ensure that full momentum is maintained behind Crossrail"". The scheme, Europe's biggest infrastructure project, is currently runningalmost Â£600m over budget,and the loan has not come without criticism. Chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee Caroline Pidgeon called the loan ""only a sticking plaster to keep the project going"". ""Londoners need to know what work is left to open the line, how much this will cost and ultimately who will pick up the tab,"" she said. When open, the project will help ease London's chronic congestion by connecting major landmarks such as Heathrow Airport and the Canary Wharf business district. Trains will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west through 13 miles of new tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, when fully operational. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes and described the 10-year project as ""hugely complex"". The firm said ""further time"" was required for testing, and that contractors needed to complete work in the central tunnels and to develop ""railways systems software"". The ""interim"" loan will be made available to the Mayor of London following an independent review of Crossrail's governance and a separate review on Crossrail's finances by accountancy firm KPMG. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""This agreement is the result of positive discussions between City Hall, Transport for London, the Treasury and the Department for Transport and will allow Crossrail Ltd to continue their construction work and the testing process."" London's Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown, said the money would ""enable Crossrail Ltd to continue its construction work and vital testing at pace to open the Elizabeth line to passengers as quickly as possible"". The Elizabeth Line had been due to open in December 2018 ""The funding will go towards Crossrail Ltd completing the final fit out of the tunnels, work on stations and the extensive safety and reliability testing needed for the new systems,"" he said. An estimated 200m passengers will use the new undergound line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. Leader of London Assembly Conservatives Gareth Bacon blamed Mr Khan for the delay. ""Crossrail is a subsidiary of TfL and it is a sad state of affairs when the government has to bail out the mayor who was apparently asleep on the job,"" he added. However, Rail Minister Mr Johnson added: ""This project is already delivering benefits for the whole of the UK through its cross-country supply chain and its UK built train fleet. ""A further update will be provided once the discussions on the financing arrangements have concluded.""

Person arrested over US mail-bombings,"This video can not be played Van of mail bomb suspect A 56-year-old man has been arrested in Florida in connection with a mail-bombing campaign aimed at critics of US President Donald Trump. US officials named the man as Cesar Sayoc. He faces five charges including mailing explosives and threatening ex-presidents. Mr Trump said the acts were ""despicable and have no place in our country"". Fourteen items have been sent in recent days to figures including ex-President Barack Obama and actor Robert de Niro. Two were found in Florida and New York City on Friday morning. Later, two more were discovered in California. Billionaire and Democrat donorTom Steyer said that a package sent to him had been intercepted at a mail facility in Burlingame,external, and another addressed to Democrat Senator Kamala Harris was reported in Sacramento. The incidents come less than two weeks before the US mid-term elections, with politics highly polarised. How the US mail bomb suspect was caught Why Trump attacks the media The president praised law enforcement for the quick arrest of the suspect, describing the search as looking for a ""needle in a haystack"". ""These terrorising acts are despicable and have no place in our country,"" he said. This video can not be played Trump: 'We can never allow political violence' The comments were in stark contrast to Mr Trump's tweet earlier in the day, when he suggested the incidents, which he described as ""'Bomb' stuff"", were slowing Republican ""momentum"" in early voting.

But Mr Trump returned to the theme later, accusing US media of exploiting the latest case. ""The media's constant, unfair coverage, deep hostility and negative attacks... only serve to drive people apart and to undermine healthy debate,"" he said at a rally in North Carolina. ""We have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican party."" US media reports suggest Mr Sayoc is a registered Republican who attended some of Mr Trump's rallies in 2016 and 2017. However, the president rejected any suggestion that his rhetoric had contributed to the attacks. ""I heard he was a person that preferred me over others. There's no blame, there's no anything,"" Mr Trump said. Former intelligence chief James Clapper, one of the recipients of Friday's packages, told CNN: ""This is definitely domestic terrorism, no question in my mind."" He said that anyone who had been a critic of President Trump needed to be on the alert and take extra precautions. ""I'm not suggesting a direct cause-and-effect relationship between anything he's said or done and  the distribution of these explosives. But I do think he bears some responsibility for the coarseness of civility of the dialogue in this country,"" he added. He was at a vehicle parts shop in the city of Plantation, Florida. FBI Director Christopher Wray revealed that he was detained after his fingerprint was allegedly found on one of the packages. Officials also said DNA and mobile phone data were used to track the suspect down. Cesar Sayoc was reportedly arrested at a shop in Plantation, Florida The Department of Justice said he faced up to 48 years in jail. ""We will not tolerate such lawlessness, especially political violence,"" US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a news conference. ""Let this be a lesson to anyone, regardless of their political beliefs, that we will use the full force of the law against you."" Law enforcement agencies said Mr Sayoc lives in Aventura, Florida. In 2002, he was arrested for making a bomb threat in Miami-Dade County, and received one year of probation for the charge. Who is mail bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc? Mr Sayoc has a criminal record dating back to 1991 in Broward County, according to clerk records. He was arrested, aged 29, on a theft charge. He has also faced charges of fraud and battery. Court records show Mr Sayoc filed for bankruptcy in 2012 while he was living with his mother. A handwritten note in his bankruptcy report reads: ""Lives w/mom. Has no furniture."" The suspect's van displayed a collection of pro-Trump posters In 1980, he spent three semesters as a student at Brevard College in North Carolina, a university spokeswoman told BBC News. He did not graduate, the spokeswoman added. Following his arrest, US TV broadcast live images of a white van, said to belong to Mr Sayoc, being loaded on to a trailer in Plantation and towed away for examination. The van's windows were covered in images. One piece of artwork depicted President Trump standing on a tank and another showed Hillary Clinton with a bullseye superimposed on her face. Twitter and Facebook accounts in the name of Cesar Altieri and Cesar Altieri Randazzo respectively, believed to be used by the suspect, have been taken down. The series of bomb alerts began on Monday, whena suspected device was found in the post box of billionaire businessman George Soros, a major Democratic Party donor. This video can not be played Police in New York City find another suspicious package addressed to a Trump critic A total of 13 devices were sent to the following 11 individuals, according to the FBI. George Soros Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former President Barack Obama Former Vice-President Joe Biden (two devices) Former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN Former Attorney General Eric Holder California Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters (two devices) Robert De Niro Democrat Senator Cory Booker Former director of national intelligence James Clapper Democrat Senator Kamala Harris The package sent to Mr Steyer was not mentioned on the complaint against Mr Sayoc. None of the devices went off. FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney said thorough examinations of all the packages were under way at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, near Washington DC. The package addressed to Mr Clapper was found in New York Several of the packages appear to have contained pipe bombs, according to the FBI. CNN quotes investigators as saying they were functional but unstable, meaning they could be set off merely by handling. They have timers easily bought at retail outlets. But experts speaking to several US media outlets have cast doubt on their effectiveness after seeing X-ray images. New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill could not confirm whether all the devices were intended to explode, but he said officials ""are treating them as suspected explosive devices"". Later FBI Director Wray said that, though they were still being examined, ""these are not hoax devices"". He said it was possible there were more undiscovered packages. Some of the packages included photos of the intended targets with red Xs drawn through them, investigators said. How the US mail bomb suspect was caught Bomb truck removes package sent to De Niro.

What we know about US mail bomb threats,"A police bomb sniffing dog is seen in New York after an explosive device was found Cesar Sayoc, 56, has been arrested after a number of suspected mail bombs were sent to critics of US President Donald Trump, authorities say. The suspected bombs were found across the country, from New York to Los Angeles, and were reportedly crudely made and sent in similar envelopes. None of the packages exploded, and the suspect has been taken into custody. He faces five federal crime charges: interstate transportation of an explosive, illegal mailing of an explosive, threats against former presidents and other persons, threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers. Here is what we know. Law enforcement officials say Cesar Sayoc is the principal suspect, and that fingerprint samples, DNA and mobile phone data were used to track him down. Who is mail bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc? He is a resident of south Florida and has a criminal record. Mr Sayoc also reportedly has ties to New York. At a news conference on Friday, Justice Department officials announced Mr Sayoc was in the custody of the FBI. FBI Director Chris Wray said the nationwide investigation spanned ""from New York to Delaware to Maryland to the District of Columbia to Florida to California"". Mr Sayoc was identified in the last 36 hours, the director said, after his fingerprint was discovered on a package sent to Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Mr Wray also said they confirmed Mr Sayoc's DNA from two different devices mailed in different envelopes with a DNA sample from Mr Sayoc, collected from a previous arrest. Late on Thursday night, the FBI confirmed this information with Florida law enforcement. Cesar Sayoc (2nd right) is escorted by FBI agency Electronic devices were used to ping and track his mobile phone, leading to his arrest in a car park in Plantation, Florida. Mr Sayoc's Twitter account was also used by investigators to confirm his identity. Several posts misspelled ""Hillary"" as ""Hilary"" and ""Schultz"" as ""Shultz"", which is the same spelling mistake that appeared on the envelopes that contained the explosives, officials say. ""We do believe we've caught the right guy,"" Mr Wray said. ""But we also know that this is an ongoing investigation and there's a lot of work to be done - there are still plenty of unanswered questions."" The first device was found in a postbox near the New York home of billionaire businessman George Soros on 22 October. Mr Soros, a major donor to the Democratic Party, has become a frequent target for criticism by right-wing groups because of his support for liberal causes. The item was discovered by one of his employees and it was later destroyed by bomb squad officers. Police said the package contained explosive powder and ""had the components"" of a bomb. A suspected explosive device was found in a mailbox outside Mr Soros's home in Bedford, New York The following day, the Secret Service discovered a package addressed to former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. It was reportedly found during a routine screening of mail sent to the home she shares with her husband - former President Bill Clinton - in Chappaqua, New York. A US official told the Associated Press that it was a ""functional explosive device"". Who is billionaire financier George Soros? Trump attacks 'media hostility' after mail bombs 'Those responsible will be brought to justice' A third package, addressed to former President Barack Obama, was intercepted early on 24 October in Washington DC. ""[The] packages were intercepted prior to being delivered to their intended location,"" a statement from the Secret Service said of both incidents. ""The protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them,"" it added. The next development occurred when CNN's New York office was evacuated on Wednesday morning after a suspected bomb was sent to their mailroom. It was addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan, a vocal critic of Mr Trump, who was scheduled to appear on the network that day. Police say they found an ""envelope containing white powder"" in the packaging of the device. The network was on air when the package was discovered, and an alarm could be heard in the background as the presenters discussed the story. Allow Twitter content?

Later that day, reports emerged that former Attorney General Eric Holder had been sent a suspected explosive device. This was followed by news that another device, addressed to Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, had been found at a mail sorting facility near Washington, DC. A second suspicious package addressed to her was later discovered in Los Angeles. One of the packages - addressed to Congresswoman Waters - was found at this mail sorting facility On Thursday, shortly after 05:00 local time, another suspected explosive device was found in New York City. It had been sent to the Tribeca Grill in Manhattan, a restaurant owned by the actor Robert De Niro. De Niro - the star of films Raging Bull and Meet the Parents - is a vocal Trump opponent and once called him ""a national disaster"". Trump hits back at Robert De Niro The package was similar to the previous examples, officials said. The FBI later confirmed that two further suspicious devices had been sent to former Vice-President Joe Biden in Delaware. This video can not be played A specialist ""total containment vehicle"" removes a suspect package sent to Robert De Niro On Friday, more packages were found. One was located during a search of a Florida mail facility and was addressed to the Democratic Senator Cory Booker. The other package was discovered at a post office in New York and the target was ex-national intelligence chief James Clapper. Later, two more were discovered in California. Billionaire and Democrat donorTom Steyer said that a package sent to him had been intercepted at a mail facility in Burlingame,external, and another addressed to Democrat Senator Kamala Harris was reported in Sacramento. None of the suspicious packages exploded and there have been no reports of injuries. FBI Director Mr Wray described the devices as ""roughly six inches of PVC pipe, a small clock, a battery, some wiring, and what is known as energetic material"", which is material that can give off heat and energy as a reaction to heat, shock or friction. ""Though we're still analysing the devices in our lab, these are not hoax devices,"" Mr Wray said at a news conference on Friday. They were all sent in manila envelopes with bubble wrap, addressed with computer-printed labels. Each listed Debbie Wasserman Schultz, former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, as the sender, although her name was misspelt. The Florida congresswoman said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the way her name was used. The devices are suspected to be pipe bombs. The one sent to CNN - of which there are pictures - is wrapped in black tape and was about 6in (15 cm) long. FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney has confirmed that the white powder found in this package ""did not present a biological threat"". The package that was sent to CNN's offices in New York Investigators are working to establish whether they were capable of detonating. An X-Ray of the package sent to De Niro reportedly showed it contained a device matching the others which resembled a pipe bomb. All of the packages are now being examined at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, outside Washington DC. Unnamed officials told US media that investigators believe at least one was sent from Florida, and the FBI searched a mail facility near Miami late on Thursday. The political fallout has been swift. Conservatives claim Democrats, including those who were targeted in the bomb scare, have encouraged ""angry mob"" behaviour. Mr Trump has called on the media ""to stop the endless hostility"" following the incidents. But his critics say his comments are hypocritical, as he often uses vicious language against his opponents and the press. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Stop endless hostility"" CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker was one such voice. ""There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media,"" he said on Wednesday. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders praised Mr Trump's reaction to the bomb scares on Fox News, saying: ""The president, I think could not have been more presidential."" She added that ""certainly the media has a role to play in this process"" adding that ""90% of the coverage of this president is negative despite the historic successes"". Some of Mr Trump's supporters have also said they believe the packages are part of a Democratic plot to win votes in the mid-terms, but there is no evidence for this. Every person who has been sent a package is known to be a critic of the president. Mr Soros, the target of the first package, branded Mr Trump ""an imposter, a [political] conman and a would-be dictator"" during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last year. In return, Mr Trump has pinned a number of unsubstantiated accusations on the businessman. Most recently, he accused him of paying women to protest againstBrett Kavanaugh's nominationto the Supreme Court. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Senator Booker - a possible 2020 presidential hopeful - was a vocal opponent of Mr Kavanaugh's nomination and is a frequent critic of Mr Trump. ""We cannot surrender America to Trump,"" he tweeted last year. ""We must fight."" In a similar vein, Mr Brennan and Mr Clapper have both made regular TV appearances in which they have criticised the president. Mr Brennan's security clearance was revoked last year by Mr Trump, who described the ex-CIA director as a ""political hack"" and a ""loudmouth"". De Niro, who has previously said he would like to punch Mr Trump, received a standing ovation for his verbal attack on him at this year's Tony Awards.

Here's what's happened to the main original cast members in the 23 years since the film was released. Silverstone had more misses than hits in Hollywood after Clueless, and started a sideline as a clean-living guru. She published a health cookbook and a parenting book, in which she revealed she had her son Bear's placenta turned into pills, recommended not using tampons, and received criticism for claims about the medical benefits of a vegan diet. She has also launched a range of organic vitamins. She returned to the screen earlier this year in 1970s-set TV comedy American Woman - but itwas cancelled after one season,external. Murphy played the misfit Tai in Clueless and went on to appear in Sin City, Girl, Interrupted and 8 Mile. However there was huge shock when she was found dead in 2009 at the age of just 32. The LA coroner ruled,externalthat she died of pneumonia, with iron-deficiency anaemia and ""multiple drug intoxication"" being secondary factors in her death. Dash - Dionne in Clueless - became a controversial figure after swapping acting for becoming an outspoken pundit on Fox News and announcing her intention to run as a Republican candidate for Congress. She has hit the headlines for her stance on issues regarding race. In 2016, she called the #OscarsSoWhite boycott ""ludicrous"" and said there was no need for Black History Month. Shewithdrew from the Congress race in March,external, however, blaming the ""overall bitterness surrounding our political process"". After his breakthrough as Cher's scruffy stepbrother Josh, Rudd has carved out the most successful career of them all, including roles in Anchorman, Knocked Up and This Is 40. His journey to Hollywood A-lister was completed when he joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Ant-Man for the film of the same name in 2015, for which he also co-wrote the script. And he starred in and co-wrote Ant-Man and the Wasp, which came out earlier this year. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

More suspicious mail targets Trump critics,"The package addressed to Mr Clapper was found in New York Two suspicious packages have been found in the US, addressed to a top Democrat and a former senior intelligence official. One item addressed to Senator Cory Booker was found at or near a Florida mail facility. A second was at a New York post office, addressed to ex-national intelligence chief James Clapper via CNN. The news came after 10 mail bombs were sent to prominent critics of US President Donald Trump. Ex-President Barack Obama and actor Robert de Niro were among those targeted. Security camera footage at the Florida postal facility in Opa-locka, Miami, is being scrutinised by the FBI. A bomb squad and canine unit had accompanied federal officials to the site, police from Miami-Dade County said. Meanwhile New York police described the Manhattan package as one that ""closely resembled others sent across the country in recent days"". Police have asked the public to avoid the area where the Manhattan package was found They said bomb squad personnel were on the scene, later adding that the package had been removed. Mr Clapper responded immediately to the news that he had been targeted, saying on CNN: ""This is definitely domestic terrorism, no question in my mind. ""There is some question about whether these things are functional or not - we probably have to assume they actually are,"" he added, saying the incidents were not going to silence critics of the Trump administration. But he said that anyone who had in any way publicly been a critic of President Trump needed to be on the alert and take extra precautions. The series of bomb alerts began on Monday, whena suspected device was found in the post box of billionaire businessman George Soros, a major Democratic Party donor. A total of 10 devices were sent to the following eight individuals, according to the FBI: Mr Soros Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former President Barack Obama Former Vice-President Joe Biden (two devices) Former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN Former Attorney General Eric Holder California Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters (two devices) Mr De Niro None of the devices went off. Every person who has has been sent a package is known to be a critic of President Donald Trump. The attempted bombings also come just under two weeks before the mid-term elections, with US politics highly polarised. Why Trump attacks the media Mr Trump has commented several times on the mail bombs, but in his latest tweet he suggested the incidents, which he described as ""'Bomb' stuff"", were slowing Republican ""momentum"" in early voting.

Conservatives say Democrats are to blame for the state of political discourse in the US. They say Democrats, including those who were targeted in the bomb scare, have encouraged ""angry mob"" behaviour. FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney said thorough examinations of all the packages were under way at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, near Washington DC. Several of the packages appear to have contained pipe bombs, according to the FBI. CNN quotes investigators as saying they were functional but unstable, meaning they could be set off merely by handling. They have timers easily bought at retail outlets. But experts speaking to several US media outlets have cast doubt on their effectiveness after seeing X-ray images. New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill could not confirm whether all the devices were intended to explode, but he said officials ""are treating them as suspected explosive devices"".

"Asda considering up to 2,500 job cuts","Supermarket giant Asda is to begin consultations with staff on changes that could mean up to 2,500 job cuts. An Asda representative said the firm needed to consider changing employees' roles and working hours. Asda, which has been owned by US retail giant Walmart since 1999, has agreed to merge with rival Sainsbury's. Union representatives said the news would not put workers' minds at rest about the merger and pledged to fight any job cuts. The proposed merger is the subject of an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Aldi and Lidl part of Sainsbury-Asda probe Areas of work likely to be affected in the job cuts include petrol sales, bakery departments and back-office staff, reports say. Jobs in the George clothing sales areas could also be subject to changes. Asda said it was planning the changes because of the ""competitive retail market"", which has seen supermarkets striving to compete more effectively with German discounters Aldi and Lidl. ""We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers,"" Asda said. ""We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren't easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them."" The GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said cutting the workforce made no sense and it would ""fight tooth and nail for every single job"". National officer Gary Carter said: ""These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run-up to Christmas, is doubly appalling. ""Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company.""

Green's Topshop facing boycott,"This video can not be played Retail analyst Claire Bailey says Topshop sales could be hurt Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire is facing a backlash after it emerged he had used an injunction to stop the media publishing allegations of sexism and harassment against him. The hashtag #pinknotgreen is trending on Twitter, with people calling on consumers to boycott Topshop and other Arcadia brands. Lord Peter Hain named Sir Philip in the Lords after the Daily Telegraph was prevented from identifying him. Sir Philip strongly denies the claims. In a statement on Thursday, Sir Philip said: ""To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations."" Lord Hain 'arrogant' for naming Green Sir Philip Green named over harassment claims Naming Green 'right thing to do', says Hain #Pinknotgreen was created by Scarlett Curtis, who was stopped from promoting her book in a Topshop store in London earlier this month. The fashion retailer had agreed to host a pop-up with Penguin to help launch the book, Feminists Don't Wear Pink (And Other Lies). But it dismantled the in-store display after just 20 minutes, blaming ""creative"" concerns and sparking an angry reaction on social media. Ms Curtis has now spoken out about this week's allegations against Sir Philip and her message has gone viral. Her tweet attracted hundreds of messages of support from women and men, with some calling for a boycott of Arcadia stores. Others said the allegations emphasised the need for change right across the business world. Arcadia is mainly made up of female-focused fashion retailers, such as Evans, Wallis and Dorothy Perkins, although it does include the menswear chains Topman and Burton. Claire Bailey, a retail analyst, told the BBC: ""In any cases where allegations or charges are brought against business owners, it can cause customers to feel uncomfortable spending their money with them. ""It's a difficult situation because people will have heard the story and they may form a judgment and come to a conclusion, whether the outcome is in his favour or not."" Sir Philip is also a regular at London Fashion Week, seen here in 2015 The Telegraph first reported on the injunction on Wednesday, saying a ""leading businessman"" had won a legal battle to stop the newspaper printing details of harassment claims made against him. Without naming Sir Philip, it said it had spent eight months investigating allegations of bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment. It also reported that interviews with five members of staff revealed that victims had been paid ""substantial sums"" in return for legal commitments not to discuss their alleged experiences. However, on Thursday Lord Hain used his parliamentary privilege to identify Sir Philip, saying it was his duty given the ""serious and repeated"" nature of the allegations. He also said non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) had been used to ""to conceal the truth"". Topshop sparked anger after it dismantled a pop-up to promote a feminist book earlier in October The move has attracted criticism from some in the legal profession, but Lord Hain maintained it was the ""right thing to do"". The BBC has not been able to verify the allegations contained in the Telegraph's report. Sir Philip said: ""Arcadia and I take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated. ""Arcadia employs more than 20,000 people and in common with many large businesses sometimes receives formal complaints from employees. ""In some cases these are settled with the agreement of all parties and their legal advisers. These settlements are confidential so I cannot comment further on them.""

Profile: Sir Philip Green,"This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Sir Philip Green, once known as the 'King of the High Street' is facing his biggest challenge yet. His Arcadia retail empire is teetering on the brink of collapse, the latest saga in a colourful career that once saw him branded as the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". The retail tycoon's life story to date is rich in character and anecdote, from his failed attempts to take over M&S, to a lavish lifestyle that has attracted accusations of tax avoidance. But questions now swirl over the fate of his empire, and its 13,000 employees. Despite being born into a well-to-do family in south London, Sir Philip prided himself on having worked his way to the top. His competitive streak was apparent from an early age, noticed by school mates at Carmel College, his exclusive boarding school, nicknamed the ""Jewish Eton"". School friend Tony Rauch recalls Sir Philip making a beeline for the table-tennis table at break time and losing a tussle with another boy who had been trying to get the best bat. ""He got very angry; cried a little bit,"" Mr Rauch told BBC Radio 4'sProfileprogramme in 2012. ""He wasn't physically hurt, I think he was just very angry at having lost."" Sir Philip left school aged 15 and began working on the forecourt of the petrol station that his mother managed. He then went on to learn business basics as an apprentice in a shoe warehouse. At 23 years old, he set up his own business importing and selling jeans. Staff leaving the BHS headquarters after being told the company would go into administration Stuart Lansley, the author of an unauthorised biography of Sir Philip, described those early days for Radio 4. ""He had a very mixed track record of starting up companies, and closing them down, working with other people, falling out with people,"" said Mr Lansley. ""He travelled a lot, learning a lot about the supply chain, who the cheaper suppliers were and so on - but he certainly wasn't a household name."" It was BHS, known then as British Home Stores, that marked the moment Sir Philip Green finally ""arrived"" in 2000. He paid Â£200m for what was already a slightly faded, dowdy chain. ""He borrowed very large sums of money, invested a little bit himself, and bought up companies that were relatively cheap, because they weren't doing very well. He turned them around, paying off his debt, and then tripling - quadrupling - the money he put in, in a matter of a couple of years,"" Mr Lansley said. Two years later, he copied that model when he bought the giant retail empire Arcadia, which owns brands such as Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, and of course, Topshop and Topman. Sir Philip Green's most ambitious move came in 2004, when he put together Â£10bn, much of it from investment banks, to make an offer for Marks and Spencer. Even Sir Stuart Rose - then his rival and at the helm of Marks at the time - was impressed. ""Philip is not only a first-class retailer, he is absolutely pre-eminent in his generation in terms of his financial nous and ability,"" Sir Stuart toldProfile. ""If I wanted to be slightly uncharitable, I could say that he came to the market to raise a very, very large sum of money at a time when money was cheap and freely available - but only Philip could have put that together."" As chairman of Marks and Spencer, Sir Stuart Rose (L) faced two takeover bids from Sir Philip Green (R) Sir Stuart Rose also has first-hand experience of his reportedly very short fuse. Sir Philip reportedly grabbed the then M&S boss by the lapels during his second unsuccessful takeover bid in 2004. ""There was a fairly physical occasion one morning, yes. I think tension had got quite high during the bid and Philip got upset about something,"" said Sir Stuart. ""He wasn't above ringing me up during the height of the bid and singing 'if I were a rich man' down the telephone to me, trying to point out the error of my ways [for not selling]... that I would make more money. ""He used to say, 'The only jet you know is Easyjet.'"" Sir Philip is not shy about enjoying the trappings of his success. He commutes into London from Monaco in a private jet, has a super-yacht called Lionheart, and has been known for throwing extravagant parties for friends and family in exotic places, with entertainment from the likes of Beyonce and Jennifer Lopez. What has attracted the most controversy though is not the lavish lifestyle, but his tax affairs. In 2005, his company paid a Â£1.2bn dividend to the owner of Arcadia - Sir Philip's wife, Cristina. Since she is a resident of Monaco, she paid no tax in the UK. In 2010,activists demonstrated outside the flagship Topshop and BHS storesin central London after Sir Philip was chosen by then Prime Minister David Cameron to conduct agovernment efficiency review. They thought his tax arrangements made him the wrong choice. Despite their anger, however, Arcadia has paid significant sums in corporation tax. Activists targeted BHS, Topshop and Topman in 2010 But some of Arcadia's glamour has waned in recent years. Critics say that Sir Philip, reportedly averse to electronic gadgets, has not embraced online shopping as aggressively as competitors such as Asos or Boohoo. While sales remained steady through the group, BHS was seen as the weakest link, and was sold for Â£1. Questions were asked following the sale over just how much money Sir Philip had taken out of the company in the years before. At the time, Angela Eagle, the former shadow business secretary, said: ""In this situation, it appears this owner extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from the business and walked away to his favourite tax haven, leaving the Pension Protection Scheme to pick up the bill."" BHS went bust in April 2016, leaving a Â£571m pensions deficit. Sir Philipagreed a Â£363m cash settlementwith the Pensions Regulator in 2017 to plug the gap in the BHS pension scheme.

Runway hitch delays Harry and Meghan's plane,"This video can not be played Video from on board showed Meghan and Harry's plane forced to abort its planned landing The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were kept up in the air slightly longer than planned as their flight into Sydney had to temporarily abort its landing. Another aeroplane on the runway that was too slow to move meant the charter jet carrying Prince Harry and Meghan could not land as initially scheduled. The Qantas pilot urged passengers to look on the bright side, promising ""another great view of the harbour"". The couple were flying from Tonga as part of their first overseas tour. An announcement from the flight deck said: ""There was an aircraft on the runway a little slow to roll... so the decision was taken to abort the landing."" BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond, who was on the flight, said that as the plane approached the runway, the pilot spotted that a preceding plane had not quite taxied away. ""Such aborted landings are not extraordinary events. At no point was there any risk to safety of the Duke and Duchess,"" our correspondent added.

Baby choke death cot designer jailed,"A judge said Craig Williams held a ""significant responsibility"" for Oscar Abbey's death A bed firm boss who designed a cot in which a seven-month-old baby ""choked to death"" has been jailed for three years and four months. Craig Williams's Playtime Beds Ltd sold the cot bed where Oscar Abbey got stuck trying to crawl through a gap. Oscar's lifeless body was found by his parents caught in the bed at their home in York on 3 November 2016. Williams, 37, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to two charges at Leeds Crown Court. The father of three admitted a health and safety failing to discharge the employer's general duty and a fraud charge. A jury in his trial was asked to return a not guilty verdict to gross negligence manslaughter. Judge Martin Spencer said Williams, of Park View Road, had a ""significant responsibility"" for Oscar's death, less than a week after he first started using the bed. The judge told Williams: ""You should bear the brunt of that responsibility for the rest of your life."" Williams's employee, Joseph Bruce, 31, of Kimberworth Park Road, Rotherham, was jailed for six months after admitting fraud. Employee Joseph Bruce was jailed for six months after admitting fraud Oscar's parents, Charlie and Shannon Abbey, paid Â£655 including delivery costs for the cot bed, which featured a slide. Prosecutor John Elvidge QC told the court Williams had assured them it was suitable for children aged six or seven months. Oscar had effectively ""choked to death"" after ""wriggling his body through the holes at the front of his cot bed"", jurors heard. More news from Yorkshire Mr Elvidge said Williams had demonstrated ""an utterly indifferent attitude towards the safety of small children, even after he had been visited by police in relation to Oscar's death"". Williams had continued to make the beds and did not modify his designs, the court heard. They went on to sell the same cots after Oscar's death under a new company, Magical Dream Beds. Oscar Abbey died of positional asphyxia after he got his head stuck, the court heard Judge Spencer said: ""It is pure fortune that no other child did die, and that is no thanks to [Williams] or Mr Bruce."" Williams had shown a ""flagrant disregard"" for adhering to safety regulations and had committed a ""wicked fraud"" by continuing to sell beds, the judge added. Following sentencing, North Yorkshire Police said the pair were ""solely motivated by money and were willing to sacrifice children's safety in the pursuit of it"". Det Supt Nigel Costello described them as ""selfish and callous individuals"". In a statement read during the trial, Mr Abbey, 24, said he found his son trapped face-down in the front of the cot. ""It looked like he'd tried to crawl out backwards but his head was stuck,"" he said. Mrs Abbey, 23, described in her statement how she woke up and heard her husband ""shouting and screaming: 'He's not breathing'."" ""I ran to the landing and Charlie was holding Oscar in both arms,"" she said.

Suspicious item addressed to top Democrat,"The package addressed to Mr Clapper was found in New York Two suspicious packages have been found in the US, addressed to a top Democrat and a former senior intelligence official. One item addressed to Senator Cory Booker was found at or near a Florida mail facility. A second was at a New York post office, addressed to ex-national intelligence chief James Clapper via CNN. The news came after 10 mail bombs were sent to prominent critics of US President Donald Trump. Ex-President Barack Obama and actor Robert de Niro were among those targeted. Security camera footage at the Florida postal facility in Opa-locka, Miami, is being scrutinised by the FBI. A bomb squad and canine unit had accompanied federal officials to the site, police from Miami-Dade County said. Meanwhile New York police described the Manhattan package as one that ""closely resembled others sent across the country in recent days"". Police have asked the public to avoid the area where the Manhattan package was found They said bomb squad personnel were on the scene, later adding that the package had been removed. Mr Clapper responded immediately to the news that he had been targeted, saying on CNN: ""This is definitely domestic terrorism, no question in my mind. ""There is some question about whether these things are functional or not - we probably have to assume they actually are,"" he added, saying the incidents were not going to silence critics of the Trump administration. But he said that anyone who had in any way publicly been a critic of President Trump needed to be on the alert and take extra precautions. The series of bomb alerts began on Monday, whena suspected device was found in the post box of billionaire businessman George Soros, a major Democratic Party donor. A total of 10 devices were sent to the following eight individuals, according to the FBI: Mr Soros Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former President Barack Obama Former Vice-President Joe Biden (two devices) Former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN Former Attorney General Eric Holder California Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters (two devices) Mr De Niro None of the devices went off. Every person who has has been sent a package is known to be a critic of President Donald Trump. The attempted bombings also come just under two weeks before the mid-term elections, with US politics highly polarised. Why Trump attacks the media Mr Trump has commented several times on the mail bombs, but in his latest tweet he suggested the incidents, which he described as ""'Bomb' stuff"", were slowing Republican ""momentum"" in early voting.

Conservatives say Democrats are to blame for the state of political discourse in the US. They say Democrats, including those who were targeted in the bomb scare, have encouraged ""angry mob"" behaviour. FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney said thorough examinations of all the packages were under way at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, near Washington DC. Several of the packages appear to have contained pipe bombs, according to the FBI. CNN quotes investigators as saying they were functional but unstable, meaning they could be set off merely by handling. They have timers easily bought at retail outlets. But experts speaking to several US media outlets have cast doubt on their effectiveness after seeing X-ray images. New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill could not confirm whether all the devices were intended to explode, but he said officials ""are treating them as suspected explosive devices"".

Road rage driver jailed for cyclist punchDarren Hefferman hit Gareth Marshall into oncoming traffic leaving the victim with multiple injuries.Wales,"Mr Marshall had multiple injuries following the attack A road rage motorist who punched a cyclist into oncoming traffic has been jailed for two years. Darren Hefferman, 38, overtook cyclist Gareth Marshall on Beaufort Hill, Ebbw Vale, but the victim shouted for more room as Hefferman passed him. Newport Crown Court heard Hefferman waited for Mr Marshall a short distance later, got out of his car and hit him - causing him to get trapped under a van. He pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm following the 11 January attack. The court heard Mr Marshall suffered multiple injuries, including a broken collar bone, multiple broken ribs, a damaged lung, shattered pelvis and dislocated hip. Darren Hefferman was told his behaviour was ""arrogant, stupid and impatient"" Sentencing Hefferman, Judge Richard Williams said: ""Your behaviour was arrogant, stupid and impatient. It shows a total lack of self control. ""Mr Marshall will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of his life. ""This incident arose because of your total lack of ability to control your temper. Confrontations like this between road users have to be deterred."" Gareth Marshall said he has been left ""unable to do the simplest of things"" since the attack Jamie Dewar, senior Crown prosecutor at CPS Wales, said: ""He chose to stop his vehicle, chose to get out and chose to assault another road user, resulting in dreadful injuries. ""The CPS would like to thank the members of the public who gave details of what happened. The strength of evidence presented resulted in an early guilty plea."" In a victim impact statement, Mr Marshall, from Brynmawr, said he had lost fitness and confidence, and was ""unable to do the simplest of things"". ""I dream of death or falling or being chased by a car that is trying to kill me,"" he said. X-rays show the level of work Mr Marshall needed to repair his pelvis Outside court, Mr Marshall added: ""I can't thank the NHS enough for saving me and fixing me. ""Mentally you need to be strong to get over it but you'll always be looking over your shoulder from the day when the gentleman attacked me.""

What happened to the 2nd Platoon?," As we drove into the market in al-Dora in southern Baghdad the driver announced: “Welcome to the swamp.” The place reeked of violence. It was April 2007 and the Americans, after years of unsuccessfully fighting the insurgency sparked by their invasion of Iraq, were striving one last time for some sort of victory. Tens of thousands of extra troops were going in - the Surge. Back in 2007, death stalked the streets of al-Dora. One reporter dubbed it “the most dangerous place in Iraq”. When we arrived early one evening the place was deserted. The few market traders still there opened for just a couple of hours each morning. For the rest of the day and night local inhabitants cowered in their homes while the militant Sunni opposition tried to kill both Americans and other Iraqis. Shia death squads, meanwhile, targeted the Sunnis that made up most of the local population, aiming to force them out. In autumn 2006, the Islamic State - in its first incarnation - had been declared by al-Qaeda in the west of the country. Pounded by the Americans there, some fighters had escaped to al-Dora, where they seized a foothold in the capital of Iraq. Before the invasion of 2003 the suburb had been a place of market gardens, vegetable sellers, and restaurants. Streets of low-rise family homes were laid out in a grid pattern, and the almost bucolic nature of the suburb made it popular with middle-class families. The houses had little enclosed gardens and the area was sprinkled with date palms. The parallel thoroughfares were numbered rather than named and groups of them formed city blocks. The market is to the north of these residential blocks, and marks the transition to urban Baghdad proper. Al-Dora’s semi-rural location on the southern fringes of the capital made for good quality of life before the invasion. But afterwards it made it easier for insurgents to infiltrate from the desert hinterland, and by early 2007 they were destroying its tranquility. The place became a free-fire zone. Al-Qaeda shooters picked off passers-by, death squads cruised, and bomb-makers planted IEDs (improvised explosive devices) for passing Humvees. We were on a media “embed” with 2nd Platoon, a unit of 40 men that was part of A or Gator Company of 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment (referred to in US Army-speak as 2-12 Infantry). While we were staying in the al-Dora outpost a woman out foraging for her family was brought in shot. A middle-aged man took a round too, and a younger fellow was hit while trying to make his way from door to door dodging the snipers. It happened every day. Medics swept fist-sized bullet wounds with Quikclot (a clotting agent that shut down bleeding with amazing speed), patched up these random Iraqi victims and drove them to the US combat surgical hospital in the Green Zone. “I wouldn’t stand there, dude,” one of the soldiers told me during my first morning out in the market. “There’s a sniper works this street.” The idea of the Surge was to increase the density of troops in certain key neighbourhoods, to the point where they could “police” them effectively. This didn’t just mean taking the insurgents on, it also involved gaining the trust of locals by living among them, saving their wounded, and securing schools, shops, or places of worship. The American soldiers had put themselves into the firing line in al-Dora in March 2007, creating a small, fortified base for a few dozen troops on a street corner. It became a magnet for all manner of attacks. Creating the outpost involved taking over several three-storey buildings in the crook of a Y-junction. There had been shops on the ground level and offices above. A short street or cut between the two branches of the junction had been sealed off with concrete walls, creating a secure parking area for the Humvee “gun trucks” and a place for troops to mill about. The soldiers slept up above, in abandoned offices.  Armoured Humvees stood guard in the street a hundred or so metres in each direction. But the protected bubble was very small, and the insurgents got very close. During our short stay a rocket-propelled grenade was fired into the outpost and a Humvee hit by an IED only 50m from its entrance. After arriving with 2nd Platoon, we quickly got to know its commander, as well as Platoon Sergeant Dorian Perez. Sitting drinking tea with them in an abandoned food shop within the outpost, they spoke with complete frankness about the daunting task they were facing. Just a fortnight or so before a huge bomb under the street had destroyed one of their “gun trucks”, killing two of the platoon’s soldiers. A similar blast had also killed a man from 1st Platoon. Three men dead in as many weeks. The combat infantryman or “grunt” is the basic building block of military action. But this indispensable ingredient in war is also, historically, the type of soldier hardest hit by the experience. They are the most difficult to integrate back into civilian society when it’s over. The soldiers we interviewed had other options but had chosen the infantry. They wanted to fight. Dorian Perez, a native of San Antonio, Texas, had actually been trained as a satellite communications technician when he joined up in 1992. That job could have given him an easy life in the army and a highly paid civilian occupation when he left. But in 1997 he chose to become an infantryman, in part it seems because he thought his father, a multi-tour Vietnam War veteran, would not ultimately respect him unless he did. Dorian Perez in 2007 Dorian tried to live by his own warrior code, inspired by three key texts: Robert Heinlein’s sci-fi novel Starship Troopers, Steven Pressfield’s Gates of Fire, a historical fiction about the battle of Thermopylae, and a modern translation of the samurai code or Bushido. Compared with other soldiers I met in Iraq, Dorian was unusual in the thought he had given to the business at hand. For many of the younger soldiers, the graphic TV images of the falling Twin Towers in New York, taken down by jihadist hijackers on 9/11, played a key role in their decision to fight. Nick Mazzarella, 2007 Nick Mazzarella, working for a Florida roofing contractor, talks about “9/11 fever”, motivating him. “I was young, naive and I wanted a little bit of vengeance.” He wanted education too, knowing that if he served in the army he could get government funding for college when he got out. Cody Edmondson, a native of Miami, Oklahoma, already had a degree in construction and was working in that field in Texas when 9/11 happened. A couple of years later he lost his job. Cody Edmondson, 2007 The Army recruiter asked him, “why are you here?” when he opted to join as an infantryman, since his degree could have got him into officer school. But Cody “wanted to start at the bottom and work my way up”.  He didn’t want to be giving orders unless he’d already proved he could execute them. Benjamin Jones also encountered a little scepticism at the recruiting office. Seeing his scores in the aptitude tests, the recruiter couldn’t understand why he wanted to be a grunt when he could be almost anything. Benjamin Jones in 2007 “I said I want to do stuff that they do on the recruiting videos,” Benjamin recalls, sitting in his home in Adams County, Pennsylvania, just a few miles from where he was raised, and where he signed up in 2003. For him, it was about leaping out of helicopters and closing with the enemy. All four men got more action than they bargained for. Shortly before they arrived in Iraq, warrior philosophy to the fore, Dorian gave his platoon several no-nonsense talks designed to jolt them into making the psychological transition from life on an army post in Colorado to the streets of Baghdad. He told them to understand the possibility that they might have to shoot women or children, if they were being used as suicide bombers. Dorian talking to his platoon In another speech, the sergeant asked his men to reconcile themselves to the idea that they were all already dead. “The people that try to convince themselves they are coming home,” he explains, “generally screw up and [that] costs not only them their lives but someone else.” Of the 40 men in 2nd Platoon who deployed to Iraq, three were killed and about a dozen earned the Purple Heart, the US medal for those wounded in combat. In all the unit served 15 months in Iraq - an extraordinarily long tour even by the standards of the US Army at the time, which generally set a one-year maximum. The unit would do a six-day stretch in the al-Dora market, followed by one day off back at a nearby base, and then back to the streets. Their enemy used hit and run tactics - concealed bombs, sniping, or mortars. So 2nd Platoon seldom saw their foe, but lived for many months under constant risk, with all the strain that that involved. Nick, who survived an IED blast that killed another man in his vehicle on his first patrol in al-Dora, and then had a further two near misses, was convinced he wouldn’t make it out alive. The third of those incidents happened just yards from the combat outpost, as we were filming there. Dusted by the blast, he was rushed into the sick bay for a check up, declaring himself “stoked” as he grinned into our camera. But that momentary relief at his survival hid an inner dread, that Nick reveals now. “After a while I thought, you can just write me off.” Cody agrees - they felt they were headed for oblivion. “It was just kind of easier not to worry about it.” All four men use the word “transition” to describe their homecoming from Iraq as well as their eventual return to civilian society. It wasn’t easy. That was inevitable after the intensity of what they’d experienced. Returning to their base in Fort Carson, Colorado, after more than a year away, the battalion was full of soldiers who had spent too long bottling up their hopes and fears. “Some people just got blind drunk for a month,” recalls Benjamin Jones. For his part, returning to a wife who had barely seen him in 15 months, he sensed immediately that things between them had changed. “There was quite a bit of drama with a lot of the guys drinking too much,” Nick recalls of their troubled homecoming in the Rockies, “lots of nights of crying and talking about guys we lost, and just kind of letting it all out. It seems like the only time you can do that is when you're blackout drunk.” Cody Edmondson, the only one of the four who was a father at the time, found himself trying to rebuild bridges with his wife and son. “It wasn't easy on my family and it wasn't easy on me, so there was a lot of trials.” Looking after his boy, Hunter, kept Cody focused, initially at least, but he saw other members of the platoon hit the bottle and lose control, with some ending up in jail. “It wasn’t a good result when we got home,” Cody reflects ruefully, sitting in his family ranch, an hour’s drive west of Tulsa. He left the unit in 2008 and threw himself into a new posting as a drill sergeant, trying to keep busy rather than dwelling on what he’d been through. As long as he had that forward momentum in his life, he felt able to carry on. The return of the brigade that 2nd Platoon were part of to Colorado was to become a defining moment. It went on to change the US Army’s attitude to mental health and managing the return of battle-weary troops. In late 2007 and 2008 there were a string of murders in Fort Carson by soldiers who had returned from Iraq. There were also a large number of incidents involving drink, drugs, and attempted self-harm. Did we, as leaders, understand the impact of rapid deployments?I know that I personally didn’t An army study was published in 2012 in the journal Military Medicine.  It noted “a possible association between increasing levels of combat exposure and risk for negative behavioural outcomes”. In layman’s terms, they had been asked to put up with too much for too long. “Did we, as leaders, understand the impact of rapid deployments?” asks Duane France, an officer who served on that ill-fated Baghdad tour and later left the army to establish a mental health practice near the base in Colorado. “I know that I personally didn’t.” Key to the problems was the amount of time the troops spent in combat. During the years 2004-2009, 2-12 Infantry spent not much more than two years at home, creating a battle-stress time bomb.  “The military was deploying at unprecedented rates unseen in modern military history,” comments France. Few men stayed in the unit all the way through that period of unprecedented deployments. Dorian, Benjamin, and Cody left the 2nd Platoon after al-Dora, heading for other assignments. But Nick Mazzarella stayed with it. After just one year at home, he was sent to the Pech Valley in Afghanistan for another exceptionally testing 12-month deployment. After that, he couldn’t wait to leave the military. Nick Mazzarella, 2018 “The transition wasn’t exactly smooth,” he reflects, sitting in his house in southern Florida, with an accompaniment of whining cicadas. “There's a whole lot of training on what to do when you go overseas,” he reflects, “but there's very little training on what to do when you get out, frankly, because after you get out, they're done with you.” The props that had kept him and the others steady during the trials of their deployments were kicked away one by one - the support of comrades, the regimentation of army life, and the focus provided by their mission. It was never going to be easy. “My original position was PTSD: you know it's not real,” Dorian Perez says, as he sits in a Virginia hotel. He’d always felt it was a scam. “This is something that people are using to try to get some money from the VA [Veterans Administration].” But as he carried on his duties at a training base in Louisiana he was bewildered when the sound of a firecracker used on an exercise caused him to dissolve in floods of tears. After he’d left the army in 2012, and been to college in North Carolina to study agriculture, he started noticing other symptoms. He couldn’t sleep unless he had a loaded pistol under his pillow. “My comfort,” he calls it. If Dorian woke, sometimes after just a couple of hours’ sleep, that would be it for the night. By the time he’d graduated he had taken to hiding guns in different places in his apartment, just in case. They were needed, he says, for him to hold on to - “my sense of safety”. For Dorian, on the verge of his forties as he headed into civilian life, it was seeing the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in another soldier, that finally made it feel OK to talk about it. He calls this friend “the hardest man I know, the warrior’s warrior”. For six years after coming home, this man had slept in a different bed to his wife in fear that he might strangle her in his sleep. Cody Edmondson knew all was not right - the evidence came in anxiety that he felt in everyday situations. “I didn’t want to be around people,” he explains. “I didn’t want to be around a crying baby, because of some stuff that happened over there.” His sleep was totally disrupted too. Cody Edmondson, 2005 Having kept himself busy for years, things fell apart for Cody while he was at Fort Rucker, Alabama, learning to fly an Apache helicopter. He had dreamed of being a pilot, but couldn’t cope with the occasional downtimes caused by changes in the weather or training routine. Depression and anxiety overwhelmed him. His ambition to become a pilot and his first marriage ended about the same time. Cody left the army in 2012, entering what he calls, “a dark place”. Unable to work, heavily medicated on anti-depressants, it took him more than a year to emerge. But he says he never considered killing himself. The issue of suicide hangs heavily over the veteran community though. People talk of the “22 a day” - the supposed number of veterans who take their own lives. That figure has been disputed but it is acknowledged that there is a much higher risk of suicide among veterans than those who have never fought. Nick in Florida, 2018 Nobody in the platoon “checked out” in the year it was at home after al-Dora, though Nick Mazzarella says there was one suicide after they got back from their next tour, in Afghanistan. Having learned its lessons after the al-Dora tour, the army had increased the number of mental health professionals at Fort Carson, and Nick took advantage of their services. He feels he received a good deal of help in dealing with his PTSD and in part this inspired him to study psychology when he got back to his native south Florida, having left the army in 2010. For him though it was also key that his mother and brother also lived there. “Quite a few guys don’t have the same family support network that I have,” he reflects, “they were going back to poverty, to a rough marriage, a rough relationship.” Like many soldiers returning from Iraq, the 2nd Platoon men had been damaged in various ways. The IEDs or roadside bombs that became such a feature of life during patrols in al-Dora caused enormous physical effects, as well as psychological trauma. Nick was diagnosed as suffering from TBIs or traumatic brain injuries from his brushes with death. This affected his memory, and his mother suggests that there’s much of his childhood that now seems to be lost. Cody also talks about memory problems - something he associates with the medication he was on as well as his time in combat. For Benjamin Jones, a heart problem resulted in a medical discharge from the army. Proximity to IEDs was the trigger, the army doctors thought, All four of the men - Dorian, Cody, Nick and Benjamin - have suffered from the effects of PTSD. Millions have served in America’s recent campaigns, providing mental health workers and academics alike with work for the foreseeable future. It is all part of the legacy of wars of choice, and the relationship, often uneasy, between a society and those it sends to fight. The world of the al-Dora combat veteran divides into those who were there and those who weren’t. Benjamin Jones on the break-up of his first marriage:  “It got to the point where we were just roommates”. Among the outsiders were the wives they came back to. All four of our 2nd Platoon interviewees have broken marriages. Speaking to the veterans, it seems that almost every marriage in the whole platoon went south. Their erstwhile platoon commander, an officer still serving in special operations, is one of the “very rare” marital survivors, says Dorian Perez. For Benjamin Jones the return from Iraq led to a slow realisation. “It was more like we were friends and then it got to the point where we were just roommates.” It seems hardly surprising that two young people separated with just a week or so’s home leave during the entire 15-month tour should grow apart. Those who went to al-Dora market were all too aware of their wives’ needs - physical, emotional, and social - that were being left unmet back at Fort Carson. All of the soldiers speak with some care on this topic, for fear of re-opening old wounds. Looking back on it, Dorian realises he had just been too fixated with getting through the tour to understand what was going on at home. “She realised that she no longer had those feelings for me, and I remember that put me into a bad spot.”  He’s still single, and jokingly compares dating to, “looking for an IED”. You will search in vain for definitive statistics about the fate of US military marriages but some surveys exist. One suggested that non-commissioned officers in the military had the highest divorce rate of any occupation, with 30% of marriages ending by the time they reach 30. Another found that long deployments significantly boosted the chance of breakup. For soldiers coming home, there are questions about opening up to spouses, other family members and friends. And this hints at a deep division between those who served, often in extreme jeopardy, and the vast majority of the population. Nick Mazzarella, survivor of so many IEDs, gun battles, and raids, says he can’t really talk to his kids about it - not yet anyway. “They don't know what I did and I'm not sure how much I want them to know what I did. Maybe when they're a lot older.” Travelling around the country, visiting old army buddies, Dorian has tried to guide them on what their loved ones might understand - or not. Talking with one of his former team leaders from 2nd Platoon, the man confided in Dorian that he was afraid to show his wife his true self, “how dark I am”. “My response was you know, OK, you are a killer,” Dorian replied. “We have done these things. And you can't turn it off.” To be clear, although 2nd Platoon were in numerous contacts with insurgents, in which they or their wider company lost several men, only a very small number of them killed Iraqis. Dorian surprised me when, near the end of the tour, he told me he’d never even fired his assault rifle at anyone in al-Dora, still less hit them. There were moments, for example after losing men, when emotions were running high but Cody, who led a fire team of four men, says there were no reprisals. “We did the right thing there. And I think I tried really hard to keep my guys in line… morally straight.” Although they have all been on the rack - with PTSD, lost relationships, and alcohol - two of them told me that they have seriously considered going back into harm’s way as security contractors. Both Dorian and Cody still shoot military specification semi-automatic rifles regularly - for fun - and both, it seems, miss the camaraderie and sense of purpose that comes with being on operations. Benjamin Jones, another proud gun owner, has taken the route followed by many veterans, of working in law enforcement. “When you’re infantry, that’s kind of an obvious way to go,” he notes. Soldiers who learned trades have different prospects of course. For Nick being a cop was not an option. The last thing he wanted after al-Dora and Afghanistan, “was to get shot at some more”. The story of the returning soldier is one that echoes throughout human history, chronicled by everyone from Homer, to Shakespeare, and Kipling. The soldiers have always suspected that those who lived comfortably at home don’t understand them. I still feel awkward when people thank me for my service because the first thing that comes to mind is, ‘I didn't really do it for you’ One rainy morning we went with Dorian Perez to the Vietnam war memorial in Washington DC. He compared their situation favourably with his father’s. America was so polarised by Vietnam that they had come home, “to be spat at, have dog waste thrown at them”. It’s very different today, he feels. But still there is a divide between the warriors and the society they served. Travelling around doing our interviews, you notice that serving members of the military get to board the flight first at US airports. There are posters and memorials commemorating the fallen, and one often hears the words, “thank you for your service”. It’s laudable of course, but many veterans are not entirely comfortable with it. “I still feel awkward when people thank me for my service because the first thing that comes to mind is, ‘I didn't really do it for you’,” Nick explains, “I wasn't thinking about protecting our freedom or our rights or anything like that, I was just thinking that I wanted to blow some shit up!” With all volunteer armed forces the bond between the fighters and the wider society they serve is often slender.  But while veterans like those of 2nd Platoon are still intensely loyal to one another, and defined by their experience, there are some paths back to integration, and there is something society can learn from their experience. In Benjamin Jones’s home in rural Pennsylvania, his sons are playing - Corrin, five years old, and Gibson who is not yet one. Ben with his son Gibson, named after a fellow soldier who died in Iraq Gibson is a captivating,  relentlessly upbeat little person. No, Benjamin tells people he meets, he’s not named after a make of guitar. He is named after Derek Gibson, one of the 2nd Platoon soldiers killed in al-Dora. “Derek Gibson was a friend of mine,” he explains, emotions rising, “wasn't even 21 when he died, not old enough to drink a beer, at least here in the States, old enough to die for his country.” Gibson and Walter Freeman, another member of the platoon, were killed when a huge IED blast flipped their Humvee. For Benjamin, honouring his fallen friend is a way of reassuring himself not just that their sacrifice is remembered but that these people live on. We embedded with the 2nd Platoon a second time near the end of 2007, by which time a remarkable transformation had taken place in al-Dora. At the height of the violence just 200 market traders had been opening for business, but by the time 2-12 Infantry headed for home it was back up near 1,000. Concrete walls had been erected to shut out the death squads and a local militia had been hired to keep the peace. Was it worth it? “If I say it wasn't worth it,” Benjamin reflects, the tremor in his voice betraying his inner conflict, “then I feel like I would be saying that all my friends died in vain and I can't get myself to that point.” Back in late 2007, Nick Mazzarella was quite direct in response to that question. No, it wasn’t worth even one of the guys they’d lost. Now he’s had more than a decade to reflect, his answer is a little different. “I feel like we accomplished our objective,” he says, “but I'm always going to be bitter about the lives that we've we sacrificed to accomplish that goal.” Swiftly, he moves to the wider meaning of what they did, and the moral for America. “I hope that we've learned our lesson.” And on this point we found consensus among our veterans. From Trump supporter Cody to disillusioned Obama voter Dorian, they do not believe America should act as the world’s policeman. “Why should we take care of everyone else?” Cody asks, as he sits in a family farm founded during Oklahoma’s dustbowl of the 1930s, “I mean it's time to put Americans first.” Re-married, he now has two young daughters, and for Cody, as for Benjamin, family is now the pathway into the future. Nick’s kids are a little older and he is also a devoted father. He works in a psychiatric unit now, and hopes to further his professional education so he can help fellow veterans in crisis. For Cody, meeting Miranda, his second wife, turned his life around. Her message to him was: “Look man you need to get your act together. Let's do this! …I mean she kicked my butt into gear.” Dorian Perez is single and the only one of the four without children, charting his future instead through new adventures. He’s moving to Alaska - “the last frontier” as he calls it - continuing his work for the Department of Agriculture, conserving the soil and trying to foster good farming practice. Now in his mid-forties, Dorian doesn’t do anything by halves, the former warrior is truly committed to his new work, and talks about going to the developing world, Haiti for example. But there is a part of him that cannot escape Iraq, and specifically what they left behind in al-Dora. He yearns to know what it looks like now, and how the Iraqi kids they met on patrols are doing. “The kindergarten that we built, is it still there? Did they ever finish the primary school?” Benjamin too voices the hope that the people in al-Dora will remember them as something other than the “Great Satan”. “Maybe they'll be like, ‘oh no these guys helped us they were good guys’.” Having been back to al-Dora in 2014 and filmed with local people, I can answer some of these questions. The kindergarten is indeed thriving. Although there have been sectarian tensions, for example with the re-emergence of Islamic State, it remains a far more prosperous and stable place than the killing ground we experienced in 2007. Did that justify the death and destruction? However well they manage in the future, working hard, trying to be good members of society, fathers and husbands, ultimately those are questions that the survivors of the 2nd Platoon will never escape.

Baby choke death cot designer jailedSeven-month-old Oscar Abbey was found caught in the side of his cot bed at his home in York.England,"A judge said Craig Williams held a ""significant responsibility"" for Oscar Abbey's death A bed firm boss who designed a cot in which a seven-month-old baby ""choked to death"" has been jailed for three years and four months. Craig Williams's Playtime Beds Ltd sold the cot bed where Oscar Abbey got stuck trying to crawl through a gap. Oscar's lifeless body was found by his parents caught in the bed at their home in York on 3 November 2016. Williams, 37, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to two charges at Leeds Crown Court. The father of three admitted a health and safety failing to discharge the employer's general duty and a fraud charge. A jury in his trial was asked to return a not guilty verdict to gross negligence manslaughter. Judge Martin Spencer said Williams, of Park View Road, had a ""significant responsibility"" for Oscar's death, less than a week after he first started using the bed. The judge told Williams: ""You should bear the brunt of that responsibility for the rest of your life."" Williams's employee, Joseph Bruce, 31, of Kimberworth Park Road, Rotherham, was jailed for six months after admitting fraud. Employee Joseph Bruce was jailed for six months after admitting fraud Oscar's parents, Charlie and Shannon Abbey, paid Â£655 including delivery costs for the cot bed, which featured a slide. Prosecutor John Elvidge QC told the court Williams had assured them it was suitable for children aged six or seven months. Oscar had effectively ""choked to death"" after ""wriggling his body through the holes at the front of his cot bed"", jurors heard. More news from Yorkshire Mr Elvidge said Williams had demonstrated ""an utterly indifferent attitude towards the safety of small children, even after he had been visited by police in relation to Oscar's death"". Williams had continued to make the beds and did not modify his designs, the court heard. They went on to sell the same cots after Oscar's death under a new company, Magical Dream Beds. Oscar Abbey died of positional asphyxia after he got his head stuck, the court heard Judge Spencer said: ""It is pure fortune that no other child did die, and that is no thanks to [Williams] or Mr Bruce."" Williams had shown a ""flagrant disregard"" for adhering to safety regulations and had committed a ""wicked fraud"" by continuing to sell beds, the judge added. Following sentencing, North Yorkshire Police said the pair were ""solely motivated by money and were willing to sacrifice children's safety in the pursuit of it"". Det Supt Nigel Costello described them as ""selfish and callous individuals"". In a statement read during the trial, Mr Abbey, 24, said he found his son trapped face-down in the front of the cot. ""It looked like he'd tried to crawl out backwards but his head was stuck,"" he said. Mrs Abbey, 23, described in her statement how she woke up and heard her husband ""shouting and screaming: 'He's not breathing'."" ""I ran to the landing and Charlie was holding Oscar in both arms,"" she said.

"Naming Green 'right thing to do', says Hain","Sir Philip Green issued a statement saying he ""categorically and wholly"" denied the allegations Lord Hain has defended naming Sir Philip Green as the man behind a court injunction, preventing a newspaper publishing allegations of sexual and racial harassment. The Daily Telegraph was not allowed to identify the retail tycoon but the peer used parliamentary privilege to do so. A barrister said Lord Hain's conduct was ""completely improper"", but the peer said it was ""the right thing to do"". Sir Philip says he ""categorically and wholly"" denies the allegations. The Telegraph first reported on the injunction on Wednesday, sayinga ""leading businessman"" had won a legal battle,externalto stop the newspaper printing ""confidential information"" from five employees. Profile: 'High Street king' to 'face of capitalism' Sir Philip Green named over harassment claims This video can not be played Lord Hain says he stands by his decision to name Sir Philip Green, who denies the claims It says it spent eight months investigating allegations of bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment. After he was contacted for comment in July, Sir Philip and a number of senior staff applied for an injunction to stop details being published, the Telegraph said. A High Court judge refused to grant the gagging order the following month, but Appeal Court judges ruled in Sir Philip's favour on Tuesday this week. Sir Philip, pictured with daughter Chloe, wife Tina and F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, at Cannes Film Festival last year The Telegraph also reported that interviews with five members of Sir Philip's staff revealed that ""substantial sums"" had been paid in return for legal commitments not to discuss their alleged experiences. The BBC has not been able to verify the allegations contained in the Telegraph's report. While the Court of Appeal's temporary order banning the naming of Sir Philip remains in force, Lord Hain told the House of Lords he ""felt it was his duty"" to identify the Topshop boss and that it was in the public interest. This video can not be played Lord Hain said the details were ""clearly in the public interest"" The former Neath MP said he had been contacted by someone ""intimately involved in the case"" and, given the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) ""to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying"", he felt he should speak out. Parliamentary privilege protects MPs or peers from being prosecuted over statements made in the Commons or Lords, and is one of the oldest rights enshrined in British law. Speaking later on BBC Newsnight, Lord Hain denied he was undermining a decision of the courts, saying: ""I considered it extremely seriously before I said it."" ""I'm not disputing judges' responsibilities or timing or anything like that. That's a matter for the judiciary,"" he said. ""I'm discharging my function as a parliamentarian - and what concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse."" Lord Hain said while there had been some criticism of his decision on social media, he had received ""overwhelming support - particularly from women"". By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent People will remember back to the super-injunction stories of recent years, including the case of footballer Ryan Giggs. When he was named using parliamentary privilege, it was frowned upon. Parliamentarians and the judiciary alike were very concerned that this privilege should not be used to undermine the rule of law. And a great effort was made from that time to ensure that this didn't happen again. So the judiciary is unlikely to be pleased. We have not got a constitutional crisis on our hands here, but we do have a really significant development in terms of the way in which parliamentary privilege is seen to be used in relation to court orders. Labour MP Jess Phillips said Lord Hain ""did the right thing"", adding: ""It was brave and I doubt he took the decision lightly."" But Barrister Hugh Tomlinson QC said the courts were the ""proper institutions"" for deciding the issues raised in this case. Mr Tomlinson, a founder of the Hacked Off press regulation campaign, said: ""Parliament can't trespass into areas of the courts and say we think the courts have got it wrong - and that's what Lord Hain is effectively doing."" Sir Philip is also a regular at London Fashion Week, seen here in 2015 Former Labour Home Secretary Alan Johnson also questioned Lord Hain's actions, telling the BBC there had to be a very good reason for a parliamentarian to breach the decision of three senior judges who had seen the evidence. Lord Evans, the new chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""the ability to raise issues in Parliament without fear of them being brought into the court, I think is an important safeguard in our system"". There have been calls for Arcadia chairman Sir Philip to lose his knighthood if the allegations are proved to be correct, from MPs including Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable. And Labour's Frank Field, who led condemnation of Sir Philipover the BHS pension fund scandal, said: ""The charge sheet against the knighthood is growing."" Sir Philip's recent fall from grace came after he sold the retail chain BHS for Â£1 in March 2015 and it then went into administration, leaving a Â£571m hole in its pension fund. Meanwhile, pledges to boycott Sir Philip's stores, including Topshop, have been made on social media with the hashtag #pinknotgreen, with #feministsdontweartopshop also trending in the light of Lord Hain's statement. Sir Philip Green was knighted in 2006 for services to the retail industry Sir Philip said in a statement on Thursday night that he would not comment on anything that happened in court or was said in Parliament. ""To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations,"" he said. Sir Philip said he and his company, Arcadia, ""take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated.

Philip Green's Topshop facing boycott,"This video can not be played Retail analyst Claire Bailey says Topshop sales could be hurt Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire is facing a backlash after it emerged he had used an injunction to stop the media publishing allegations of sexism and harassment against him. The hashtag #pinknotgreen is trending on Twitter, with people calling on consumers to boycott Topshop and other Arcadia brands. Lord Peter Hain named Sir Philip in the Lords after the Daily Telegraph was prevented from identifying him. Sir Philip strongly denies the claims. In a statement on Thursday, Sir Philip said: ""To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations."" Lord Hain 'arrogant' for naming Green Sir Philip Green named over harassment claims Naming Green 'right thing to do', says Hain #Pinknotgreen was created by Scarlett Curtis, who was stopped from promoting her book in a Topshop store in London earlier this month. The fashion retailer had agreed to host a pop-up with Penguin to help launch the book, Feminists Don't Wear Pink (And Other Lies). But it dismantled the in-store display after just 20 minutes, blaming ""creative"" concerns and sparking an angry reaction on social media. Ms Curtis has now spoken out about this week's allegations against Sir Philip and her message has gone viral. Her tweet attracted hundreds of messages of support from women and men, with some calling for a boycott of Arcadia stores. Others said the allegations emphasised the need for change right across the business world. Arcadia is mainly made up of female-focused fashion retailers, such as Evans, Wallis and Dorothy Perkins, although it does include the menswear chains Topman and Burton. Claire Bailey, a retail analyst, told the BBC: ""In any cases where allegations or charges are brought against business owners, it can cause customers to feel uncomfortable spending their money with them. ""It's a difficult situation because people will have heard the story and they may form a judgment and come to a conclusion, whether the outcome is in his favour or not."" Sir Philip is also a regular at London Fashion Week, seen here in 2015 The Telegraph first reported on the injunction on Wednesday, saying a ""leading businessman"" had won a legal battle to stop the newspaper printing details of harassment claims made against him. Without naming Sir Philip, it said it had spent eight months investigating allegations of bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment. It also reported that interviews with five members of staff revealed that victims had been paid ""substantial sums"" in return for legal commitments not to discuss their alleged experiences. However, on Thursday Lord Hain used his parliamentary privilege to identify Sir Philip, saying it was his duty given the ""serious and repeated"" nature of the allegations. He also said non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) had been used to ""to conceal the truth"". Topshop sparked anger after it dismantled a pop-up to promote a feminist book earlier in October The move has attracted criticism from some in the legal profession, but Lord Hain maintained it was the ""right thing to do"". The BBC has not been able to verify the allegations contained in the Telegraph's report. Sir Philip said: ""Arcadia and I take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated. ""Arcadia employs more than 20,000 people and in common with many large businesses sometimes receives formal complaints from employees. ""In some cases these are settled with the agreement of all parties and their legal advisers. These settlements are confidential so I cannot comment further on them.""

French dismiss Calais 'go-slow' Brexit fears,"The French and British governments are working towards a deal - but preparing for one not happening French officials have rejected suggestions they could resort to a ""go-slow"" policy at the port of Calais if there is no Brexit deal. The UK's Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab warned on Thursday of major disruption in a ""worse case scenario"", which might force firms to use other ports. But Xavier Bertrand, president of the Hauts-de-France region, said ensuring ""fluidity"" of trade was essential. Another official said closing Calais would be an ""economic suicide mission"". There has been widespread concern about the impact of longer border checks at Calais if the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 without a deal. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling met the mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, on Thursday to discuss French and British preparations for such an eventuality amid claims that businesses may be forced to use Dutch and Belgian ports instead to transport goods. Brexit and the booming British strawberry UK 'will pay the price' of no-deal Brexit Brexit plan to safeguard medicine supplies Responding to a question in the House of Commons about no-deal planning on Thursday, Mr Raab appeared to suggest the French could choose to create additional delays. ""We also need to prepare for the worst case scenario where the authorities at Calais are deliberately directing a go-slow approach  by supporting a diversion of the flow to more amenable ports in other countries,"" he said. Responding on Twitter,external, Mr Bertrand said closing the port of Calais or the Channel Tunnel to cross-channel traffic in the event of a no-deal Brexit ""was not envisaged"". ""Who could believe such a thing? We have to do everything to guarantee fluidity,"" he wrote. And Jean-Paul Mulot, who represents Hauts-de-France, France's northern-most region, in the UK said that while there might be delays if the event of a no-deal, it was in France's interest to minimise these.

At present, the UK's membership of the EU single market and the customs union allows for the free movement of goods, people and services around Europe. But the UK government has said it is leaving both of these arrangements as part of Brexit. The UK and the EU are in negotiations on how their final relationship will work but have yet to reach a deal on key issues. Both sides say they still want to agree a deal before the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019, but are also making plans for what happens without one. This week the National Audit Office warned that queues and delays were likely at border crossings under a no-deal Brexit, saying exporters did not have time to prepare for new rules. A ""transition"" period to cushion the UK's exit from the EU is planned to last until December 2020 - but this is dependent on the two sides reaching agreement on outstanding issues like the Irish border.

The gang was responsible for 55 drone deliveries into prisons around the country between April 2016 and June 2017. Police described the drone conspiracy as the ""biggest ever seen"" in the UK. The men were sentenced for between three and 10 years and five other gang members were given suspended sentences at Birmingham Crown Court earlier. The ringleader Lee Anslow has been jailed for 10 years The gang flew an estimated Â£550,000 worth of drugs - mainly cannabis and synthetic cannabis - along with amphetamines, crack cocaine and heroin to inmates' windows, West Midlands Police said. Prisons in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Worcestershire, Warrington, Lancashire and Liverpool were targeted. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Passing sentence on the 13 defendants convicted of conspiracy charges, Judge Simon Drew QC said: ""This was a sophisticated commercial operation and due to the high value placed on drugs and mobile phones in prisons, designed to make those of you who ran the operation hundreds of thousands of pounds in profit."" This video can not be played HMP Wymott, in Lancashire, was one of seven prisons targeted by the group Drug and mobile phone use in prisons had caused heightened levels of violence, an increase in self-harm and deaths, as well as allowing witness intimidation and illegal financial transactions, Judge Drew added. Det Insp Gareth Williams from the Prison Investigation Team said: ""This is a landmark case: It's the biggest drone drug smuggling racket into prisons ever seen in the UK.""

Homeless man sets up home in parking space,"Paul has scrubbed the floor and keeps the space clean A homeless man has turned a parking space on the fourth floor of a multi-storey into his personal ""hotel"" complete with framed pictures, bedding and a cardboard carpet. Paul Lindsay-Jones, 55, transformed the disabled spot in Truro, Cornwall, after being evicted about two weeks ago. ""I take pride,"" he said. ""Some people are on the street with just a sleeping bag but I like a bit of luxury."" The local council said it would meet to discuss Paul's situation. He said he found pictures and furnishings by raiding bins and skips around the city, with other pieces donated by charities. Paul, who is originally from Bodmin, has made a small table, and is making a sofa from two chairs. He said he planned to get some carpet next. This video can not be played Paul Lindsay Jones gives a tour of his parking space home Paul said the space, which boasts flowers and a doormat with ""Home"" written on it, was his ""own eight-storey hotel"".

""There are people living on the streets just lying on a sleeping bag. But I like a bit of luxury. It's about using your brain. ""I keep it clean and cause no problems. I'm polite with the public and the security guys have no problem with me.""

Man arrested for Magna Carta theft attempt,"The hammer made three holes in the top layer of protective glass A hammer-wielding man has been arrested after an attempted smash and grab of a Magna Carta from its display at Salisbury Cathedral. Alarms went off when the would-be thief tried to break through the glass box which protects the charter on Thursday. The suspect was held on suspicion of attempted theft of the document - claimed to be the best preserved of four original Magna Cartas. It was not damaged and nobody was injured, police said. The man was wrestled to the ground by staff when he attempted to flee after the attempted raid at 16:45 BST, the Dean of Salisbury said. The Very Reverend Nick Papadopoulos said: ""There were people around so the cry went up, it was pretty thick glass so it hadn't yielded easily despite having a hammer hit it. ""It was a great shock but everyone responded magnificently, both our staff and volunteers and members of the public. ""They raised a cry and he did not get away."" The drama unfolded just before Evensong near to closing time at the visitor centre. Dean Papadopoulos added: ""He had been carrying a hammer so our guys were very courageous. ""They were able to restrain him and they held him for 12 minutes."" The Dean of Salisbury Cathedral described his staff as ""courageous"" after they restrained the man A silent alarm was activated which alerted staff to the disturbance, he added. A 45-year-old man is being held on suspicion of attempted theft, criminal damage and possession of an offensive weapon. He has been taken to Melksham police station where he is being questioned. Magna Carta is a charter of rights agreed by King John in 1215. It is considered one of Britain's most influential legal manuscripts. Several versions were sent around the country ""as evidence of the King's decision"", according to Salisbury Cathedral's website. Best-preserved Magna Carta on show Why are there so many Magna Cartas? Cathedral given Magna Carta on a coin Only four original copies survive today, and the cathedral is home to what isclaimed to be ""the most beautiful"". The charter was put on display at the cathedral three years ago as part of an exhibition funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The charter has been removed for safe-keeping while the case is refurbished, Dean Papadopoulos said. A facsimile copy of the charter will be displayed, and the visitor centre will re-open as soon as possible. The document is displayed at Chapter House at the cathedral Magna Carta outlined basic rights with the principle that no one was above the law, including the king. It charted the right to a fair trial, and limits on taxation without representation. It inspired a number of other documents, including the US Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Only three clauses are still valid - the one guaranteeing the liberties of the English Church; the clause confirming the privileges of the city of London and other towns; and the clause that states that no free man shall be imprisoned without the lawful judgement of his equals. The British Library has two copies of the 1215 Magna Carta. Source: The British Library The historical document is encased in two glass layers, Dean Papadopoulos added. ""The layer that is closest to the document itself was completely untouched by the individual concerned, but his hammer did do some damager to the initial glass screen."" Two copies of the Magna Carta that date from 1215 are held by the British Library and go on regular display there. The Salisbury copy went on display in 2015 in the 13th Century Chapter House at the cathedral.

"'A spare room changed my life'""When I tell people about my previous life you can see their jaws drop,"" says 18-year-old Chloe.Family & Education","Chloe (r) had more than 30 foster placements before she moved in with Sarah Chapman (l) Leaving care can feel like facing a cliff edge and it is not only care leavers who say this, it is government ministers. They are launching a landmark scheme to ease the path to adulthood for some of England's most vulnerable teenagers. More than 50 organisations, including government departments and industry giants like Rolls-Royce, have signed up to the government'sCare Leaver Covenant,external, which will provide 10,000 work opportunities to care leavers over 10 years. They aim to help people like Chloe, who was in foster care from the age of 13, and now, at 18, holds down a steady job in the hospitality industry. ""When I tell people about my previous life you can see their jaws drop,"" she says. ""I thought I would end up as a drug addict and I just accepted it. It was all I thought my life would amount to."" Chloe says she had more than 30 placements in three years. She ran away frequently and ""spent a lot of time in police stations, waiting to be picked up again"". She says the right support at the right time has helped her on ""a massive journey"". ""I've grown up so much in the past year."" At 17, as the end of her time in care approached, Chloe feared she might end up in a hostel - but her social worker suggested tryingsupported lodgings through the charity Barnardo's,,externalwhere people offer a spare room to a vulnerable young person and help them on the path to independent living. The person with the spare room was Sarah Chapman, a lawyer in her early 30s, from Warwickshire. She already volunteered with Barnardo's and with the Girl Guides, so, when she heard about supported lodgings, she knew she was well placed to help. ""I enjoy working with that age group. So I thought it was a good opportunity to put my spare room to better use than just a regular lodger, and maybe help out a teenager who needed support at a quite a critical time in their life,"" says Sarah. Background checks, training and reassurances about ongoing support followed. Sarah was approved as a host and then the charity began sending potential lodgers round to meet her. ""It was a little bit nerve-wracking but, you know, part of the process, and it was a really good part, to make sure you're matching people with the right provider."" Chloe was the second girl to come round and the pair ""clicked"". ""We were very comfortable in each other's company and the conversation flowed easily. So we all agreed that she could move in."" A year on, Sarah says: ""It's been excellent."" She likes having company around the house and is impressed by how Chloe has ""straightened herself out"". Chloe says starting work was key to her transformation. She eventually hopes to move into management or run her own business. ""I like having a job. I like being busy. I don't like sitting down doing nothing."" But before she moved in with Sarah it was difficult to hold down a job because she was constantly moving home. Now she has ""somewhere I know I'm going to be able to go back to"". ""It's not like I'm going to get there and my social worker will be outside in a car with all my stuff in the back telling me I'm moving."" At Sarah's she is learning to cook and eat more healthily, to shop and budget for herself and even to save out of her wages. Sarah says there have been ""a few ups and downs... but mainly things you get living with any teenager"". ""They're not keen on washing up or cleaning or taking the bins out, but I don't think that's a symptom of coming out of the care system, I think it's a symptom of being a teenager."" Chloe admits that, initially, she had low expectations of sharing Sarah's home. ""I'd learnt the hard way not to get too excited or attached because I'd been passed around so many places. ""But this was different. Sarah let me put up posters, pictures and mirrors, and we went out shopping together to get lamps, shelves and duvets. ""For the first time I started to feel pretty good about myself."" Unlike care leavers who go straight into independent living, there's no danger of the electricity being cut off because she has run out of money and there's always enough to eat. Leaving care: The financial reality Starting university after leaving care She says she would advise any other young person offered the chance of supported lodgings to ""go for it"". Under the supported lodgings arrangements, Chloe is eligible to stay at Sarah's until she is 21 and ready to be properly independent. ""It's Sarah's home but now it feels like my home too,"" says Chloe. ""I always tell her where I'm going and what I'm doing, but it's not like she's pretending to be my mum. ""We've grown very close and we have very long talks about all sorts of things, from mundane stuff to relationships. I know that I can talk to her about anything."" Sarah agrees that substitute parents are ""often the last thing these teenagers need"". ""They're looking for an older sister, an aunt, a mentor, supportive but not mollycoddling or trying to do everything for them. ""This is the point at which they're trying to learn how to be independent.""

Woman with knife attacks Chinese children,"Police say the woman who attacked the school was carrying a kitchen knife At least 14 children have been injured in a knife attack at a kindergarten in Chongqing, south-west China.

The motive for the attack is unclear, though some reports on social media say the woman had a grievance against the government. The woman, whose surname was given as Liu, was arrested at the scene.

More millennials can get new railcard,"The new 26-30 railcard will go on sale before the end of the year - and this time it will be available to all four million eligible passengers, the rail industry has announced. During a trial in the spring, only 20,000 people were allowed to buy one. The ticket website crashed because of overwhelming demand from thousands of young people. The launch of the ""millennial"" railcard was originally announced by the chancellor in the autumn 2017 Budget. Millennial rail cards sell out Millennial railcards 'still on track' For the first time, the 26-30 railcard will be ""digital only"", meaning that passengers will need a smartphone to download it. For a Â£30 fee, the new railcard will offer one-third off most leisure fares for 12 months. However, anyone travelling before 10am on a weekday will have to pay a minimum fare of Â£12. This is the same restriction as on the 16-25 railcard. But unlike the card for younger passengers, that minimum fare will also apply on weekdays throughout July and August. Most of those with a 16-25 railcard are students, so journeys in the summer holidays count as leisure travel. There will be no fare reductions on sleeper trains, first-class and season tickets or Eurostar services. Full details - and a savings calculator - are available on therailcard website,external. If you do not have a phone, or if your phone has run out of battery power, you will be allowed to download your card on someone else's phone. However, there will be no paper version of the card. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) told the BBC a digital card was safer than having a physical version, as that was easier to lose. No firm date has yet been announced, although the RDG says it will launch before the end of 2018. During the trials in the spring, it was found that passengers took an average of six leisure journeys a month, covering an average of 400 miles in total. On this basis, cardholders could expect to save Â£125 a year. Allowing for the Â£30 cost of the card, the saving would be Â£95.

Radio 1 gets new weekend breakfast hosts,"Matt Edmondson and Mollie King will be the new hosts of the BBC Radio 1 weekend breakfast show. The pair will swap with Dev and Alice, who will take over their weekend afternoon slot. Matt and Mollie will host breakfast between Friday and Sunday as part of Radio 1'sthree-day weekend schedule. Greg James hosts the other four days. Mollie, a former member of The Saturdays, said she was ""blown away"" to be asked to co-host breakfast. ""I remember the buzz I got when I first walked into Radio 1 as a guest, 10 years ago, and that buzz is still with me now every time I step through the studio doors,"" she said. In a statement, Matt joked: ""Getting to present the Radio 1 breakfast show three days a week is an absolute dream come true, as is working with Mollie (a nightmare is technically still a dream)."" The schedule change may have been sparked by Charlie Sloth's unexpectedlyearly departure from Radio 1last week. As a result, Dev has been covering Sloth's evening show The 8th - which,according to Radio 1's website, he will continue to do for the foreseeable future. If he had stayed on breakfast, this would have meant a late-night finish for Dev on Thursdays, followed by an early-morning start on Fridays. In a statement, Dev and Alice made light of their move to afternoons. ""The thing we will really miss is setting that 4am alarm, but in time we think we might get used to it,"" they joked. ""We love doing the show together, and the afternoons have such a good energy about them - these shows are ideal for our sense of humour and the kind of things we like to talk about."" Matt has been presenting on Radio 1 since 2010 in various slots, but Mollie is newer to the station. Major schedule changes for BBC Radio 1 Greg James on breakfast and battling Taylor Swift fans Her profile received a boost after taking part in Strictly Come Dancing last year, and she officially joined Matt as co-host of his weekend show in June. Adding a female co-host to a BBC radio show with a solo male presenterisn't always a good idea, but bosses are understood to be pleased with the pair's chemistry and the reaction from listeners. The duo also guest presented This Morning over the summer while Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were away. Greg James hosts the Radio 1 breakfast show from Monday to Thursday Radio 1's decision to let their weekday DJs have Fridays off and pull the weekend schedule forward by a day was met with surprise when it was announced in April. ""I think when they broke the news to me they were expecting resistance,"" Greg James told BBC News earlier this year. ""I was quite pleased for a Friday off. I feel very lucky that I get to do four days a week and have Friday to recover and have a life and have some things to talk about for the Monday. ""So it's, for me, perfect. We were like [to management], 'Are you sure?! OK, not going to argue with that!' ""The way I looked at it was there's nothing you can do in five days that you couldn't do in four.

Caitlyn Jenner ends support for Trump,"Caitlyn Jenner accused Mr Trump of using trans people as ""pawns"" Transgender activist Caitlyn Jenner has ended her support for President Donald Trump over his record on trans rights. The ex-Olympic athlete and reality TV star said she had ""remained hopeful"" that she could work with Mr Trump's administration. Butin a column for the Washington Post,externalon Thursday, she admitted her position had been a ""mistake"". ""The reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president,"" she wrote. The president has faced strong criticism in recent days after the New York Times reported the government was considering officially defining gender as biological and fixed. Outcry over 'proposed change' to US trans law The change would rescind previous policy which eased trans recognition and would instead define gender solely by the genitalia people are born with. In her column, Ms Jenner accused the president of using the trans community as ""political pawns"". ""The leader of our nation has shown no regard for an already marginalized and struggling community,"" she added. ""He has ignored our humanity. He has insulted our dignity."" Last year,Ms Jenner told the BBC that she had been ""really upset"" by some of the president's policies, including his decision to revoke Obama-era guidance which allowed transgender students to use school toilets matching their gender identity. ""It doesn't make me regret my vote yet, but it is very disappointing and I have been very verbal about that,"" she said at the time. The same year, Mr Trump also reinstated a ban on transgender people serving in the military which had been lifted by former President Barack Obama. He later signed a more limited directive after federal judges ruled the initial ban was probably unconstitutional.

It is not the first time O'Connor, who legally changed her name to Magda Davitt last year, has publicly spoken about religion. In 1992, she sparked controversy after ripping up a photograph of the Pope live on US television. Seven years later, she was ordained by a breakaway church in Lourdes. The Catholic Church, which does not allow women to become priests, did not recognise the ceremony. The singer was ordained as a priest in 1999 Oscar-nominatedEgyptian actor Omar Sharif converted and changed his name in 1955,externalto marry his wife Faten Hamama. He was born Michel Dimitri Chalhoub to a family of Melkite Christians in Alexandria, Egypt.

Rapper Ice Cube converted to Islam in the 1990s,external. In 2017 he said he was still a practicing Muslim, but told The Daily Beast ""I might change religions three or four times before I die"". Comedian Dave Chappelle became a Muslim in 1998,external. ""I don't normally talk about my religion publicly because I don't want people to associate me and my flaws with this beautiful thing,"" he told Time magazine in 2005. ""And I believe it is a beautiful religion if you learn it the right way."" O'Connor rose to fame in 1990 with a striking arrangement of Prince's Nothing Compares 2 U. Her version of the ballad topped charts across the world and spent four weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, earning her three Grammy nominations. The music video, directed by John Maybury, consists mostly of a close up on O'Connor's face as she sings the lyrics. The visual won three Moonmen at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year, where the singer was the first female artist to win the esteemed prize of the night.

"Ryanair flight rant man 'not a racist'David Mesher was on a flight from Barcelona to Stansted when he began insulting Delsie Gayle, 77.Essex","David Mesher has apologised, saying he had ""a fit of temper"" A Ryanair passenger who was filmed launching a tirade at an elderly woman on a flight has apologised and denied he is a racist. David Mesher was on a flight from Barcelona to Stansted on 19 October when he began insulting Delsie Gayle. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain he was ""not a racist person by any means"" and it was ""just a fit of temper at the time"". Mrs Gayle, 77, and her daughter Carol Gayle have rejected his apology. In the film - viewed on Facebook more than 1.8 million times - Mr Mesher can be heard using racial slurs to Delsie Gayle and threatening to ""push"" her to another seat. He also shouts at her: ""Don't talk to me in a foreign language, you stupid ugly cow."" This video can not be played The row was captured by passenger David Lawrence, who spoke to BBC Radio 5 live about what happened Speaking on Friday, Mr Mesher, from Birmingham, said the dispute with Mrs Gayle began over getting to his seat. ""I probably lost my temper a bit and ordered her to get up,"" he said. ""I'm not a racist person by any means and it's just a fit of temper at the time, I think. ""I apologise for all the distress you've had there and since."" Delsie Gayle and daughter Carole have rejected David Mesher's apology Asked if she accepted the apology, Mrs Gayle said: ""I don't think so. You must forget and forgive but it's going to take a long time for me to get over what he has done to me."" Carol Gayle said: ""He says he wasn't racist; he wouldn't be saying words like that if he wasn't racist."" The pair have also renewed their criticism of Ryanair, saying they are still yet to hear from the budget airline. In a statement issued on Friday, the airline said it became aware of the incident late on 20 October and reported the video to Essex Police the following morning, together with the details of the passengers involved, and had written to Mrs Gayle the same morning. It said the company's Spanish cabin crew were aware of an argument between two passengers but were not aware of the racist comments until they were shown the video after the flight landed in London. The crew had followed company procedure to defuse an argument, which was to separate the passengers by offering to move one to alternative seating. Ryanair said Mrs Gayle was moved at her request, to a seat next to her daughter, and both passengers involved in the altercation confirmed they were ""OK"". The airline said it had written, both by email and letter, to Mrs Gayle to apologise. In the statement, Robin Kiely from Ryanair again apologised for the ""regrettable, and unacceptable remarks"" made to Mrs Gayle. ""We believe that by reporting this matter immediately to Essex Police, and by apologising in writing to this customer early on Sunday morning, Ryanair treated it with the urgency and seriousness it warranted,"" he said. Dion Dublin 'racially abused by woman' Snowboarder gets first Ellie Soutter grant Ross from Friends lookalike identified Officers from Essex Police are investigating and Mr Keily said Ryanair was giving the force its ""full co-operation and assistance"". The incident took place on the tarmac of Barcelona Airport before the plane departed for Stansted, and police have said they will pass on information to the Spanish authorities in due course, in line with national protocols. Officers from West Midlands Police have assisted Essex Police by speaking to Mr Mesher in his sheltered accommodation in Yardley Wood on Thursday.

RBS sees 'uncertain economic outlook',"Royal Bank of Scotland has said it is setting aside Â£100m to deal with ""the more uncertain economic outlook"". RBS is among the first big banks to make such a provision in the run-up to the UK's exit from the EU. Chief executive Ross McEwan told journalists during a conference call: ""We have to be prepared for our customers no matter what happens."" The move came as the bank reported a 14% rise in third-quarter profits to Â£448m, from Â£392m a year earlier. However, the profits rise was less than analysts had expected. Shares fell 5% in early trading. The bank also allocated a further Â£200m in the July-to-September period to cover costs for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). RBS is still 62% publicly owned after being bailed out by the government at the height of the financial crisis. It paid its first post-crisis dividendto shareholders earlier this month. ""RBS has taken a Brexit blow of Â£100m, an impairment of its assets to reflect what it believes is greater economic uncertainty,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""This serves as a reminder that the bank's fortunes are very heavily influenced by the domestic economy, and by extension, so is its share price."" Earlier this month, Mr McEwan told the BBC a no-deal Brexit could tip the UK economy into recession. He said a ""bad Brexit"" could result in ""zero or negative"" economic growth, which would hit RBS's share price. Brexit recession warning from RBS boss The Â£100m impairment provision reflects concern at RBS that some of its customers may have difficulty in future repaying loans to the bank. Mr McEwan told journalists that there was now ""a more optimistic tone"" coming from Prime Minister Theresa May in the Brexit negotiations, judging from the way she had spoken to him and other business figures on a call last week. However, he added: ""We are seeing large companies pause their investments until they get certainty."" RBS also disclosed that it had received approval from Dutch regulators to serve EU clients out of Amsterdam after the UK leaves the EU. RBS chief Ross McEwan called the results ""a good performance"" The fresh PPI provision reflected ""greater than predicted complaints volumes"", RBS said. The bank has now set aside a total of Â£5.3bn to deal with the mis-selling. In the bank's statement,external, Mr McEwan described the results as ""a good performance, set against a highly competitive market and an uncertain economic outlook"". He added: ""We are growing lending in our target markets and are in a strong position to support the economy.""

"Controversial HS2 burial site dig beginsSome 45,000 skeletons are being removed to make way for a new station terminus.London","Over 200 archaeologists and specialists are working at the site beside Euston Station Archaeological work to remove 45,000 skeletons from a burial site to make way for HS2 construction has begun. Some 61,000 burials took place at St James's Gardens between 1788 and 1853, beside what is now London Euston station. Protests and amemorial servicewere held before the site was closed to create a new terminus station. HS2 said the dig in Camden would ""add to our understanding of how this city transformed"". The burial ground is one of 60 archaeological sites along the route between London and Birmingham which is being explored prior to the construction of the Â£55.7bn high-speed rail line. HS2 said it was working with the Church of England to select a site where the skeletons will be reburied. Head of heritage Helen Wass said the dig would ""better our understanding of life and death in London's 18th and 19th centuries, shedding light on health and disease, social status and lifestyle"". The site was opened in 1788 as an overspill burial ground for St James's Church in Piccadilly. Archaeologists believe only 45,000 skeletons of the 61,000 buried there remain, with many having been removed during the expansion of Euston station in the late 19th Century. People from all walks of life, from paupers to nobility, were interred at St James's. Among the most notable people buried were: Captain Matthew Flinders,who led the first circumnavigation of Australia and is credited with giving the country its name. The English navigator, explorer and scientistcreated a chart of the land mass in 1804while he was imprisoned on Mauritius. Bill 'The Terror' Richmond,who was born a slave in 1760s New York but became a celebrated bare-knuckle boxer after moving to England as a teenager. He was an apprentice cabinetmaker before taking up boxing, proving such a success that he was favoured by King George IV and taught Lord Byron to spar. Lord George Gordon,who was a political and religious activist who led the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots of 1780, where a huge mob marched on the Houses of Parliament. Gordon was acquitted of being part of the trouble but died 13 years later in Newgate prison while serving a sentence for libelling the Queen of France. Campaigners chained themselves to trees in a park as part of protests against HS2 work The site closed following the Burial Acts of the 1850s which prohibited nearly all burials within the city limits. Many of the memorial stones were then removed and repositioned around the edges of the ground before it was reopened as St James's Gardens in 1887. Campaigners argued that building over the park would harm the local community and environment, and organised a memorial service to pay tribute to the people buried there. However, HS2 said the project would provide ""much-needed extra capacity at Euston"". A time capsule was found at the National Temperance Hospital near Euston where work is also taking place The archaeological work is described by HS2 as the largest ever in Britain with more than 1,000 people taking part. Objects have already been discovered at other sites along the route, including flints at a prehistoric hunter-gatherer site in Hillingdon, north-west London. Other digs include at a medieval manor in Warwickshire, a Romano-British town in Fleet Marston, Aylesbury, and a World War Two bombing decoy in Lichfield. The project's chief executive Mark Thurston said HS2 was ""committed to sharing as much of our cultural heritage as possible."" HS2 expects to complete all the digs including that at Euston within the next two years Station designs unveiled for HS2 route Plan for HS2's longest viaduct revealed Vicar chained to tree in HS2 protest HS2 exhumations prompt memorial service What is HS2 and why scrap the Manchester link?

Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you?,"The government's new flagship benefits system - universal credit - is causing ""unacceptable hardship"" for many of the claimants it was meant to help,a committee of MPs has said.,external The universal credit system has been made less generous since it was announced eight years ago and there are concerns 3.2 million working families could lose Â£48 a week - about Â£2,500 a year - compared with the old system. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has indicated there could bemore cash announced for the welfare system in the Autumn Budget on Monday. So will you be affected by the move to universal credit? And if so, by how much? Universal credit is a single monthly payment for people on a low income or who are out of work. It replaces some of the benefits and tax credits you might be getting now. Universal credit will replace these - referred to by the government as ""legacy benefits"": working tax credit child tax credit income-based jobseeker's allowance income support income-related employment and support allowance housing benefit While the system, first introduced in 2013, was supposed to be up and running by April 2017, it is now not expected to be fully operational until December 2023. Currently being phased in across the UK, it aims to make the benefits system simpler and more flexible - so people who are able to work are rewarded for doing so. However, it has been criticised for running over budget, causing delays to people's payments and in some cases making people worse off. By June this year, 883,000 claimants were receiving universal credit. This is about 13% of the total caseload expected when all claimants are migrated from legacy benefits. Birmingham, Croydon, Manchester, Southwark and Newcastle upon Tyne had the largest numbers of claimants at that point - between 14,000 and 33,000 in each area. Esther McVey has admitted that some working families could lose Â£200 a month as a consequence of the introduction of universal credit. But she said the most vulnerable would be protected, and people could take on more work to increase their income. Universal credit rollout delayed yet again What is universal credit - and what's the problem? In reality, whether you will be better or worse off under the new system will depend on your family and household circumstances. According to the Resolution Foundation think-tank,2.2 million families are expected to gain under universal credit, with an average increase in income of Â£41 a week.,external However, 3.2 million families are also expected to be worse off, with an average loss of Â£48 a week. The Resolution Foundation's analysis suggests the net impact on couples with children will be broadly neutral. Slightly fewer couples with children will gain (one million) than lose (1.1 million). The average gain of Â£54 a week compares to an average loss of Â£53 a week. However, the story for single parents is very different. Overall, they will lose by an average of Â£26 a week - but almost twice as many will lose (0.7 million) as will gain (0.4 million). But even within these different groups of gainers and losers, there are a wide range of outcomes, the latest Resolution Foundation's analysis suggests. The most common gains and losses for families will fall somewhere between Â£25 and Â£75 a week. For some, the gains or losses will exceed Â£100 a week, analysts say. The following hypothetical case studies of families, produced by the Resolution Foundation, give an example of how very different the impact of universal credit could be for different families with differing work statuses. In addition, whether families rent or own their own home will have an impact on whether they gain or lose. Renters are far more likely than homeowners to gain, according to the Resolution Foundation. Of the total 3.2m losers, 2.5 are homeowners. Of the 2.2m gainers, 1.6m are renters. Separate analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies conducted in 2016,found a similar pattern of winners and losers to the Resolution Foundation.,external IFS researchers found that the winners, on average, would be single-earner couples with children. The losers, on average, would be everyone else. Since the IFS analysis two years ago, universal credit has changed in certain ways not captured in their figures. However, researchers say the pattern of winners and losers remains broadly the same. Another thing to bear in mind is that benefits related to children are also changing. Under the old tax credits system, applicable in 2016-17, first-born children received Â£3,325 each year and subsequent children received Â£2,780. But as of April 2017 this changed. Newborn first children stopped receiving a higher entitlement and newborn third and subsequent children stopped receiving any support at all. Although this ""two-child limit"" imposed on tax credits is a change separate to the rollout of universal credit, universal credit will speed its implementation. As of November this year, any new claimants for universal credit will not receive any support for third and subsequent children, regardless of how old the children are. Because of these changes to child-related benefits,the IFS estimates that about 600,000 three-child families will lose an average of Â£2,500 a year,,externalwhile about 300,000 families with four or more children will lose Â£7,000 on average. Most of those affected families are in work. Claimants have experienced financial difficulties as a result of the move to the new system. In the the Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) own survey of full-service claimants, published in June this year,four in 10 said they were experiencing problems keeping up with bills and credit commitments.,external A report by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, released on Friday, said universal credit was taking too long to pay people the money they needed and that the package of support to help them adjust was ""not fit for purpose"". The National Audit Office (NAO), which oversees government spending and assessed universal credit's progress earlier this year,said vulnerable groups had struggled with the move to the new system for a number of reasons.,external Claimants didn't have enough savings to last until their first payment was made, they had problems with monthly budgeting because of fluctuating universal credit payments, and they faced difficulties making and managing claims online, because of a lack of digital accessÂ and skills. The NAO reported how in three of the four areas it visited and for which data was available, the use of foodbanks had increased more rapidly where universal credit's full service had been rolled out. This corresponded with research by the Trussell Trust, which suggested upsurges of 30% in foodbank use in the six months after universal credit rolled out to an area, compared with 12% in non-universal credit areas. The NAO also found that local authorities, housing associations and landlords had seen an increase in rent arrears since universal credit's introduction. At one housing association looked at by the DWP, average rent arrears increased as claimants waited a month for their first payment. On average this started to plateau 10 to 12 weeks following a claim, when people started to repay their debts. Responding to these issues, the DWP announced that from April 2018 those already on housing benefit would continue to receive their award for the first two weeks of their universal credit claim to ease the transition to the new system. It is not yet known what impact this has had. This week, a group of single mothers also told the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee how the new system was putting them at risk of debt because they had to pay childcare costs upfront and wait as long as six weeks to get reimbursed. Vikki Waterman, 34, who has two young daughters, said she had to pay Â£1,300 for childcare before she returned to work, which the universal credit system took five weeks to repay. ""We want to be able to go to work and to provide for our own families, and at the minute it seems as if there is a roadblock everywhere we turn,"" she told MPs. The government is facing growing calls from Conservative MPs - including the architect of the system Iain Duncan Smith - to scrap a promised income tax cut and instead pump more more money into universal credit. Former Prime MinisterJohn Major has likened the system to the hated poll tax- the policy that helped end Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, part of the coalition team that launched the welfare programme, has also argued that a Â£5bn cash injection is required to ensure the system reaches its original aims of encouraging more people into work and simplifying the system. But the DWP insists universal credit is working and that people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. It says the programme willincrease the number of people in work by around 200,000 and bring in a Â£34bn return over 10 years.,external However, the NAOsaid in its report that both these benefits were impossible to prove at this stage.,external Prime Minister Theresa May defended the system in Parliament on Wednesday, saying there was Â£3.1bn set aside for additional support for people transitioning to the new system. ""We are not replicating the old system, because the old system did not work,"" she told MPs. ""This is a system that helps people into work and makes sure work pays."" Esther McVey has reportedly raised concerns with ministers about funding ahead of the Budget next week. Further information: More details about universal credit can be found on the DWPs'Understanding universal credit,externalwebsite. There is also information aimed atclaimants, landlords and employers.,external Citizens Advice, which will receive government funding from April 2019 to support people claiming universal credit, also has backgroundinformation about how to apply.,external Universal credit rollout delayed yet again How are universal credit rules changing?

Bomb squad searches Florida post officeActor Robert De Niro and Vice-President Joe Biden are the latest to receive suspected bombs by post.US & Canada,"New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill (centre), New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (left) and FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney (right) brief reporters The FBI has searched a mail facility in Florida, as investigators try to find out who is behind a series of crude explosive packages targeting several prominent Democrats. Devices have been sent to eight high-profile people, including ex-President Barack Obama and actor Robert De Niro. US officials say some of the packages appear to have been sent from a postal centre in north-western Miami. The FBI has not yet released any details of their investigation. Similar packages have also been sent to former Vice-President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, among others. What we know about US mail bomb threats Pence vows to punish senders Security camera footage at the postal facility in Opa-locka, Miami, is being scrutinised. A bomb squad and canine unit had accompanied federal officials to the site, police from Miami-Dade County said. This video can not be played A specialist ""total containment vehicle"" removes a suspect package sent to Robert De Niro On Thursday evening, the Time Warner Center in New York was evacuated after reports of a suspicious package, but it was later declared a false alarm. The building is home to news network CNN, which received one of the devices by post the previous day. FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney said thorough examinations of all the packages were under way at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, near Washington DC. Several of the packages appear to have contained pipe bombs, according to the FBI. CNN quotes investigators as saying they were functional but unstable, meaning they could be set off merely by handling. They have timers easily bought at retail outlets. Ten packages were dispatched - most with a return address of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, her last name misspelt But experts speaking to several US media outlets have cast doubt on their effectiveness after seeing X-ray images. Anthony May, a former government bomb expert, told NPR the packages contained only one set of batteries - not enough to trigger the explosive. Earlier, Mr Sweeney confirmed that white powder found inside the package sent to CNN ""did not present a biological threat"". New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill could not confirm whether all the devices were intended to explode, but he said officials ""are treating them as suspected explosive devices"". ""This has to be taken with the utmost seriousness,"" he said. ""As far as a hoax device? We're not treating it that way."" Mr O'Neill added that authorities ""do not know at this time"" whether there were additional devices in the mail. On Thursday morning, the FBI said Mr Biden had received two suspect packages and a similar package was found at a New York restaurant owned by Mr De Niro. The series of bomb alerts began on Monday, whena suspected device was found in the post box of billionaire businessman George Soros, a major Democratic Party donor. Devices were sent to the following eight individuals, according to the FBI: Mr Soros Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former President Barack Obama Former Vice-President Joe Biden Former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN Former Attorney General Eric Holder California Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters Mr De Niro None of the devices went off. A suspected explosive device was found at a building in Manhattan early on Thursday, local time. It is home to Mr De Niro's production company and the Tribeca Grill restaurant. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio praised the ""really quick-witted work of a security guard"" who alerted authorities. The Academy Award-winning actor has been a vocal critic of President Trump According to the Associated Press, the security guard was off work on Thursday and had seen an image in a news report of the packages others had received. That individual then recalled spotting something similar in the building's mailroom and immediately called authorities who removed the device at about 06:30 local time (10:30 GMT), AP reports. CNN's New York office was evacuated on Wednesday morning after the package addressed to Mr Brennan was found in its mailroom. Every person who has has been sent a package is known to be a critic of President Donald Trump. The attempted bombings also come just under two weeks before the mid-term elections, with US politics highly polarised. Why Trump attacks the media On Wednesday, President Trump responded to the unfolding news of the suspect packages by calling for more civility in public life, and urging politicians to stop treating their opponents as ""morally defective"". This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Stop endless hostility"" His critics called his remarks hypocritical, and former CIA Director John Brennan tweeted to him on Thursday: ""Stop blaming others.

Controversial HS2 burial site dig begins,"Over 200 archaeologists and specialists are working at the site beside Euston Station Archaeological work to remove 45,000 skeletons from a burial site to make way for HS2 construction has begun. Some 61,000 burials took place at St James's Gardens between 1788 and 1853, beside what is now London Euston station. Protests and amemorial servicewere held before the site was closed to create a new terminus station. HS2 said the dig in Camden would ""add to our understanding of how this city transformed"". The burial ground is one of 60 archaeological sites along the route between London and Birmingham which is being explored prior to the construction of the Â£55.7bn high-speed rail line. HS2 said it was working with the Church of England to select a site where the skeletons will be reburied. Head of heritage Helen Wass said the dig would ""better our understanding of life and death in London's 18th and 19th centuries, shedding light on health and disease, social status and lifestyle"". The site was opened in 1788 as an overspill burial ground for St James's Church in Piccadilly. Archaeologists believe only 45,000 skeletons of the 61,000 buried there remain, with many having been removed during the expansion of Euston station in the late 19th Century. People from all walks of life, from paupers to nobility, were interred at St James's. Among the most notable people buried were: Captain Matthew Flinders,who led the first circumnavigation of Australia and is credited with giving the country its name. The English navigator, explorer and scientistcreated a chart of the land mass in 1804while he was imprisoned on Mauritius. Bill 'The Terror' Richmond,who was born a slave in 1760s New York but became a celebrated bare-knuckle boxer after moving to England as a teenager. He was an apprentice cabinetmaker before taking up boxing, proving such a success that he was favoured by King George IV and taught Lord Byron to spar. Lord George Gordon,who was a political and religious activist who led the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots of 1780, where a huge mob marched on the Houses of Parliament. Gordon was acquitted of being part of the trouble but died 13 years later in Newgate prison while serving a sentence for libelling the Queen of France. Campaigners chained themselves to trees in a park as part of protests against HS2 work The site closed following the Burial Acts of the 1850s which prohibited nearly all burials within the city limits. Many of the memorial stones were then removed and repositioned around the edges of the ground before it was reopened as St James's Gardens in 1887. Campaigners argued that building over the park would harm the local community and environment, and organised a memorial service to pay tribute to the people buried there. However, HS2 said the project would provide ""much-needed extra capacity at Euston"". A time capsule was found at the National Temperance Hospital near Euston where work is also taking place The archaeological work is described by HS2 as the largest ever in Britain with more than 1,000 people taking part. Objects have already been discovered at other sites along the route, including flints at a prehistoric hunter-gatherer site in Hillingdon, north-west London. Other digs include at a medieval manor in Warwickshire, a Romano-British town in Fleet Marston, Aylesbury, and a World War Two bombing decoy in Lichfield. The project's chief executive Mark Thurston said HS2 was ""committed to sharing as much of our cultural heritage as possible."" HS2 expects to complete all the digs including that at Euston within the next two years Station designs unveiled for HS2 route Plan for HS2's longest viaduct revealed Vicar chained to tree in HS2 protest HS2 exhumations prompt memorial service What is HS2 and why scrap the Manchester link?

"Universal Credit: Will benefit changes affect you?The benefit system is causing ""unacceptable hardship"" but officials refuse to listen, say MPs.UK","The government's new flagship benefits system - universal credit - is causing ""unacceptable hardship"" for many of the claimants it was meant to help,a committee of MPs has said.,external The universal credit system has been made less generous since it was announced eight years ago and there are concerns 3.2 million working families could lose Â£48 a week - about Â£2,500 a year - compared with the old system. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has indicated there could bemore cash announced for the welfare system in the Autumn Budget on Monday. So will you be affected by the move to universal credit? And if so, by how much? Universal credit is a single monthly payment for people on a low income or who are out of work. It replaces some of the benefits and tax credits you might be getting now. Universal credit will replace these - referred to by the government as ""legacy benefits"": working tax credit child tax credit income-based jobseeker's allowance income support income-related employment and support allowance housing benefit While the system, first introduced in 2013, was supposed to be up and running by April 2017, it is now not expected to be fully operational until December 2023. Currently being phased in across the UK, it aims to make the benefits system simpler and more flexible - so people who are able to work are rewarded for doing so. However, it has been criticised for running over budget, causing delays to people's payments and in some cases making people worse off. By June this year, 883,000 claimants were receiving universal credit. This is about 13% of the total caseload expected when all claimants are migrated from legacy benefits. Birmingham, Croydon, Manchester, Southwark and Newcastle upon Tyne had the largest numbers of claimants at that point - between 14,000 and 33,000 in each area. Esther McVey has admitted that some working families could lose Â£200 a month as a consequence of the introduction of universal credit. But she said the most vulnerable would be protected, and people could take on more work to increase their income. Universal credit rollout delayed yet again What is universal credit - and what's the problem? In reality, whether you will be better or worse off under the new system will depend on your family and household circumstances. According to the Resolution Foundation think-tank,2.2 million families are expected to gain under universal credit, with an average increase in income of Â£41 a week.,external However, 3.2 million families are also expected to be worse off, with an average loss of Â£48 a week. The Resolution Foundation's analysis suggests the net impact on couples with children will be broadly neutral. Slightly fewer couples with children will gain (one million) than lose (1.1 million). The average gain of Â£54 a week compares to an average loss of Â£53 a week. However, the story for single parents is very different. Overall, they will lose by an average of Â£26 a week - but almost twice as many will lose (0.7 million) as will gain (0.4 million). But even within these different groups of gainers and losers, there are a wide range of outcomes, the latest Resolution Foundation's analysis suggests. The most common gains and losses for families will fall somewhere between Â£25 and Â£75 a week. For some, the gains or losses will exceed Â£100 a week, analysts say. The following hypothetical case studies of families, produced by the Resolution Foundation, give an example of how very different the impact of universal credit could be for different families with differing work statuses. In addition, whether families rent or own their own home will have an impact on whether they gain or lose. Renters are far more likely than homeowners to gain, according to the Resolution Foundation. Of the total 3.2m losers, 2.5 are homeowners. Of the 2.2m gainers, 1.6m are renters. Separate analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies conducted in 2016,found a similar pattern of winners and losers to the Resolution Foundation.,external IFS researchers found that the winners, on average, would be single-earner couples with children. The losers, on average, would be everyone else. Since the IFS analysis two years ago, universal credit has changed in certain ways not captured in their figures. However, researchers say the pattern of winners and losers remains broadly the same. Another thing to bear in mind is that benefits related to children are also changing. Under the old tax credits system, applicable in 2016-17, first-born children received Â£3,325 each year and subsequent children received Â£2,780. But as of April 2017 this changed. Newborn first children stopped receiving a higher entitlement and newborn third and subsequent children stopped receiving any support at all. Although this ""two-child limit"" imposed on tax credits is a change separate to the rollout of universal credit, universal credit will speed its implementation. As of November this year, any new claimants for universal credit will not receive any support for third and subsequent children, regardless of how old the children are. Because of these changes to child-related benefits,the IFS estimates that about 600,000 three-child families will lose an average of Â£2,500 a year,,externalwhile about 300,000 families with four or more children will lose Â£7,000 on average. Most of those affected families are in work. Claimants have experienced financial difficulties as a result of the move to the new system. In the the Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) own survey of full-service claimants, published in June this year,four in 10 said they were experiencing problems keeping up with bills and credit commitments.,external A report by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, released on Friday, said universal credit was taking too long to pay people the money they needed and that the package of support to help them adjust was ""not fit for purpose"". The National Audit Office (NAO), which oversees government spending and assessed universal credit's progress earlier this year,said vulnerable groups had struggled with the move to the new system for a number of reasons.,external Claimants didn't have enough savings to last until their first payment was made, they had problems with monthly budgeting because of fluctuating universal credit payments, and they faced difficulties making and managing claims online, because of a lack of digital accessÂ and skills. The NAO reported how in three of the four areas it visited and for which data was available, the use of foodbanks had increased more rapidly where universal credit's full service had been rolled out. This corresponded with research by the Trussell Trust, which suggested upsurges of 30% in foodbank use in the six months after universal credit rolled out to an area, compared with 12% in non-universal credit areas. The NAO also found that local authorities, housing associations and landlords had seen an increase in rent arrears since universal credit's introduction. At one housing association looked at by the DWP, average rent arrears increased as claimants waited a month for their first payment. On average this started to plateau 10 to 12 weeks following a claim, when people started to repay their debts. Responding to these issues, the DWP announced that from April 2018 those already on housing benefit would continue to receive their award for the first two weeks of their universal credit claim to ease the transition to the new system. It is not yet known what impact this has had. This week, a group of single mothers also told the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee how the new system was putting them at risk of debt because they had to pay childcare costs upfront and wait as long as six weeks to get reimbursed. Vikki Waterman, 34, who has two young daughters, said she had to pay Â£1,300 for childcare before she returned to work, which the universal credit system took five weeks to repay. ""We want to be able to go to work and to provide for our own families, and at the minute it seems as if there is a roadblock everywhere we turn,"" she told MPs. The government is facing growing calls from Conservative MPs - including the architect of the system Iain Duncan Smith - to scrap a promised income tax cut and instead pump more more money into universal credit. Former Prime MinisterJohn Major has likened the system to the hated poll tax- the policy that helped end Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, part of the coalition team that launched the welfare programme, has also argued that a Â£5bn cash injection is required to ensure the system reaches its original aims of encouraging more people into work and simplifying the system. But the DWP insists universal credit is working and that people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. It says the programme willincrease the number of people in work by around 200,000 and bring in a Â£34bn return over 10 years.,external However, the NAOsaid in its report that both these benefits were impossible to prove at this stage.,external Prime Minister Theresa May defended the system in Parliament on Wednesday, saying there was Â£3.1bn set aside for additional support for people transitioning to the new system. ""We are not replicating the old system, because the old system did not work,"" she told MPs. ""This is a system that helps people into work and makes sure work pays."" Esther McVey has reportedly raised concerns with ministers about funding ahead of the Budget next week. Further information: More details about universal credit can be found on the DWPs'Understanding universal credit,externalwebsite. There is also information aimed atclaimants, landlords and employers.,external Citizens Advice, which will receive government funding from April 2019 to support people claiming universal credit, also has backgroundinformation about how to apply.,external Universal credit rollout delayed yet again How are universal credit rules changing?

Meghan said she ""knew at the onset"" that she wanted a bateau neckline and a cropped sleeve. The gown and veil were created after 3,900 hours of work by 50 people. They are now the star attraction of the Windsor Castle exhibition, A Royal Wedding: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex. It features recordings of personal stories from Prince Harry and Meghan about their big day, including a ""surreal"" meeting with the Queen and the ""miracle"" of ensuring 10 bridesmaids and pageboys behaved. The royal couple, who married in May, are currently on their first official tour of Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific. Of her Givenchy wedding dress, the duchess said in the exhibition commentary: ""I had a very clear vision of what I wanted for the day, and what I wanted the dress to look like. ""So what was amazing in working with Clare is that sometimes you'll find designers try to push you in a different direction. ""But she just completely respected what I wanted to see for the day, and she wanted to bring that to life for me."" Meghan's dress in detail Meghan reveals her 'something blue' Royal couple given their first baby gift Tonga rolls out red carpet for royal visit The duchess said she wanted a ""very timeless, classic feeling"" to the gown, which she hoped would be ""modest"" with respect to the fact they would be married in Windsor Castle's St George's Chapel. ""I knew that the tailoring was so key, because the dress itself would be so covered up,"" she said. The white dress' luminosity is because of the double-bonded silk cady - fabric woven on both sides of the loom. The duchess's veil was embroidered with flowers from each of the 53 Commonwealth nations. Meghan said they realised the day would be what Prince Harry called a ""global wedding"", but featuring personal choices would make it more ""intimate"". She has previously revealed that her ""something blue"" was a piece of a dress worn on her first date with Prince Harry that was stitched somewhere inside the gown. She praised the designer, saying Ms Waight Keller ticked ""all the boxes"" from being British, to reflect the duchess's new home, and a woman, to working for Givenchy as artistic director. This video can not be played ""Really proud"": Meghan's designer Clare Waight Keller from Givenchy describes the dress The duchess wore Queen Mary's diamond and platinum bandeau tiara, lent to her by the Queen, on her wedding day and which is also displayed in the exhibition. Visiting the Queen to choose a headpiece was ""an incredibly surreal day,"" she said. The Duke of Sussex, who joined Meghan for the visit, joked in the commentary that it was ""every girl's dream"" to try on a tiara and the one that was picked was ""the one that looked the best... without question"". ""I shouldn't have really even been there, but such an incredible loan by my grandmother, it was very sweet,"" he said. His commentary revealed other touching stories from their big day, including how a cold-snap had meant there were fewer flowers to pick for his wife's bouquet. The duke also spoke on the commentary about how he picked Handel's Eternal Source Of Light Divine to be the music his wife walked down the aisle to. He said he was looking for ""something completely different"" and he ""ended up stumbling across this piece of music"". ""Both of us, wherever we are, whatever we're doing, we can close our eyes, listen to that music and take ourselves straight back to that moment,"" he said. ""It's a beautiful thing for both of us.""

Bomb squad searches Florida post office,"New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill (centre), New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (left) and FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney (right) brief reporters The FBI has searched a mail facility in Florida, as investigators try to find out who is behind a series of crude explosive packages targeting several prominent Democrats. Devices have been sent to eight high-profile people, including ex-President Barack Obama and actor Robert De Niro. US officials say some of the packages appear to have been sent from a postal centre in north-western Miami. The FBI has not yet released any details of their investigation. Similar packages have also been sent to former Vice-President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, among others. What we know about US mail bomb threats Pence vows to punish senders Security camera footage at the postal facility in Opa-locka, Miami, is being scrutinised. A bomb squad and canine unit had accompanied federal officials to the site, police from Miami-Dade County said. This video can not be played A specialist ""total containment vehicle"" removes a suspect package sent to Robert De Niro On Thursday evening, the Time Warner Center in New York was evacuated after reports of a suspicious package, but it was later declared a false alarm. The building is home to news network CNN, which received one of the devices by post the previous day. FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney said thorough examinations of all the packages were under way at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, near Washington DC. Several of the packages appear to have contained pipe bombs, according to the FBI. CNN quotes investigators as saying they were functional but unstable, meaning they could be set off merely by handling. They have timers easily bought at retail outlets. Ten packages were dispatched - most with a return address of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, her last name misspelt But experts speaking to several US media outlets have cast doubt on their effectiveness after seeing X-ray images. Anthony May, a former government bomb expert, told NPR the packages contained only one set of batteries - not enough to trigger the explosive. Earlier, Mr Sweeney confirmed that white powder found inside the package sent to CNN ""did not present a biological threat"". New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill could not confirm whether all the devices were intended to explode, but he said officials ""are treating them as suspected explosive devices"". ""This has to be taken with the utmost seriousness,"" he said. ""As far as a hoax device? We're not treating it that way."" Mr O'Neill added that authorities ""do not know at this time"" whether there were additional devices in the mail. On Thursday morning, the FBI said Mr Biden had received two suspect packages and a similar package was found at a New York restaurant owned by Mr De Niro. The series of bomb alerts began on Monday, whena suspected device was found in the post box of billionaire businessman George Soros, a major Democratic Party donor. Devices were sent to the following eight individuals, according to the FBI: Mr Soros Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former President Barack Obama Former Vice-President Joe Biden Former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN Former Attorney General Eric Holder California Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters Mr De Niro None of the devices went off. A suspected explosive device was found at a building in Manhattan early on Thursday, local time. It is home to Mr De Niro's production company and the Tribeca Grill restaurant. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio praised the ""really quick-witted work of a security guard"" who alerted authorities. The Academy Award-winning actor has been a vocal critic of President Trump According to the Associated Press, the security guard was off work on Thursday and had seen an image in a news report of the packages others had received. That individual then recalled spotting something similar in the building's mailroom and immediately called authorities who removed the device at about 06:30 local time (10:30 GMT), AP reports. CNN's New York office was evacuated on Wednesday morning after the package addressed to Mr Brennan was found in its mailroom. Every person who has has been sent a package is known to be a critic of President Donald Trump. The attempted bombings also come just under two weeks before the mid-term elections, with US politics highly polarised. Why Trump attacks the media On Wednesday, President Trump responded to the unfolding news of the suspect packages by calling for more civility in public life, and urging politicians to stop treating their opponents as ""morally defective"". This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Stop endless hostility"" His critics called his remarks hypocritical, and former CIA Director John Brennan tweeted to him on Thursday: ""Stop blaming others. Look in the mirror. Your inflammatory rhetoric, insults, lies, & encouragement of physical violence are disgraceful."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It is not the first time O'Connor, who legally changed her name to Magda Davitt last year, has publicly spoken about religion. In 1992, she sparked controversy after ripping up a photograph of the Pope live on US television. Seven years later, she was ordained by a breakaway church in Lourdes. The Catholic Church, which does not allow women to become priests, did not recognise the ceremony. The singer was ordained as a priest in 1999 Oscar-nominatedEgyptian actor Omar Sharif converted and changed his name in 1955,externalto marry his wife Faten Hamama. He was born Michel Dimitri Chalhoub to a family of Melkite Christians in Alexandria, Egypt.

Comedian Dave Chappelle became a Muslim in 1998,external. ""I don't normally talk about my religion publicly because I don't want people to associate me and my flaws with this beautiful thing,"" he told Time magazine in 2005. ""And I believe it is a beautiful religion if you learn it the right way."" O'Connor rose to fame in 1990 with a striking arrangement of Prince's Nothing Compares 2 U. Her version of the ballad topped charts across the world and spent four weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, earning her three Grammy nominations. The music video, directed by John Maybury, consists mostly of a close up on O'Connor's face as she sings the lyrics. The visual won three Moonmen at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year, where the singer was the first female artist to win the esteemed prize of the night.

Google sacks dozens over harassment,"Android creator Andy Rubin left Google in 2014 Google has sacked 48 people including 13 senior managers over sexual harassment claims since 2016. In aletter to employees,external, chief executive Sundar Pichai said the tech giant was taking a ""hard line"" on inappropriate conduct. The letter was in response to a New York Times report thatAndroid creator Andy Rubin received a $90m exit package despite facing misconduct allegations.,external A spokesman for Mr Rubin denied the allegations, the newspaper said. Sam Singer said Mr Rubin decided to leave Google in 2014 to launch a venture capital firm and technology incubator called Playground. He was given what the paper described as a ""hero's farewell"" when he departed. Google sued over 'male discrimination' Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem? Mr Pichai's letter said the New York Times story was ""difficult to read"" and that Google was ""dead serious"" about providing a ""safe and inclusive workplace"". ""We want to assure you that we review every single complaint about sexual harassment or inappropriate conduct, we investigate and we take action,"" he continued. None of the employees dismissed in the past two years had received an exit package, Mr Pichai added. According to the New York Times report, two unnamed Google executives said then-chief executive Larry Page asked Mr Rubin to resign after the company confirmed a complaint by a female employee about a sexual encounter in a hotel room in 2013. A Google investigation found the woman's complaint to be credible, the paper reported, but the company has not confirmed this. Mr Rubin has said he did not engage in misconduct and left Google of his own accord. The claims will add to the growing chorus denouncing sexist culture in male-dominated Silicon Valley.

'Alarming' numbers of Tube users fainting,"The most common day of the week for people fainting is Monday, closely followed by Thursday, data shows Hundreds of commuters have fainted on the London Underground during morning rush hours, the BBC has found. Since 2016, 825 people have fainted or felt faint while travelling on the Tube between 08:00 and 08:59, Transport for London (TfL) data shows. The RMT union described the numbers of people fainting as ""alarming"". Passengers raised concerns about the heat and overcrowding, but TfL insisted it ""constantly"" tried to keep temperatures down. Figures obtained by the BBC showed the most common day of the week for people fainting was Monday, closely followed by Thursday. King's Cross St Pancras, the busiest station on the Tube network, recorded the highest number of fainting incidents between January 2016 and May 2018, followed by Green Park and Liverpool Street. During the summers of 2017 and 2018, temperatures on the Tube soared to more than 35Â°C (95F) - hotter than theEuropean Union limit of 30Â°C (86F) for transporting cattle. The RMT said transporting humans in such excessive heat was dangerous and claimed a lack of air conditioning on Tube trains was a ""huge contributor"" to the amount of people fainting. General secretary Mick Cash added: ""Overcrowding on Tube and rail services is a daily nightmare for thousands of passengers and its no surprise that more people are passing out."" Nearly three billion journeys were made on London's Underground network in 2017 Earlier this year, commuter Holly Brown, from Putney, felt temperatures at Oxford Circus Tube station were ""unhealthily high"". ""I have fainted a few times on the Tube,"" she said. ""Notably in the summer but also in the winter when there are way too many people packed into the carriages. ""People genuinely can't breathe at times. I was once crushed between two large men who pushed on to the train at Liverpool Street - which was already so packed. ""I was so squished that the pressure on my chest and the lack of air caused me to faint."" The 23-year-old said she fainted while standing up because the Tube was so crowded. ""Something needs to be done,"" she added. ""Whether more carriages are added, or a better air conditioning system is put in place. As it stands at the moment, it's very dangerous."" Similarly, London student Tia Jones said she fainted for the first time in her life on an overcrowded Tube into central London. Tia Jones said she fainted for the first time in her life on an overcrowded London Tube train ""In the minutes I got on the Tube it went from really cold outside to really hot on the Jubilee Line and I started to feel quite faint because of the heat"", she said. ""There should be some kind of cut off point to how many people you can cram onto this tin that we travel to and from work in."" In July, Chris Taggart, head of operations on the Central Line, addressed the worries of passengers who felt temperatures were too high. When asked about plans to solve the ""unacceptably hot conditions"", Mr Taggart said new trains with improved air conditioning would be launched in 2030.

Another commuter, Mark Peters, 34, from West Ruislip, said he ""blacked out"" as temperatures became ""unbearable"". ""I just remember feeling overwhelmingly warm,"" he said. ""It just got worse and worse as more and more people got on to the Tube. ""I wear a suit for work and had taken my jacket off but that wasn't helping. The next thing I knew I had blacked out. ""I can't remember the last time I fainted, so it came as a real shock to me."" Many disgruntled passengers complained of the heat on the Tube - with many taking to social media to thank those who helped them when they fainted. Allow Twitter content?

Sir Philip Green named over harassment claims,"Sir Philip Green at the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix in May 2014 Retail billionaire Sir Philip Green has been named in Parliament as the leading businessman accused by a newspaper of sexual and racial harassment. Peter Hain, who identified him in the Lords, said it was his duty to name him, given the ""serious and repeated"" nature of the allegations. The Telegraph accused but did not name the businessman on Tuesday. Sir Philip ""categorically and wholly"" denied allegations of ""unlawful sexual or racist behaviour"". The Court of Appeal issued an injunction preventing the newspaper from publishing Sir Philip's name. It remains in force, but Lord Hain's statement, made under parliamentary privilege, has been widely reported in the UK media. The peer said publication of the story was ""clearly in the public interest"". TheTelegraph said,externalit had spent eight months investigating allegations of bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment made against Sir Philip. This video can not be played Lord Hain said the details were ""clearly in the public interest"" The newspaper reported that interviews with five members of staff revealed that victims had been paid ""substantial sums"" in return for legal commitments not to discuss their alleged experiences. The BBC has not been able to verify the allegations contained in the Telegraph's report. Lord Hain said he had been contacted by someone ""intimately involved in the case"". He said that given the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) ""to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying"", he felt it was his duty under parliamentary privilege to name Sir Philip as the individual in question. Parliamentary privilege protects MPs or peers from being prosecuted over statements made in the Commons or Lords and is one of the oldest rights enshrined in British law. Sir Philip Green profiled Why NDAs are being abused Sir Philip said in a statement on Thursday night that he and his company, Arcadia, ""take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated. ""Arcadia employs more than 20,000 people and in common with many large businesses sometimes receives formal complaints from employees. ""In some cases these are settled with the agreement of all parties and their legal advisers. These settlements are confidential so I cannot comment further on them."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Sir Philip ""should certainly be stripped of his knighthood"" if the allegations were proved to be correct. Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Committee, said a mechanism was needed to allow the voices of abuse victims to be heard in Parliament. ""This would develop the role of the House of Commons in a way which stands up for people who have little money, against those who have much,"" he said. The MP planned to raise the issue with ministers was a matter of urgency. Sir Philip Green was knighted in 2006 for services to the retail industry By Simon Jack, BBC business editor Sir Philip Green has built a fortune from a retail empire that includes Topshop, BHS, Burton and Miss Selfridge. It was a fortune he didn't mind flaunting - inviting a few hundred of the world's most famous people including Sir Elton John, the Clintons, Elizabeth Hurley and Kate Moss to celebrate lavish 50th and 60th birthday parties. He portrayed himself as a rags-to riches businessman and his reputation as a great deal maker was further endorsed in 2010 when David Cameron asked him to review whether government procurement departments could get better value for money. The collapse of BHS saw his crown not just slide, but hit the floor with a clang. He sold the business to a three-time bankrupt Dominic Chappell - going so far as helping to finance him in order to offload the business and its massive pension scheme deficit. BHS collapsed soon after leaving 12,000 people out of work and a further 20,000 people facing reduced pensions. During a series of testy encounters with MPs, throughout which he showed his famously volatile temper, Sir Philip promised to ""sort"" the pension fund - which he eventually did - handing over Â£363m. He hoped his reputation could be repaired following that payment. Today's allegations mean he has a new - and possibly bigger - battle to fight. By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent The naming of Sir Philip Green in the House of Lords is a surprising development. People will remember back to the super-injunction stories of recent years, including the case of footballer Ryan Giggs. When he was named using parliamentary privilege, it was frowned upon. Parliamentarians and the judiciary alike were very concerned that this privilege should not be used to undermine the rule of law. And a great effort was made from that time to ensure that this didn't happen again. So the judiciary is unlikely to be pleased. The injunction in this case was a court order granted by three of the most senior judges in the country at the Court of Appeal. It was the rule of law in action. They had before them many facts and evidence to consider and came to a ruling that was pretty emphatic. We have not got a constitutional crisis on our hands here, but we do have a really significant development in terms of the way in which parliamentary privilege is seen to be used in relation to court orders. The peer told BBC Newsnight he decided to name Sir Philip in the Lords because ""what concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse"". He added: ""It's for others to judge whether I've been right or wrong, but you know there's no point in being in Westminster ... if you never deploy the precious rights of parliamentary privilege, to be used - as I've said - extremely carefully with integrity and very responsibly."" There had been some criticism of his decision on social media, but Lord Hain added: ""I've had overwhelming support - particularly from women."" Camilla Tominey, associate editor of the Telegraph, told BBC Radio 4's PM it was ""farcical"" that Lord Hain was able to name Sir Philip in the House of Lords, but, as the paper remained the subject of an injunction, it was unable to confirm or deny a name. ""It's not the first time it's happened and it won't be the last,"" she said. The people who have made the claims had ""bravely"" come forward to the paper with the accusations, Ms Tominey added.

"Naming Green 'right thing do', says Hain","Sir Philip Green issued a statement saying he ""categorically and wholly"" denied the allegations Lord Hain has defended naming Sir Philip Green as the man behind a court injunction, preventing a newspaper publishing allegations of sexual and racial harassment. The Daily Telegraph was not allowed to identify the retail tycoon but the peer used parliamentary privilege to do so. A barrister said Lord Hain's conduct was ""completely improper"", but the peer said it was ""the right thing to do"". Sir Philip says he ""categorically and wholly"" denies the allegations. The Telegraph first reported on the injunction on Wednesday, sayinga ""leading businessman"" had won a legal battle,externalto stop the newspaper printing ""confidential information"" from five employees. Profile: 'High Street king' to 'face of capitalism' Sir Philip Green named over harassment claims This video can not be played Lord Hain says he stands by his decision to name Sir Philip Green, who denies the claims It says it spent eight months investigating allegations of bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment. After he was contacted for comment in July, Sir Philip and a number of senior staff applied for an injunction to stop details being published, the Telegraph said. A High Court judge refused to grant the gagging order the following month, but Appeal Court judges ruled in Sir Philip's favour on Tuesday this week. Sir Philip, pictured with daughter Chloe, wife Tina and F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, at Cannes Film Festival last year The Telegraph also reported that interviews with five members of Sir Philip's staff revealed that ""substantial sums"" had been paid in return for legal commitments not to discuss their alleged experiences. The BBC has not been able to verify the allegations contained in the Telegraph's report. While the Court of Appeal's temporary order banning the naming of Sir Philip remains in force, Lord Hain told the House of Lords he ""felt it was his duty"" to identify the Topshop boss and that it was in the public interest. This video can not be played Lord Hain said the details were ""clearly in the public interest"" The former Neath MP said he had been contacted by someone ""intimately involved in the case"" and, given the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) ""to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying"", he felt he should speak out. Parliamentary privilege protects MPs or peers from being prosecuted over statements made in the Commons or Lords, and is one of the oldest rights enshrined in British law. Speaking later on BBC Newsnight, Lord Hain denied he was undermining a decision of the courts, saying: ""I considered it extremely seriously before I said it."" ""I'm not disputing judges' responsibilities or timing or anything like that. That's a matter for the judiciary,"" he said. ""I'm discharging my function as a parliamentarian - and what concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse."" Lord Hain said while there had been some criticism of his decision on social media, he had received ""overwhelming support - particularly from women"". By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent People will remember back to the super-injunction stories of recent years, including the case of footballer Ryan Giggs.

We have not got a constitutional crisis on our hands here, but we do have a really significant development in terms of the way in which parliamentary privilege is seen to be used in relation to court orders. Labour MP Jess Phillips said Lord Hain ""did the right thing"", adding: ""It was brave and I doubt he took the decision lightly."" But Barrister Hugh Tomlinson QC said the courts were the ""proper institutions"" for deciding the issues raised in this case. Mr Tomlinson, a founder of the Hacked Off press regulation campaign, said: ""Parliament can't trespass into areas of the courts and say we think the courts have got it wrong - and that's what Lord Hain is effectively doing."" Sir Philip is also a regular at London Fashion Week, seen here in 2015 Former Labour Home Secretary Alan Johnson also questioned Lord Hain's actions, telling the BBC there had to be a very good reason for a parliamentarian to breach the decision of three senior judges who had seen the evidence. Lord Evans, the new chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""the ability to raise issues in Parliament without fear of them being brought into the court, I think is an important safeguard in our system"". There have been calls for Arcadia chairman Sir Philip to lose his knighthood if the allegations are proved to be correct, from MPs including Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable. And Labour's Frank Field, who led condemnation of Sir Philipover the BHS pension fund scandal, said: ""The charge sheet against the knighthood is growing."" Sir Philip's recent fall from grace came after he sold the retail chain BHS for Â£1 in March 2015 and it then went into administration, leaving a Â£571m hole in its pension fund. Meanwhile, pledges to boycott Sir Philip's stores, including Topshop, have been made on social media with the hashtag #pinknotgreen, with #feministsdontweartopshop also trending in the light of Lord Hain's statement. Sir Philip Green was knighted in 2006 for services to the retail industry Sir Philip said in a statement on Thursday night that he would not comment on anything that happened in court or was said in Parliament. ""To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations,"" he said. Sir Philip said he and his company, Arcadia, ""take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated. ""Arcadia employs more than 20,000 people and in common with many large businesses sometimes receives formal complaints from employees. ""In some cases these are settled with the agreement of all parties and their legal advisers. These settlements are confidential so I cannot comment further on them.""

"Google sacks dozens over harassmentThe tech giant says it dismissed 48 employees, including 13 senior managers, over the past two years.Business","Android creator Andy Rubin left Google in 2014 Google has sacked 48 people including 13 senior managers over sexual harassment claims since 2016. In aletter to employees,external, chief executive Sundar Pichai said the tech giant was taking a ""hard line"" on inappropriate conduct. The letter was in response to a New York Times report thatAndroid creator Andy Rubin received a $90m exit package despite facing misconduct allegations.,external A spokesman for Mr Rubin denied the allegations, the newspaper said. Sam Singer said Mr Rubin decided to leave Google in 2014 to launch a venture capital firm and technology incubator called Playground. He was given what the paper described as a ""hero's farewell"" when he departed. Google sued over 'male discrimination' Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem? Mr Pichai's letter said the New York Times story was ""difficult to read"" and that Google was ""dead serious"" about providing a ""safe and inclusive workplace"". ""We want to assure you that we review every single complaint about sexual harassment or inappropriate conduct, we investigate and we take action,"" he continued. None of the employees dismissed in the past two years had received an exit package, Mr Pichai added. According to the New York Times report, two unnamed Google executives said then-chief executive Larry Page asked Mr Rubin to resign after the company confirmed a complaint by a female employee about a sexual encounter in a hotel room in 2013. A Google investigation found the woman's complaint to be credible, the paper reported, but the company has not confirmed this. Mr Rubin has said he did not engage in misconduct and left Google of his own accord. The claims will add to the growing chorus denouncing sexist culture in male-dominated Silicon Valley. Amazon scrapped 'sexist AI' tool Was Google wrong to fire memo author? Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies in San Francisco,tweeted,external: ""In a normal world this would mean Rubin is done, but tech has not just been forgiving, some tech sees little wrong with this. ""I'd like to think Google will clean up its act if anything to avoid having a retention problem with their female employees."" Shares in Alphabet, which owns Google, fell more than 3% in New York after it reported revenues of $33.7bn (Â£26.3bn) for the three months to September - slightly less than analysts had expected. However, net profit soared $2.5bn to $9.2bn - far higher than expected.

"More millennials can get new railcardFor the first time the card will be digital-only, meaning passengers will need access to a smartphone.Business","The new 26-30 railcard will go on sale before the end of the year - and this time it will be available to all four million eligible passengers, the rail industry has announced. During a trial in the spring, only 20,000 people were allowed to buy one. The ticket website crashed because of overwhelming demand from thousands of young people. The launch of the ""millennial"" railcard was originally announced by the chancellor in the autumn 2017 Budget. Millennial rail cards sell out Millennial railcards 'still on track' For the first time, the 26-30 railcard will be ""digital only"", meaning that passengers will need a smartphone to download it. For a Â£30 fee, the new railcard will offer one-third off most leisure fares for 12 months. However, anyone travelling before 10am on a weekday will have to pay a minimum fare of Â£12. This is the same restriction as on the 16-25 railcard. But unlike the card for younger passengers, that minimum fare will also apply on weekdays throughout July and August. Most of those with a 16-25 railcard are students, so journeys in the summer holidays count as leisure travel. There will be no fare reductions on sleeper trains, first-class and season tickets or Eurostar services. Full details - and a savings calculator - are available on therailcard website,external. If you do not have a phone, or if your phone has run out of battery power, you will be allowed to download your card on someone else's phone. However, there will be no paper version of the card. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) told the BBC a digital card was safer than having a physical version, as that was easier to lose. No firm date has yet been announced, although the RDG says it will launch before the end of 2018. During the trials in the spring, it was found that passengers took an average of six leisure journeys a month, covering an average of 400 miles in total. On this basis, cardholders could expect to save Â£125 a year. Allowing for the Â£30 cost of the card, the saving would be Â£95.
