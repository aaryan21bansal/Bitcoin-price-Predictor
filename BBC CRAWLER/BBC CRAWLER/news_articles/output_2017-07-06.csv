Grenfell inquirer 'lost room' at meeting,"This video can not be played ""You don't respect me"": Footage from the meeting shows Sir Martin Moore-Bick defending his position The retired judge who will head the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower block fire has faced angry residents and survivors in a three-hour long meeting. A video of the meeting shows Sir Martin Moore-Bick saying he would ""find the facts as I see them from the evidence"". Joe Delaney, of the Grenfell Action Group, told the BBC that Sir Martin was not jeered or booed, but people were sceptical about him. He has already faced calls to step down just days after being appointed. Sir Martin said he had been invited to the meeting on Thursday by the Lancaster West Residents Association. He described it afterwards as a ""very useful meeting"". Where have cladding fire tests failed? Reality Check: The Grenfell rehousing promise 'Amnesty' for Grenfell fire residents Profile: Sir Martin Moore-Bick Mr Delaney told BBC Radio 5 live that Sir Martin: ""You could hear people sighing and tutting."" ""It got a bit loud before the end. I have heard public speakers who can shut up a stadium full of thousands of people. This man couldn't hold a room with 200 or so people."" Local resident Melvyn Akins, 30, said there had been ""frustration, anger and confusion"" in the meeting. ""People firmly believe that arrests should be made as a result of the outcome of all of this. If arrests are not made, people are going to feel justice may not be being done."" Melvyn Akins says local residents want to see people arrested A short video of Sir Martin, recorded at the meeting, shows him telling those present: ""I can't do more than assure you that I know what it is to be impartial. ""I've been a judge for 20 years, and I give you my word that I will look into this matter to the very best of my ability and find the facts as I see them from the evidence. ""That's my job, that's my training, and that's what I intend to do. Now if I can't satisfy you because you have some preconception about me as a person, that's up to you."" A consultation with residents to help define the scope of the inquiry into the 14 June fire in west London, in which at least 80 died, is due to end next Friday. Some survivors are calling for a delay of up to six weeks so they can seek legal advice. However, government officials said Sir Martin was not currently ""minded"" to extend the consultation period. Sir Martin has previously faced calls to step down as head of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry Kensington's Labour MP Emma Dent Coad has described Sir Martin as ""a technocrat"" who lacked ""credibility"" with victims and should step down. But Prime Minister Theresa May said she believed it was ""important"" that the inquiry was ""judge-led"", and said it would ""address the issues that the residents and victims of this terrible fire want to see addressed"". Grenfell Tower inquiry 'will be broad' Will a public inquiry deliver answers? Why is it taking so long to rehouse survivors? Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, of Kensington and Chelsea Council, called on Sir Martin to publish regular updates to residents to take them through the inquiry. ""The judge has got to learn to take heckling from upset people,"" he said. ""I don't think judges are used to being shouted at - and the residents have got to understand that there are constraints on the timing on what the judiciary can do. ""Let's judge the judge by what he does in the next few weeks."" Meanwhile, a team of outside consultants has confirmed to the Victoria Derbyshire programme that it was employed as the clerk of works to carry out checks on Grenfell Tower as recently as July last year. The company, John Rowan and Partners, received four payments totalling more than Â£17,000 to carry out mechanical and engineering inspections and checks on the fabric - or material used - on the building, between March and July 2016. According to documents filed with Kensington and Chelsea Council, seen by the programme, the firm acted in a site-monitoring and supervision role on the project for at least 26 days last year. It is understood the work, which started in January 2015, included making visual inspections, attending meetings and compiling a list of minor defects for the contractor, Rydon, to rectify. John Rowan and Partners said in a statement that it had been deeply shocked by the fire, adding: ""We provided a site-monitoring role during the refurbishment work that completed in 2016. ""The scope for this work included making visual inspections, attending meetings as required by the client and the snagging of works after the contractor has informed that works have been snagged by them."" Separately, cladding samples which failed safety tests in the wake of the fire will be subjected to further ""large-scale"" testing - including building a 30ft-high (9m) demonstration wall to subject the material to a ""severe fire"". Urgent tests were ordered on cladding from about 600 towers blocks in England after the blaze, but after 190 samples out of 191 failed, more tests were requested. Elsewhere, Minister for London Greg Hands has called on Mayor Sadiq Khan to consider moving the Notting Hill Carnival following the fire. Mr Handstweeted,externala letter, in which he wrote: ""The carnival is an important and symbolic community celebration in our capital's calendar... clearly it must go ahead. ""However, we have to ask ourselves if it is appropriate to stage a carnival in the near proximity of a national disaster."" Respondingon Twitter,external, Mr Khan wrote: ""Notting Hill Carnival is a firm London tradition and incredibly important to the local community. It should not be moved.""

"Boy, 5, 'killed in park for losing shoe'","Marvyn Iheanacho is accused of killing his partner's son in Mountsfield Park, Catford A five-year-old boy was battered to death by his mother's boyfriend in a south-east London park after he lost his trainer, a court has heard. Marvyn Iheanacho, 39, is accused of causing fatal head and stomach injuries to Alex Malcolm in Mountsfield Park, Catford, on 20 November last year. Witnesses in the park heard a ""child's fearful voice"", loud banging and a man screaming about the loss of a shoe, Woolwich Crown Court was told. Mr Iheanacho denies murder. The jury heard the 39 year old, of Hounslow, was in a relationship with Alex's mother Lilya Breha and would often stay in her flat in Catford. CCTV captured Mr Iheanacho taking Alex on three separate buses to the park where they arrived at about 17:12 GMT. Prosecutor Eleanor Laws QC said the pair then went to the play area because Alex lost one of his trainers and Mr Iheanacho ""lost his temper and violently assaulted the boy."" She told jurors there were no witnesses or CCTV footage of the attack but said there was ""clear evidence...the defendant lost his temper with Alex before he sustained his injuries."" One witness described how she saw Mr Iheanacho bending down and ""raging at the child who was very quiet"", the court was told. Ms Laws said the witness's partner also heard ""loud banging and a male voice screaming about the loss of shoes and a child's fearful voice saying 'sorry'"". ""At some point, whether during this confrontation or between this confrontation and the next sighting of the defendant... the boy had received extreme injuries,"" she said. Judge Mark Dennis QC told jurors the main issue in the case was how Alex sustained the injuries. The trial continues.

Did Amelia Earhart die a Japanese prisoner?,"A newly-discovered photo suggests legendary US pilot Amelia Earhart might have died in Japanese custody - and not in a plane crash in the Pacific. If true, it would solve one of aviation history's biggest mysteries. Earhart vanished during a 1937 flight over the Pacific - and her disappearance has been a breeding ground for speculation ever since. A photograph from the 1930s shows a figure that could be her, taken on the then-Japanese Marshall Islands. However, at least one prominent expert has poured cold water on the claim, saying he was ""astounded"" it had taken off. The new material - presented as evidence for an old theory - is a black-and-white photograph found in the vaults of the US National Archives. Earhart, or not? The 1930s picture shows a group of people on the wharf at Jaluit Atoll It shows a group of people standing on a dock. The label on the photograph says it was taken on Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands, presumably by a US spy. The link might seem thin, though, to the legendary pilot who five years before her disappearance had risen to fame as the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. The claim is that one seated person with her back to the camera could be Earhart, while another figure on the far left in the photo is said to be Fred Noonan, her navigator on that last flight. On the very right of the picture is a blurry section which, it is claimed, shows Earhart's plane. These magnified details of the new picture are alleged to show (from left), navigator Fred Noonan, Earhart herself, and their plane Ric Gillespie, author of Finding Amelia and executive director of The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), is certainly unconvinced. He told the BBC: ""This photograph has people convinced. I'm astounded by this. I mean, my God! Look at this photograph... Let's use our heads for a moment. It's undated. They think it's from 1937. Okay. If it's from July 1, 1937 then it can't be Amelia, because she hadn't taken off yet. ""If it's from 1935 or 1938 it can't be her.... This photograph has to have been taken within a very narrow window - within a couple of days of when she disappeared."" He notes that the photograph came from an Office of Naval Intelligence file, saying it was ""very natural"" the US would want a picture of this Japanese naval asset. ""And what does the photo say that it shows? ... Jaluit Atoll - Jaluit Island. It doesn't say 'Amelia Earhart in Japanese custody'! ""If this is a picture of Amelia Earhart in Japanese custody, where are the Japanese? There are no soldiers in this picture. Nobody in uniform,"" he observes. Ric Gillespie, author of Finding Amelia, does not believe the picture shows Earhart and her navigator The photograph was released by the US-based History channel ahead of a documentary to run this weekend. If the goal was to drum up attention - and hence audience numbers - it appears to have paid off. A preview of the programme has two experts backing up the claim by looking at the torso measurements of the woman alleged to be Amelia Earhart in the photo, and teeth and hairline of the figure claimed to be Fred Noonan. A far stretch? After all, the heroine has her back to the camera and it's debatable how much of a hairline let alone teeth can really be made out reliably on a faded photograph from the 1930s. Mr Gillespie says it doesn't match other known pictures of the famous aviator. ""The person who they say is Amelia Earhart might be a white woman. But her hair is way too long to be Amelia's. We have many pictures of Earhart taken the day before she took off, and her hair's a lot shorter than that."" The fate of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan has long fascinated historians He adds that the man identified as Fred Noonan does not, in his view, resemble the navigator. Further, his shirt is the wrong colour. ""The man is dressed in white. Noonan always wore dark shirts and dark slacks. Amelia didn't have a shirt like that with her on the trip either. So the Japanese have apparently given them new clothes. ""Everything about this is wrong,"" he concludes. ""I'm astounded."" Scepticism aside, the alleged scoop feeds into one of the existing theories about what happened to Earhart and her navigator. She disappeared during her attempt to fly around the globe, trying to reach Howland Island in the Pacific for refuelling. The official explanation is that she didn't find the island, lost communication and ran out of fuel, only to crash into the ocean. While that's a largely accepted version of events, there is no evidence - as in debris - to back it up. The two other prominent theories are that Earhart crash-landed on or near the then-Japanese Marshall Islands, or that she made it to Nikumaroro island near Kiribati and died a castaway there. There is no conclusive evidence for either of these theories - but that hasn't stopped amateur and professional historians from digging into them. Nikumaroro island was uninhabited at the time Earhart would have landed there Parts of a skeleton found on Nikumaroro in 1940 were initially thought to have been hers, but doctors at the time decided they belonged to a male body. Mr Gillespie, who backs the Nikumaroro theory, has led 11 expeditions in the South Pacific to research Earhart's fate. He points out that the island was uninhabited at the time when Earhart would have landed there. He and his team have recovered artefacts which they say strongly suggest the presence of an American woman from the right era - including a makeup box from the 1930s, a popular US women's moisturiser, and a jacket zipper. Ric Gillespie and his team excavating on Nikumaroro, where they believe Earhart's plane came down The team found a bone-handled jack knife that matches one mentioned in Earhart's inventory Mr Gillespie also cites the timing and location of radio distress calls sent by Earhart after her plane came down. He says the calls were sent ""night after night"" - which would suggest the plane was on land, not in the water - because if the radios got wet, they wouldn't work. ""After six nights the radio signals stopped,"" he told the BBC. ""We now think that's because the airplane was landed on the reef round the island, which is flat, smooth - dries at low tide... But the tide does come in and go out, and ... by the sixth night [he believes] the aeroplane was washed into the ocean by the tides. ""So when the planes from the battleship flew over the island a week later, no plane was visible."" The rest of the search took place in open ocean, and found nothing. The would-be rescuers concluded that Earhart and Noonan had sunk without a trace. The conclusion drawn by the History documentary, based on the new Marshall Islands picture, is that Earhart was taken by the Japanese, later interned and eventually died a prisoner of war. The Marshall Islands went from German to Japanese hands during World War One, and ahead of the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor became an important military post for Tokyo. The Japanese archives have no records of Earhart as a prisoner - but with many documents from these archives known to have been lost, this does not necessarily prove the story wrong. At the same time, the discovery of a single photograph that may or may not show the two lost pilots is likely to add to the mystery rather than solve it.

Germany G20 protests turn violent,"This video can not be played Watch: Protesters and police clash in Hamburg Seventy-six police officers have been injured in clashes with protesters in Germany's city of Hamburg, where a G20 summit starts shortly. Three officers were taken to hospital, police said. There were also reports of injuries among protesters. The clashes began when police charged at masked protesters at a ""Welcome to hell"" march attended by 12,000 people. World leaders - including US President Donald Trump - will discuss climate change, trade and other major issues. Police fired water cannon and pepper spray at masked protesters, who hurled bottles, stones and flares. Decoding Trump's off-script remarks Organisers cancelled the march where the first clashes took place, but protesters remained on the streets and police said violence spread to other areas of the city. Protesters built makeshift barricades, set vehicles alight, damaged businesses and repeatedly shone a laser at a police helicopter to dazzle its pilot, police said. Medics were seen treating several people. At least one person appeared to have been seriously hurt and was carried away covered by a foil blanket. Before the march, police had warned of possible violence and said they had confiscated a number of homemade weapons. Some 20,000 police have been deployed in Hamburg for the summit, and security cordons have been erected to prevent protesters reaching the venues. Up to 100,000 protesters are expected in Hamburg during Friday and Saturday. The G20 leaders face their own disagreements, including over climate change and trade. Mr Trump has already met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the pair spent an hour talking about North Korea, the Middle East, the conflict in eastern Ukraine and G20 issues, a German government spokesman said. Mrs Merkel (R) and Mr Trump talked for an hour Last week Mrs Merkel said the G20 wouldfocus on the Paris climate deal- which the US has withdrawn from. But earlier she said that as the G20 host she would work to find compromises. Putin and Trump in their own words The summit will also see Mr Trump meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time. The meeting will take place at 14:45 local time (13:45 GMT) and last for an hour, Russian media report. Earlier in the day Mr Trump used a speech in the Polish capital Warsaw to call on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and other countries. This video can not be played Trump: Russia should join ""the fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself"" Russia should also end support for ""hostile regimes"" such as those in Syria and Iran and ""join the community of responsible nations"", he said. He urged Russia to join the ""fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself"". The Kremlin rejected his comments. This video can not be played Russian interference? No-one knows - Trump Mr Trump referred to Russia's ""destabilising"" behaviour twice in one day in Poland. But the Kremlin spokesman has shrugged that off, saying simply that Moscow ""does not agree"". It's all part of the wait-and-see approach here. Russia once had great hopes that Donald Trump could rescue relations from the pit into which they were plunged after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Almost six months into the Trump presidency, there may be increasing pessimism. But the Kremlin is calling Mr Trump's meeting with Mr Putin on Friday an important chance to get acquainted. Perhaps it is betting that personal dynamics will help overcome policy differences. After all, officials here insist that it is simply ""Russophobia"" in the US that has prevented President Trump ""getting along"" with Russia as he said he wanted. They have certainly noted how in Poland he shied away from accusing Russia unequivocally of meddling in the US elections. Moscow has argued all along that there is no proof. In public at least, Mr Trump appeared to agree with that. The US leader also hailed Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms.

Woman stole Â£46k of school dinner money,"Jacqueline Robb used the money to buy holidays and clothes A finance manager who stole Â£46,000 of school dinner money has been jailed. Jacqueline Robb, 54, of Laburnum Avenue, Manchester, used the funds to buy foreign holidays and clothes. The school where she worked spotted that Â£952 was missing from its bank account after an audit in autumn 2016. It later identified a loss of Â£46,011 between April 2012 and December 2016. Robb was jailed for 10 months at Manchester Crown Court after she pleaded guilty to theft. She had been employed at a school in Openshaw since April 2009, where her duties included the administration and accounting of the school meals income. The audit identified an annual deficit of about Â£10,000 missing from the school's bank account between 2012 and 2016. Det Con Laura Watson, from Greater Manchester Police, said Robb had been initially considered as a ""respected and trusted member of staff"".

Tupac blamed race in Madonna breakup,"Madonna confirmed two years ago she had a relationship with Tupac (R) Tupac Shakur suggested to Madonna he broke up with her because of race, in an emotional letter attributed to the doomed rapper. The 1995 missive, addressed to ""M"", said being with a black man could only help her career, but that he might let down his fans. Madonna confirmed two years ago they had had a relationship, though it is unclear how long it lasted. The letter is up for auction with a starting bid of $100,000 (Â£77,000). Dated 15 January 1995, it was penned while Tupac was serving a prison sentence for sexual assault and 18 months before he was shot dead. Both artists were then at the height of their fame. The rapper sold over 75 million records worldwide ""For you to be seen with a black man wouldn't in any way jeopardize your career, if anything it would make you seem that much more open and exciting,"" Tupac, then 23, wrote from New York's Clinton Correctional Facility. ""But for me at least in my previous perception I felt due to my 'image' that I would be letting down half of the people who made me what I thought I was. ""Like you said, I haven't been the kind of friend I know I am capable of being,"" he wrote, adding: ""I never meant to hurt you."" Rolling Stone magazine said it had confirmed the authenticity of the document, which was first published by TMZ. Tupac died in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas Tupac - whose parents were both Black Panthers - also suggested Madonna, then 36, hurt him by saying in an interview that she was ""'off to rehabilitate all the rappers and basketball players' or something to that effect"". ""Those words cut me deep seeing how I had never known you to be with any rappers besides myself,"" he wrote. ""It was at this moment out of hurt and a natural instinct to strike back and defend my heart and ego that I said a lot of things."" He added: ""Please understand my previous position as that of a young man with limited experience with a extremely famous sex symbol."" Tupac concluded: ""It's funny but this experience has taught me to not take time for granted."" He signed off with a heart symbol. On 7 September 1996, the rapper - who sold over 75 million records worldwide - died in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas after watching a Mike Tyson boxing match. The letter will be up for auction at the Gotta Have Rock and Roll sale, which is scheduled for 19 - 28 July.

Why are viewers complaining about Love Island?,"Marcel Somerville and Camilla Thurlow are among the contestants Viewers have been complaining about Love Island - but not for the reason you might think. The ITV2 show sees single men and women put together in a Majorcan villa to find love and win a Â£50,000 prize. So far this series, there have been several instances of, shall we say, intimate behaviour taking place. But broadcasting regulator Ofcom says it has actually received far more complaints about scenes that show the contestants smoking. The series airs after the 21:00 watershed but has still attracted 46 complaints to date. More than half of those - 24 - were from viewers objecting to the portrayal of smoking. Fifteen of the complaints were made about the promotion of ""sexual material and promiscuity"". The remaining complaints were for bad language, grievances about a racial slur and violence (for the time when a contestant threw a cushion ""aggressively"").

Newman and Baddiel reunite at party,"Former duo David Baddiel and Rob Newman as they look today It's no big deal for comedians to play sold-out arena shows these days - just look at Peter Kay and Michael McIntrye. But it was unheard of before 1993, when Rob Newman and then comedy partner David Baddiel became the first comics to sell out Wembley Arena. With Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis, they formed The Mary Whitehouse Experience in the 1990s, before getting their own show, Newman and Baddiel in Pieces. It was such a success the pair went on tour - but by then the cracks were showing. They later admitted that for part of the tour,the only time they spoke to each other was to deliver lines,external. Baddiel said inan interview,external: ""It was incredibly acrimonious. I remember people saying at the time that it was a publicity stunt, but it really wasn't. We weren't speaking at times, except on stage... It's interesting in terms of fame, in that it's quite toxic, and it certainly was in that relationship."" And how they were in their 1990s heyday Newman - now a writer as much as a comedian - was ""affected by fame"" and became a ""difficult person to work with"",he said at the time,external. Baddiel went on to further fame on Fantasy Football with Frank Skinner, while Newman pretty much retreated from the limelight. So imagine fans' delight whenNewman got back in touch,externalwith his former partner earlier this year. In a slightly clunky tweet, he requested free tickets toBaddiel's showabout his father's dementia (inspiring one reply of ""See that freeloader? That's you, that is"", in a nod to their catchphrase). He said the show was ""heart-warming"" and ""very, very funny"". It was the first time they'd been in the same room since 1993 - though Baddiel said they'd bumped into each other a few times ""in various parks and streets"". And now, they've been publicly reunited at the Harper Collins summer party - leading to many fans (and some fellow celebs) pinning their hopes on them getting back together. Others said they hoped it meant they were getting back together for a one-off series - but Baddiel has previously vowed they would never work together again. While that might dash the hopes of comedy fans, at least they're on speaking terms. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

PR company 'sorry' for S Africa campaign,"A protest outside the Gupta family compound in Johannesburg earlier this year A UK public relations firm has apologised over a controversial social media campaign in South Africa that critics say inflamed racial tensions. Bell Pottinger is accused of using a strategy that stressed the power of white-owned businesses and promoted the #WhiteMonopolyCapital hashtag. The company has sacked one employee and suspended three, admitting the campaign was ""offensive"". Critics say it worked to the advantage of President Jacob Zuma. Bell Pottinger was hired by Oakbay, a company owned by the wealthy Guptas family. The South African president has faced corruption allegations and suspicion over his ties with the Guptas. Mr Zuma and the Guptas have consistently denied all allegations. Jacob Zuma: South Africa's great survivor Who are the Guptas? The campaign sought to emphasise the continued ""existence of economic apartheid"", according to leaked emails, published in the local press. Opposition party Democratic Alliance (DA) is among those to have voiced objection, filing a complaint to the London-based Public Relations and Communications Association. On Friday, the DA said the apology was a PR stunt in itself. The governing ANC insists it has played no role in the row. Critics in South Africa and media outlets had for some time accused the PR firm of presenting opponents of President Zuma and the Guptas as agents of ""white monopoly capital"". In a statement on Thursday,,externalBell Pottinger Chief Executive James Henderson said: ""We wish to issue a full, unequivocal and absolute apology to anyone impacted."" Bell Pottinger said it had ended its contract with Oakbay three months ago. Some of the world's worst advertising fails The PR firm also said it had asked an independent law firm to review ""the account and the work done on it"", and that executives had been ""misled"" about the campaign. There has been an outcry on social media in the country about the original campaign and the statement. Some South Africans are also angry because Bell Pottinger had an account representing the national tourist board, which is funded by tax-payers. The tourist board ended the three-year contract in June, with the PR company blaming the way its other work had been ""misrepresented"" in the local media. South African Tourism told PR Week that the Gupta connection had no bearing on its decision to switch to another firm. Bell Pottinger temporarily made its Twitter account private Last month, Bell Pottinger temporarily changed the settings on its own Twitter account to make it private, meaning critics could no longer hijack its other posts with views on the company's work in South Africa. South Africa ""managed to force a PR company to make their Twitter account private. A PR company"", wrote one incredulous tweeter. On Friday, critics were still on the attack online, doctoring the company's Wikipedia page and accusing it of a ""weak, meaningless and pathetic"" apology.

France plans ban on petrol cars by 2040,"Hybrid and electric cars, like this Renault, make up about 5% of the French car market France is set to ban the sale of any car that uses petrol or diesel fuel by 2040, in what the ecology minister called a ""revolution"". Nicolas Hulot announced the planned ban on fossil fuel vehicles as part of a renewed commitment to the Paris climate deal. He said France planned to become carbon neutral by 2050. Hybrid cars make up about 3.5% of the French market, with pure electric vehicles accounting for just 1.2%. It is not yet clear what will happen to existing fossil fuel vehicles still in use in 2040. Volvo goes electric across the board Global dismay at US climate deal pullout How Paris is stepping up its drive against the car Mr Hulot, a veteran environmental campaigner, was appointed by new French President Emmanuel Macron. Mr Macron has openly criticised US environmental policy, urging Donald Trump to ""make our planet great again"". President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement in June was explicitly named as a factor in France's new vehicle plan. ""France has decided to become carbon neutral by 2050 following the US decision,"" Mr Hulot said, adding that the government would have to make investments to meet that target. This video can not be played French President Emmanuel Macron criticised Mr Trump in June Poorer households would receive financial assistance to replace older, more polluting vehicles with cleaner ones, he said. Earlier this week, car manufacturer Volvo said all of its new car models would be at least partly electric from 2019, an announcement referenced by Mr Hulot. He said he believes French car manufacturers - including brands such as Peugeot-Citroen and Renault - would meet the challenge, although he acknowledged it would be difficult. Renault's ""Zoe"" electric vehicle range is one of the most popular in Europe. However, traditional fossil fuel vehicles account for about 95% of the European market. Other targets set in the French environmental plan include ending coal power plants by 2022, reducing nuclear power to 50% of total output by 2025, and ending the issuance of new oil and gas exploration licences. Several French cities struggle with high levels of air pollution, including Paris, which endured several days of peak pollution in March. The capital has implemented arange of measures to cut down on cars, but air pollution is also a problemin picturesque mountain regions. Last month,a woman took the French state to courtover what she said was a failure to protect her health from the effects of air pollution in Paris. Norway, which is the leader in the use of electric cars in Europe, wants to move to electric-only vehicles by 2025, as does the Netherlands. Both Germany and India have proposed similar measures with a target of 2030.

Clashes erupt at Germany G20 protest,"This video can not be played Watch: Protesters and police clash in Hamburg Seventy-six police officers have been injured in clashes with protesters in Germany's city of Hamburg, where a G20 summit starts shortly. Three officers were taken to hospital, police said. There were also reports of injuries among protesters. The clashes began when police charged at masked protesters at a ""Welcome to hell"" march attended by 12,000 people. World leaders - including US President Donald Trump - will discuss climate change, trade and other major issues. Police fired water cannon and pepper spray at masked protesters, who hurled bottles, stones and flares. Decoding Trump's off-script remarks Organisers cancelled the march where the first clashes took place, but protesters remained on the streets and police said violence spread to other areas of the city. Protesters built makeshift barricades, set vehicles alight, damaged businesses and repeatedly shone a laser at a police helicopter to dazzle its pilot, police said. Medics were seen treating several people. At least one person appeared to have been seriously hurt and was carried away covered by a foil blanket. Before the march, police had warned of possible violence and said they had confiscated a number of homemade weapons. Some 20,000 police have been deployed in Hamburg for the summit, and security cordons have been erected to prevent protesters reaching the venues. Up to 100,000 protesters are expected in Hamburg during Friday and Saturday. The G20 leaders face their own disagreements, including over climate change and trade. Mr Trump has already met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the pair spent an hour talking about North Korea, the Middle East, the conflict in eastern Ukraine and G20 issues, a German government spokesman said. Mrs Merkel (R) and Mr Trump talked for an hour Last week Mrs Merkel said the G20 wouldfocus on the Paris climate deal- which the US has withdrawn from. But earlier she said that as the G20 host she would work to find compromises. Putin and Trump in their own words The summit will also see Mr Trump meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time. The meeting will take place at 14:45 local time (13:45 GMT) and last for an hour, Russian media report. Earlier in the day Mr Trump used a speech in the Polish capital Warsaw to call on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and other countries. This video can not be played Trump: Russia should join ""the fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself"" Russia should also end support for ""hostile regimes"" such as those in Syria and Iran and ""join the community of responsible nations"", he said. He urged Russia to join the ""fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself"". The Kremlin rejected his comments. This video can not be played Russian interference? No-one knows - Trump Mr Trump referred to Russia's ""destabilising"" behaviour twice in one day in Poland. But the Kremlin spokesman has shrugged that off, saying simply that Moscow ""does not agree"". It's all part of the wait-and-see approach here. Russia once had great hopes that Donald Trump could rescue relations from the pit into which they were plunged after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Almost six months into the Trump presidency, there may be increasing pessimism. But the Kremlin is calling Mr Trump's meeting with Mr Putin on Friday an important chance to get acquainted. Perhaps it is betting that personal dynamics will help overcome policy differences. After all, officials here insist that it is simply ""Russophobia"" in the US that has prevented President Trump ""getting along"" with Russia as he said he wanted. They have certainly noted how in Poland he shied away from accusing Russia unequivocally of meddling in the US elections. Moscow has argued all along that there is no proof. In public at least, Mr Trump appeared to agree with that. The US leader also hailed Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms. Polish history lessons from Trump's speech Five reasons why Trump visited Poland Why the Polish crowd loved President Trump Poland's conservative government shares Mr Trump's hostile view of immigration and strong sense of sovereignty. This video can not be played Donald Trump's handshake is left hanging by the Polish president's wife NTV correspondent- ""After the icy reception [Trump] was given in Europe in May what he needs now are comfortable and favourable surroundings, a picture along the lines of 'look at how they adore us here'.""

CBI urges single market until Brexit deal,"The UK should stay in the single market and customs union until a final Brexit deal is in force, according to the CBI business lobby group. CBI head Carolyn Fairbairn said it was ""impossible"" for all the details of a new trade deal with the European Union to be in place by March 2019. That is when talks about the UK's withdrawal are due to formally finish. To minimise disruption, UK businesses need a ""bridge"" instead of a ""cliff edge"" for the new deal, she said. Businesses are delaying investment because of the uncertainty, according to the CBI, whose members employ nearly 7 million people. The CBI's comments come ahead of a government conference on Friday with business figures from sectors across the UK. The event, to be hosted at Chevening House in Kent, is part of government plans to work more closely with industries over Brexit. ""While we will be leaving the single market and the EU customs union, we want to achieve a comprehensive free trade agreement that allows for the most frictionless possible trade,"" a government spokesman said. What are the single market and customs union? Brexit 'shouldn't end City's market access' What's happened since the Brexit vote? In her speech at the London School of Economics, Ms Fairbairn said it was ""common sense"" to stay in the single market and customs union until a trade deal was in place. ""This is not about whether we are leaving the EU, it is about how,"" she said. ""Once the Article 50 clock strikes midnight on 29 March 2019 the UK will leave the EU."" Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, the founder of the Wetherspoons pub chain and campaigner for Brexit, Tim Martin, said constant talk about the UK ""falling off a cliff and standing on the top of buildings"" was the re-emergence of Project Fear again. ""The desire expressed by the doom-laden comments of the head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn is to stay in the customs union and the single market and of course that is the equivalent of staying in the EU for now and perhaps forever. ""I don't know what the motivation is but it certainly doesn't speak for a business as a whole, 93% of which doesn't even trade with the EU,"" he added. He suggested after the meeting at Chevening, the Brexit Secretary David Davis should ""have a cup of tea, listen to everything that has been said and give me a bell and I'll put him straight"". Those who successfully voted to leave the EU, fear that prolonged transitional arrangements could be used by Remainers as a way of reversing the Brexit vote by stealth. But the CBI said businesses feared they could be forced to adapt twice - first to a transitional arrangement, and then to the final trade deal. That would be ""wasteful, difficult and uncertain in itself,"" Ms Fairbairn said. She told the BBC that a survey of CBI members found that 40% had reduced investment plans due to Brexit uncertainty. ""The urgency is simply growing. March 2019 is tomorrow for a lot of businesses. They are having to make their plans now,"" she said. Her comments were backed by Labour, which said it wanted an early commitment to ""strong transitional arrangements"" on similar terms to those currently in place. Ms Fairbairn says it's ""time to be realistic"" about Brexit The CBI's proposal was backed by a range of business bodies, including from retail, aerospace and manufacturing. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of the manufacturers' body EEF, said: ""The absence of any clarity for businesses makes this a sensible approach to transition."" The TUC also supported the move, saying ""it's crucial that we get the transition right as we leave the EU"". However, Patrick Minford, chairman of the Economists for Free Trade and an economics professor at Cardiff University, said it was not clear what the CBI wanted. ""They are constantly arguing for remain through the back door and this sounds like the same thing,"" he told the BBC. He said the UK and EU would have to reach some kind of deal by the end of March 2019 and that would involve transitional arrangements. Business groups have increased their calls in recent weeks for the UK to maintain existing trading relations with the EU. After last month's election, five business bodies - including the CBI and EEF - called for the government to maintain the economic benefits of the single market and the customs union. The CBI has now gone further by urging that the UK stay in those trading arrangements until a final deal is in place.

Germany's Finance Minister and the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that the EU should leave the door open to the UK if it wants to change its mind about Brexit. Wolfgang Schaeuble said it was not his place to advise the UK but added: ""If Britain were to move in

irreversible, adding the EU and Britain must continue to

Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al Baker said earlier on Thursday that any delays were the plane-maker's responsibility. He said: ""We are asking Airbus to deliver it faster.

The G20 summit in Hamburg officially begins on Thursday but protesters are making their feelings known about the event this evening. There were demonstrations as world leaders arrived for the gathering. Riot police used gas and water cannons on demonstrators some of whom, according to Reuters, threw bottles and other missiles. A planned anti-G20 protest march was called off following the clashes. Another of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has signaled that interest rates could be going up soon - a decade after the last increase. Ian McCafferty said that depending on economic data âwe would expect to see a couple of modest rate rises over the next couple of years or soâ. Mr McCafferty (far left) likened holding the interest rate at 0.25% to keeping a foot on the accelerator of the economy. âWe may need to take a little bit of that away,â he said on LBC radio.

investment strategist at CFRA Research reckons that the fall in US share prices on Thursday could be because of jobs data which showed that US businesses added 158,000 jobs in June. This was against expectations of 185,000 new roles. ""The market moves significantly on the jobs report. We are
expecting to see a little bit of a rebound from last month, but
again we didn't get that in the ADP number today which was also
expected to be stronger than what it was,"" says Ms Bell. Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil says that its takeover of Blue Man Group is in line with its ""vision for the future"" as it ""looks to further expand globally and diversify its entertainment offering beyond circus arts"".

It has been performed in over 20 countries and seen by more than 35m worldwide since then. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Shares in the electric car maker Tesla have fallen 5.64% to $277.55 after its Model S vehicle failed to get a top rating in a crash test. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said that despite changes being made to the car, the Model S was again only able to 
attain an ""acceptable"" rating in a test that mimics a car hitting a tree or a pole. As a result, Tesla failed to achieve the IIHS Top Safety Pick rating, which 
requires a ""good"" rating in all five of its crash test scenarios, according to Reuters.

Manchester bomb 'carried in city for hours',"Abedi was walking around Manchester city centre with the bomb for several hours before he detonated it The Manchester Arena bomber carried the device through city centre streets for ""several hours"" before the attack, police believe. Salman Abedi detonated the home-made bomb, with metal nuts used as shrapnel, at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. Abedi was not part of a larger network, the head of the North West Counter Terrorism unit has said. Ch Supt Russ Jackson said others may have been ""aware or complicit"" in the attack that killed 22 people. He said further arrests may follow. More than 250 people were hurt in the blast and have injuries ranging from paralysis and loss of limbs to internal and facial injuries, he said. Abedi was walking around Manchester city centre with the bomb before he detonated it, but police do not believe he had any target other than the Arena in mind. Hashem Abedi, the bomber's 20-year-old brother, was detained in Tripoli The bomb had a ""devastating"" impact and gouged out a section of the concrete floor. Ch Supt Jackson confirmed officers want to interview the bomber's younger brother, Hashem Abedi, who continues to be held by special deterrence forces in Tripoli. He would not comment on whether officers had travelled to the country, but said the force was engaged with the Libyan authorities and the Crown Prosecution Service. Who was Salman Abedi? Who were the victims? Briefing reporters at the headquarters of Greater Manchester Police on Thursday, Ch Supt Jackson said it was ""hard to get inside [Abedi's] head"" in terms of how he was radicalised. ""Salman Abedi travelled to Libya a number of times in his life. What we are looking at is the number of ways he learned the skills to build the device,"" he said. Officers are still searching for a blue suitcase used by Abedi Abedi left no note or video explaining his actions, he said. Ch Supt Jackson said officers were still searching for a blue suitcase in a landfill site, and this was a ""key line in the inquiry"". The investigation was expected to continue for ""many, many months to come"", he said. It will not be quick, as police have 16,000 hours of CCTV footage and 755 statements to analyse, he added. ""Significant forensic evidence"" was alsofound in a Nissan Micrain Rusholme, Greater Manchester. Police earlier said Abedi may have used items stored in his car ""to help assemble the device"" he used to kill. Ch Supt Jackson said ""digital exhibits"" containing more than three million files and 15 terabytes of data have also been recovered. Asked if Abedi was involved in gang activity in Manchester, Ch Supt Jackson said he may have known ""people who would be identified as being in gangs"", but there was no suggestion of a link to gang activity in the attack. Police are not looking for any particular suspects. Ch Supt Jackson said people who were arrested then released without charge had ""not reached the threshold"" [for further investigation]. ""It should be noted that terrorism offences do not carry the option of bail. They can only be released without charge."" Forensic officers who were working at the arena in the days after the attack laid roses next to name plates at each spot where the 22 victims were killed, Ch Supt Jackson revealed.

"Leave Ukraine alone, Trump tells Russia","This video can not be played Trump: Russia should join ""the fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself"" US President Donald Trump has called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and other countries and end support for ""hostile regimes"" such as those in Syria and Iran. Speaking in the Polish capital Warsaw, Mr Trump urged Russia to ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin rejected his comments. The US leader has travelled to Hamburg for the G20 summit, where he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time. He also faces differences with other leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said last week that the G20 wouldfocus on the Paris climate deal- which the US has withdrawn from. Putin and Trump in their own words Five reasons why Trump visited Poland What future for the Atlantic alliance? Up to 100,000 protesters are expected over the two-day event and police have warned of potentially violent clashes. They have already confiscated a number of homemade weapons. The ""Welcome to Hell"" protest march is under way ""It's important because you have the biggest meeting of all of the leading rulers of the main countries in the world - the G20 - and I don't like some of the politics that they're doing, especially that of [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, of Putin and of Trump,"" one protester told the BBC. In Warsaw, Mr Trump argued that the future of Western civilisation itself was at stake and asked whether the West had the ""will to survive"". He urged Russia to join the ""fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself"". This video can not be played Russian interference? No-one knows - Trump Mr Trump referred to Russia's ""destabilising"" behaviour twice in one day in Poland. But the Kremlin spokesman has shrugged that off, saying simply that Moscow ""does not agree"". It's all part of the wait-and-see approach here. Russia once had great hopes that Donald Trump could rescue relations from the pit into which they were plunged after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Almost six months into the Trump presidency, there may be increasing pessimism. But the Kremlin is calling Mr Trump's meeting with Mr Putin on Friday an important chance to get acquainted. Perhaps it is betting that personal dynamics will help overcome policy differences. After all, officials here insist that it is simply ""Russophobia"" in the US that has prevented President Trump ""getting along"" with Russia as he said he wanted. They have certainly noted how in Poland he shied away from accusing Russia unequivocally of meddling in the US elections. Moscow has argued all along that there is no proof. In public at least, Mr Trump appeared to agree with that. The US leader also hailed Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms. Poland's conservative government shares Mr Trump's hostile view of immigration and strong sense of sovereignty. This video can not be played Donald Trump's handshake is left hanging by the Polish president's wife Giving a news conference ahead of his Warsaw speech, Mr Trump also: called on countries to demonstrate to North Korea that there were consequences for its ""very bad behaviour"" and said ""something will have to be done about it"" said America's ""strong alliance with Poland and Nato"" remained ""critical to deterring conflict"" said in reference to Syria that ""any nation which values human life can never tolerate the use of chemical weapons"" said ""nobody really knows for sure"" if Russia interfered in last year's US election said CNN had taken ""too seriously"" a mock video he tweeted in whichhe wrestles a person with the broadcaster's logo for a head. NTV correspondent- ""After the icy reception [Trump] was given in Europe in May, what he needs now are comfortable and favourable surroundings, a picture along the lines of 'look at how they adore us here'."" Ren TV presenter- Trump was keen to play on differences within Europe and help Poland ""cobble together an Eastern European bloc opposed to EU leaders...

Sports Direct's Ashley a 'power drinker',"Mike Ashley told the court he enjoys binge drinking Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has told a High Court judge he is a ""power drinker"" who likes to get drunk. The Newcastle United owner was giving evidence on the fourth day of a trial in London where he is being sued by investment banker Jeffrey Blue. Mr Blue says the sportswear tycoon promised to pay him Â£15m if he used his expertise to increase Sports Direct's share price to Â£8 each. However, the finance expert claims he was paid only Â£1m. Mr Ashley denies the claim and saysMr Blue is talking ""nonsense"". Mr Justice Leggatt has heard the dispute relates to a conversation in a central London pub, called the Horse and Groom, four years ago. Mr Ashley told the judge he would have had four to five pints within an hour, after being asked how much he had drunk by a lawyer representing Mr Blue. ""It was a fun evening, drinking at pace,"" he said. ""I like to get drunk. I am a power drinker."" Mr Ashley added: ""My thing is not to drink regularly. It is binge drinking. I am trying to get drunk."" Jeffrey Blue claims he was promised Â£15m by Mr Ashley in a London pub Mr Ashley also said he had been trying to ""have a good night out"". Asked how much Mr Blue had drunk, he replied: ""He would never have been able to keep up. He's a lightweight when it comes to drinking."" Mr Ashley went on say he had ""never taken a penny out of Sports Direct - salary or otherwise"". He added that he was the ""last person to know"" at Newcastle United, saying: ""They are really not interested in my opinion."" The court was previously told Mr Ashley would regularly hold management meetings in pubs and on one occasionvomited into a fireplace after drinking 12 pints. The hearing continues.

Man who killed two girlfriends gets life,"Robert Trigg had denied manslaughter and murder A man who killed two girlfriends five years apart has been jailed for life. Robert Trigg was convicted of murdering 52-year-old Susan Nicholson in 2011 and of the manslaughter of Caroline Devlin, 35, who died in March 2006. Both were treated as not suspicious at the time Trigg, 52, was told he would serve a minimum of 25 years in prison. In a statement in court, Ms Nicholson's elderly mother questioned why she had been able to gather enough evidence to bring the case to court but not police. Despite initial investigations into both deaths, in Worthing, West Sussex, finding nothing suspicious, Ms Nicholson's family refused to believe them. They started what would be a five-year campaign to get to the truth. Ms Nicholson's parents Elizabeth and Peter Skelton complained on three occasions to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) but were unsatisfied with its response. Jurors were told there were similarities between the cases of Caroline Devlin (left) and Susan Nicholson In 2014 they hired a barrister and a forensic pathologist, Dr Nathaniel Carey, to re-examine the original pathologist's report. He concluded that Ms Nicholson was suffocated by having her head forced into the bed. In Ms Devlin's case, he found her death was was caused by a blow to the back of her head. In a victim impact statement read out in court, Mrs Skelton said the family wanted answers over why she and her husband, now both in their 80s, were able to bring Trigg's case to court and not the police. She said the fight for justice had caused ""mental torture"" which triggered a mild heart attack in her and caused depression in Ms Nicholson's brother. During the sentencing hearing, judge Mrs Justice Ingrid Simler said Mr and Mrs Skelton had ""fought doggedly and continuously since their daughter's death for the police to re-investigate her death"". She added: ""The efforts of Ms Nicholson's family led to a review and re-investigation of her death and its cause."" Addressing Trigg, the judge said: ""The grief and sadness of these two families will never leave them. ""These were senseless deaths and nothing can now restore their lives, nor can any part of this sentencing process restore them either."" This video can not be played The parents of one of two women murdered by Robert Trigg speak out During the trial the court heard both women suffered domestic violence at the hands of Trigg during their relationships with him. He was described as a ""possessive, controlling and jealous"" man and by one former girlfriend as a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" character who drank heavily. The Skeltons said officers had never warned their daughter about Trigg's history of domestic violence. Sussex Police has apologised to both families of Trigg's victims for not presenting all the facts to prosecutors following the original investigation. Asst Ch Con Laurence Taylor said: ""I am sorry it has taken so long to get the justice they wanted."" The IPCC said it upheld two complaints into the way Sussex Police dealt with complaints about its investigation into Ms Nicholson's death. A third appeal was not upheld, a spokeswoman said. Sussex Police has now referred the case to the IPCC for ""an independent view and advice"", Mr Taylor said. This video can not be played Neighbour calls 999 over Susan Nicholson's death Brandyn McKenna, the youngest son of Ms Devlin, said outside court on Wednesday: ""We have always said that it was all down to the Skelton family that we finally got justice."" During his trial Trigg was described as ""no more than a drunken slob who could act in a loutish way"". The court heard in both cases after the women died, a neighbour called 999 after Trigg failed to do so despite knowing they were dead. In the case of Ms Devlin, Trigg had gone out for milk and made a coffee before telling one of her four children - then aged 14 - to go upstairs andcheck on his mother, knowing she was already dead. In Ms Nicholson's case, he bought cigarettes before phoning his brother and then phoning a neighbour who lived upstairs. Duncan Atkinson QC, prosecuting, told the jury Trigg's presence, actions and inaction after the deaths of both women bound them together. Parents of murdered woman fought for justice.

BBC's Robbie Gibb to be No 10 spokesman,"The head of the BBC's Westminster political programmes team has been named as Prime Minister Theresa May's new director of communications. Robbie Gibb, who edits the Daily Politics, replaces Katie Perrior, who quit before the general election. He worked for the Conservative MP Francis Maude in the 1990s, as well as Michael Portillo. He tweeted,externalit had been ""a privilege to work for the BBC "" and he would ""always be a supporter"" of the corporation. Mr Gibb has edited several BBC political programmes during a long career at the Corporation, including the Daily Politics, This Week and the Andrew Marr Show, and is a former deputy editor of Newsnight. The BBC's director of news, James Harding, said he had been ""an innovator in story-telling on television and an unrelenting advocate of the BBC, its independence and our public service role"". ""The signal quality he and his programmes have shown is the willingness to speak truth to power - I suspect it will come in handy,"" he added. Following reports that he had been interviewed for the job, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale tweeted that he had been asked to consider it but decided not to apply. Ms Perrior, a former PR executive, resigned as Mrs May's director of communications when the PM called a snap general election in April. She went on to criticise Mrs May's closest advisers Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, who were forced to stand down when the PM lost her majority. Her predecessor in the Downing Street communications role, Sir Craig Oliver, was also poached from the BBC, where he was editor of the Ten O'Clock News. Mr Gibb's brother is the Conservative MP and schools minister Nick Gibb. The position of Downing Street director of communications, which was first held by Alastair Campbell under Labour PM Tony Blair, has normally been held by a former newspaper or TV journalist.

Sexual harassment 'at the highest level',"Cheryl Yeoh revealed details about Mr McClure's behaviour on her website Tech entrepreneur Cheryl Yeoh's account of sexual harassment by a leading Silicon Valley investor is the latest discrimination scandal to rock the tech industry. Dave McClure resigned from 500 Startups, the firm he co-founded, following claims made by another woman - which encouraged Ms Yeohto publish her own story online,external. In her first interview, Cheryl Yeoh explains why she decided to talk publicly about the incident, which took place in 2014, and what she thinks needs to change. It has been edited for length. ""I was obviously angry and hurt but also surprised that I felt like it wasn't a rare thing, it was considered normal in the start-up world, the tech world. ""Now I realise that's not OK and that's part of the problem. That's why we need to speak up about it and have a conversation around how do we change this dynamic, how do we change the narrative?"" ""My issue is, it wasn't even me inviting him. It was him and a few other business partners who wanted to come over to brainstorm, and in the start-up world it's not uncommon to have after business hours brainstorm sessions. ""A lot deals are made after office hours, it's definitely not uncommon at all. ""What I was shocked about was how bold he was to message me after that and, prior to that, he had asked me to come to his hotel room through text. It's shocking how bold they are that they wouldn't be afraid of consequences."" ""Oh yeahâ¦ it takes one person coming out about sexual harassment or discrimination. Ellen Pao was ordered to pay her former employer's legal costs after losing her case ""That was a few years ago with Ellen Pao's case, and with the recent Susan Fowler story about sexual discrimination at Uber, and then a few other stories around Binary Capital, more and more women have the courage to speak up about it, because it was for the longest time a very controversial topic. ""So more people are aware of it and because of it more transparent policies are being created to address it so offenders are hopefully going to think twice before they do it again."" ""I had just moved to Malaysia from San Francisco to take on this very public position as CEO of a government agency that was given $30m [Â£23m] to start accelerators and programmes to encourage entrepreneurs in South East Asia. ""So Dave McClure had visited Malaysia to work with me to start an accelerator in Malaysia for South East Asia. ""After our board meeting he and some business partners came to my apartment to brainstorm ideas for the programme. ""They bought alcohol over, they brought whiskey, and he kept pouring whiskey into my glass before it was empty, and that felt a little weird. Dave McClure visited Ms Yeoh's home in June 2014 ""And then hours later, everyone decided to leave and order their cabs but he didn't seem to want to. When I asked him, like 'Dave are you leaving?' he said 'no'. ""So I said: 'Do you want to crash here? I have a guest room'. ""I walked him to the guest room and then I walked to my room thinking: 'I guess he's just too intoxicated'. ""And then he came into my room and wanted to sleep with me, and I told him: 'No, I have a boyfriend what are you doing, do you want to leave?' ""I showed him the way out and on the way out, he backed me up against the wall and moved forward to kiss meâ¦ that was when it was overboard. Thank goodness I didn't drink that much and I pushed him away and I opened the door and made sure he was out. ""I couldn't help but think: what if I was helpless, or I was weaker, or he used more force, what could have happened? ""And that's just terrible, no one should ever go through that ordeal, so I think that itself is sexual harassment at the highest level. ""And the second thing that was going on there was the power dynamic. ""He had a deal looming over us and if I were to speak up about him then it might compromise the accelerator and that wasn't even for me, it was for the region, and I felt like I couldn't report him because the whole region would not get the benefits of the accelerator just because of that night."" ""I tried not to speak to him after that, I didn't know what to say. ""If I had told him how angry I was at the time he might have pulled the deal offâ¦ you know now looking back, I'm angry that even though I was mad at him I couldn't tell him that and that's just not a good memory. ""But in my post, when I retold my account of what happened, I urged women to write down a full account of what happened (that night), email it to themselves right away so they have a timestamp and they remember what happened, or email it to your best friend, your mum, and when you're comfortable email it to him, so he knows that what he did was not OK, and that you're hurt. ""I think that helps with getting closure and it also makes them realise that you're not OK with it."" 'I'm a creep': Tech boss Dave McClure resigns after harassment claims Silicon Valley's women have spoken. Now what? Serena Williams takes on new challenge in Silicon Valley Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem?

""No, because the accusation at the time was that he had texted an entrepreneur who was seeking a job from him and the text goes 'I'm not sure whether to hire you or hit on you'â¦ that's not right, but it's a more minor offence. ""When he stepped down from being CEO and apologised for his inappropriateness, everyone thought it was because of that comment, it was too minor a misdeed for him to step down.

A mother's fight against knife crime,"Joshua's mum, Alison Cope, goes into schools to talk about how her son died Rising knife crimeis one of the biggest challenges facing the police, especially in the UK's major cities, but chiefs say they cannot solve the problem alone - and one mother is fighting hard to make sure more young people are protected from its dangers. Alison Cope knows first hand how damaging knife crime can be. In September 2013, her son Joshua Ribera was stabbed to death at a party to commemorate the life of a friend who had died in a stabbing the previous year. The 18-year-old was a well known Birmingham rapper. To his fans around the country and to people around the world who knew him he was Depzman, an up and coming grime artist who had just produced his first album and was building his career, appearing on BBC Radio 1Xtra. But to his mum he was much more. ""I say Joshua, not Depzman, not a grime MC, because Joshua is my little boy, my only son,"" she says. ""That little boy was a newborn baby in my arms, a toddler, and a totally obnoxious teenager who grew into the most beautiful young man. ""So I need you to understand that Depzman was nothing to me. Joshua was everything to me."" He became involved in a row over a girl which spiralled into a fight and his rival, Armani Mitchell, left the club but then returned with a knife. He said he wanted to cut Josh on the arm, but as he pulled the knife, Joshua raised his arm to protect himself and Mitchell plunged the knife into his heart. This video can not be played PC Rob Pedley: ""You're carrying the country's number one murder weapon"" As a passionate anti-knife campaigner, Alison has now dedicated her life to convincing teenagers there is another path in life. Speaking to pupils at City of Birmingham school, which looks after children permanently excluded from mainstream education for a whole range of reasons - including having knives - she tells them the harsh reality of what happened to her son. ""He fought back, seven heart attacks, multiple blood transfusions, they were cutting his body open from top to bottom and all the way across desperately trying to save his life,"" she says to the class. ""But on the morning of 21 September at 05:58, my son gave up on life and he died. That changed everything for my family. ""But it also changed the life of another 18-year-old boy, Armani Mitchell. He worked and was at college part-time. ""He is now in a category-A prison, serving a life sentence. Two 18-year-old boys went on a night out and neither of them came home."" Rapper Nathan Chin has been jailed for knife crime but now aims to persuade others not to carry them Rapping was Joshua Ribera's route to success. Now Alison encourages teenagers and younger children to take part in sessions at a recording studio in Birmingham, to help harness their creativity and develop a sense of self-worth in the hope it will keep them away from gangs and knives. At the studio, another of those also trying to help the next generation is 27-year-old Nathan Chin, whose rap name is Lil Fella. As well as being a rapper, he is trying to set up a charity called Unity Each 1, Teach 1, to support people struggling to get into education and employment. Nathan spent most of his teenage years in and out of young offender institutions. He has been in prison for knife crime, but has tried to turn his life around believing people like him are well placed to try to stop teenagers carrying knives. ""People who have gone to prison, real people who have been in situations, are the best people to help reform people,"" he says. Alison's final message to the teenagers is simple: ""With the help of your teachers and your family, you have every chance of being an amazing successful individual. You have got a choice. ""Make the best of your life.""

"Chilcot on Blair, Bush and Iraq - a year on","This video can not be played In full: Laura Kuenssberg interview with Sir John Chilcot The Chilcot report became a by-word for dispute, delay, and doubt. When the inquiry finally emerged in its full two million words, in the chaotic aftermath of the EU referendum, its analysis was polite. But it was firmly critical of the decision-making process and behaviour of the UK government both in the run-up to, conduct of, and aftermath of one of the most controversial conflicts in British foreign policy - what many now regard as one of the UK's biggest foreign policy mistakes. In the immediate aftermath of the inquiry itself, Sir John, a former Whitehall permanent secretary who had worked for decades at the highest level of government, declined to take further part in the debate, as his and his panels' conclusions were digested. In full: Transcript of Chilcot interview Blair 'not straight' with UK over Iraq But in the run-up to the report's anniversary, he agreed to speak for the first time about the inquiry's conclusions, its criticisms and consequences for us all. Exactly a year ago, he produced two million words in 12 volumes, to detail a seven-year long study of the tumultuous political and diplomatic events in the run-up to, conduct, and aftermath of the 2003 Iraq War. But what was implicit in the lengthy pages of that document is now crystal clear in his personal, succinct and unvarnished view of the hours of evidence, thousands of documents, and witness accounts of one of the country's most significant public inquiries. He defends its duration, its conduct, and believes strongly that the work could stop another rush to war in the future. Sir John told me believes the ""rising generations"" of the military have understood and absorbed the lessons of the inquiry so much that they would demand and insist that future governments would be required to be more rigorous, more thorough in their examinations of the case for war. He explained his exhaustive criticism of the relationship between Tony Blair and George W Bush, his shock on seeing their private correspondence for the first time. He also spoke of his own relief at how the families of those killed in the conflict received his report when it was finally published. But he speaks plainly on perhaps the most fundamental political question of all, the role of the former prime minister. When asked if Tony Blair had been as straight with the country and the inquiry as he ought to have been, Sir John told me, 'any prime minister taking a country into war has got to be straight with the nation and carry it, so far as possible, with him or her. I don't believe that was the case in the Iraq instance."" He went on to say he believed Tony Blair had given an ""emotional truth"" to the inquiry, and had been ""suffering"" during its sessions - Tony Blair was always, he said ,""the advocate"" for whom, ""persuasion is everything"". A spokesperson for the former prime minister referred us to his comments when the inquiry was published, when he said the report showed there were no lies, and no deceit, but that he took responsibility for the criticisms of how decisions had been made. You won't be surprised, having undertaken such a huge task, that Sir John speaks on a massive range of issues concerned with the Iraq war. The conflict may have begun 14 years ago now, the inquiry taking longer than the war itself. But for our politics, our diplomacy, and our military, this new more personal account will still resonate today.

Purged: The officers who cannot go home to Turkey,"Maria Psara meeting two unidentified Turkish officers Last July, a botched military coup led to fighting on the streets of Ankara and Istanbul. Quickly peace was restored, the perpetrators were arrested - and a purge began of thousands of people, from judges to teachers, accused of links with the plotters. As Maria Psara in Brussels explains, the purge reached as far as Belgium, where its effects are still being felt. Sitting at the back of a small cafe in Brussels, the two men were looking around to check whether they had been followed. The two women who accompanied them were silent, waiting for a signal that it was safe to talk. Ibrahim had already told me that they all feared for their lives. ""The Turkish media call us 'terrorists' and say that Turkish or even Russian intelligence should kill us,"" he said. ""Turkish officials describe us as traitors and advise people to attack us if they meet us."" A year ago, Ibrahim and Abdullah (not their real names) were high-ranking members of the Turkish military delegation to Nato. Now they are jobless and de facto stateless - two of the myriad casualties of a purge that followed an attempted military coup in Turkey a year ago. Ayse and Deniz (also pseudonyms) are the wives of two other purged Turkish Nato officers. All their lives have changed dramatically. They have lost their homes and their incomes and may never be able to return to the country of their birth. After the unsuccessful coup on the night of 15 July 2016, tens of thousands of civil servants, judges, teachers, journalists, and others were arrested, suspected of being followers of Fethullah Gulen, the exiled cleric who is supposed - although he denies it - to have orchestrated the attempt to overthrow Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Among them were hundreds of military officers, but those serving abroad felt safe. It was clear, at least, that they had not taken any active role in the fighting. ""The Turkish army has more than 600,000 personnel,"" says Ibrahim. ""If an army of this size has decided to carry out a coup, it does not need the few officers it has abroad to execute it. The ones in Turkey would suffice."" One of the officers holds his cancelled passport In August, however, lists of names began to arrive in Brussels every Friday after business hours - they were the names of officers who had been suspended or dismissed without explanation. At the end of September, a long document with 221 names arrived at Turkish missions abroad, including the Nato headquarters in Brussels and in Mons, nearby. In it, the Turkish General Staff ordered the officers to return to Turkey immediately, again without explanation. ""My name was in the list. We called Turkey in an attempt to understand the accusations against us,"" says Abdullah. ""Take the first flight back,"" was the only response. Those who didn't comply were purged in a decree issued on 22 November, accusing them of links with a ""terrorist organisation"", a reference to the Gulenist movement. Their assets in Turkey were frozen and their passports were cancelled. By this stage it had long become clear that obeying the summons to Turkey was fraught with danger. A group of officers who were quick to sell their furniture and their cars, and close their contracts with electricity and gas suppliers, returned in early October and almost all were arrested - some on arrival at the airport, others when they reported to headquarters. Around the same time, a Navy officer was called from Brussels to an emergency meeting on ""standardisation"" at the general staff in Ankara. ""Anyone in the armed forces knows that standardisation is not a subject that one would ever classify as emergency. Even though everything about this meeting was fishy, the officer went because there was no reason to be afraid,"" says Ibrahim. It turned out to be a set-up. He was arrested and has been in jail awaiting trial ever since. ""Up until now, he has not been informed about any evidence against him,"" Abdullah says. His wife and three children, who were not officially notified of his arrest, remain behind in Belgium, trying to survive without him. Describing these family tragedies, and their own, the officers and officers' wives are understandably grim-faced. One story, though, evokes a bitter smile. The men explain that a colleague was involved in a serious road accident in the days before the coup. At the time it happened he was in intensive care in a Belgian hospital. ""He was unconscious,"" Ibrahim says. But he too was accused of being involved in the coup. Overall, more than 700 officers out of 950 officers serving at Nato and in Turkish diplomatic missions around the world are estimated to have been purged. Most have applied for asylum in their host countries, and some - in Germany and Norway, for example - have already received it. Most of the Turkish officers in Belgium were living with their families in military housing. Many were ordered to move out at the end of September, though those in Mons were allowed to stay until the end of the school year, because their children went to school on the base. Some left early anyway, to start adapting to their new life as soon as possible. Others stayed, on the grounds that they had nothing to hide and were not afraid. ""However hard the Turkish national military representative tried to make us leave the base and make life harder for us, Nato put up a stance against his illogical arguments,"" says Abdullah. The head of Nato's allied command headquarters in Mons, Gen Curtis Scaparotti, dismissed the idea that these officers could have been involved in the planning of a coup, Abdullah says. Foreign colleagues tried to help in different ways. Some offered monetary help, others invited the Turkish families to Christmas dinner, some even offered their personal houses in their homelands. ""Unanimously, all advised against going back to Turkey."" For children, moving from the Nato school to a Belgian school is a huge change. Suddenly, instead of studying in English, they are in an environment where everyone speaks either Flemish or French. The families have so far been surviving on their savings. They will soon need to find work - but they are barred from employment until, or unless, they are granted asylum. They are also hesitant about leaving the house, afraid of being targeted by pro-Erdogan zealots. More than three-quarters of Turks in Belgium who cast a ballot in a referendum held last April voted in favour of granting sweeping new powers to the president. Clashes between the president's supporters and opponents, as voting took place, left several in hospital. Since they were teenagers the officers have been at military schools, and have always been reluctant to express political views. They deny any connection with Fethullah Gulen. At the same time, they are clearly deeply alarmed by the direction President Erdogan is leading the country - away from the West, as they see it, closer to the Muslim world and to Russia. A faction of the Turkish military attempted to overthrow the government, bombing the Turkish parliament and presidential palace, and sending tanks into the streets of Istanbul and Ankara President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called people on to the streets to demonstrate against the coup Opposition leaders and top military commanders also publicly denounced it 260 died and thousands were injured Erdogan accused a leading US general of siding with the coup plotters and demanded the extradition of Fethullah Gulen from the US - American officials said they would first need evidence of his involvement Find out more:Erdogan's Turkey The role of the Turkish Army as the guardian of a modern secular republic is under threat, they argue, while the purge has resulted in pro-Western officers being replaced with officers who either support political Islam or have a ""pro-East, pro-Russia ideology"". Privately, Nato sources admit that the quality of the new officers is nowhere near that of those who were forced out. The patriotism of the former officers is visible in their anger. ""See this?"" asks Abdullah, showing his passport. ""Throughout my whole life I have served my country, my flag, and now I have to hide my identity, although I did nothing wrong."" ""Our husbands sacrificed their daily life, their family life for their work. They were married with their work, not with us,"" says Ayse. Abdullah says his greatest wish for the future is for Turkey to ""return to normality"" as he puts it. ""To be again a country we would be proud of,"" he adds. ""And we want to go back.""

Is humour the way to keep an office happy?,"Humour can bring offices together Have you heard the joke about the humourless office worker who went for a promotion? He didn't get it. In workplaces around the world a bit of humour can go a long way towards making it a more enjoyable place to spend eight or so hours a day. But for every genuinely funny employee or boss, there are others whose unfunny or inappropriate jokes make colleagues wince. So treading carefully, how exactly does humour help both improve a workplace and the standing of the person who is good at it? When Steve Carlisle, president of General Motors of Canada, walks around the firm's Ontario headquarters he shares jokes, and uses humour to bond with his staff. ""I believe having a sense of humour is part of the leadership package,"" Mr Carlisle says. ""It can help people feel more relaxed, more comfortable and thus be more effective at what they do."" Steve Carlisle says President Donald Trump has been a rich source of material What Mr Carlisle brings to his role at the car giant is exactly what a business professor called Maurice Schweitzer cautiously recommends. Prof Schweitzer recently co-authored a study entitled Risky Business: When Humour Increases and Decreases Status. It found that a worker or boss who successfully use humour is seen as both confident and competent, which in turn increases his or her status. ""In the workplace context, people look up to those who are confident,"" says Prof Schweitzer, who works at the University of Philadelphia's Wharton School. ""Being funny is taking a risk, and being risky shows confidence."" Prof Schweitzer urges any would-be office humorist to be cautious But do workers think that a humorous colleague is more competent at his or her job? Prof Schweitzer says that telling a good joke requires both intellect and empathy, which makes colleagues believe that the person has a greater level of competency across the board. ""Being funny requires us to take into consideration other people's points of view, and what they may find funny,"" he explains. ""And being funny means you understand effective timing, and how to straddle a fine line between what is humorous and what's offensive."" Prof Schweitzer adds that if a person tells inappropriate jokes, be they insulting or unfunny, they are still regarded as more confident, but - perhaps unsurprisingly - also incompetent. The study says: ""Telling inappropriate jokes signals low competence, and the combined effect of high confidence and low competence harms status."" Ricky Gervais' toe-curling character David Brent, in The Office, regularly over-stepped the mark when it came to office humour Essentially, you don't want to be like David Brent, the cringeworthy fictional boss from The Office, the TV comedy series that was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. ""Humour creates a flattening of relationships in a hierarchal company,"" says Jennifer Moss, co-founder of Toronto's Plasticity Labs, which conducts research on emotional intelligence and happiness for businesses. ""To create stronger engagement with your staff, it helps to be humorous."" One example Prof Schweitzer cites of a good use of humour is a tweet sent out back in 2009 by former Twitter chief operating officer Dick Costolo. Mr Costolo tweeted: ""First full day as Twitter COO tomorrow. Step one, undermine CEO, consolidate power."" As it happened, Mr Costolo did actually go on to become Twitter's chief executive a year later, holding the role for five years before ultimately leaving the company. Prof Schweitzer says: ""Mr Costolo's not a seasoned veteran when it comes to comedy, he's not a comedian but he endeared himself to the company."" In fact, having some fun in the office can combat negative side effects of intense jobs. In a 2006 study published in The Journal of Behavioral and Applied Management, researchers found that for healthcare workers, emotional exhaustion was significantly lower among those who experienced greater levels of fun at work. Will someone please file a complaint with HR Also, research out of Vrije University Amsterdam concluded that teams that share more jokes gave more supportive and constructive statements to each other, such as ""that's a great idea"" or ""we could solve this problem by doing X"". When it comes to the type of humour you might want to try out on your workmates, Prof Schweitzer says that self-deprecation ""can be effective"" because it humanises the joke-teller. Sarcasm can also be effectively used, according to Prof Adam Galinsky of Columbia Business School, but he urges a cautious approach. He says sarcastic humour works best when trust and playfulness has been established between parties, otherwise a wrongly-placed sarcastic comment can appear flippant or cruel. ""Sarcasm requires a cognitive capacity to understand flexibility of thinking and how words can be interpreted,"" says Prof Galinsky. ""It is a particular type of social intelligence that not everyone uses or grasps.""

Does selling up mean selling out? 'I turned my dad's erotic novel into a hit podcast' Would you carry something abroad for a stranger? Barbara Plester, senior lecturer at the University of Auckland Business, says it is simply vital for jokes to not cause offence. The author of The Complexity of Workplace Humour: Laughter, Jokers and the Dark Side of Humour, also cautions about high-ranking managers bringing comedy to the office. ""While some managers do retain and use their sense of humour, the potential for causing distress is even greater when you add a power differential,"" she says. ""Therefore, a manager joking with a subordinate risks not only offending the worker if the humour is taken poorly, but may come in for other accusations, such as sexual harassment, if the humour backfires."" Workplace expert Barbara Plester wonders if staff just laugh at jokes to please the boss Ms Plester also warns that senior staff sharing jokes ""can never be sure if they are really funny, or if others laugh because the manager has power and so subordinates laugh strategically to please the boss."" Connecticut resident Tim Washer never shied away from being the ""funny guy at work"", thanks to growing up appreciating comedians and even trying some stand-up. Now a comedy writer and consultant, Mr Washer says the right wisecrack will ease tension and help bonding. He says: ""If I tell a joke and you laugh, then we've shared a moment and we have something in common.""

Blair 'not straight' with UK over Iraq,"This video can not be played Blair 'not straight' with country over Iraq, says Sir John Chilcot Tony Blair was not ""straight with the nation"" about his decisions in the run up to the Iraq War, the chairman of the inquiry into the war has told the BBC. Speaking for the first time since publishing his report a year ago, Sir John Chilcot discussed why he thinks the former PM made those decisions. He said the evidence Mr Blair gave the inquiry was ""emotionally truthful"" but he relied on beliefs rather than facts. A spokesman for Mr Blair said ""all these issues"" had been dealt with. They added that Sir John had also made clear that he believed Mr Blair had ""not departed from the truth"". In a wide-ranging, exclusive interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Sir John also talked about Mr Blair's state of mind during the inquiry and his relationship with the then US President George W Bush in the build-up to the 2003 conflict. In full: Transcript of Chilcot interview Chilcot on Blair, Bush and Iraq - a year on Chilcot report: Findings at-a-glance Iraq Inquiry: Timeline of key moments Sir John also admitted that at the start of the inquiry he had ""no idea"" how long it would take, but defended its conduct and the seven years it took to complete. The inquiry concluded that Mr Blair overstated the threat posed by Iraq leader Saddam Hussein and the invasion was not the ""last resort"" action presented to Parliament, when it backed the action, and the public.

In the immediate aftermath of the inquiry itself, Sir John, a former Whitehall permanent secretary who had worked for decades at the highest level of government, declined to take further part in the debate, as his and his panels' conclusions were digested. But in the run-up to the report's anniversary, he agreed to speak for the first time about the inquiry's conclusions, its criticisms and consequences for us all. Read more on this here Asked if the former prime minister had been as straight as he could have been with the country and the inquiry, Sir John told the BBC: ""Any prime minister taking a country into war has got to be straight with the nation and carry it, so far as possible, with him or her. I don't believe that was the case in the Iraq instance."" He went on: ""Tony Blair is always and ever an advocate. He makes the most persuasive case he can. Not departing from the truth but persuasion is everything. Advocacy for my position, 'my Blair position'."" He said the former Labour leader gave the case for war based on his own assessment of the circumstances,  saying Mr Blair made the case ""pinning it on my belief, not on the fact, what the assessed intelligence said."" ""You can make an argument around that, both ethical and - well, there is an ethical argument I think."" Asked by the BBC whether Mr Blair gave the fullest version of events, Sir John replied: 'I think he gave an - what was - I hesitate to say this, rather but I think it was from his perspective and standpoint, emotionally truthful and I think that came out also in his press conference after the launch statement. ""I think he was under very great emotional pressure during those sessionsâ¦ he was suffering. He was deeply engaged. Now in that state of mind and mood you fall back on your instinctive skill and reaction, I think."" The UK's seven-year involvement in Iraq resulted in the deaths of 179 British personnel Sir John criticises Tony Blair's ""with you whatever"" memo to US President George W Bush in 2002 Sir John also talked at length about Mr Blair's relationship with the US president in the build-up to the war. ""Tony Blair made much of, at various points, the need to exert influence on American policy making,"" he said. ""To do that he said in terms at one point, 'I have to accept their strategic objective, regime change, in order to exert influence.' For what purpose? To get them to alter their policy? Of course not. So in effect it was a passive strategy. Just go along."" Commenting on the documentation revealed when the Iraq Inquiry was published, Sir John revealed that his first response on reading a note sent by Mr Blair to Mr Bush in 2002 in which he told him 'I shall be with you whatever', was ""you mustn't say that"". His reaction was: ""You're giving away far too much. You're making a binding commitment by one sovereign government to another which you can't fulfil. You're not in a  position to fulfil it.  I mean he didn't even know the legal position at that point."" Chilcot rejects Blair's case for war Blair: World better because of Iraq War Asked if the relationship between Mr Blair and Mr Bush was appropriate, Sir John says the former prime minister was running ""coercive diplomacy"" that clashed with the settled position of the government. ""I think that the fundamental British strategy was fractured, because our formal policy, right up to the autumn of 2002 was one of containment. That was the concluded decision of cabinet. ""But the prime minister was running one of coercive diplomacy. With the knowledge and support of the foreign secretary, but the foreign secretary hoped that diplomacy would win and not coercion. I think to the prime minister it probably looked the other way round."". Residents fled the city of Basra in March 2003 Speaking after the publication of the Iraq Inquiry report last year, Mr Blair said he felt sorrow and regret at the deaths of 179 British personnel in Iraq between 2003 and 2009 and those of countless Iraqi civilians. He accepted the intelligence had been wrong and post-war planning had been poor. But he insisted that he did what he thought was the ""right thing"" at the time and he still believed Iraq was ""better off"" without Saddam Hussein. In response to Sir John's interview, a spokesman for Mr Blair said on Thursday: ""A full reading of the interview shows that Sir John makes clear that Mr Blair had not 'departed from the truth'. ""Sir John also makes clear that on the eve of the invasion Mr Blair, 'asked the then Chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee, can you tell me beyond any reasonable doubt that Saddam has weapons of mass destruction. To which the answer was, yes I can. He was entitled to rely on that'. ""Five different inquiries have all shown the same thing: that there was no falsifying of the intelligence."" Maj Gen Tim Cross, who was involved in post-war planning in Iraq and gave evidence to the inquiry, said Mr Blair was ""an emotional guy"" and that he was ""sure"" his emotions affected the decision to go to war. He told BBC Breakfast: ""When I briefed Tony Blair, it was quite clear that he felt this was a necessity, that there was a just cause, that we had to do something about this. How he portrayed that politicallyâ¦ I do not think he played it very well."" Current Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was an opponent of the Iraq War, said various reports into it had concluded ""there was an interpretation placed on advice that Tony Blair was given that was simply not correct and we ended up going to war with Iraq and the consequences are still with us"". Lord Menzies Campbell, who was foreign affairs spokesman for the Lib Dems at the time they were opposing the war, said:  ""In truth, Mr Blair's decision was fundamentally wrong. ""A bad decision, even if made in good faith, is still a bad decision.""

Grotbags actress Carol Lee Scott dies,"Actress Carol Lee Scott, who was best known as Grotbags the witch, has died at the age of 74. She appeared in children's programmes in the 1980s and early 1990s, including ITV'sRod Hull's Emu's World,external. Her family confirmed the news on social media, with her niece Gina Mear writing on Facebook on Wednesday that the actress had ""lost her brave fight against cancer"". ""To many of you she was Grotbags - a legend!"" she said. Lee Scott appeared in a TV show with Rod Hull and Emu ""To me she was just aunty Carol. I shall miss her hugely, rest in peace Carol."" The actress was warmly remembered by comic and performer Rufus Hound, whodescribed her,externalas ""an icon for folk of my generation"". Hull's son Toby added his voice to the tributes,tweeting,external: ""Sending our thoughts to the family of Carol Lee Scott, what great memories we have of her. Xx"" David Lee, from Pantoni Pantomimes, told the BBC: ""I was saddened to receive news of Carol's passing. She appeared in two pantomimes for me; Aladdin in Canterbury in 1984 and Aston Under Lyne with the late Ken Goodwin. ""She was a real trooper and in the time honoured tradition of showbiz, 'the show must go on!'. During the Canterbury panto run we had agreed she could take a cabaret appearance on Xmas Day near London. ""That day she badly injured her ankle but she was back on stage on Boxing Day and completed the run pushed around in a wheelchair by her sidekick in the show who played a Dragon. ""She was also a tremendous cabaret artist and great rock and roll performer. Thanks for some fabulous memories. RIP Carol."" Her character Grotbags was a dastardly pantomime witch, with a bright green wig and face to match. She famously hated ""brats"" and did her best to spoil the fun of children, using her ""Bazazzer"" - a pointy stick with a gold hand on the end of it. Fans of the show flooded Twitter with comments, with Gary Dewarwriting,external: ""Daleks. Zelda. Skeletor. Nothing - NOTHING - terrified me quite like Grotbags. Bravo!"" Noobadded,external: ""Rest in peace Grotbags. You made my early years awesome. I was so scared of you!"" Lee Scott, who was born in Somerset, began her career with cabaret performances touring clubs in the north of England, as well as stints as a London pub singer and as a Pontins Blue Coat. She worked for the holiday park for 19 years before she began collaborating with Hull on a series of children's 1980s TV shows. They created the character Grotbags during a summer season in Cleethorpes and stayed friends until his death in 1999. Grotbags first appeared in Emu's World before going on to get her own eponymous show, which ran on ITV for three series between 1991 and 1993.

Western civilisation is at stake - Trump,"People listening to the speech held up portraits of Mr Trump (centre right) and Polish President Andrzej Duda US President Donald Trump has argued that the future of Western civilisation is at stake in a keynote speech in the Polish capital Warsaw. Holding up Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, he warned against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"". Criticising Russia, Mr Trump urged Moscow to ""join the community of responsible nations"". Mr Trump is in Poland ahead of a G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. In Warsaw, he addressed a large, cheering crowd from the monument to the 1944 Uprising in the city, on Krasinski Square. Poland's conservative government shares Mr Trump's hostile view of immigration and strong sense of sovereignty. Five reasons why Trump is visiting Poland Putin and Trump in their own words What future for the Atlantic alliance? Poland country profile ""As the Polish experience reminds us, the defence of the West ultimately rests not only on means but also on the will of its people to prevail,"" Mr Trump said. ""The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive."" This video can not be played President Trump said North Korea faced consequences for its ""very, very bad behaviour"" He called on Russia to ""cease its destabilising activities in Ukraine and elsewhere and its support for hostile regimes including Syria and Iran"". Instead, he said, Russia should ""join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself"". The US leader is to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in Hamburg. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian presidency did not accept that Russia had been destabilising the region. ""This is exactly why we are waiting for the first meeting of the two presidents,"" he added. Giving a news conference hours before the speech, Mr Trump: called on countries to demonstrate to North Korea that there were consequences for its ""very bad behaviour"" and said ""something will have to be done about it"" said America's ""strong alliance with Poland and Nato"" remained ""critical to deterring conflict"" said in reference to Syria that ""any nation which values human life can never tolerate the use of chemical weapons"" said CNN had taken ""too seriously"" a mock video he tweeted in whichhe wrestles a person with the broadcaster's logo for a head Mr Trump also said talks he had attended in Warsaw of 12 nations with interests in the Baltic, the Adriatic and the Black Sea - the ""Three Seas"" summit - had been ""incredibly successful"". The Polish government is trying to become less energy-dependent on Russia, and last month the first ever US liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipment arrived. Commending American LNG, Mr Trump told the news conference: ""You can never be held hostage to a single supplier."" The first US shipment of liquefied natural gas arrived in Poland in June A global glut in supply, however, has depressed prices and made it difficult for LNG exporters to turn a profit, Adam Sieminski, an energy analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Warsaw and three Baltic states have spoken against the construction of an offshore Russian gas pipeline to Germany, known as Nord Stream 2. US leaders are almost always guaranteed a warm welcome in Poland, which will contrast with the protests being planned for the G20 summit in Hamburg. Mr Trump talked of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victory over war"". Melania Trump (L) was entertained by Polish First Lady Agata Kornauser-Duda Sandwiched between Germany and Russia, Poland suffered centuries of partition and occupation and emerged from the Cold War a staunch ally of America, ready to commit troops to the US-led coalitions in Iraq and Afghanistan. By choosing to speak at the monument to the Warsaw Uprising, which was a desperate action ultimately crushed by the Nazis, Mr Trump appealed to fierce national pride. Poland's current government has been at odds with some other EU states over itsrefusal to accept refugeesunder a 2015 solidarity plan. Mr Trump's visit is seen as mutually beneficial by both Mr Trump and the Polish government, the BBC's Adam Easton reports from Warsaw. Greenpeace activists illuminate the Palace of Culture and Science with words ""No Trump Yes Paris"" However, the Polish branch of Greenpeace is using Mr Trump's visit to Warsaw to protest against his decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. The words ""No Trump Yes Paris"" were projected in huge green letters on the city's Palace of Culture and Science on Wednesday. Later on Thursday, the US leader will travel to Hamburg for what could be a potentially fractious summit. UK Prime Minister Theresa May and US President Donald Trump were being mocked by anti-capitalist protesters in Hamburg on Thursday He has fallen outwith some EU nations over climate changeand trade.UK Prime Minister Theresa May will challenge him over climate change,saying an international agreement on the issue should not be renegotiated. Aid organisations are expected to hold demonstrations in Hamburg urging the heads of government to do more to tackle inequality. ""It's important because you have the biggest meeting of all of the leading rulers of the main countries in the world - the G20 - and I don't like some of the politics that they're doing, especially that of [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, of Putin and of Trump,"" one protester told the BBC. ""No G20"": Demonstrators arrive by train in Hamburg on Thursday Security in Hamburg has been tightened, with police warning of potentially violent clashes. They have already confiscated a number of homemade weapons. EU leaders signed an agreement in principle with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Brussels on Thursday for a landmark free trade deal. It is estimated that 99% of trade between Japan and the EU will be liberalised, while an accompanying strategic partnership deal will see them co-operate in other areas, from climate change to tackling terrorism. Both want to show they are committed to a world order built on open trade and international co-operation, in contrast to Mr Trump's America that is turning inward, BBC Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas reports. EU-Japan trade talks had stalled after four years but when Mr Trump took office and scrapped his own possible Pacific trade partnership this year, it spurred them into action, and they resolved most of their differences in a matter of weeks.

Are your clothes polluting the ocean?,"In an indoor ""Manchester-drizzle-simulating"" rain room at the University of Leeds, and in a laundry lab in Plymouth, research is revealing the unexpected environmental cost of the very clothes on our backs. ""Not many people know that lots of our clothes are made of plastic,"" says Imogen Napper, a PhD student at Plymouth University, ""polyester, acrylic."" Ms Napper and Prof Richard Thompson study marine microplastics - fragments and fibres found in the ocean surface, the deep sea and the marine food chain. And in a recent lab study, they found that polyester and acrylic clothing shed thousands of plastic fibres each time it was washed- sending another source of plastic pollution down the drain and, eventually, into the ocean. ""My friends always make fun of me because they think of marine biology as such a sexy science - it's all turtles, hot countries and bikinis,"" says Ms Napper. ""But I've been spending hours washing clothes and counting the fibres."" It might not be exotic, but this painstaking ""laundry-science"" has revealed that an average UK washing load - 6kg (13lb) of fabric - can release: 140,000 fibres from polyester-cotton blend nearly half a million fibres from polyester more than 700,000 fibres from acrylic This video can not be played Some of the plastic found in the ocean has come from clothing, scientists say That is from every load of synthetic laundry from every UK washing machine. ""A lot more fibres were released in the wash than we expected,"" Ms Napper says. ""They're going down the drain, so they are making their way into the sewage treatment works and maybe, from there, into the marine environment."" Prof Thompson says washing clothes could be a ""significant source"" of plastic microfibres in the ocean. ""When we sample, we find plastic fibres less than the width of a human hair - in fish, in deep sea sediments, as well as [floating] at the surface."" Changes need to happen ""at the design stage"", he says; better, harder-wearing and less ""disposable"" clothing would last longer and be good for the environment. ""The garments [we washed] were similar fleecy garments, and some were shedding fibres much faster than others,"" Prof Thompson says. ""We need to understand why some garments wear out much more quickly than others, so we can try to minimise unnecessary emissions of plastic."" And scientists now have the backing of possibly the most wholesome of British organisations;the Women's Institute, decided just last month to campaign,externalfor what they called ""innovative solutions"" to the problem of microplastic fibres in the ocean. Our plastic rubbish has floated to islands that are thousands of miles from the nearest human population Prof Richard Blackburn, head of the sustainable materials research group at the University of Leeds,external, agrees that textile-makers need to think about what happens ""in use"", when we wear and wash our clothes. ""People don't consider it,"" he says. ""So, potentially, the pollution could be caused by us - the consumers - rather than the manufacturers."" Prof Blackburn's colleague in Leeds, Philippa Hill, was also drawn to the subject of laundry - by chemical coatings being washed off outdoor clothing. This video can not be played Chemical coating make our nylon raincoats repel water - but they could come off in the wash The waterproofing most high-end, rain-proof jackets are treated with consists of perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), which are persistent and potentially toxic pollutants. Coating textiles and other materials with PFCs makes them resistant to stains, grease, and water. They are also used in some non-stick pans and food packaging. These molecules sit on top of the (usually nylon) outer fabric like a protective layer of chemical barbed wire - the tip of every barb pushes away water molecules, which are too large to pass through the spaces in between. Air molecules can pass through freely, resulting in a non-sweaty, breathable, waterproof jacket. Fluorochemical coatings have been used for decades to make nylon jackets water-repellent, but breathable But, asDr Andrew Sweetman, from the Lancaster Environment Centre,external, points out, lab and field studies have shown that some PFCs can accumulate in the tissues of fish and other wildlife as they consume contaminated food and water - building up a dose that can become harmful. Essentially, they don't degrade,"" he explains to BBC News.  ""So if we take samples from waterways, as a result of their widespread use and persistence, we basically find them wherever we look."" Scientists report finding fluorinated chemicals in waterways 'wherever they look' And while textiles manufacturers have to abide by regulations to limit the pollution they release into waterways, Prof Blackburn says, ""there are no limits on what we can release from our own homes"". Prof Blackburn and Ms Hill compared PFC-coated fabric with that treated with more benign oil-based coatings that also repel water. ""We took samples of fabrics that had been coated with the different treatments,"" says Prof Blackburn. ""And we'd carry out industry-standard tests - showering them with water and measuring their performance. ""We demonstrated that new coatings - that are not based on [fluorochemicals, or PFCs,] give just as good water-repellency as the fluorochemical coatings that have been around for decades."" A campaign last year by Greenpeace spurred several outdoor brands to promise to end their use of PFCs in their clothing And a representative of the European Outdoor Group (EOG) - the body that represents the outdoor industry - said of Prof Blackburn and Ms Hill's research: ""This is the kind of data we need to make decisions on. ""It's a real challenge, but brands are very keen to have this information and to move away from PFCs."" However, Prof Blackburn also makes the point that in comparison with the environmental footprint of the natural fibre cotton, many synthetics are actually ""pretty clean"". ""I always tell my new students that to grow 1kg of cotton consumes the amount of water you've drunk in your lifetime,"" he says. And bringing into the mainstream what are currently relatively niche ""bio-plastic"" fabrics could help clean up the industry further. These bio-synthetics are available and gradually becoming more popular: lyocell,external- a fibre made from trees PLA fabric,externalmade from fermented food waste artificial vegan,externalleather made from pineapple Henry Ford developed soybean-based plastic fibres,external.Casein fibres - made from milk,external- have also been developed. But, Prof Blackburn says, ""these never received the research focus or attention, with the advent of the petrochemical synthetic fibre industry"". He cites further examples, of fibres made from fermented food waste and fruit skins. ""Poly[lactic acid] fibre or PLA is made by fermenting waste corn to make lactic acid, which is then polymerised to make this bio-polyester,"" he says. ""That's a great fibre, but has largely been used for packaging - the [fabric research] has fallen by the wayside."" But while the new research puts pressure on the textile and clothing manufacturers to clean up their act, there is something we can all very easily do to reduce the impact of what we wear on the environment. ""We are unsustainably addicted to consumption,"" says Prof Blackburn. ""I cannot emphasise enough how much of a step-change it would be for sustainability if we bought fewer items of clothing per year, wore them for longer and threw them away less often.""

"'We served our country, 70 years apart'","It's 100 years since women were legally allowed to serve in the British military. Back then most were cooks or worked in administration. Today they are deployed in many different roles around the world. Only last year theban was lifted on women serving in close combat units, enabling women to fight on the frontline for the first time. Newsbeat meets three women who served their country in very different times. ""Food is definitely the morale of the ship. If there isn't the right amount of food then people won't work to the best of their ability. So it's a tough job but a job that needs to be done."" After five and a half years of working as a chef, Lynsey is about to train to become a naval nurse. ""There's definitely something for everybody. There's the opportunity that if you join as one thing and you decide you want to change or do something different there are opportunities [to do that]."" ""In my day, 1944, they assumed you had an education, which in my case, was not quite accurate."" Marie signed up to the Wrens when she was 17 years old and became a trained switchboard operator. ""I was a war time Wren, stationed at probably the most important part of the country on D-Day. ""I had been given special training on a rather innovative piece of equipment called a VHF set. ""What I didn't realise until I began to operate it was that it was actually connected to the beaches at Normandy."" The Wrens were the Women's Royal Naval Service, which has since become part of the Royal Navy. ""Memories are a bit hazy now after 73 years, you can remember the highlights but the minutiae of the day has disappeared."" Lynsey and Sara at HMS President on the River Thames Sara's job involves overseeing HR and legal issues. She's served on HMS Westminster which has carried out anti-piracy work in the Gulf and has also worked at a nuclear submarine base. Last year former prime minister, David Cameron, lifted a ban on women serving in close combat units. ""If a woman can prove herself in the tests that men have to do then she should be given that fair opportunity to be in combat situations,"" says Lynsey. ""I think it's going to be an amazing thing,"" she tells Newsbeat. Sara also thinks it's a brilliant opportunity. ""It's been a man's world for a very long time and I think for a woman to be able to do it, if they can do it, then I think it's brilliant."" The expectation is that the number of women applying for these roles will be small, but the decision to lift the ban puts the UK in line with other countries such as the US. But Marie thinks the decision may not be a good thing. ""Women can be very vulnerable in those situations. If they're captured by the enemy they could undergo all sorts of fearful torture and sexual abuse. I don't think it should happen."" 12 women who are either serving in the Armed Forces or are veterans The Armed Forces charity SSAFA has marked the anniversary with a photo shoot. Both Sara (sitting front and centre right) and Lynsey (sitting far right) are pictured. The 12 women photographed include the first woman to kill in combat, the highest-ranking woman in the British Army and the first transgender woman to serve.

Malawi stadium stampede kills eight,"Thousands queued to get into the stadium, even after the earlier stampede Eight people - including seven children - have died in a stampede ahead of a football match in Malawi, police say. Dozens more were injured in the crush at Lilongwe's Bingu national stadium. The stampede happened as thousands of people rushed for seats ahead of a friendly between top sides Nyasa Big Bullets and Silver Strikers. Despite the deaths, the match did go ahead in a packed stadium, although President Peter Mutharika did not attend as planned. He offered his condolences and said the government would do all it could to assist the families of the bereaved. He said he was shocked to learn of the tragedy.

EU and Japan reach free trade deal,"European Council president Donald Tusk shakes hands with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe The European Union and Japan have formally agreed an outline free-trade deal. The agreement paves the way for trading in goods without tariff barriers between two of the world's biggest economic areas. However, few specific details are known and a full, workable agreement may take some time. Two of the most important sectors are Japanese cars and, for Europe, EU farming goods into Japan. Analysis: Damian Grammaticas, BBC News The EU and Japan have done two deals for the price of one: a trade deal and a complementary ""Strategic Partnership"". One will create a major free-trading economic bloc, the second will see them co-operate in other areas like combating climate change. Both are ""in principle"" deals, some details to be agreed, so there could still be hurdles. But the signal this sends, bringing two of the world's biggest economic powers together, is unmistakeable. EU-Japan negotiations began in 2012 then stalled. It was Donald Trump's election, and the inward turn America is taking, that spurred the EU and Japan to overcome their differences. Both want to show domestic audiences they can deliver signature deals that promise new economic opportunities. They also want to send a clear message internationally that the EU and Japan, highly-developed democracies, remain committed to a liberal, free-trading, rules-based world, and they will seek to shape it even if the US won't. The outline plan was signed in Brussels after a meeting between the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, and the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on the eve of a meeting of the G20 group of leading economies in Hamburg. It comes hard on the heels of the collapse of a long-awaited trade agreement between Japan, the US and other Pacific ring countries, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was scrapped in January by US President Donald Trump. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the agreement showed the EU's commitment to world trade: ""We did it. We concluded EU-Japan political and trade talks. EU is more and more engaged globally."" Mr Tusk also said the deal countered the argument put forward by some of those in favour of Brexit that the EU was unable to promote free trade: ""Although some are saying that the time of isolationism and disintegration is coming again, we are demonstrating that this is not the case."" He added that the deal was not just about common trade interests, but reflected ""the shared values that underpin our societies, by which I mean liberal democracy, human rights and the rule of law"". Japan is the world's third-largest economy, with a population of about 127 million. As it stands, the country is Europe's seventh biggest export market. One of the most important trade categories for the EU is dairy goods. Japan's appetite for milk and milk-based products has been growing steadily in recent years. The EU's dairy farmers are struggling with falling demand in its home nations and an ultra-competitive buying climate, which farmers say means they are paid less than the cost of production. Even once the agreement is fully signed, the deal is likely to have in place long transition clauses of up to 15 years to allow sectors in both countries time to adjust to the new outside competition.

Arla boss warns of butter shortage,"The UK could be facing a butter and cream shortage this Christmas, the boss of dairy giant Arla has warned. ""The first sign we will see of it, is that the price of butter rises very sharply,"" Peder Tuborgh, chief executive of the farmer-owned firm told the BBC. There was insufficient milk being supplied by farmers to make the products, he said. The National Farmers' Union dubbed his comments ""scaremongering"". Arla Foods is a large European milk co-operative, owned by dairy farmers including British ones, and is the largest UK milk buyer. Its brands include Anchor and Cravendale, and it has annual revenues of 9.6bn euros (Â£8.4bn). Mr Tuborgh said the milk shortage had come about because producers ""put the brakes on"" in 2016, in the wake of previous overproduction of milk and consequently lower prices. He said consumers would feel the impact across Europe in the coming months, suggesting that price rises would differ between European nations. However, the Arla boss did not want to predict how much butter would cost later this year. ""At the moment, we are trying to get as much butter and cream out of our producers,"" he said. It comes as global butter prices have hit an all-time high, according to figures released on Thursday by theUN Food and Agriculture Organisation,external. The UN body said butter prices rose 14% last month because of higher demand for the fat and lower dairy exports from major producers. Simon Clapp, from Brue Valley Farms near Glastonbury where they make butter and cheese for the likes of M&S, Waitrose and Aldi, told BBC Radio 5 live: ""It's getting pretty tough, there's a shortage of fats across Europe and we're part of that. ""Since Brexit, the pound has weakened, so it's made products here more attractive, so cream is going abroad. ""We're seeing historic prices even above historic prices we've seen in the past - We've never been in this territory. ""This time last year, we'd spend 80p for cream to go into butter - now it's up to Â£2.50, Â£2.60."" The National Farmers' Union said the ""constant boom-and-bust dairy market cycle"" helped ""no-one, most of all farmers"". A spokesman for industry body Dairy UK said there had been ""significant increases"" in wholesale prices for butter and cream recently. It added: ""To what degree price increases are transmitted to consumers is a matter for retailers."" It said the global oversupply of milk less than two years ago had resulted in a ""difficult time for farmers"". ""This illustrates the fact that dairy markets are inherently subject to fluctuations and a sudden surge in milk production, or unseasonable weather which depresses production, can have a significant effect on wholesale prices for commodity products like butter and cream,"" Dairy UK said. The National Farmers Union said while there had been ""record prices"" for wholesale cream and butter in recent weeks, farm-gate prices had failed to keep up. According to the union, the ""lack of strong upward movement in farm-gate milk price"" was ""extremely concerning"". ""That said, scaremongering about lack of milk supply going forward only serves to concern consumers,"" the union said. ""It's no surprise that milk buyers are worried about milk volumes falling,"" it added. Confidence within dairy farming is at an all-time low - mistrust in the market dynamics and suspicion about how milk buyers are treating their supply base coupled with the lack of direction on the impact of Brexit on the dairy sector."" In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said that while farm-gate milk prices had fallen by 0.6% per litre in May 2017 compared with the previous month, they had risen by 31% compared with May 2016. It also said UK milk production increased by 4.7% in May compared with April, almost equalling production in May 2016. It's not the first time in recent years that we've had dark warnings of no cream with our mince pies. But hearing it from the boss of the world's fourth-largest dairy company carries some weight. Speaking to the National Farmers' Union, the prospect of an actual shortage seems to be overblown. But it's impossible to ignore the doubling in the price of cream and butter over the past year - though no one can quite pinpoint why it's happening. Since butter featured on the front cover of Time Magazine in 2014, its popularity has soared and demand for it is strong. In America, McDonald's has recently switched from margarine to butter. And others are following suit. We're drinking less skimmed milk, which means there is less cream which was taken from it. There's speculation in the UK that manufacturers are stockpiling butter and cream as the price rises - pushing it up further. On the supply side, the National Farmers' Union says farmers are wary of upping production too much because they fear another price crash - and the uncertainty caused by Brexit. For consumers, the impact is there - but less dramatic. A 250g block of butter currently costs Â£1.49, and a year ago it was Â£1.35, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Chicago gun violence claims 101 victims,"This video can not be played The BBC's Ian Pannell and Darren Conway report on life - and death- on the streets of Chicago At least 101 people were shot in Chicago over the Fourth of July weekend, 15 of them fatally, according to a city newspaper. Nearly half of the shootings during the four-day holiday happened over 12 hours, reports the Chicago Tribune. The youngest victim was a 13-year-old boy and the oldest a 60-year-old man. US President Donald Trump recently said he was sending in federal agents to help local police contain the Illinois city's gang wars. Five ways Trump can help Chicago About half of the shootings happened between 15:30 on Tuesday and 03:30 on Wednesday, mainly in Chicago's south and west sides. This video can not be played In September last year, the toll for homicides in Chicago passed 500 Not even the deployment of more than 1,000 extra officers by Chicago police department could staunch the violence. The casualties are significantly higher than 2016, when 66 people were shot in Chicago over the Independence Day weekend, which lasted three days. It brings the total number of people shot in Chicago so far in 2017 to more than 1,800,reports the Tribune,external. But that figure is not as severe as last year when 2,035 people had been shot by this point. At the weekend, Chicago police said shootings this year had declined 14% compared with the first six months of last year.

Trump warns NK of 'severe' consequences,"This video can not be played President Trump said North Korea faced consequences for its ""very, very bad behaviour"" US President Donald Trump has warned North Korea that he is considering a ""pretty severe"" response following the country's long-range missile test. ""They are behaving in a very, very dangerous manner and something will have to be done about it,"" he said. But he moderated his comments, saying: ""We'll just take a look at what happens over the coming weeks and months."" Pyongyang tested an intercontinental ballistic missile with the potential to hit the US state of Alaska on Tuesday. Despite the ICBM's relatively short flight and eventual crash into the sea, the test has been labelled a sharp military escalation by the US. ""I have pretty severe things that we're thinking about,"" Mr Trump said of a possible US response. ""That doesn't mean that we'll do them."" He said other nations should challenge Pyongyang's ""very, very bad behaviour"". Mr Trump was speaking in Warsaw, Poland, at a joint news conference with the Polish President Andrzej Duda. He is due to meet with other world leaders at the G20 summit in Germany on Friday. The president's comments follow those of US ambassador Nikki Haley, who told the United Nations Security Council that the US was willing to use its ""considerable military forces"" on North Korea ""if we must"". Is the new missile test a game-changer? Can the US defend itself against N Korea? Possible solutions to crisis The US and South Korea have already stepped up military drills, firing missiles into the Sea of Japan in an apparent show of strength. Pyongyang, however, said it would not negotiate over its missile programme unless the US ended its ""hostile policy"" against North Korea. The South Korean destroyer Yang Manchun was seeing firing an anti-ship missile Tuesday's ICBM launch was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council, but China and Russia, which are both veto-wielding members of the council, opposed the use of military force. President Trump had alreadycriticised China for its trade with North Korea,and is due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit this week. 'Worst tension since Korean War', says former US envoy Why is Donald Trump going to Poland? South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has voiced concern that the North's nuclear and missile development is ""proceeding much faster than expected"". Speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, where he met German leader Angela Merkel, he said they would ""examine possibilities of ramping up sanctions"". At the UN Security Council meeting in New York, France's ambassador said it also favoured a new resolution on North Korea to tighten sanctions. This video can not be played Why Trump only has bad North Korea options, as the BBC's Korea correspondent Steve Evans explains Russia, which condemned the test, said the possibility of using military measures ""should be excluded"". China's ambassador Liu Jieyi echoed similar sentiments and said ""military means must not be an option"". He repeated China and Russia's proposal that North Korea should halt its missile and nuclear programmes in exchange for US and South Korean military exercises in the region being frozen. They also propose reversing plans to deploy a controversial anti-missile system in the South. The ""US strategy of strength"" combined with pressure and engagement ""will never work"", state news agency KCNA said. Unless the US stopped its ""hostile policy"", North Korea would ""never put the nuke and ballistic rocket on the negotiating table"". This video can not be played North Korea missile launch: What we do know and don't know North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was earlier quoted as saying that Tuesday's launch was a ""gift"" to the Americans on their Independence Day, and that he had ordered officials to ""frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees"". Pyongyang said the Hwasong-14 ICBM had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flown 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea. North Korea, it said, was now ""a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world"". But while experts agree that the test shows Pyongyang has a long-range projectile, many are sceptical that its missiles can successfully deliver nuclear warheads. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14 North Korea's missile programme in detail Have missile tests paid off? What can the outside world do about N Korea?

Johnson: May's got show back on road,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson tells Today there is no PM vacancy Boris Johnson has dismissed leadership speculation, saying Theresa May has shown ""unbelievable grace and steel"". The foreign secretary said the PM had ""put things back together and got the show back on the road"" after a ""difficult"" election. Asked about about any leadership contest, he said there would not be a vacancy ""for a very long time"". He also appeared to backtrack on his previous support for axing the public sector pay cap. In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Johnson said he agreed with Chancellor Philip Hammond on public sector pay and the need to take a ""fiscally sensible and responsible"" approach. A source close to Mr Johnson had previously said the foreign secretary supported a better pay deal for public sector workers and believed this could be done without causing ""fiscal pressures"". Mr Johnson, who was briefly a rival to Mrs May in the Conservative leadership contest which followed David Cameron's resignation last year, sought to play down talk of a fresh contest. He said: ""The last thing people want is any more of this kind of nonsense. ""They want to see a long period of stability and calm and progress for the British people."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson praises Donald Trump's approach to politics on Today Mr Johnson also used his Today interview to urge China to step up economic pressure on North Korea following the launch of a long-range missile in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council. ""My view is that what the North Koreans are doing is reckless, it's indefensible, it's in defiance of UN resolutions, repeated UN resolutions, it's illegal and I think that it is very important that the world stands together against what they re doing. ""People will say well, what can we actually physically do, and the single most important thing is for the country with the most direct economic relationship with North Korea, that is China, has got to continue to put on the pressure. ""In the last six months or so, we are seeing some real changes in Beijing's attitude to North Korea and that's got to go further."" China and Russia have urged the United States to show restraint, after the American ambassador to the United Nations warned that North Korea's test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile had cast a dark shadow over the world. Nikki Haley told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the test represented a sharp military escalation. Asked about whether he believed US President Donald Trump, who will later meet Theresa May in Hamburg, was unpredictable she said the UK did not ""agree with everything Washington currently says"". But she added: ""I think, actually, that Donald Trump's approach to politics has been something that has gripped the imagination of people around the world. ""He's engaged people in politics in a way that we haven't seen for a long time, with his tweets and all the rest of it.  I do think that he raises people's awareness of issues, he engages in a very direct way.""

Schools issue Snapchat Map warning,"This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why the latest maps feature on Snapchat has caused some concern. Schools are warning parents that a new location-sharing feature in Snapchat could put children at risk. Snap Map lets users share their exact location with people on their ""friends"" list in real time. In a letter seen by the BBC, one school said the map raised ""serious safeguarding concerns"" because children could be tracked on the map. But Snap, the company behind Snapchat, says the feature is opt-in and can be switched off at any time. Snap Map was launched on 21 June and lets people browse a map of photos and videos that have been shared publicly. This video can not be played WATCH: What does Snap Map do? It also lets people share their exact location with those they have added as ""friends"" in the app. Users who are sharing their location appear on the map as a cartoon avatar. Some schools have criticised the accuracy of the location-sharing feature, with one warning that it could be used to ""build up a picture of home addresses, travel routes, schools and workplaces"". While location information is shared only with people on your ""friends"" list, that could include people you do not actually know, such as friends met on other apps and websites. Others have criticised the way the map was added to Snapchat without a detailed announcement explaining exactly how it worked. ""We know tech companies are constantly developing their platforms and we'd encourage them to provide signposted information for parents and young people, so they know how to keep themselves safe,"" said Rose Bray from the NSPCC. ""Parents could be given a bit of warning, so they can look up the information before the new feature launches, and have a conversation with their child."" One mother, Paula, told BBC Breakfast she was surprised to find her 11-year-old son had opted in to share his location. Paula had concerns that her son had enabled location sharing ""I didn't know anything about it,"" she said. ""Somebody had told him about it, one of his friends at school. ""I was a little bit worried about the fact that you could be pinpointed. Obviously there are predators, there are bullies."" Paula said she had discussed the feature with her son and they had agreed he would enable ""ghost mode"" to disappear from the map. In a statement, Snap said: ""The safety of our community is very important to us and we want to make sure that all Snapchatters, parents and educators have accurate information about how the Snap Map works."" The company stressed that location sharing on Snap Map was off by default, was an opt-in feature and could be switched off at any time. It told the BBC that the feature had to be accurate so that friends could use it to find one another and meet up. It added that ""the majority of interactions on Snapchat take place between close friends"", unlike some social networks that are designed for people to discover and follow new friends. However, when asked by the BBC why it had not warned users that the map was about to be launched, the company did not comment. The National Crime Agency's Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (Ceop) haspublished guidance for parents,externalwho want to know more about Snapchat and Snap Map. It says parents should encourage children to share their location only in private messaging apps with people they know. The BBC's Newsround programme has produced this short guide, explaining how to switch off location sharing.

"UK terror convictions rise, BBC data shows","Imran Khawaja, 27, of west London, was jailed in 2015 after travelling to fight in Syria More than 100 people in the UK have been convicted of terrorism offences related to Syria and Iraq since 2014, research by the BBC has revealed. The youngest is a schoolboy from Blackburnwho was 14 when he incited an act of terrorism in Australia. The figures also show there are growing numbers of women and girls being prosecuted. Police say five terror plots have been foiled since March and 18 thwarted since 2013. For the last two years the BBC has tracked the numbers of people from the UK who have been drawn into the conflict in Syria and Iraq. The most comprehensive online record of its kind, it shows the rapidly escalating number of prosecutions since 2014. Who are Britain's jihadists? - search the BBC's database Those convicted come from a wide cross section of society and include former prisoners, a hospital director and the son of a police officer. Married couples, siblings and a mother of six have also been prosecuted. Of the 109 people convicted, 18 (16%) were women and girls and interestingly, over 85% of those convicted have never been to Syria or Iraq. That's because some of the offences relate to those who have plotted to go and fight but who werearrested before putting their plans into action. Others have been convicted of using social media to encourage support for banned groups such as Islamic State. Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders told the BBC: ""We need to be acutely aware that if people can't go to Syria - and we have certainly seen this in some of the cases we have prosecuted - they may plan a sort of an attack here instead or they may do more to radicalise other people here to attack so we need to be very aware of that."" The DPP says the Crown Prosecution Service has the resources it needs to deal with the increased number of cases. After the London Bridge attack in which eight members of the public were killed, theprime minister called for a review of Britain's counter-terrorism strategyto make sure the police and the security services have the powers they need. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has announced that some of the country's most dangerous extremistshave been moved to a ""prison within a prison"",external. The inmates have been relocated to what the MoJ has called 'separation centres' within HMP Frankland in County Durham.

'Last chance to see' Mercury mission,"This video can not be played Watch: Inside the testing facility The two satellites that make up the BepiColombo mission to Mercury were presented to the media on Thursday. This joint European-Japanese venture has been in development for nearly two decades, but should finally get to the launch pad in 15 months' time. The two spacecraft will travel together to the baking world but separate on arrival to conduct their own studies. Thursday's event in the Netherlands was the last chance for journalists to view the so-called ""flight stack"". This is the edifice that goes on top of the rocket and comprises Europe's Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and Japan's Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO), as well as the propulsion module to control their path towards the world that circles closest to the Sun. As a single item, the stack has just finished a series of important tests, but it will shortly be taken apart so that the individual components can continue with their own preparations.  The structure will not be reassembled until all equipment reaches the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana. The double mission,externalis due to blast away from Earth on an Ariane rocket in October 2018. Everyone will have to be patient, however. It is going to take seven years for the satellite duo to get to their destination. The gravity of the Sun pulls hard on any spacecraft travelling into the inner Solar System, and Bepi will have to fire thrusters in the direction of travel to ensure it does not overshoot Mercury. ""Mercury is the least explored of the rocky planets, but not because it is uninteresting,"" said Prof Alvaro GimÃ©nez CaÃ±ete, the director of science at the European Space Agency (Esa). ""It's because it's difficult. It's difficult to get there; it's even more difficult to work there."" Temperatures on the surface of the diminutive world go well above 400C - hot enough to melt some metals, such as tin, zinc and lead. Europe's Mercury mission takes shape Mercury mission ends with a bang Water bonanza at Mercury's pole Europe's Airbus company led production of the MTM, MPO and the sun shield for MMO MTM is a propulsion module to control the cruise to Mercury Europe's Mercury Planetary Orbiter carries 11 instruments For the cruise phase, a sun shield protects the MMO At Mercury, Japan's orbiter dispenses with the shield It will simply spin to prevent its surfaces from overheating MMO and MPO will go into different polar orbits at Mercury The MPO and MMO will be looking to deepen and extend the knowledge gained at Mercury by the US space agencyâs recent Messenger mission. The American probe, which ceased operations in 2015, took some 270,000 images of the planet's surface and acquired 10 terabytes of other scientific measurements. It provided remarkable new insights on the composition and structure of the smallest terrestrial planet, and it made the amazing discovery that, despite those high temperatures, there are shadowed craters where it is still cold enough to support water-ice. Esa and the Japanese space agency (Jaxa) hope that the more advanced, higher-resolution technology on their satellites will be able to answer questions that Messenger could not. Esa's BepiColombo project scientist, Johannes Benkhoff, said: ""We need to come up with new ideas. And for that reason we need to have good instrumentation and we need to do very close monitoring of the planet; and we can do that with our spacecraft that we're sending to Mercury."" This video can not be played Emma Bunce: ""Bepi will allow us to make a step change in our understanding"" Past Mercury visitors were Nasa missions: Mariner 10 and Messenger The planet's diameter is 4,880km - about one-third that of the Earth It is the second densest planet in the Solar System: 5.4 grams/cu cm The Caloris Basin is the largest surface feature (1,550km across) It is an extreme place: surface temps swing between 425C and -180C There is water-ice in the planet's permanently shadowed craters Mercury's huge iron core takes up more than 60% of the planet's mass Apart from Earth, it is the only inner planet with a global magnetic field The key conundrum is why the planet contains an outsized iron core and only a thin veneer of silicate rocks. A favoured theory before Messenger was that Mercury at some point in its history was stripped of its outer layers, either by a big collision with another body or by the erosive effects of being so close to the Sun. But the American probe observed large abundances of volatile substances. ""They shouldn't be there had those events happened in Mercury's past; the sulphur and potassium volatiles on the surface just shouldn't be there,"" insisted Prof Emma Bunce, a principal investigating scientist from Leicester University, UK. ""And the other mystery about the surface is that there isn't much iron on it, seemingly; and so that needs to be looked into in more detail and that's something we'll be able to do with our imaging X-ray spectrometer, MIXS."" Europe's MPO will have a total of 11 instruments onboard. It will fly in a near-circular polar orbit around the planet, mapping the terrain, generating height profiles, sensing the interior, and collecting data on surface composition and the wispy ""atmosphere"". Japan's MMO will have five instruments and will investigate the planet's magnetic field. Mercury is the only terrestrial planet - apart from Earth - to have a global magnetic field. But it is an odd one. The field is roughly three times stronger in the northern hemisphere than it is in the south. This video can not be played Messenger compiled this coloured map of Mercury during its first year in orbit Both Esa and Jaxa are delighted to at last be approaching launch. The development of the mission, particularly on the European side, has been a torrid learning curve. The launch date was repeatedly put back as engineers struggled to find equipment that could cope with the intense heat and radiation experienced just a few tens of millions of km from the Sun. The development of solar cells in particular proved extremely problematic. ""We're flying into a pizza oven,"" quipped Esa project manager Ulrich Reininghaus. ""We had to test materials at different, very high temperature regimes, sometimes with very unwanted results."" When Esa's Science Programme Committee originally green-lit BepiColombo in 2000, it had in mind a launch in 2009. Even whenthe industrial contract to build the MPO was finally signed,externalin 2008, a launch was thought possible in 2013. Esa says the mission is costing roughly â¬1.65bn (Â£1.45bn; $1.85bn). This includes all European and Japanese costs. One fascinating aside. That SPC meeting in 2000 also approved Esa participation in the successor space telescope to Hubble, which is called the James Webb Space Telescope. Its development schedule has also been heavily delayed and is itself now booked for launch on an Ariane in October 2018. But it is not possible to put both missions up at the same time, so one will have to stand aside. A decision on whether it is Bepi or JWST that goes first is likely to be made this September.

Trump to set out his vision of Europe,"People listening to the speech held up portraits of Mr Trump (centre right) and Polish President Andrzej Duda US President Donald Trump has argued that the future of Western civilisation is at stake in a keynote speech in the Polish capital Warsaw. Holding up Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, he warned against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"". Criticising Russia, Mr Trump urged Moscow to ""join the community of responsible nations"". Mr Trump is in Poland ahead of a G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.

Instead, he said, Russia should ""join the community of responsible nations in our fight against common enemies and in defence of civilisation itself"". The US leader is to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in Hamburg. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian presidency did not accept that Russia had been destabilising the region. ""This is exactly why we are waiting for the first meeting of the two presidents,"" he added. Giving a news conference hours before the speech, Mr Trump: called on countries to demonstrate to North Korea that there were consequences for its ""very bad behaviour"" and said ""something will have to be done about it"" said America's ""strong alliance with Poland and Nato"" remained ""critical to deterring conflict"" said in reference to Syria that ""any nation which values human life can never tolerate the use of chemical weapons"" said CNN had taken ""too seriously"" a mock video he tweeted in whichhe wrestles a person with the broadcaster's logo for a head Mr Trump also said talks he had attended in Warsaw of 12 nations with interests in the Baltic, the Adriatic and the Black Sea - the ""Three Seas"" summit - had been ""incredibly successful"". The Polish government is trying to become less energy-dependent on Russia, and last month the first ever US liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipment arrived. Commending American LNG, Mr Trump told the news conference: ""You can never be held hostage to a single supplier."" The first US shipment of liquefied natural gas arrived in Poland in June A global glut in supply, however, has depressed prices and made it difficult for LNG exporters to turn a profit, Adam Sieminski, an energy analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Warsaw and three Baltic states have spoken against the construction of an offshore Russian gas pipeline to Germany, known as Nord Stream 2. US leaders are almost always guaranteed a warm welcome in Poland, which will contrast with the protests being planned for the G20 summit in Hamburg.

Melania Trump (L) was entertained by Polish First Lady Agata Kornauser-Duda Sandwiched between Germany and Russia, Poland suffered centuries of partition and occupation and emerged from the Cold War a staunch ally of America, ready to commit troops to the US-led coalitions in Iraq and Afghanistan. By choosing to speak at the monument to the Warsaw Uprising, which was a desperate action ultimately crushed by the Nazis, Mr Trump appealed to fierce national pride. Poland's current government has been at odds with some other EU states over itsrefusal to accept refugeesunder a 2015 solidarity plan.

Superstars plan next career with Harvard course,"Katie Holmes is among the famous names signing up as students for the Harvard course The football superstar, the actress and the rapper walk into a classroom. This is not the set-up for a joke, but a four-day executive education course held at Harvard Business School in the United States last month. Among the students taking the Business of Sport, Media and Entertainment course were Barcelona defender Gerard Pique, actress Katie Holmes and Irish rugby union player Jamie Heaslip. Rapper LL Cool J is another former graduate. ""Many of the participants want to know how to monetise their brand and build a business around it, to launch a second career after their current one is over, or to enter new careers,"" says course leader Professor Anita Elberse. Prof Elberse's job might sound like a teacher's worst nightmare. Celebrities are not used to being told what to do - or that they have got something wrong. But she insists none of them receives special treatment. Get me a raise: Prof Elberse with actress Katie Holmes and sports stars CJ McCollum, Gerard Pique, Rashean Mathis and Jamie Heaslip ""They know that if they say something that makes no sense, then I or someone else in the class will tell them they are wrong,"" she says. ""This might actually be quite refreshing for them and one of the reasons they enjoy the course so much."" During the course, they eat meals together and sleep in the Harvard dormitories. When a celebrity applies to the course, Prof Elberse often phones them up to make sure they know what to expect. ""So far all of them have been very engaged,"" she says. ""I have not been disappointed."" The reason so many big names from sports and entertainment apply for the course is to capitalise on the growing importance of individual superstar brands in these fields. The trend was identified by Prof Elberse in her book, Blockbusters. She argues that building a business around ""blockbuster products"" - a small number of high impact, big investment films, TV shows, books or star names - is ""the surest path to long-term success"". Barcelona and Real Madrid football clubs are claimed as examples - gaining sporting and commercial success by spending a large proportion of their budgets on a few stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar Jr. The rise of the superstar has been accelerated by social media, which allows individuals to connect directly with fans, rather than work through publishers or agents. Rapper LL Cool J has been a fan of the course at Harvard Irish rugby union player Jamie Heaslip might have been setting off for New Zealand with the Lions tour last month, but a serious injury in March meant he had time to attend this year's course. He hopes to apply what he learned to his own sport. ""I was fascinated by the blockbuster theory and how it can be implemented in rugby, which has only been professional for 20 years, so is a relatively young sport in that sense,"" he says. ""We looked at how other sports have sold themselves as entertainment products, and how everyone involved in a sport is a stakeholder who can have a role in growing the game."" ""I had some interesting discussions with [basketball player] C.J. McCollum about the differences between the business side of rugby and the NBA."" He says he would be interested in working to grow rugby in new markets after he retires from playing. Prof Elberse's course could have an impact on the future of sport and entertainment, if her students go on to become leaders in these industries. Gerard Pique has been suggested as a future president of Barcelona. Will he apply the blockbuster theory to running the Spanish club? ""I don't know, but I told him if he's president then I insist on being vice-president,"" she says. Global education How can you train to be a top tennis umpire? Historic violin lent by Oxford University to Syrian refugee UN warns 'no progress' in lack of school places Rubbish collector builds library from discarded books Education aid 'stagnates' despite pledges Ideas for theGlobal education series? Get in touch. The course is taught using Harvard Business School's case study method. Students look at 10 recent examples of success and failure in the sports, entertainment and music industries. These include Beyonce's gamble to release an album in 2013 without any prior marketing and promotion, and the decision by a production company to sell the TV series House of Cards to Netflix rather than a traditional TV network in 2011. Students are divided into small groups to discuss the case studies, then the groups present their findings to the rest of the class. ""I ask questions and hope they come up with the answers, and I provide models for how they can think about or frame the discussion,"" says Prof Elberse, who also teaches the MBA at Harvard Business School. Jamie Heaslip has an undergraduate degree in medical engineering and a master's in business. He says the case study method was ""very different to what I've experienced in my own education"" but ""very insightful"". Prof Elberse has developed a theory of high impact ""blockbuster"" successes This was partly because of the backgrounds of his fellow students - only 10 were from the ""talent"" side of sport and entertainment and the rest were from the management and business side. ""There were high-up executives running TV companies and studios in the room so it was really interesting to get their perspective,"" he says. The course costs $10,000 (Â£7,700) per head and no prior educational qualifications are required. With around 60 students attending each year, cynics could say that it is an easy source of income for Harvard. Prof Dan Sarofian-Butin, dean of the school of education and social policy at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, says the course benefits from Harvard's prestige. ""This type of course allows students to say they went to Harvard, were taught by a famous professor, and interacted with other cool students,"" he says. He says most students on executive education courses are already ""insiders"" who may know more about their industries than a professor. But he says they can still benefit from the wider view provided by teachers. ""This is what a good teacher can bring to the table - the ability to point things out that are obvious, but only once you are able to see the bigger picture,"" he says.

How virtual reality may change your life,"The band Miro Shot explored virtual reality with their audience in Amsterdam in May Virtual reality (VR) is being touted as a big growth area for film-makers, engaging audiences in ways traditional film can't. But it is also being explored everywhere from rock music to psychiatric treatments.  Is it all just a passing fad - or could VR really change the way we see the world about us? In film-making it's hard to avoid talk of VR as the next big thing. A report this April claimed it could add $7bn (Â£5.4bn) to film-industry revenues this year and by 2021, that figure might have risen 10-fold. However, performer-composer Roman Rappak and his new band Miro Shot are at the forefront of bringing VR to rock music. In May, Rappak premiered a VR show at the Centre for Contemporary Art in Amsterdam, funded by a Dutch grant. Around 10 people at a time took their seats as Rappak and the other musicians stood ready to perform on stage.  Before a note of his composition Lifeforms was played, audience members were helped into VR headsets through which they experienced a performance of around eight minutes. The band became graphic versions of themselves before the audience was suddenly flying over an empty landscape and then a giant blue head of a woman emerged. The show is designed to appeal to every sense: Electric fans wafted specially-concocted fragrances over the audience. Some people were quicker than others to work out that the event is 360 degrees: It's a good idea to look up or down and turn to see what's behind you. Modigliani exhibition to feature virtual reality Paris Star Trek virtual reality game boldly goes with IBM Watson UK virtual reality firm Improbable raises $500 Is 2017 the year of virtual reality film-making? Rappak says VR intensifies the usual concert experience. ""It's everything that's exciting about a concert but more intense. There are the colours, the sense of place, the aromas, the beats. If you're at a gig and love it that will transform you. With virtual reality it's magnified."" Rappak is impressively ahead of the game in his ambitions for VR and music - but some non-performance uses are surprisingly well-established. Prof Daniel Freeman of the University of Oxford says using VR to treat anxiety disorders goes back to the early 1990s. ""VR has the potential to revolutionise how we treat certain mental health problems and phobias,"" he says. ""Many of the problems are linked to our environment in some way, such as a fear of enclosed spaces. With virtual reality we can now put people in the physical situation which disturbs them. Then we coach them in the best way to overcome these anxieties."" This video can not be played Visiting Europe's largest permanent virtual reality facility Prof Freeman says VR could potentially help people deal with conditions like acrophobia (fear of heights) and even depression. ""Therapists have been using VR to treat patients with claustrophobia,"" he explains. ""We can use a headset gradually to populate a lift, allowing the patient to control their tension level.   What we're working on in Oxford is a programme which doesn't even require a therapist to be there. VR could bring the benefits of therapy to more people. ""With depression, therapy would for now probably complement evidence-based treatment with a skilled therapist.  But VR can certainly help people re-engage with the world and be stimulated by it."" Virtual reality people in a lift The VR recreations were of everyday situations. A London Tube train and a lift could each be made more or less crowded in a carefully controlled experiment. ""There's still research to be done but for certain patients the potential benefits are great."" If clinical psychologists were quick off the mark, journalism is coming late to the VR party. Zillah Watson of the BBC has just written a report for the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism calledVR for News: The New Reality?,external ""The Reuters Institute was keen to cut through some of the hype about VR and ask some difficult questions: How can VR ever be monetised for news and how compelling is it currently for audiences?"" she says. ""What really got newsrooms excited was when, in November 2015, the New York Times decided it was getting into VR and launched an app. ""The newspaper wanted to discover new and exciting ways to tell stories. VR compels you to think in a completely different way about journalism which has to be a good thing - but the practicalities are complicated."" Watson says there are problems even with what is meant by VR. ""Full VR - at least at this stage - involves putting on a headset which is tracked and, as you look around, the scene you see is rendered in real time and you feel you are there. ""For now, what is branded VR in news is in fact largely 360 video which people watch on their computer screen or on a phone. People watching news basically don't want to put on a headset. It's a problem - though technology will develop."" Notes on Blindness was released in 2016 Watson thinks the best VR material available is often at the features end of the news spectrum. ""A fantastic piece to seek out isNotes on Blindness, which isn't hard news at all. It illustrated the audio diaries of the academic John Hull who, in the 1980s, had to come to terms with blindness. ""Virtual reality is a challenge for TV news where traditionally it's assumed a story is mediated through the reporter.  But if an editor wants to hear from refugees somewhere, then for VR it could work just as well - or better - if the refugees tell their own stories."" Watson says journalistic VR is in a fusion period. ""Virtual reality is taking baby steps and no one yet is sure what the public demand is."" Toby Coffey, head of digital development at London's National Theatre, is convinced that VR will become part of what its audience expects. ""Twenty-two years ago I wrote a dissertation about virtual reality in the treatment of repeat offenders - so it's all older than people think,"" he says. ""But about four years ago it was clear modern VR was becoming important and when Rufus Norris arrived to run the National he wanted to explore it as a storytelling mechanism."" The theatre had rave reviews this year when it co-presented the VR piece Draw Me Close at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. Written by Jordan Tannahill, it's an extraordinary one-on-one piece where the viewer - wearing a headset - moves through a physical set of a child's bedroom and interacts with what may be a memory of Tannahill's own mother. The mother is played by an actress in a motion-capture suit (which means purists would say the piece isn't VR but augmented reality). Draw Me Close involves an actress in a motion capture suit who interacts with you live Coffey says he still doesn't know what the National will offer in terms of VR. ""Like everyone, we're feeling our way and we're still not at the mass adoption stage. ""I'm looking forward to when someone will buy a National Theatre ticket and VR will be a major part of the experience. But I can't say if it will physically be in one of the National Theatre auditoriums. ""There's one-on-one storytelling, such as Draw Me Close, but also there's social VR. That can be where a group of people wear individual headsets and see the same thing but are cut off from everyone else. ""Or there's what I call social social VR, where people are aware of one another even with the headset on and that's really what I'm looking at."" Almost everyone in VR talks of how quickly technology is changing and how ambitions are changing too. Rappak says a huge part of the attraction of VR is that for now, nothing is certain. ""In 2017, VR is about a headset which you strap to your skull. But a couple of years from now it could be glasses or some new kind of contact lens. It's important not to get obsessed with the technology because the one certainty is it will change within months. ""There's lots being written about virtual reality and I'm sure some predictions will prove completely wrong. But VR is almost totally unexplored which is why it's an amazing opportunity.""

One in three nursing homes 'fail safety',"Vulnerable people are playing ""Russian roulette"" when they need care in England, campaigners warn, as a quarter of services are failing on safety. The Care Quality Commission said drug errors, lack of staff and falls were major problems, after inspecting 24,000 services. Nursing homes had the worst problems, with a third falling short on safety. The CQC said the failings across services for the elderly and disabled were ""completely unacceptable"". The findings mark the completion of the first round of inspections under the ""tougher"" system launched in 2014 amid concerns problems were going undetected. One million vulnerable people use care services - either getting their fees paid by councils or funding it themselves. More than 200,000 of them live in nursing homes, which had the most serious problems. Some 37% of homes failed on safety, with inspectors noting they had a particular problems recruiting and retaining nurses. Just below a quarter of care homes and home helps were rated not safe enough, while in community support, including sheltered housing, 17% fell short. The CQC highlighted poor care inspectors had found, including: the death of a 62-year-old man who had broken his neck in a fall from a shower chair at a West Yorkshire care home. The company in charge of the site, St Anne's Community Services, was prosecuted and fined Â£190,000 a number of cases where residents had been put back to bed in the morning because there had not been enough staff to provide them with support a 79-year-old woman left with serious burns after falling against an uncovered radiator at Manor Residential Home in London cases where incontinence pads had not been changed regularly and were even reused in some instances a resident of a home who had died after errors with his anti-blood clotting drugs a home that had managed its rotas so badly that care staff had had to help out in the kitchen at lunchtime when residents had needed help a home care service in Lincolnshire, Aamina, that had missed calls or carried out rushed visits, with examples of 30-minute calls being done in five Overall, inspectors have successfully prosecuted five care providers and another 1,000 have had enforcement action taken against them, from being closed down to handed warning notices. All the services deemed to be failing would continue to be monitored and re-inspected, the CQC said. But it pointed out that, despite the concerns, most had achieved good or outstanding ratings on safety. Age UK advises families to check: the latest CQC report on the home whether the staff are friendly and welcoming if senior staff are on duty at all times and whether they know residents and families personally whether residents can choose their daily routines the ratio of staff to residents and the turnover of staff the dementia support available To find out more, view the checklisthere,external. Chief inspector Andrea Sutcliffe said funding remained an issue for the sector and a ""long-term solution"" needed to be found but lack of money was ""no excuse"".

Who gets social care and who pays for it? 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care How can social care be funded? Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the findings were ""alarming"" and vulnerable people were ""effectively playing Russian roulette when they need care"". She added: ""Taken as a whole, this report is a graphic demonstration of why older people desperately need the government to follow through on its commitment to consult on proposals for strengthening social care later this year."" Margaret Willcox, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said councils and providers would be ""re-doubling our mutual efforts to ensure older and disabled people and their families get the reliable, personal care they need and deserve"".

"'Three years younger, Â£15,000 more debt'","Students are facing debtsrising to more than Â£50,000when they leave university. The poorest will owe around Â£57,000 when they graduate, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Interest rates on student loans will be 6.1% from September 2017, and tuition fees are also rising to Â£9,250. It means that, on average, students will graduate having already built up Â£5,800 in interest. Ben Jones, 22, finished his course this summer with more than Â£40,000 of debt. His sister Florence, 25, graduated in 2015 with around Â£15,000 less to pay back. ""I'm just annoyed about it,"" says Ben, who studies TV and radio production at the University of Salford. ""It's such a small age difference but it's such a huge difference in money."" Ben says that he and his sister don't talk about the difference too much, because it annoys him. ""She'll brag about it - I would if I was her too - and I'm just annoyed about it."" But Florence says that she feels bad that her younger brother has to pay more. She says she would have ""thought twice"" about going to university if she had to pay Â£9,000 a year in fees. Although she trained to be a teacher, Florence now works in the charity sector. For her, the lower debt means that she feels less under pressure to do a job where she has to earn a lot of money. She pays off Â£22 a month of her total debt, which began at just over Â£25,000 - an amount she ""doesn't notice at all"" when it comes out of her payslip. ""I work in the charity sector which is lower-paid, so I was lucky to not need to pay back as much."" She doesn't think she'd be able to do the job she does now if she was in the same amount of debt as her brother. Florence is worried that Ben's higher debt will weigh heavily on his shoulders once he graduates. ""I think he'll be a lot more concerned about [jobs] that are higher paid rather than ones that he might be interested in doing,"" she tells Newsbeat. And it seems that she's right - Ben says: ""if I was on three times less of a student debt, it would make it a lot easier to start out in life."" Most people never pay off their student loans in full, according to the IFS. But for Ben, the fact that the debt is ""such a huge amount of money"" means that ""it's just at the back of your mind all the time that you're going to be slowly paying it off"". ""I feel like the government doesn't really realise how much difference it is. ""It's not a small margin - it's not like they went up by a grand or so - it's three times the amount. ""It's OK for people to pay for university, but it shouldn't be such a huge cost."" Florence thinks that as well as changing peoples' career decisions, such a heavy debt burden means that going to university has become more of a transaction than anything else. According to her, people feel under pressure to pick a course which will earn them more money, rather than something purely out of interest. ""I didn't really have the issue of the higher loans, so I could just decide to go to uni whenever I wanted,"" she says. ""Whereas with my brother... he debated it a lot more than I did."" Ben shows this change in attitude when he says: ""You go to university to try to increase your chance of getting the job that you want. ""It felt like an investment - I think that's how most people see university.""

Greening calls for 'army of skilled young',"Jeremy Corbyn says businesses should pay higher taxes to invest in skills Jeremy Corbyn has called for a major investment in skills to tackle a ""lost decade"" in which there had been an ""explosion"" of low-paid, insecure jobs. But Education Secretary Justine Greening, also addressing the British Chambers of Commerce, says she wants firms to back a ""skills revolution"" and her plans for new technical qualifications. With warnings of a post-Brexit skills gap, the Labour and Conservative representatives gave business leaders their plans to improve skills. Labour leader Mr Corbyn told a British Chambers of Commerce conference in London that investing in education was the path away from ""stagnant living standards"", even if it meant raising taxes. Justine Greening says that England needs a ""skills revolution"" But Ms Greening called on business leaders to support the so-called ""T-levels"", which are intended to raise the quality and status of vocational qualifications. The education secretary said that in England from next April, Â£50m will be available to fund work placements and Â£15m to help improve further education. The investment is part of the Â£500m for technical educationannounced by Chancellor Philip Hammond in the Budget in March. Ms Greening told business leaders that she wanted an ""army of skilled young people"". But Mr Corbyn said the economy needed to be revived by a much bigger investment in skills - and that would mean businesses paying higher corporation tax. The Labour leader said that improving the UK's poor record on productivity meant investing in education and training. Otherwise he warned of an economy built on ""low-paid insecure jobs"". Mr Corbyn said that too often only ""lip service"" was paid to valuing vocational training. He rejected the idea of lower taxes, saying that there were ""no short cuts"" for a strong education system, and the alternative was becoming a ""low tax haven on the shores of Europe"". Mr Corbyn repeated his commitment to scrapping university tuition fees - and said that high levels of debt could deter young people from staying in education. He said that ""not everyone can access the bank of mum and dad to go to university"". Mr Corbyn called for better funding for schools - saying that it was ""utterly unacceptable where schools were having to beg parents for donations to cover the basics"". ""We lose out as a society if we don't have a highly qualified workforce,"" he told the business and education conference.
