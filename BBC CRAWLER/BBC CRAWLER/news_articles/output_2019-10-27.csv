Three bailed over Essex lorry deaths,"The families of Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong are concerned they may be among the victims Three people arrested in connection with the deaths of 39 people found dead inside a lorry in Essex have been released on bail. The suspects, two men and a woman, had been held on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people after the discovery in Grays last Wednesday. Lorry driver Maurice Robinson, 25, is due to appear in court on Monday. Meanwhile, families in Vietnam face an anxious wait to find out if their loved ones were among the dead. Those bailed were a 46-year-old man from Northern Ireland, who was arrested at Stansted Airport on Friday, and Joanna and Thomas Maher, both 38, from Warrington, Cheshire. Mr Robinson, of Laurel Drive, Craigavon, Northern Ireland, has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter as well as people trafficking, immigration and money laundering offences. He is due before Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday. Maurice Robinson has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter In total, five people have been arrested in connection with the investigation into the deaths. A man in his 20s, arrested by Irish police in Dublin on Saturday was said to be ""of interest"" to the Grays investigation. His arrest at Dublin Port is unconnected to the lorry death investigation but Essex Police said they were liaising with Irish police as the man is currently being held outside the jurisdiction of English and Welsh law. Why are Vietnamese people trying to reach the UK? Essex lorry deaths: What we know In Vietnam, relatives of Bui Thi Nhung, 19, said they feared she may be among the dead. The teenager is thought to be the youngest of those who died. Bui Thi Nhung is from Nghe An province Since the bodies were discovered on Wednesday, several families in Vietnam have expressed concerns over missing relatives. Among them is Le Van Ha, 30, who left his young son and pregnant wife behind to journey to the UK. Since he left, his wife has given birth to their second child. His father Le Minh Tuan says the family have ""nothing left"" after mortgaging their land to fund the Â£20,000  journey to the UK. Others feared to be among the 39 victims are Pham Thi Tra My, 26, who last messaged her family late on Tuesday, and two men - Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, and Nguyen Dinh Tu. A friend of Tran Thi Tho, 21, fears she may also be among the victims. The friend, who lives in Glasgow, did not want to be identified but told the BBC he had been due to meet up with her when she arrived in the UK. Police in Vietnam are taking DNA samples from family members of those reported missing in a bid to identify the victims, Reuters has reported. In Ha Tinh in Vietnam, police have opened a special criminal case to investigate claims they have received in relation to the lorry deaths, the BBC has learnt. Included in the investigation are allegations of human trafficking in Ha Tinh province. This video can not be played Nguyen Dinh Sat fears his son was among the 39 found dead inside a refrigerated lorry A representative of VietHome - a website for Vietnamese people in the UK - said it had passed on the pictures of almost 20 people who have been reported missing to detectives. Police said they were investigating a ""wider conspiracy"" after reports the lorry may have been part of a convoy of three carrying about 100 people. Catholic worshippers said prayers for the 39 people at a Mass in Nghe An province, Vietnam The victims - who police initially believed to be Chinese nationals - were inside a lorry trailer which came to the UK via the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. Officers said post-mortem examinations were being carried out. The victims had been carrying ""very few"" identity documents, leaving officers to rely on fingerprints, DNA and distinguishing features such as tattoos or scars, Essex Police said. The bodies were discovered in the early hours of Wednesday Meanwhile, concerns have been raised over the UK's ability to work with European officials to combat people trafficking after Brexit. Labour's Yvette Cooper and exiled Conservative Dominic Grieve voiced the fears over co-operation with Europol as plans for the transition period after Brexit and beyond have yet to be agreed. However, the Home Office said the UK would continue to work with EU law enforcement agencies with or without a Brexit deal. Do you have any information to share about the incident?

Police investigate 'Kill Gina Miller' crowdfunding,"Businesswoman Gina Miller has had to employ round-the-clock security after court victories on Brexit Police are investigating a crowdfunding page which sought to raise Â£10,000 to have campaigner Gina Miller killed. The GoFundMe page targeting Ms Miller, who twice won Supreme Court cases challenging the government on Brexit, was first posted in April. Police said the fundraising campaign was reported to them on Wednesday. GoFundMe took down the page, which had not raised any money, and apologised for any distress to Ms Miller, who called the crowdfunding ""horrifying"".

Key word 'adequate' removed from Brexit plan,"Labour claims workers' rights will be eroded under Boris Johnson's Brexit deal renegotiation An internal UK government memo on the consequences of Boris Johnson's Brexit deal renegotiation singles out the removal of the word ""adequate"" from the UK-EU Political Declaration to describe mechanisms for enforcing common social, environmental, and labour standards after Brexit. The word ""adequate"" appears to have been replaced by the word ""appropriate"". Extracts of a note written for the government's cross-Whitehall Economic Partnership Steering Group, and seen by the BBC, say the ""parties will include ""appropriate"" (rather than ""adequate"") mechanisms for dispute settlement"" of key ""level playing field commitments"" in a future trade deal with the European Union. The consequence of that change, the note says, is that it means that it is now possible to argue it is ""inappropriate for the future UK-EU relationship"" that disputes about these commitments on employment, environment, tax, state aid and other standards should be subject to binding arbitration. The memo,first leaked to the Financial Times,externaland marked ""Official Sensitive"", contains a series of claimed negotiation wins from the Brexit deal renegotiation, weakening the scope and strength of Level Playing Field Commitments (LPF), a crucial element in a future UK-EU trade arrangement. 'Fears confirmed' over rights at work, says Labour What does the Brexit deal say about workers' rights? ""The previous Protocol applied wide-ranging LPF measures on a UK-wide bases as a response to UK access to the EU market through the single customs territory. ""UK negotiators successfully resisted the inclusion of all UK-wide LPF rules"" says the memo, with the last four words put in bold for emphasis. ""The only level playing field provisions in the revised Protocol are those necessary to support the operation of the Single Electricity Market and state aid measures that affect trade between NI and the EU,"" it says. The title of the memo is ""Update to EPSG (Economic Partnership Steering Group) on Level Playing Field Negotiations"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is the first acknowledgement that changing the Level Playing Field commitments agreed by Theresa May was a specific aim of the PM's renegotiation. In public, the PM focused on changing what he referred to as ""the anti-democratic backstop"", which had been rejected by the government's parliamentary allies, the Democratic Unionists. In the end, the PM's new solution, creating a new trade and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, further alienated the DUP. Backbench eurosceptic Conservative MPs have, however, been won over to the deal. Theresa May's original 2018 deal included a range of specific enforceable common standards for the UK and the EU within the legally binding Withdrawal Treaty. Some of these standards were related to EU law, others referred to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), International Labour Organisation and the Council of Europe. Business minister Kwesi Kwarteng said the leaked reports are ""completely mad"" These were all removed, along with the backstop, and the only reference remaining in the overall deal was in the non-binding Political Declaration. The memo shows that within Whitehall, weakening these provisions was a key part of the renegotiation. Regarded as an internal success, their removal paves the way for a ""much more open starting point for future relationship negotiations"" that allow for ""a range of landing zones"" for a future deal. ""The Political Declaration text provides us with a framework for negotiating FTA-style commitments on Level Playing Field,"" the memo concludes under the headline ""Next Steps"". That is a reference to the fact that, unlike the original Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May, dispute settlement mechanisms have not applied to existing standard EU Free Trade Agreements. Sam Lowe, trade fellow at the Centre for European Reform, said: ""The Level Playing Field commitments in the EU's Free Trade Agreements with Canada and Japan are unenforceable, because they are specifically excluded from the dispute settlement mechanisms. The government appears to be aiming for the same treatment."" Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly rejected suggestions there are attempts to relax workplace rights or environmental protections. ""In many areas we have already gone further than the European Union,"" he said. ""We are making hard improvements on worker rights through an increase in the National Living Wage."" The government was also strengthening rules on maritime protection and animal welfare, he added. On Saturday, ministers said stories about the leaked memo were ""not correct"" and ""way exaggerated"". The government also said: ""The UK government has no intention of lowering the standards of workers' rights or environmental protection after we leave the EU. ""UK level playing field commitments will be negotiated in the context of the future UK-EU free trade agreement, where we will achieve a balance of rights and obligations which reflect the scope and depth of the future relationship.""

Masterpiece found in French kitchen fetches â¬24m,"The painting had been hung above a hotplate in a kitchen in the French town of Compiegne A long-lost painting by a celebrated Italian artist that was found hanging in the kitchen of an elderly French woman has sold for â¬24m (Â£20m; $26.6m) at auction, setting a new record. Christ Mocked, by the pre-Renaissance artist Cimabue, was discovered last month in northern France. The painting was expected to fetch up to â¬6m at auction. But the winning bid far exceeded expectations, with the painting fetching four times the estimate. Long-lost artwork found in elderly woman's kitchen Painting stolen by Nazis found in museum by FBI Acteon Auction House said the sum, paid by an anonymous buyer from northern France, was a new world record for a medieval painting sold at auction. ""When a unique work of a painter as rare as Cimabue comes to market, you have to be ready for surprises,"" auctioneer Dominique Le Coent told Reuters news agency. For years, the painting hung above a hotplate in a kitchen in the city of CompiÃ¨gne. It was spotted by an auctioneer, who advised its owner to have it evaluated by experts. The owner believed it to be an old religious icon with little value. Tests were carried out on the artwork using infrared light to determine the similarities with works by the Italian painter Cimabue, also known as Cenni di Pepo. Born in the city of Florence, he was active in the late 13th and early 14th Centuries - a transitional figure between the stylised art of the medieval period and the more naturalistic works of the Renaissance.

It is believed to be part of a polyptych - a larger work of painted scenes divided into several panels - dating from 1280, depicting Christ's passion and crucifixion. Two other scenes from the same Cimabue series can be seen at London's National Gallery, and the Frick Collection in New York. Cimabue's work was largely influenced by Byzantine art, produced on poplar wood panels with backgrounds of gold paint.

Where IS is still active,"The Philippines has seen an uptick in IS attacks in recent years After months of fighting, the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) has finally lost Baghuz, a village in eastern Syria that came to represent the final chapter in its self-styled caliphate. While this is a major blow, the loss of the small enclave near the Iraqi border does not spell the end of IS as a militant group capable of mounting deadly attacks worldwide. IS and its affiliates continue to be active in various countries, claiming attacks on a daily basis through the group's online propaganda outlets. Data collected by BBC Monitoring shows that despite having lost most of its territory in Syria and Iraq at the end of 2017, IS said it was behind 3,670 attacks worldwide last year - an average of 11 attacks per day - and 502 attacks in the first two months of 2019, while Baghuz was under siege. There was a peak in IS attack claims in September 2018. This was likely to have been linked to the start that month of an operation by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance to take the IS stronghold of Hajin, north of Baghuz. The jihadist group commonly steps up its attacks in response to offensives against it, either in the area under siege or elsewhere to divert attention or resources away from there. Although Iraq and Syria continue to account for the lion's share of IS attack claims, Afghanistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria and Egypt's Sinai peninsula also feature regularly. In a recent message, the IS leadership mocked US President Donald Trump's claim in December to have defeated the group, and insisted that it was far from over. Nevertheless, IS's caliphate model has been over since late 2017, when it lost its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. After that, the group struggled to project the image of a functioning and flourishing state - which had formed the basis of its claim to have revived the caliphates of early Islam. The rise and fall of the Islamic State group The enduring appeal of violent jihad The data is based exclusively on what the group itself has claimed through its official ""Nashir News Agency"" media outlets on the messaging app Telegram. The dates reflect when IS said the attacks took place, rather than when the claim was published. The data includes every claim of attack, no matter how small or inconsequential. Most attacks that IS claimed solely through its weekly newspaper al-Naba without issuing a separate statement were not reflected in the data. It is worth noting that IS, like any jihadist group, has a tendency to exaggerate the scale of its attacks and their impact. IS has officially declared that it has a presence in the following countries and regions: Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, ""Khorasan"" (the Afghanistan-Pakistan region), ""the Caucasus"", ""East Asia"" (mostly active in the Philippines), Somalia, and ""West Africa"" (mostly active in Nigeria). Some of these branches, such as Algeria and Saudi Arabia, have barely claimed any activity, and others like ""the Caucasus"" rarely claim attacks. The group recently signalled through its propaganda an intention to step up its activity in Tunisia, a country where it has so far failed to make inroads following the 2015 attacks on a museum and beach resort that it claimed. IS also announced for the first time a presence in Burkina Faso. The announcements about Tunisia and Burkina Faso suggest that at least in terms of propaganda, IS is keen to indicate that its trademark slogan ""Remaining and Expanding"" still applies. Unsurprisingly, IS's biggest battleground continues to be in Iraq and Syria, where it clearly has its best resources. Out of a total of 3,670 attacks IS claimed worldwide in 2018, 1,767 were in Iraq (48%) and 1,124 were in Syria (31%). Nigeria's army has increasingly come under attack by a branch of IS in recent months But last year also saw a notable increase in claimed activity by other IS branches. It was as if the group wanted to compensate for its losses in Iraq and Syria and to remind people that it also operated outside the Middle East. In 2018, IS claimed 316 attacks in Afghanistan, 181 in Egypt's Sinai peninsula, 73 in Somalia, 44 in Nigeria, 41 in Yemen and 27 in the Philippines. The number of attack claims by IS West Africa Province in Nigeria has notably risen in recent months. The army has been the primary target, possibly because the group is attempting to seize weaponry and in turn boost its capability. Islamic State and the kidnap of Nigerian schoolgirls Made-up to look beautiful. Sent out to die IS has claimed 44 attacks in Nigeria in the first three months of 2019, matching the total number of attacks it claimed in a whole year in 2018. In a propaganda video released in January, IS West Africa Province called on Muslims to migrate to the region and join its branch, signalling that it was ready to receive foreign recruits. On 22 March, IS West Africa Province announced for the first time that it had a presence in Burkina Faso - a country where its rival al-Qaeda has already carried out several attacks. There has also been an uptick in the number of attack claims in the Philippines. IS operates in the country through local affiliates, most of which have been fighting to establish an independent Islamic state in the south for decades. But their attacks, mostly against the army, are still sporadic. And despite repeated calls to its supporters, IS did not claim any major attacks in the West during 2018. The previous year, it claimed four attacks in the UK, including the Manchester Arena bombing; the Barcelona attacks in Spain; and the Las Vegas shootings in the US. However, some of those claims appeared to have been opportunistic, as the group failed to provide evidence. In 2018, IS claimed seven, mostly low-profile attacks in the West that appeared to have been inspired by the group. They comprised four knife or gun attacks in France, and one attack each in Belgium, Canada and Australia.

IS leader killed in US operation in Syria,"Baghdadi announced the creation of a ""caliphate"" from Mosul in 2014 The fugitive leader of the Islamic State (IS) group killed himself during a US military operation in north-west Syria, President Donald Trump has said. Speaking from the White House, Mr Trump said Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest after fleeing into a tunnel, chased by US military dogs. Baghdadi came to prominence in 2014, when he announced the creation of a ""caliphate"" in areas of Iraq and Syria. IS carried out multiple atrocities that resulted in thousands of deaths. The jihadist group imposed a brutal rule in the areas under its control and was behind many attacks around the world. Although the US declared the ""caliphate"" defeated earlier this year, IS militants remain active in the region and elsewhere. Baghdadi's death is a major victory for Mr Trump as he faces heavy criticism for his decision to pull US troops out of northern Syria and fights an impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats. Who was Baghdadi? What we know about US raid The meaning of Baghdadi's death for IS in Syria Backlash for US newspaper over Baghdadi headline In an unusual Sunday morning statement, Mr Trump described the night-time operation in extraordinary detail, saying Baghdadi ran into a dead-end tunnel, ""whimpering and crying and screaming"", while being chased by military dogs. Baghdadi killed himself and three of his children by igniting his suicide vest, Mr Trump said, causing the tunnel to collapse. No US personnel were killed but one of the dogs was seriously injured in the explosion. This video can not be played Mr Trump called Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi a 'brutal killer' The blast mutilated Baghdadi's body but, according to the president, an on-site DNA test confirmed his identity. The special forces spent two hours in the area and gathered ""highly sensitive material"". ""The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,"" Mr Trump said. Also on Sunday, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said IS spokesman Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, described as Baghdadi's right-hand man, had been killed in a separate joint operation with the US military near the northern Syrian town of Jarablus. The location - the village of Barisha in Idlib province near the Turkish border - was far from where Baghdadi had been thought to be hiding along the Syria-Iraq border. Many parts of Idlib are under the control of jihadists opposed to IS but rival groups are suspected of sheltering IS members. Baghdadi had been under surveillance for ""a couple of weeks"" and ""two or three"" raids had been cancelled because of his movements, Mr Trump said, describing the IS leader's move to Idlib as part of a plan to rebuild the group. This video can not be played Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US commandos An undisclosed number of forces targeted the compound using eight helicopters, which were met with gunfire, Mr Trump said. The commandos managed to land safely and entered the building by blowing holes in the wall, avoiding the main door which was believed to be booby-trapped. ""He was a sick and depraved man,"" Mr Trump said. ""He died like a dog, he died like a coward."" US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said Baghdadi's remains should be given the same treatment applied to those of former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, whose body was buried at sea after he was killed in a raid in 2011. 'Caliphate' defeated but IS remains a threat Where IS is still active around the world IS: The long and short story A ""large number"" of Baghdadi's followers also died while others were captured, the president said. The dead included two of Baghdadi's wives who were both found wearing explosive vests that were not detonated. Eleven children were removed, uninjured, from the compound. The SDF - one of the main US allies in northern Syria until Mr Trump withdrew US troops from the area this month - said they had shared details about the location of high-level IS members, including Baghdadi. Iraqi officials also said they had provided ""accurate information"". Mr Trump praised them all, as well as Russia - which opened up the airspace it controls for the operation - Turkey and Syria for giving ""certain support"" to the operation. He said Russia had not been told about the nature of the US mission. After the president's address, the White House released pictures said to be of Mr Trump watching the operation from the Situation Room surrounded by Vice-President Mike Pence and top security officials.

While IS lost its territory in Syria and Iraq after a years-long deadly campaign, experts say the group remains a threat, with affiliates active in various countries. The strategic significance of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death is clear. Removing a skilled and brutal leader from the battlefield will undoubtedly make allied efforts to eradicate IS forces easier. The lasting political benefits for Donald Trump remain to be seen. Baghdadi was far from a household name in the US, although IS has been a well-known adversary ever since its brutal executions and advance grabbed headlines in 2014. His death will give Mr Trump a signature moment to cite when making the case that his leadership has led to the methodical defeat of IS forces. It also will help deflect from weeks of sharp bipartisan criticism following the president's decision to remove US forces from northern Syria and tacitly permit a Turkish invasion to drive out US-allied Kurds. While it is true most Americans only pay attention to foreign policy during times of war, most of Mr Trump's current political headaches have come from actions directed abroad - whether it's the Syrian move or the rapidly unfolding impeachment inquiry into his Ukraine conduct. Now the president has a clear foreign policy success to tout. It will not solve all his political problems, but it is a start. Leaders around the world reacted to the news of Baghdadi's death, with many stressing that the fight against the group continues. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Baghdadi's death was ""an important moment in our fight against terror but the battle against the evil of [IS] is not over yet"". French President Emmanuel Macron described the development as a ""hard blow"" against IS, but said ""the fight continues to finally defeat this terrorist organisation"". In a statement, the Iraqi government highlighted its role in finding Baghdadi's hideout, and said it would continue to ""relentlessly pursue"" the militant group. Baghdadi, whose real name was Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri, had a reputation as a highly organised and ruthless battlefield tactician. He was described as the world's most wanted man. He was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, in 1971, and reports suggest he was a cleric in a mosque in the city around the time of the US-led invasion in 2003. Some believe he was already a jihadist during the rule of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Others suggest he was radicalised during the time he was held at Camp Bucca, a US facility in southern Iraq where many al-Qaeda commanders were detained. This video can not be played A video appearing to show the IS group leader was released earlier this year Baghdadi emerged in 2010 as the leader of an umbrella group that included al-Qaeda in Iraq, and rose to prominence when IS militants captured the Iraqi city of Mosul in 2014, when he declared the creation of a ""caliphate"". That was the only time Baghdadi was seen in public. At its peak, IS had eight million people in territories under its control. Baghdadi only reappeared in a video released by IS earlier this year. In October 2011, the US officially designated him a ""terrorist"" and offered a reward of $10m (Â£5.8m at the time) for information leading to his capture or death. This was increased to $25m in 2017. What Baghdadi's death means for IS in Syria Where is IS still active around the world? Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?

Where in the world is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?,"This video can not be played Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has not been seen on video for five years He is the world's most wanted man. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the fugitive leader of the Islamic State (IS) group and its self-styled ""caliph"", has a $25m (Â£19m) US government bounty on his head. For more than three years he has been dodging capture, and ever mindful of his security, until now he has only ever appeared once in-vision, when he delivered his sermon from Mosul in 2014 declaring a ""caliphate"", ruled by him. Earlier this week, Baghdadi resurfaced in an 18-minute online video, rallying his supporters but, not surprisingly, giving no clues as to his current whereabouts. So where is he, how is he being searched for, and why cannot the US and its allies, with all their sophisticated technology, locate him? Where is IS still active around the world? Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat Reports say that on 3 November 2016, Baghdadi made a mistake that nearly cost him his life. The battle for Iraq's second city of Mosul was getting underway and US-led coalition forces were pressing in on IS fighters. From somewhere just outside the city, Baghdadi made a 45-second radio call exhorting his followers to keep fighting. The message was intercepted by electronic eavesdropping aircraft operated by the coalition, a voice match was made and there was a frantic scramble to react. But by then the IS leader was gone, moved on by his bodyguards and no doubt implored by them not to take to the airwaves in real time ever again. It is unclear where the IS leader is It took US intelligence almost 10 years to track down and kill Osama Bin Laden, between the day of the 9/11 attacks in 2001 until the small hours of 2 May 2011 whenUS Navy Seal commandos burst into his compound in Pakistan. America's National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain's GCHQ have a staggeringly large capacity for Signals Intelligence, known as 'Sigint', monitoring, intercepting and decoding both open and encrypted communications around the world. Who is Baghdadi? In the old days, terrorists on wanted lists would sometimes give away their locations by making calls from their mobile phones or staying online too long from one location. Bin Laden was wise to that, and Baghdadi has been too - mostly. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually tracked down to his Abbottabad lair not through his digital footprint but through the courier who ferried his propaganda videos and other messages by hand from there to wherever they were being uploaded onto the internet. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's last appearance was in a mosque in Mosul in 2014 Tracing this reverse journey is likely to be one of the first things US intelligence is likely to be doing in the days following Baghdadi's video release, but his security team will be wise to that. Only a very small number of trusted associates will be with him and they are likely to be moving him around constantly. Born near Samarra, Iraq, in 1971, his real name is Ibrahim Awad al-Badri. Deeply religious from an early age, he later spent time incarcerated in the US-run internment camp of Camp Bucca in 2004 following the Anglo-US invasion and occupation. There he forged close alliances with other inmates, including former Iraqi intelligence officials. ""He learned a lot on how to operate from Saddam's former intelligence officials,"" says Michael Stephens, a Middle East expert with the London-based think-tank Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). ""His operational security is excellent,"" he adds, ""partly because of his excessive paranoia"". Where is he hiding now? Almost certainly still in the Iraq-Syria border area, says Stephens. ""He'll be able to take advantage of established smuggling networks across that border,"" he says, ""using money to pay his way amongst the tribes there"". Baghdadi forged alliances with former Iraqi intelligence officials during his time in a US-led prison Iraq's former strongman Saddam Hussein went on the run for nine months after his regime was overthrown. US operation Red Dawn tracked him down to an underground hiding place near his birthplace in Tikrit after a human informant betrayed his whereabouts for a multi-million dollar reward. But getting such a ""mole"" inside Baghdadi's inner circle would be very difficult indeed. The tiny amount of people in close proximity to him could well be so loyal as to be beyond financial temptation. So if the world's most wanted man is staying off-line, he is not making any calls on a mobile phone, and he is possibly moving around constantly from one hiding place to another, then what hope does Washington and the West have of ever finding him? (Preferably before he orchestrates or inspires the next major IS attack). Ultimately, it may well come down to luck and patience: a chance sighting by an inquisitive villager, an unusual configuration of vehicles spotted by an alert drone operator, or even an exhausted and disillusioned IS member who decides it is finally time to take the reward money on offer and spend the rest of his or her life, fabulously rich and forever in hiding.

Where IS is still active around the world,"The Philippines has seen an uptick in IS attacks in recent years After months of fighting, the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) has finally lost Baghuz, a village in eastern Syria that came to represent the final chapter in its self-styled caliphate. While this is a major blow, the loss of the small enclave near the Iraqi border does not spell the end of IS as a militant group capable of mounting deadly attacks worldwide. IS and its affiliates continue to be active in various countries, claiming attacks on a daily basis through the group's online propaganda outlets. Data collected by BBC Monitoring shows that despite having lost most of its territory in Syria and Iraq at the end of 2017, IS said it was behind 3,670 attacks worldwide last year - an average of 11 attacks per day - and 502 attacks in the first two months of 2019, while Baghuz was under siege. There was a peak in IS attack claims in September 2018. This was likely to have been linked to the start that month of an operation by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance to take the IS stronghold of Hajin, north of Baghuz. The jihadist group commonly steps up its attacks in response to offensives against it, either in the area under siege or elsewhere to divert attention or resources away from there. Although Iraq and Syria continue to account for the lion's share of IS attack claims, Afghanistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria and Egypt's Sinai peninsula also feature regularly. In a recent message, the IS leadership mocked US President Donald Trump's claim in December to have defeated the group, and insisted that it was far from over. Nevertheless, IS's caliphate model has been over since late 2017, when it lost its strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. After that, the group struggled to project the image of a functioning and flourishing state - which had formed the basis of its claim to have revived the caliphates of early Islam. The rise and fall of the Islamic State group The enduring appeal of violent jihad The data is based exclusively on what the group itself has claimed through its official ""Nashir News Agency"" media outlets on the messaging app Telegram. The dates reflect when IS said the attacks took place, rather than when the claim was published. The data includes every claim of attack, no matter how small or inconsequential. Most attacks that IS claimed solely through its weekly newspaper al-Naba without issuing a separate statement were not reflected in the data. It is worth noting that IS, like any jihadist group, has a tendency to exaggerate the scale of its attacks and their impact. IS has officially declared that it has a presence in the following countries and regions: Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, ""Khorasan"" (the Afghanistan-Pakistan region), ""the Caucasus"", ""East Asia"" (mostly active in the Philippines), Somalia, and ""West Africa"" (mostly active in Nigeria). Some of these branches, such as Algeria and Saudi Arabia, have barely claimed any activity, and others like ""the Caucasus"" rarely claim attacks. The group recently signalled through its propaganda an intention to step up its activity in Tunisia, a country where it has so far failed to make inroads following the 2015 attacks on a museum and beach resort that it claimed. IS also announced for the first time a presence in Burkina Faso. The announcements about Tunisia and Burkina Faso suggest that at least in terms of propaganda, IS is keen to indicate that its trademark slogan ""Remaining and Expanding"" still applies. Unsurprisingly, IS's biggest battleground continues to be in Iraq and Syria, where it clearly has its best resources. Out of a total of 3,670 attacks IS claimed worldwide in 2018, 1,767 were in Iraq (48%) and 1,124 were in Syria (31%). Nigeria's army has increasingly come under attack by a branch of IS in recent months But last year also saw a notable increase in claimed activity by other IS branches. It was as if the group wanted to compensate for its losses in Iraq and Syria and to remind people that it also operated outside the Middle East. In 2018, IS claimed 316 attacks in Afghanistan, 181 in Egypt's Sinai peninsula, 73 in Somalia, 44 in Nigeria, 41 in Yemen and 27 in the Philippines. The number of attack claims by IS West Africa Province in Nigeria has notably risen in recent months. The army has been the primary target, possibly because the group is attempting to seize weaponry and in turn boost its capability. Islamic State and the kidnap of Nigerian schoolgirls Made-up to look beautiful. Sent out to die IS has claimed 44 attacks in Nigeria in the first three months of 2019, matching the total number of attacks it claimed in a whole year in 2018. In a propaganda video released in January, IS West Africa Province called on Muslims to migrate to the region and join its branch, signalling that it was ready to receive foreign recruits. On 22 March, IS West Africa Province announced for the first time that it had a presence in Burkina Faso - a country where its rival al-Qaeda has already carried out several attacks. There has also been an uptick in the number of attack claims in the Philippines. IS operates in the country through local affiliates, most of which have been fighting to establish an independent Islamic state in the south for decades. But their attacks, mostly against the army, are still sporadic. And despite repeated calls to its supporters, IS did not claim any major attacks in the West during 2018.

Taylor becomes unified super-lightweight championJosh Taylor beats Regis Prograis to become the unified IBF and WBA super-lightweight champion and win the World Super Series trophy in London.BBC SportComments,"Josh Taylor defeated Regis Prograis in a gripping contest at London's O2 Arena Josh Taylor beat Regis Prograis on points to become the unified IBF and WBA super-lightweight champion and win the World Super Series in London. The Scot, 28, earned a riveting, see-sawing victory, with judges scoring it 114-114, 115-113, 117-112. Prograis was composed in the early skirmishes but Taylor grew into the contest and landed telling blows in the eighth, ninth and 10th, before two fiercely contested final rounds. Taylor remains undefeated in 16 bouts. He inflicted his American opponent's first loss in 25 fights en route to the Muhammad Ali Trophy, while also claiming the WBC Diamond and Ring Magazine belts. With his right eye swollen shut, Taylor dedicated the O2 Arena victory to his late father-in-law, who died last month. ""He was here with us tonight and I want to dedicate this to him,"" he told Sky Sports. ""What a fight. All respect to Regis Prograis, a great fight, great champion, but the best man won. ""The free-flowing boxing, the inside work - I don't think he quite expected I could switch it up and go to range quite as quickly."" Reaction & as it happened Chisora stops Price in fourth round Selby beats Burns in 'career-defining' fight 5 live Boxing Podcast: Scotland's Taylor beats Prograis The fight was a mouth-watering prospect for boxing fans - two undefeated world champions, a spot of needle in the build-up and no fewer than five belts up for grabs in a packed stadium as the two southpaws prepared to battle. Taylor, four years a pro, spoke of his speed, reactions and timing being his greatest assets: all were tested in a thriller. He held the advantage in height and reach and was the man on the front foot as the Houston-based WBA champion relied on his head movement to evade Taylor's barrage before countering with both fists. There was danger everywhere - and from both fighters. Crunching body shots, uppercuts that began as far south as Louisiana, head-popping jabs, fists flying at close range and big overhead lefts. By the mid-point of the scheduled 12 rounds, there was little between the fighters but the momentum seemed to be moving in favour of the Tartan Tornado, two years younger than Prograis. But the American, evoking memories of Terence Crawford coming to the UK to take home Ricky Burns' WBO lightweight title in 2014, remained lively if increasingly ragged. Taylor's right eye was swollen by round eight as the two world-class talents traded blows before Taylor stepped up his work-rate in the ninth with shots to the body and head of his resourceful foe. In the hardest fight of their respective careers, the result was in the balance. Another strong round for Taylor in the 10th would have demoralised a lesser opponent but not Prograis - he traded body blows, landed a cracking uppercut on the taller Scot and soaked up heavy shots. Prograis was back to his cocky, stylish best with three minutes remaining, Taylor replying with his own form of artistry to rouse the crowd once more as the final bell sounded. Josh Taylor enjoyed a flurry of dominance in the ninth and 10th rounds Former middleweight world champion Andy Lee on BBC Radio 5 Live ""The one judge who gave the win by five rounds, I'm not sure what that was on about, but the other two scores were fair. Taylor found a new energy and I think Prograis let him into the fight."" BBC Radio 5 Live boxing pundit Steve Bunce ""What an outcome. What an hour it was to be there ringside.

Anguish for Vietnam families over trailer deaths,"The families of Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong are concerned they may be among the victims Three people arrested in connection with the deaths of 39 people found dead inside a lorry in Essex have been released on bail. The suspects, two men and a woman, had been held on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people after the discovery in Grays last Wednesday. Lorry driver Maurice Robinson, 25, is due to appear in court on Monday. Meanwhile, families in Vietnam face an anxious wait to find out if their loved ones were among the dead. Those bailed were a 46-year-old man from Northern Ireland, who was arrested at Stansted Airport on Friday, and Joanna and Thomas Maher, both 38, from Warrington, Cheshire. Mr Robinson, of Laurel Drive, Craigavon, Northern Ireland, has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter as well as people trafficking, immigration and money laundering offences. He is due before Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday. Maurice Robinson has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter In total, five people have been arrested in connection with the investigation into the deaths. A man in his 20s, arrested by Irish police in Dublin on Saturday was said to be ""of interest"" to the Grays investigation. His arrest at Dublin Port is unconnected to the lorry death investigation but Essex Police said they were liaising with Irish police as the man is currently being held outside the jurisdiction of English and Welsh law. Why are Vietnamese people trying to reach the UK? Essex lorry deaths: What we know In Vietnam, relatives of Bui Thi Nhung, 19, said they feared she may be among the dead. The teenager is thought to be the youngest of those who died. Bui Thi Nhung is from Nghe An province Since the bodies were discovered on Wednesday, several families in Vietnam have expressed concerns over missing relatives. Among them is Le Van Ha, 30, who left his young son and pregnant wife behind to journey to the UK. Since he left, his wife has given birth to their second child. His father Le Minh Tuan says the family have ""nothing left"" after mortgaging their land to fund the Â£20,000  journey to the UK. Others feared to be among the 39 victims are Pham Thi Tra My, 26, who last messaged her family late on Tuesday, and two men - Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, and Nguyen Dinh Tu. A friend of Tran Thi Tho, 21, fears she may also be among the victims. The friend, who lives in Glasgow, did not want to be identified but told the BBC he had been due to meet up with her when she arrived in the UK. Police in Vietnam are taking DNA samples from family members of those reported missing in a bid to identify the victims, Reuters has reported. In Ha Tinh in Vietnam, police have opened a special criminal case to investigate claims they have received in relation to the lorry deaths, the BBC has learnt. Included in the investigation are allegations of human trafficking in Ha Tinh province. This video can not be played Nguyen Dinh Sat fears his son was among the 39 found dead inside a refrigerated lorry A representative of VietHome - a website for Vietnamese people in the UK - said it had passed on the pictures of almost 20 people who have been reported missing to detectives. Police said they were investigating a ""wider conspiracy"" after reports the lorry may have been part of a convoy of three carrying about 100 people. Catholic worshippers said prayers for the 39 people at a Mass in Nghe An province, Vietnam The victims - who police initially believed to be Chinese nationals - were inside a lorry trailer which came to the UK via the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. Officers said post-mortem examinations were being carried out. The victims had been carrying ""very few"" identity documents, leaving officers to rely on fingerprints, DNA and distinguishing features such as tattoos or scars, Essex Police said. The bodies were discovered in the early hours of Wednesday Meanwhile, concerns have been raised over the UK's ability to work with European officials to combat people trafficking after Brexit. Labour's Yvette Cooper and exiled Conservative Dominic Grieve voiced the fears over co-operation with Europol as plans for the transition period after Brexit and beyond have yet to be agreed. However, the Home Office said the UK would continue to work with EU law enforcement agencies with or without a Brexit deal. Do you have any information to share about the incident?

Key word 'adequate' removed from Brexit planWorker rights: UK negotiators remove âadequateâ from employment and environmental standards enforcement.Business,"Labour claims workers' rights will be eroded under Boris Johnson's Brexit deal renegotiation An internal UK government memo on the consequences of Boris Johnson's Brexit deal renegotiation singles out the removal of the word ""adequate"" from the UK-EU Political Declaration to describe mechanisms for enforcing common social, environmental, and labour standards after Brexit. The word ""adequate"" appears to have been replaced by the word ""appropriate"". Extracts of a note written for the government's cross-Whitehall Economic Partnership Steering Group, and seen by the BBC, say the ""parties will include ""appropriate"" (rather than ""adequate"") mechanisms for dispute settlement"" of key ""level playing field commitments"" in a future trade deal with the European Union. The consequence of that change, the note says, is that it means that it is now possible to argue it is ""inappropriate for the future UK-EU relationship"" that disputes about these commitments on employment, environment, tax, state aid and other standards should be subject to binding arbitration. The memo,first leaked to the Financial Times,externaland marked ""Official Sensitive"", contains a series of claimed negotiation wins from the Brexit deal renegotiation, weakening the scope and strength of Level Playing Field Commitments (LPF), a crucial element in a future UK-EU trade arrangement. 'Fears confirmed' over rights at work, says Labour What does the Brexit deal say about workers' rights? ""The previous Protocol applied wide-ranging LPF measures on a UK-wide bases as a response to UK access to the EU market through the single customs territory. ""UK negotiators successfully resisted the inclusion of all UK-wide LPF rules"" says the memo, with the last four words put in bold for emphasis. ""The only level playing field provisions in the revised Protocol are those necessary to support the operation of the Single Electricity Market and state aid measures that affect trade between NI and the EU,"" it says. The title of the memo is ""Update to EPSG (Economic Partnership Steering Group) on Level Playing Field Negotiations"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is the first acknowledgement that changing the Level Playing Field commitments agreed by Theresa May was a specific aim of the PM's renegotiation. In public, the PM focused on changing what he referred to as ""the anti-democratic backstop"", which had been rejected by the government's parliamentary allies, the Democratic Unionists. In the end, the PM's new solution, creating a new trade and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, further alienated the DUP. Backbench eurosceptic Conservative MPs have, however, been won over to the deal. Theresa May's original 2018 deal included a range of specific enforceable common standards for the UK and the EU within the legally binding Withdrawal Treaty. Some of these standards were related to EU law, others referred to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), International Labour Organisation and the Council of Europe. Business minister Kwesi Kwarteng said the leaked reports are ""completely mad"" These were all removed, along with the backstop, and the only reference remaining in the overall deal was in the non-binding Political Declaration. The memo shows that within Whitehall, weakening these provisions was a key part of the renegotiation. Regarded as an internal success, their removal paves the way for a ""much more open starting point for future relationship negotiations"" that allow for ""a range of landing zones"" for a future deal. ""The Political Declaration text provides us with a framework for negotiating FTA-style commitments on Level Playing Field,"" the memo concludes under the headline ""Next Steps"". That is a reference to the fact that, unlike the original Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May, dispute settlement mechanisms have not applied to existing standard EU Free Trade Agreements. Sam Lowe, trade fellow at the Centre for European Reform, said: ""The Level Playing Field commitments in the EU's Free Trade Agreements with Canada and Japan are unenforceable, because they are specifically excluded from the dispute settlement mechanisms. The government appears to be aiming for the same treatment."" Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly rejected suggestions there are attempts to relax workplace rights or environmental protections. ""In many areas we have already gone further than the European Union,"" he said. ""We are making hard improvements on worker rights through an increase in the National Living Wage."" The government was also strengthening rules on maritime protection and animal welfare, he added. On Saturday, ministers said stories about the leaked memo were ""not correct"" and ""way exaggerated"". The government also said: ""The UK government has no intention of lowering the standards of workers' rights or environmental protection after we leave the EU. ""UK level playing field commitments will be negotiated in the context of the future UK-EU free trade agreement, where we will achieve a balance of rights and obligations which reflect the scope and depth of the future relationship.""

They said all the bodies had now been removed from the trailer and post-mortem examinations were being carried out. The victims had been carrying ""very few"" identity documents, leaving officers to rely on fingerprints, DNA and distinguishing features such as tattoos or scars, he said.
