Monkeypox: Jab rollout to stall as UK runs out,"People have queued at clinics in recent weeks to receive a vaccination The UK's monkeypox vaccination rollout is likely to be paused for several weeks, with stocks of the jab set to run out in parts of the country. An internal memo, leaked to the BBC, shows the UK Health Security Agency will hold back some doses to give to people already exposed to the virus. Many clinics, including London's busiest, say stocks have already run out and new appointments have ceased. The UKHSA says it's trying to ""expedite delivery"" of a further 100,000 doses. In its latest update on the monkeypox outbreak, the UKHSA has predicted all of the UK's current supplies of vaccine will have been distributed to providers by the middle of August. It goes on to say ""all available vaccines"" will have been given to vulnerable groups by the end of the month, meaning there could be several weeks without supplies across the country. Meanwhile an internal letter to senior staff at the UKHSA, leaked to the BBC, has detailed how some of that stock will be held back for 'post-exposure' - where people who have been exposed to the virus are given a vaccine in the hope of reducing severe symptoms. So far there have been 3,017  cases in total across the UK, with officials noting that the outbreak is beginning to slow. The latest data shows 29 cases a day confirmed on average, compared to 52 cases a day during the last week in June. More than 25,000 people have received a dose of the vaccine. Despite the positive signs, there are still concerns about the lack of available vaccine. A public health worker in Yorkshire, working on the vaccination rollout there, called the situation a ""nightmare"", adding ""disorganisation is going to mean more and more people get infected"". Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the public health worker said clinics were already having to turn away people who were eligible for a vaccine and predicted a ""massive increase"" in cases. ""We are turning away men here in Yorkshire for a vaccine. It's unconscionable. More people are going to be getting monkeypox and it will be transmitted in our communities."" LGBT groups demand more action on monkeypox What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? 'I'm a different person after having monkeypox' Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UKHSA, said: ""The most important way to protect those who are more likely to get monkeypox - and to limit the outbreak - is to ensure that all the vaccines available to us are in people's arms as quickly as possible, and are building protection across the community. Currently, additional stock of 100,000 doses is due to arrive in the UK by the end of September, with the UKHSA saying it is ""working with the manufacturer to expedite delivery"". It is understood that those who already have an appointment will still receive a vaccine, but - as stock runs low - no new appointments for a pre-exposure vaccine will be available. In some parts of the UK, clinics are already pausing rollout of the vaccine. On Friday, London's 56 Dean Street - Europe's busiest sexual health clinic - tweeted to say they would be unable to offer new appointments until the end of September. Other clinics, including those in Brighton, Southampton, and London's Chelsea, have posted similar messages. The UK is expecting to receive 100,000 more vaccines in September Labour MP for Brighton's Kemptown and Peacehaven, Lloyd Russell-Moyle, told BBC News:  ""I've already spoken to people in the area who feel worried, scared and that they've missed out. ""They feel that they're being put at risk, and that their enjoyment of the summer is being put at risk, by bad organisation from the government."" Mr Russell-Moyle added: ""My understanding is that  if you are not vaccinated in the next couple of weeks, then it will be too late and you'll have to wait until September"". This video can not be played Watch: Dan speaks about his experience of contracting monkeypox at the start of June Currently about 75% of monkeypox cases are in London, which is where the majority of vaccines have been targeted, but numbers outside the city are also increasing. The UK government has bought stocks of smallpox vaccine to stop the spread of monkeypox. Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe and experts say chances of infection are low. The global outbreak of monkeypox has meant a surge in demand for the vaccine. However, stocks are limited, because, until recently, the disease had not spread widely outside of countries where the virus is endemic. Sexual health experts are warning people to be alert to the signs and symptoms of monkeypox, regardless of their vaccine status. Dr Claire Dewsnap, President of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH), said she was ""concerned"" about the time it will take for the UK to receive more vaccine doses. She added: ""While you are waiting for your vaccine, or if you have just received one, please remain alert to the symptoms of monkeypox, especially if you have had a new or multiple sexual partners. Symptoms can take up to three weeks to develop, so keep checking yourself after intimate contact with others. If you feel unwell, please speak to a sexual health service.""

Tory hopefuls to target Scottish votes at hustings,"Leadership candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are to pitch for the votes of Scottish Conservative members at a hustings in Perth. Both have stated their opposition to a referendum on Scottish independence and want their policies to apply UK-wide. And each has policies to challenge the Scottish government, calling for greater scrutiny of the SNP's record. The SNP said neither candidate was offering a solution to the cost of living crisis. Both candidates would boost support for independence, they added. The two contenders to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister are taking part in a series of events around the UK. The event at the Perth Concert Hall will give local Tory members the chance to question the candidates on Scottish issues as well as other topics such as the cost of living. What can we expect from Scottish Tory hustings? Where do the final Tory candidates stand on indyref2? Truss asked me how to get in to Vogue - Sturgeon Sunak says ignoring SNP would be dangerous Speaking ahead of the hustings on a visit to the Benriach distillery, near Elgin, Ms Truss said she was ""absolutely passionate about Scotland and the United Kingdom"" and committed to delivering jobs, growth and opportunity. On the cost of living, Ms Truss said the ""first thing"" she would do would be to reduce people's taxes. She also underlined her opposition to windfall taxes on industries such as oil and gas. She promised to work with Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross to take on the SNP, which she said had been ""failing the Scottish people, whether that's on education, whether that's on health or whether that's on the transport system."" Ms Truss - the foreign secretary - also said the case of a man from Dumbarton who was arrested in Punjab nearly five years ago should be ""brought to justice as soon as possible"" by the Indian authorities. Jagtar Singh Johal was arrested in November 2017 but was only formally charged with conspiracy to commit murder and of being a member of a terrorist gang last month. The Indian government previously said Mr Johal's detention was based on ""sufficient prosecutable evidence"", but in May human rights investigators at the UN said his detention had no legal basis. Liz Truss said she was ""absolutely passionate"" about Scotland and the United Kingdom Ms Truss sparked controversy earlier this month when she claimed that it would be best to ""ignore"" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - who she described as an ""attention seeker"". The comments were condemned as ""completely and utterly unacceptable"" by Deputy First Minister John Swinney, with Ms Sturgeon later claiming that Ms Truss had once asked her how she could be featured in Vogue magazine. Mr Sunak - who spent the morning meeting party activists in Aberdeenshire - said he did not believe that ignoring the first minister was the right approach. In an interview with BBC Scotland ahead of the debate, he said: ""I don't want to ignore Nicola Sturgeon, I want to take her on and beat her. ""I think we can make a very strong case for what the UK government does to help people in Scotland, and as Chancellor I started that - to directly support Scottish communities and local areas. ""I would do more of that as prime minister and I want to hold the SNP government to account for its failings when it comes to delivering public services"". Both Mr Sunak and Ms Truss have stated their opposition to an independence referendum, despite the Scottish government's plans to hold a vote in October 2023. And they have set out a series of policies aimed at strengthening the union and increasing the visibility of the UK government north of the border. Mr Sunak has announced proposals to reform a team of advisers within Downing Street known as the ""union unit"". The former chancellor said his future reforms would ensure ""every single"" government department operated UK-wide, despite key policy areas such as education and health having been in the control of Holyrood since devolution in 1999. He has also called for Scotland's top civil servant to testify before a Westminster committee on an annual basis, while requiring the Scottish government to publish consistent data on the delivery of key services so these can be compared UK-wide. He said: ""The future of the United Kingdom is bright but our union must work together, each nation shoulder to shoulder, to get there. ""We must defeat the collective challenges threatening the health of our public services. Under my plans, the UK government will play its part, but the same must be reciprocated by Holyrood."" Ms Truss meanwhile has stressed that she would retain the ""minister for the union"" title Boris Johnson took on as prime minister. She said she would make changes to the Scotland Act to give MSPs the same full parliamentary privilege as MPs at Westminster. MPs have legal immunity from prosecution over statements made in the Commons, while MSPs have a narrower set of protections against defamation claims and some court actions. Ms Truss said giving MSPs the same status as MPs ""would allow for more robust questioning for ministers"" and would ""increase the powers of the Scottish parliament to hold the Scottish government to account"". She said: ""For too long, people in Scotland have been let down by the SNP focusing on constitutional division instead of their priorities. That won't happen under my watch. I'll make sure that my government does everything to ensure elected representatives hold the devolved administration to account for its failure to deliver the quality public services, particularly health and education, that Scottish people deserve."" The two remaining candidates have taken part in a series of hustings events as well as head-to-head debates Both candidates have won the backing of a number of Scottish Conservative MPs and MSPs. However the party's Scottish leader Douglas Ross has said he will not be publicly backing either, saying he will ""work with whoever emerges victorious"". The SNP said both candidates should ""apologise for the Tory failings that have pushed so many families to the brink"". The party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: ""During the cost of living crisis, many neighbouring countries have capped energy price increases, cut VAT on bills and offered meaningful financial support to the most vulnerable, the UK Tory government has sat on its hands - and both Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have said nothing. ""Whoever wins this leadership contest, Scotland loses. That's why we need the full powers of independence to banish Westminster governments Scotland doesn't vote for and to deliver for the people who live here."" On Monday, Welsh former cabinet minister Alun Cairnsswitched his support from Mr Sunak to Ms Truss,saying she was the best candidate to keep the UK together. The ex-Welsh secretary argued the union would be more likely to break up under Mr Sunak, compared to his opponent and praised Liz Truss for her ""positive ambition for our country"". It may seem like the Conservative leadership contest has been going on for about five years, but somehow there are still three weeks to go until one of the two contenders enters Downing Street. That means there may still be time for them to win over some crucial votes. Scotland has not been a huge focus of the campaign so far - possibly because the contest thrives on where the candidates differ, and they are in broad agreement about affairs north of the border. Both are critical of the SNP and the Scottish government; both would refuse to back an independence referendum; and both want to do more to push their policies UK-wide. But some Scottish Tories have said they are still waiting to hear more specific discussion before they make up their minds. They may also want to look the candidates in the eye and really test their attitude and tone when it comes to those issues where they have a settled position. How serious are they, really, when it comes to the union, and holding their own against the Scottish government? To be frank, which of them will be a better prospect with voters north of the border when it comes to a future election?

William Ruto wins Kenya election amid drama,"This video can not be played Watch: Tussles break out in Kenya over allegations of election vote rigging Deputy President William Ruto has been declared the winner of Kenya's presidential election amid dramatic scenes. He narrowly beat his rival, Raila Odinga, taking 50.5% of the vote, according to the official results. The announcement was delayed amid scuffles and allegations of vote-rigging by Mr Odinga's campaign. Four of the seven members of the electoral commission refused to endorse the result, saying it was ""opaque"". ""We cannot take ownership of the result that is going to be announced because of the opaque nature of this last phase of the general election,"" said Juliana Cherera, the vice-chairperson of Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). ""We are going to give a comprehensive statement... and again we urge Kenyans to keep calm,"" she added. Live updates from around Kenya Full results of the presidential and parliamentary races How Ruto defied the odds Ruto's rise from chicken seller to Kenya's president-elect Mr Odinga's party agent earlier alleged that there were ""irregularities"" and ""mismanagement"" in the election. This was the first time Mr Ruto, 55, had run for president. He has served as deputy president for 10 years, but fell out with President Uhuru Kenyatta, who backed Mr Odinga to succeed him. The 77-year-old former prime minister, who got 48.8% of the vote, was running for president for the fifth time. Mr Ruto (r) called Mr Chebukati, the head of the electoral commission, a ""hero"" Electoral commission chairman Wafula Chebukati said he had done his duty despite receiving threats. ""We have walked the journey of ensuring that Kenyans get a free, fair and credible election. It has not been an easy journey - right now two of my commissioners and the CEO are injured,"" he said. In his speech, President-elect Ruto thanked the electoral commission for overseeing the election. ""It is a wonderful eveningâ¦ all sovereign power belongs to the people of Kenya,"" Mr Ruto said, calling Mr Chebukati a ""hero"" and dismissing the other commissioners' dissent of his win as ""a side show"". Mr Ruto said he wanted to be a president of all, and for the country to focus on the future. ""To those who have done many things against us, I want to tell them there's nothing to fear. There will be no vengeance. We do not have the luxury to look back,"" he added. Celebrations have broken out in several parts of the country, including in Mr Ruto's strongholds of the Rift Valley, and that of his deputy Rigathi Gachagua, in the Central region. Supporters of Mr Odinga have staged protests in the western city of Kisumu and some parts of Nairobi. But generally there's a sense of relief that the result has finally been declared because the country had ground into a halt since election day on 9 August, economic activities had stalled and schools remain closed. Kenya's history of disputed elections in the past have led to violence or the whole process election being cancelled. Following the 2007 vote, at least 1,200 people were killed and 600,000 fled their homes following claims of a stolen election. In a country fond of political metaphors, Mr Ruto's stunning victory is akin to his party's modest symbol, the wheelbarrow, running a seven-tonne tractor off the road. Mr Odinga had the backing of the state machinery. Several opinion polls, which Mr Ruto had dismissed as fake, predicted his rival would win. As the deputy president for the last 10 years he was, by default, an establishment candidate but he ran as an outsider, framing the election as between ""hustlers"" - poor Kenyans - and ""dynasties"" - influential families like the Kenyattas and Odingas who have been big players in the country's politics since independence. ""I may be the son of a nobody but I promise to make Kenya the country of everybody,"" he said in his pitch to voters. His political stock rose when he opposed an unpopular and costly year-long push by Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga to change the constitution at a time many Kenyans were suffering, including losing jobs, following the protracted impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Supreme Court eventually ruled the move unconstitutional, buoying Mr Ruto's campaign. He also framed the election as a time for generational change, selling his message using pithy and relatable slogans, which lent him credibility and appeal across several communities. Mr Ruto's win is rightly the focus of Kenya's 2022 election, but equal attention should be given to the electoral commission which came into this poll with a terrible track record, but its decision to post results from the more than 46,000 polling stations on its website - accessible to anyone who wanted to do their own tally - allowed the media and the public to be part of the process. The leaders of Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Somalia have congratulated Mr Ruto. Analysts believe that Mr Odinga is likely to challenge the result. The Kenyan Supreme Court annulled the last election - it might have to make another big decision in a few weeks.

New system to simplify access to cheaper broadband,"The government is launching a new system to simplify access to cheaper broadband. From 22 August, people receiving certain benefits can ask broadband firms to check their eligibility for social tariffs. This means customers will not have to take full responsibility for proving they qualify for low-cost options. Campaign group Digital Poverty Alliance described it as a positive first step but warned it did not go far enough. Elizabeth Anderson, chief operating officer for the Alliance, argues that, as more sectors moved essential resources and services online ,""it's not right that a growing number of people face being cut off from the online world"". Which? analysis of recent Ofcom data revealednearly six million households are struggling to pay for essential telecoms,external. Steve Leighton, chair of the Internet Service Providers Association, said the association welcomed the government's launch of an application programme interface (API) for members - following calls by the sector for a system to help verify eligibility. ""While we still need to see the technical details, the API should help our members identify eligible customers more easily and offer them targeted support,"" Mr Leighton said. But he reiterated concerns over whether the measures went far enough, adding the government could ease the cost of living crisis' impact on the industry by reducing VAT on broadband bills. Reduced social tariffs allow UK households receiving government benefits such as Universal Credit, Pension Credit, Jobseeker's Allowance and Income Support to pay less for internet and telecoms access. Current providers include BT, Community Fibre, NOW, Sky, Virgin Media and VOXI. Tariffs,externalrange from Â£10 to Â£25 per month depending on preferred bandwidth, supplier and who qualifies for the low-cost alternative. Nadine Dorries, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said social tariffs were ""vital for families struggling with bills"". Ms Dorries said the government had secured commitments from the UK's internet service providers to help customers struggling with bill payments and costly contracts to stay connected. ""I urge anyone concerned about falling behind on payments to contact their supplier to see what support is available,"" she added. What can I do if I can't afford my energy bill? Ofcom urged to help end broadband loyalty penalty  The government's new system, which allows customers to more easily prove eligibility for cheaper broadband, aims to raise awareness and take up of broadband social tariffs among the general public. Ofcom reported earlier this year that only 1.2% of more than four million households receiving Universal Credit had successfully applied for broadband social tariffs. Ms Anderson said the low-cost optionsneeded more promotion by the governmentand the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), which will run the new eligibility system. She said the DWP should ""actively make everyone who's eligible aware of social tariffs"" to prevent those struggling from being plunged into digital poverty - essentially unable to afford to go online. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey said the new system, which launches next week, would make social tariffs easier to access at a time when it was ""more important than ever that people get the financial support available to them"".

The Fringe performers camping to save money,"Samantha is a comedian running a free show every night of the fringe at the Globe Bar Performers at the Edinburgh Fringe have taken to camper vans and tents to escape the city's sky high accommodation costs. Rental prices in the capital always rise considerably during August due to demand caused by the Fringe as well as other festivals. But this year, the increased cost of living has exacerbated things further and many performers have felt priced out. For Samantha Day, a comedian from Buckinghamshire, camping gave her the opportunity to perform at the Fringe and still turn a profit. She travelled up to Edinburgh in a campervan with her dog Percy to perform her comedy act at the Globe Bar as part of the Free Fringe, where the audience pay what they think the performance  is worth. Samantha has been enjoying spending time with her dog and thinks she would camp for the Fringe again ""Doing a show doesn't make financial sense in a hotel,"" she said. ""There are a lot of comedians who are not even here because of the affordability issues and there are others camping because that is all they can afford."" She is staying on a campsite which is a 40-minute bus ride away from the festival. She can only stay for two weeks and then must move to a second site as demand is so high. ""Because it is so expensive loads of the audience can't afford to stay in Edinburgh either so they're camping too,"" Ms Day said. ""Even camping is costing me Â£43 a night so around Â£800 - Â£900 for the whole thing. So it's not nothing even to camp."" While Ms Day has been enjoying time with her dog in the countryside she admits that camping while running a show at the Fringe, isn't ideal. ""With camping you have to be so organised,"" she said. ""It's a logistical challenge on top of everything else. ""Most people that come up here are stressed about their show, I'm not, I'm more worried about actually getting into the city, when the buses are running, whether road works are in the way and the rest of it."" Francesca Firman and Susie Garvey-Williams are both producers and actresses. They decided just 10 weeks ago that they wanted to bring a show to the Fringe. Camping was the only way they could afford to do so. The performers camped together to keep costs down for their production 12th Night Lite ""As we organised it so last minute we didn't do anything through funding, so we funded it all between the two of us,"" Ms Firman said. ""So, we went as cheap as we could. We wouldn't have been able to afford any accommodation in Edinburgh or anything more than camping."" They camped in Musselburgh, about seven miles from the city centre. ""It's been fun. Some of us have never camped before,"" Ms Garvey-Williams said. ""Getting used to the lack of sleep plus doing two shows a day isn't as fun. We're exhausted by the time we get back to the tent but we haven't let it impact the production."" The pair believe that rising costs are affecting visitors as well. ""People can't afford to come and visit the Fringe for as long,"" Ms Firman said. ""We've actually had quite considerable audiences every show so far but we have heard from other people in our venue that they are struggling for numbers,"" Ms Garvey-Williams added. Previous concerns over ticket sales due to thecost of living crisis prompted organisers to offer 35,000 tickets at a discounted rate. Lexie has been commuting by train to run her murder mystery production ""Highly suspect"" It is Lexie Ward's fifth Fringe and like in previous years she commutes 106 miles from Carlisle to Edinburgh by train everyday. She buys her train tickets 12 weeks in advance. ""I don't think we've had one train yet that has arrived on time,"" she said. ""Also trains have been cancelled, our train has just been cancelled for the second consecutive night. ""That's the flip side of doing thing this way but it is still cheaper than trying to find accommodation up here."" Some of the other members of Ms Ward's production chose to stay in Edinburgh and she believes that the prices this year are some of the worst she has ever seen. Edinburgh recently became the thefirst city in Scotland to introduce a short-term let control area to limit the number of Airbnb-style rentals. A third of all short-term lets in Scotland are found in Edinburgh. The proposal was introduced to help with affordable housing shortages in the city however some believe that it will further exacerbate the problems performers and visitors are facing this year. The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is the world's biggest arts festival Ms Ward said she understood that the Fringe was only one month a year and accommodation in the Edinburgh was a year-round concern for many. ""So whatever happens it has to suit the city first but it feels like it's pricing itself out of the Fringe,"" she said. Louise Dickins has operated a short and medium term letting business in Edinburgh over the last 25 years. She believes that the proposed short term-let control could have a ""seismic impact"" on the festival. ""The costs of renting accommodation this year are astronomical in places,"" she told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland. ""I've never had so many people on the phone to me. People in a total panic about where they're going to stay for the fringe as they can't afford the rentals."" Megan Bishop, the national director of the Scottish tenants' union Living Rent, wants the city to be able to house performers for the Fringe but thinks that the way short-term lets are operating now is making it impossible for people to live in Edinburgh long term. ""At the moment it's untenable, there needs to be a way to bring rents down for short term rentals and for people living here long term,"" she said. She believes that reducing the number of short-term lets is a good way to accomplish that. ""I love the Fringe but it's pushing people out of the city, Edinburgh is being prioritised as a place for profit rather than actually a home,"" she said.

Giggs threatened ex's sister after assault - court,"Ryan Giggs arriving at Manchester Crown Court on Monday Former Manchester United star Ryan Giggs headbutted his ex-girlfriend and threatened to do the same to her sister, a court has heard. The ex-Wales manager, 48, is on trial accused of controlling behaviour, as well as assaulting Kate Greville, 38, and her younger sister Emma, 26. Emma Greville told jurors he said ""I'll headbutt you next"" after assaulting her sister in an argument at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester. Mr Giggs denies all charges. Giving evidence from behind a screen at Manchester Crown Court, Emma Greville said she saw Mr Giggs place his hands on her sister's shoulders ""and with lots of force use his head to headbutt her on her lip"". She said Kate Greville screamed and fell to the floor and Mr Giggs told Emma Greville that it was ""her fault"" he had done it, then threatened to do the same to her. She said she ""felt fear"" and that when Kate Greville told her to call the police, Mr Giggs told her not to, telling her to ""think of his daughter and his career"". Earlier in her evidence, Emma Greville had described how her sister and Mr Giggs had returned to the house separately on 1 November 2020 after going out for a meal at the Stock Exchange hotel where they had planned to stay that night. But Kate Greville had messaged her sister, who was pet-sitting at the house, to ask her to pack her things as she was leaving that night. She said her sister arrived first and was ""upset"". Giggs' ex screamed in pain on 999 call, court told Covid lockdown with Giggs was hell, ex tells court Mr Giggs arrived about 15 minutes later and was ""annoyed"" and ""not happy"". She said Kate Greville had been drinking and Mr Giggs was ""very drunk"". Emma Greville told the jury how the couple argued in the hallway and that she had come from the kitchen to see Mr Giggs lying on top of her sister grabbing for her phone. Kate Greville asked her sister to ""get him off me"", she said. Emma Greville described how she put her arms around his waist and pulled as her sister pushed with her legs and said, that as she did so, he ""turned to the right and his elbow touched my jaw"". ""As a result, I let go,"" she said. The trial has started its second week at Manchester Crown Court She said he did not mention what had happened, ""even though I was visibly upset"" but he did say he was ""disappointed"" in her, she said. Emma Greville said the argument between the couple continued and moved into the kitchen, where the alleged headbutt then took place. The court also heard Emma Greville had been critical of a photograph her older sister arranged to be taken a couple of days after the alleged assault on 1 November that appeared to show her injuries. Kate Greville previously told the court the photo was taken in an attempt to get the paparazzi off her back. Asked about a series of messages between Kate Greville and her friend Courtney which showed the younger sister disagreed with the arrangement, Emma Greville confirmed to the court she thought it was immoral to set up a fake picture made to look genuine. She was also asked about messages between the two sisters on 16 November, when the article was published. In one, Emma Greville asked her sister how she felt about the article. Kate Greville said in response, she thought she looked terrible, but that was probably a good thing as it ""looks less staged"". Emma Greville responded: ""I think they are good photos as it looks real"". Asked if the bruises were not real, Emma Greville told the court: ""They were real."" Emma Greville was asked if she had told the police her sister had staged fake photos. She said she hadn't, but that her sister had. The court also heard from Mr Giggs' neighbour who said he was banging on her door on the night of the alleged assault. Linda Cheung, who had known the defendant for more than 20 years, said he was ""distressed"" and asked her to help him. ""He said words to affect that Kate had been accusing him of seeing other women and he wanted me to and sort her out,"" she said. Regarding the accusation of him seeing other girls, she said her reaction was: ""Oh Ryan, not that again."" He told her Ms Greville was refusing to leave. Mrs Cheung said she refused to go over as she did not want to get involved when she did not understand the situation. He later left. Later, in the early hours. after she saw the police come and go, she said she saw a small white car arrive with two women and another male. She described them ""as screaming, shouting and laughing"" and ""running up and down the drive"" Kate Greville had the dog Mack in her arms and was talking to him. She described the mood as ""high jinks"". The court was also told a firm which employed Kate Greville had blocked Mr Giggs' emails due to the quantity he was sending her. Elsa Roodt said the email volume was ""intense"" and ""Kate could not do her work"". Ms Roodt, who has a public relations firm in the United Arab Emirates, was giving her evidence via a video link from Dubai. She told the court Ms Greville had gone to help her and colleague Katie Harvey to set up a new office in Abu Dhabi in 2016. She said Ms Greville was ""happy and confident and bubbly"" and had socialised when she first arrived. Ryan Giggs' football career ended with him as the most decorated player in the Premier League era, with 34 trophies But, over the two years she worked there, she said there was a ""noticeable difference"" and they did not spend as much time with her. She appeared ""nervous"" and she was ""obsessed"" with her phone and being available at all times, said Ms Roodt. She was asked about an alleged incident at a hotel in Dubai, when Mr Giggs was visiting and when she had seen Ms Greville the following day, she told her they had had some sort of ""argument"". ""She was very upset,"" she said. I was slave to Giggs' demands, ex tells court Giggs threw ex out of hotel room naked, court told Ms Roodt added she had seen bruises on Ms Greville's wrist and had asked her where they were from. She said Ms Greville told her they had had ""rough sex"" after the argument. Ms Roodt was also asked about seeing Ms Greville in February 2020 when she visited Ms Harvey's home while on holiday in Dubai with Mr Giggs. Ms Roodt said Ms Greville described how ""she had been crying all night and seemed very upset"". She said she had bruises on her arm and had said Mr Giggs had been ""physical with her"" in the hotel room. Mr Giggs had phoned and messaged Ms Harvey during the two hours Ms Roodt was visiting. Some of his messages were ""loving"", she said, but some were ""rude"". ""It was like they were coming from two different people,"" she said. Under cross examination, Ms Roodt said she had met Mr Giggs about three times. She said she had not been present during any of the couple's arguments, and having been at a wedding with the couple in Spain, she agreed he had appeared kind, friendly and sociable at that event. The court heard Ms Greville was currently a managing partner in the UK branch of Ms Roodt's business. The trial continues.

No 10 defends PM's holiday as removal vans arrive,"Boris Johnson will be kept informed of any ""urgent issues"" while on holiday this week, Downing Street has said. The prime minister - who was criticised for taking a holiday earlier this month amid growing economic turmoil - is now on another break. It comes as removal vans were spotted in Downing Street earlier on Monday. The PM's spokesman confirmed Mr Johnson would return from holiday at the weekend, when he will have two weeks to move out of his No 10 flat. The prime minister, who was forced to announce his departure in July after a cabinet mutiny, will officially stand down on 6 September. It is not known if he will return to the Downing Street flat before it is handed over to Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak, who are competing to take over as Conservative leader and prime minister. Labour vows to freeze fuel bills with windfall tax What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? It was reported over the weekend that Mr Johnson is spending a week in Greece, with locals spotting him shopping alongside wife Carrie in a supermarket in Nea Makri, a town to the east of Athens. Asked if his holiday could have waited a few weeks, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""I can't get into the decision around timings but he is on leave this week. He will be back this weekend."" The spokesman told reporters Mr Johnson had paid for his own holiday and would be kept informed of any pressing government business while away. He added: ""If there were urgent decisions that required the PM's input he will, of course, be involved in that. ""But the deputy prime minister [Dominic Raab] is able to be deputised for meetings should they come up but as far as I'm aware there are no such meetings currently scheduled. ""Over recent weeks we've made a number of significant announcements and will continue to do so in the coming days."" Mr Johnson's spokesman said that the prime minister would remain ""contactable"". This video can not be played Watch: I'm not going to apologise for holiday with my wife and kids - Starmer But Labour accused Mr Johnson of treating recent months as ""one big party"". A spokesperson said: ""On the evidence of the last few months it seems to make little difference if the prime minister is in the office or on holiday as he has continually failed to meet the challenge of the Tory cost-of-living crisis. ""It's all just one big party for Boris Johnson while the country struggles to pay their bills."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer recently got back from his own summer holiday, in Mallorca, amid criticism he has also been missing in action during the cost of living crisis. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I've got a very important job as leader of the Labour Party, leader of the Opposition, but I've also got another job that's really important and that is I'm a dad and I'm not going to apologise for going on holiday with my wife and kids. ""It's the first time we've had a real holiday for about three years."" Mr Johnson shares his official flat in 11 Downing Street - which is owned by the government - with his wife Carrie, whomhe married in spring last year. An expensive refurbishmentcarried out in 2020 attracted controversyafter it emerged a Tory peer had initially covered part of the cost, on top of the annual Â£30,000 public grant Mr Johnson receives to pay for redecorations. An inquiry by the UK's elections watchdoglater revealedthe prime minister had spent Â£112,000 repaying the peer for the cost of the works. The PM's spokesman said that upon leaving office, Mr Johnson would be able to remove any furniture that had been paid for privately, whilst items funded by the taxpayer would remain.

Thunderstorms begin in the UK after heatwave,"This video can not be played Watch: Lightning strikes light up Scottish skies Thunderstorms are hitting the UK and weather warnings are in place as a spell of hot weather draws to a close. There is a risk of torrential downpours, causing travel disruption and some flooding, the Met Office says. Three days ofalerts,externalhave been issued for most areas, ending on Wednesday. Some parts of Devon and Cornwall have experienced flooding, after stormy conditions brought heavy rain showers and hail to parts of the South West. Temperatures topped 34C in parts of the UK at the weekend and experts have said a lengthy period of rain is needed to end the drought declared in parts of England on Friday. These areas include Devon and Cornwall, Kent and south London, East Anglia and the East Midlands. Heavy rain is unlikely to ease the drought because rainwater struggles to permeate dry ground, meaning it will run off the dehydrated surface and lead to flash flooding in some areas, the Met Office said as it issued a number of weather warnings. Lighting in a photo taken from Bo'ness, Falkirk, on Sunday Much of Scotland was hit by heavy rain late on Sunday and into Monday. A Tesco supermarket and Vue cinema in Inverness have been closed after their roofs collapsed following an intense downpour at Inshes Retail Park. A lightning strike hasblown a hole in the roof of a home in the Isle of Man, where emergency services confirmed four homes were hit during a thunderstorm overnight. The Met Office also forecast rain to move across the country from the west throughout Monday, with much of Wales and England - other than the south-east of England - expected to see thundery downpours.

An amber warning for thunderstorms, meaning flooding and travel disruption is likely, came into force for south-west England at 14:00 BST on Monday and will remain until 20:00. Heavy showers caused flooding in areas of Devon and Cornwall on Monday afternoon, includinga flash flood on a roundabout near the river in Truro. A roundabout in Cornwall was flooded but the water quickly drained away Staff had to clear out floodwater inside The Milky Way Adventure Park in north Devon Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said there have been ""very difficult"" driving conditions and some hail and lightning accompanying the rainfall. He said the stormy conditions could lead to some power cuts as well as flash flooding, particularly in towns and more urban areas. Yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms are in place across much of the rest of the UK, excluding the north of Scotland. A couple on Saltburn pier look out over the sand as a thick sea fret shrouds the beach While parts of the country have been hit by rain, the south-east is experiencing another day of warm temperatures, with highs of 29C (84.2F) forecast for Cambridgeshire. But the mercury is set to sink back to more seasonal averages by the middle of the week. The Met Office's Grahame Madge warned heavy rain could lead to flash flooding as the ground was ""like concrete"" and water will run off before it can be absorbed and drain away. He added it could take months to determine if the UK has recovered from the ""very dry summer"". Stuart Singleton-White, from the Angling Trust, stressed the expected rainfall ""will not mean the end of the drought"". He said the damage the dry weather has done to rivers and wildlife was ""so severe"" that the country needs ""a wet autumn and winter"" to move out of drought conditions. Visitors to the National Waterways Museum in Ellesmere Port during a shower on Monday Prof Hannah Cloke from the University of Reading said ""really heavy rain can overwhelm"" water drainage systems in urban areas as it often ""cannot run away quick enough"". The hydrology expert also highlighted the Tube system in London - which was affected by flooding last year - as being at risk, alongside underground car parks. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has told residents of the capital to prepare for flash flooding - urging people tocontact Floodline,externaland to check their local authority's website for ways to reduce the chances and ""minimise the consequences"" of being flooded. While the UK waits for rain to replenish dwindling water levels in reservoirs, some hosepipe bans and other water restrictions have been imposed. South West Water are the latest water boards to introduce a ban, coming into effect in Cornwall and parts of Devon on 23 August. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? How the heatwave is changing landscapes The extreme heat has led to a string of wildfireserupting across tinder-dry swathes of Ashdown Forest in East Sussexand on theStudland peninsula in Purbeck, Dorset,over the weekend. Firefighters in Derbyshire have recorded theirbusiest week since their current incident recording system began13 years ago, attending 187 fires between Monday and Sunday. On Monday, two men were charged with arson after it was claimed a disposable barbecue was thrown into Norfolk woodland. Aleksejs Sokolovs, and Darius Lazausaks, both 45 and from Boston, Lincolnshire, have been accused of arson with intent to damage property over the fire at Bawsey Country Park, near King's Lynn, on Sunday.

Families choosing between food and kids' sport,"One rugby club has started a ""boot bank"" to help children whose families are struggling with the cost of living The cost of living crisis is forcing people to choose between doing sport or buying food, according to a new report. One rugby club said it was seeing children stop playing as parents cannot afford boots or petrol for travel. The Senedd's sport committee called for a ""radical rethink"" after finding living costs were preventing participation in disadvantaged areas. The Welsh government said it was committed to ""promoting equal access to sport across the country"". The committee's report said while the Welsh government had ""well intentioned"" commitments, there was not a ""clear and defined approach"" to increasing participation in these areas. Poverty and lifestyle challenges sport 'Poor children lose out on exercise' 'Work needed' to close school sports gap Since forming in 2017, Caerau Ely RFC, in Cardiff, now has more than 150 players in its mini and junior section, attracting children from some of the most deprived areas of the capital. They run a ""boot bank"" where youngsters can exchange boots and have so far given out more than a hundred pairs, but at the moment there are only a few left. Caerau Ely RFC's manager Johanna Cotterrall said sports clubs were important for both children and parents' wellbeing ""I've noticed families with two or more children, they may not be coming because they can't afford to replace two sets of boots,"" said club manager Johanna Cotterrall. ""We have lost a lot of parents over the years to mental health and suicide,"" she added. ""What do you do with those parents who no longer have partners and husbands, but who come here on a Sunday morning to watch the kids with a coffee and see friends? ""And what do you do with those 150 children - there is no other sport in Caerau and Ely that is that cheap."" Ms Cotterrall said she worried about the viability of the club, which has often struggled to access grants that would reduce fees and ease the financial burden on parents. ""If they live on the other side of Ely, they can't afford the petrol. On the flip side, you see children still coming but they haven't got what they need. ""The kids are missing that connection, they're missing fun, they are missing being a child. So they really need to come back and be children."" Ms Cotterrall said children were missing out on ""being children"" due to the rising cost of living The report highlighted other issues like poor transport links, lack of confidence and gender inequality, which it said were also barriers. The committee made 12 recommendations, including: Calling for a ""national approach"" to address the issue, including setting targets to improve access Opening up schools and other community facilities, so people have better access to facilities More funding to address the problem of low participation levels in disadvantaged areas The committee also recommended the Welsh government follow New Zealand insetting up a pilot,externalto offer children funding to cover the costs of equipment, kit and fees. The Welsh government highlighted grants available to children eligible for free school meals for ""school uniform, kit and other equipment"". The grant - increased by Â£100 for this year - will be Â£225 per learner, or Â£300 for those entering Year 7. All children in care will qualify for the grant, regardless of whether or not they are eligible for free school meals. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""Our Programme for Government commits us to investing in sport facilities and promoting equal access to sport across the country. ""We urge the UK government to act now and use their fiscal powers to protect people's incomes at this challenging time. ""We'll consider the report from the Culture, Communication, Welsh Language, Sport, and International Relations Committee in full and respond in due course."" A HM Treasury spokesperson said: ""We know that rising prices caused by global challenges are affecting how far people's incomes go, which is why we have continually taken action to help households by phasing in Â£37bn worth of support throughout the year, which includes specific support to help people through the difficult winter ahead. ""Eight million of the most vulnerable households will see Â£1,200 extra support, provided in instalments across the year, and everyone will receive Â£400 over the winter to help with energy bills. ""That's including a record fuel duty cut and a National Insurance cut worth up to Â£330 a year for the typical employee."" Football Association of Wales chief executive Noel Mooney toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastthat being active was ""good for the body and good for the soul"". ""We don't know all of the stories of a girl or boy that cannot play football today because of the cost of living crisis etcetera but we need to know them,"" he said. He added that the FAW had afund,externalto support young people to get access to regular football opportunities. The Welsh Rugby Union said it ring-fenced around Â£11m a year for the community game, alongside a wide range of initiatives designed to help clubs with energy bills, insurance, kit and boots. It is also runningrugby-themed ""Fit, Fed, Fun"" camps,externalto support children and families throughout Wales over the school holidays.

Memorial call 60 years after camping trip death,"Lisa Stead, pictured with her husband Darrin, wants to honour the boys' bravery with a memorial A call has been made for a memorial to honour the bravery of three boys lost on a camping trip more than 60 years ago in which one died. The trio, aged 16 and 17, were separated from their group while in the Elan Valley in Powys in 1961. One made it to a farm, but rescuers could not save one of his friends. A scout leader now wants a memorial for the boys, who were from Birmingham on an expedition for their Duke of Edinburgh's Gold Award. On 25 February 1961, the 20 schoolboys arrived in mid Wales for what should have been the adventure of a lifetime. They were on the hills above the Elan Valley but, two days later, three of them failed to make their train home. Rescued climbers 'inexperienced' Tragedy that led to formation of mountain rescue group Rescuers question what3words' use in emergencies One of the boys died, and another would be in a coma for several months. They were members of the Birmingham Stonehouse Gang, a youth organisation which survives to this day. Lisa Stead, who runs an Explorer Scout group in Llanidloes, Powys, is determined to establish a permanent memorial to them. ""I first heard about the Birmingham boys when a group of my own teenagers, Explorer Scouts, were camping on Elan Valley farmer Tony Davies's land a few years ago,"" she said. The boys were on the hills above the Elan Valley for their Duke of Edinburgh's Gold Award She explained that one of her group developed sunstroke and was taken in by Mr Davies to ensure that he was safe. She added: ""He went on to tell me about a previous time there had been a Duke of Edinburgh expedition on their land."" The three boys failed to show up for their return train journey home On the snowy morning of 27 February 1961, the alarm was raised by the Rhayader train station master. Three of the boys had failed to return, and soon afterwards the entire community set out to look for them. Michael Grindod, one of the missing boys, stumbled into the yard of Henfron Farm, where Richard Davies, grandfather of Tony Davies - the current farmer - was tending his livestock, Michael asked for directions to Rhayader and told Richard Davies that his two companions, Brian Harris and Ray Guyatt, were further up the valley and needed urgent help. Although it was four years before Tony Davies was born, from the stories his family told him, the rescue was all-encompassing. ""Local farmers and the staff of the water company went out, and there were even those who got on 250cc motorbikes to search,"" he said. ""My father, Beynon Davies, walked up the hill with Sgt Brooks from the local police."" Michael and Brian survived the ordeal, but Ray did not. Brian later fell into a coma and Michael was relatively unharmed. ""They found Brian in a tent adjacent to a small shed on the hill. ""Sgt Brooks and my father followed footsteps in the snow and found Ray's body further up the mountain."" Farmers Richard and Beynon Davies helped in the rescue effort Ray had been walking around in circles, Tony Davies explained. His father Beynon took a tractor to the boy. ""A gate was removed from Blaen Methan shed and used as a stretcher to carry the body down to the tractor and trailer. ""The body was taken down on the trailer to the road to meet the undertaker."" At the subsequent inquest, Radnorshire coroner HF Ludford said: ""There is no light on why this party and this one only was attacked by fatigue. The boys should have kept together."" Mr Ludford said the boys were ""dogged by misfortune and calamity throughout that day"". The coroner continued: ""He knew that Brian Harris and Michael Grindod were left alone in the hills with the night coming on. ""He did what he thought was his duty. He was a keen boy and he went on and he failed."" But Tony Davies disagrees with the coroner's opinion: ""From what my father told me, the boys were very brave. ""It is hard to believe that they were left to camp on the exposed areas of the Elan Valley in February. ""When the three boys failed to return back to Rhayader on the Sunday night, the leaders took the rest of the group back to Birmingham on the train, leaving instructions with the station master to tell the three boys to catch the next train when they turned up."" Mr Davies said the ""group leaders failed in their duty, the search should have started the previous evening"". Ms Stead said there should be ""a tribute to the bravery of the boys, and to honour their efforts to help each other at a perilous time"". She hopes the Elan Valley Estate and Duke of Edinburgh's Award programme will support her efforts. She added: ""Young people on Duke of Edinburgh expeditions today would have better support systems in place to avoid such tragedy. ""The friendship, courage and efforts of Ray, Brian and Michael to support each other needs recognition."" Lisa is hoping to establish a standing stone in their memory, or perhaps a tree whose ""enduring survival"" in such harsh conditions will ""serve as a fitting memorial to their bravery"". The Duke of Edinburgh's Award and the Stonehouse Gang said they did not want to comment.

Syed AnwarBBC Afghan Service I was in the BBC bureau earlier than usual that morning, and in some ways it felt like a normal news day - assigning stories, chatting with colleagues. But by mid-morning, the atmosphere began to change as it became clear the government was indeed about to fall. I received a call from my son, who worked in the finance ministry, and he told me his colleagues were fleeing the office - there were rumours the Taliban had reached the gates of Kabul. When I left the BBC building a short time later - a place I had worked for so many years - I had a sense I might never return. By the time I got home, dozens of scenarios were playing through my mind about how my familyâs life might be about to change. Two days later, at midnight, we were offered places on an evacuation flight and asked to provide a list of dependents under 18 who could join us. The deadline was tight but the decision felt enormous - leave our homeland and be forced into exile, or stay, and not know what might happen. When I used to travel abroad, it was always a happy moment, but this time, everyone was in pieces. The family elders were the most upset, saying it could be our last meeting. But saying goodbye was the only option. Reaching the airport was tremendously difficult, and getting through the desperate crowds of thousands felt extremely dangerous. My elder son could not join us, being over 18, which has not been easy. But I am so glad my younger daughters have been able to continue their education in the UK. Starting from scratch in a new society and country is not easy, but knowing that they have a better future gives us hope. George WrightBBC News Zahra Fayazi managed to escape Kabul as the city was falling to the Taliban. An interpreter for the UK government and a coach of the national womenâs volleyball team, Fayazi was in more danger than most. Last time I spoke with Fayazishe was living in a hotel in London, but she now has her own house in Rugby in England. There are nearly 10,000 Afghans still in hotels across the UK. Fayazi recalls watching her homeland disappear from view from the plane a year ago. âI was sure that I would miss it a lot but it was a situation that everyone had to cope with,â she says. Fayazi says she has settled into life in Rugby and soon started playing volleyball again with a local team. âI feel happy to be able to play again in a peaceful area with no fear, restrictions or limitations,â she says. Itâs in stark contrast to the lives of the majority of Afghan female volleyball players who are still in Afghanistan. âFor one year they have not been allowed to do any sport,â she says. âOur players told me that some gymnasiums where they used to play were investigated by the Taliban, asking for the girlsâ contact numbers, their addresses.â Looking to the future, Fayazi says she wants to âserve my new communityâ in the UK, adding that returning to her homeland any time soon seems âimpossibleâ. âBut I hope Afghanistan sees peace again and Afghan women have freedom and rights to education, sports and work,â she says. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Naren Patel says itâs good to see people opening their hearts and homes to Ukrainian refugees but asks: was the same offered to refugees from Afghanistan? No scheme similar to the Homes for Ukraine programme - where people in the UK could welcome Ukrainian refugees into their own homes - was set up in the UK for Afghans. The UK government has been heavily criticised for the slow speed and clumsiness with which it has attempted to process the thousands of deserving Afghan applicants for asylum. Around 15,000 were evacuated in August 2021 under Operation Pitting (compared to over 113,000 by the US) and the UK government has budgeted for 20,000 Afghan refugees to come to Britain over five years. Many though, are taking matters into their own hands with over 1,000 arriving illegally in boats across the Channel in the first quarter of 2022, the highest proportion of any nationality. You can read more about the schemes for Ukrainianshereand for Afghanshere. Secunder KermaniReporting from Kandahar The Hazara community is Afghanistan's third largest ethnic group. Alongside other adherents of Shia Islam, they have faced persecution from the Taliban. Matthew Whitton in Japan says he isconcerned about the Hazaras' current status and condition. Is the Taliban undertaking a more'circumspect'route this time to again inflict torment and murder upon the Hazaras? Afghanistanâs Hazara ethnic minority follows the Shia sect of Islam. Hazaras have long been discriminated against in Afghanistan both on the basis of their ethnicity and their religion. The Taliban, which is dominated by the Pashtun ethnicity, has been accused of forcibly expelling some Hazara communities from villages in a number of provinces â in favour of local communities who have been pro-Taliban. Hazaras have generally also been much more in favour of girls' education and women working outside the home, so theyâve been affected by new Taliban rules in those fields too. However, the violence the Hazaras are currently facing predominantly comes from the Islamic State (IS) group, which has for years targeted the community in deadly suicide bombings. The Taliban are fighting against IS, though like the previous Afghan government they at times face criticism for failing to prevent attacks. Frank GardnerSecurity Correspondent Barbara Adolph, in London, asks:Should the UK recognise the Taliban government and try to work with the more moderate elements within it? Would this make things worse or better for Afghan women? You correctly point out, Barbara, that the Taliban is not monolithic, ie there are both moderate and hardline elements within its ranks. A lot of people were hoping that 'Taliban 2.0', this second period of Taliban rule, would be a lot less harsh and a lot more pragmatic than the first one from 1996-2001. The Taliban negotiators who spent months living in Qatar during the peace talks with the US before the fall of Kabul had a chance to see a totally different world to the rugged land of the insurgency they were fighting in back home. They took their wives shopping in air-conditioned malls and enjoyed a high standard of living. It was hoped they would have a moderating influence on the rest of the Taliban. But one year on, it's clear that hardline clerics are resisting letting girls return to secondary school or performing any sizeable role in public life, despite the pledges made last year by their spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Quietly, behind the scenes, there are some contacts going on between the West and some Taliban officials, especially on counter-terrorism since the Taliban are now facing their own insurgency problem from the islamic State group. George WrightBBC News There has been no official female sport under Taliban rule One year ago, I spoke to members of the Afghan women's cricket teamwho were in hiding from the Taliban. ""We are all hopeless,"" one of the team, Asel, told me from Kabul. Asel isn't her real name. She was using a pseudonym then and wants to continue as she still has family in Afghanistan. But life has improved a lot for Asel. She managed to escape to Pakistan in October and flew to Australia two weeks later, where the entire squad now lives. ""The border was very tough. We passed the Taliban checkpoints one by one, covering our faces so they couldnât recognise us,"" she says. While some of the team have found life in Australia easier than others, Asel is adapting well. She has also been relishing the chance to freely play the sport she loves again. The team have been training together once a week and playing indoor matches due to it being winter. ""To play cricket here is a lot easier. Itâs very easy for girls because back in our country you are not allowed to play,"" Asel says. However, the Afghanistan Cricket Board has not allowed them to represent the country officially. ""Everyone wants a team under the name Afghanistan but thatâs not possible under the current situation. We are trying to build our careers individually, if itâs possible for us. ""But Iâm so good here. The people are very kind."" Yogita LimayeReporting from Kabul Adam Nemeth, in Hungary, says:I heard that women can't leave their home without a male relative and generally they can't go to work. But could they work and study remotely? Some women and girls are pursuing online education. But this is limited to a small number who can afford gadgets like mobile phones and tablets, and a steady internet connection. The vast majority of Afghans don't fall into this category. The UN has said there could be near universal poverty in Afghanistan by next year because of the economic crisis triggered by the stopping of foreign funds which were being given to the Afghan government. So spending money on online education is a luxury that is simply out of reach for most people. Hameed ShujaBBC Afghan Service The Taliban constantly play down the existence of any armed opposition to them but over the past year there have been multiple independent reports of clashes in parts of central and northern Afghanistan between them and groups opposed to their rule. The current resistance against the Taliban operate in small pockets. The âNational Resistance Frontâ (NRF) and the âAfghanistan Freedom Front"" have accepted responsibility for many recent attacks targeting Taliban forces. Ahmad Massoud, son of the late guerilla commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, whose forces resisted the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s, leads the NRF. He is said to be based in Tajikistan but recently told the BBC he has around 3,000 armed fighters inside Afghanistan. That claim is difficult to verify and the Taliban brush off questions about their existence. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Former Taliban fighters - seen here with their weapons - now face an insurgency from the Islamic State group Over the past few hours, our correspondents have been answering your questions about the situation in Afghanistan. We asked Frank whether the return of the Taliban has meant international terrorist groups are able to re-establish themselves in the country.No, and yes, is the awkward answer. Part of the Doha Agreement negotiated in February 2020 between the US and the Taliban was that if US forces withdrew from the country then the Taliban would not allow their old allies al-Qaida to re-establish their presence in the country. This was, of course, the whole reason why the US and its allies went into Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 - to close down al-Qaidaâs bases and overthrow the Taliban government that had given them sanctuary. This week the White House has released a partly redacted US intelligence assessment that concludes that al-Qaida has not so far reconstituted its presence in Afghanistan and less than a dozen of its leaders are hiding there. This is despite the CIA locating the fugitive al-Qaida leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, hiding out in a safe house in a part of Kabul close to Taliban leaders, and killing him with a drone strike in early August. Ironically, after 20 years of being the insurgents, it is now the Taliban government that faces its own insurgency from its rival, the Islamic State group. Members of this ultra hardline and pathologically violent group have carried out a number of terrorist attacks aimed at undermining Taliban rule. This gives Western counter-terrorism officials an opportunity to make common cause with the Taliban to help them confront this threat. Afghans have been in ""survival mode"" for the past year, the UN secretary general's deputy special representative for Afghanistan says. Ramiz Alakbarov tells the BBC around 19 million Afghans are experiencing malnutrition and half of the countryâs population is in constant need of support for nutritional or basic essential needs. Alakbarov says womenâs rights are ânon-negotiableâ and âessential to the resolution of the crisis in Afghanistanâ. He says: ""Letâs face it, today the aid sector of Afghanistan could have benefited from much stronger support from the international community. It is not having the same level of support."" We've just had an update on the explosion which occurred earlier in Kabul. One person is now known to have been killed and ten people were injured, according to Emergency, an international healthcare organisation operating in the area. Explosives were reportedly planted in a wheelbarrow in front of a hotel in District 3, to the west of the city centre. Security forces have started an investigation into the incident. Secunder KermaniReporting from Kandahar Nick Gliddon, 51, in Staffordshire in the UK asks what the Taliban say and think about the exodus of so many talented Afghans from the country. The Taliban have been trying to encourage business figures, and even those linked to the previous government, to return. They see their takeover as a chance to rebuild Afghanistan. Most educated Afghans you meet who are still in the country, however, are looking for a way out. Visas are hard to come by, but the closure of most girlsâ secondary schools, along with the economic crisis mean many families no longer see a future for themselves in Afghanistan. Some are determined to stay and try to help improve the situation, but few are optimistic. Let's hear more voices from Afghanistan as people share their experiences of life under the Taliban with the BBC's Afghan service. Faroughfrom Mazar-i-Sharif says: ""The Taliban brought poverty, fear, and threat to our country. ""Over the past year,
we have become destitute. We lost our freedom of speech and education. It's the
darkest part of our history so far... People are very disappointed and hopeless
about their future. All hopes we had from the international community have now
turned into disappointment."" Walifrom Kabul says that Afghans have had ""a terrible year. All I remember from the past couple of months are bad
memories. ""I am a disabled person, and I used to receive money from the
government, which has been stopped. I am now poor and begging in the streets.
Afghanistan used to have a vibrant economy with ongoing businesses. They are
all gone. We are left wounded by our neighbours and also by the
international community."" ""Before lots of people, especially farmers, got wounded and killed, lots of shopkeepers were shot,"" said Gul Mohammad, a tailor in the village of Padkhwab in Logar Province, south east of Kabul one year on from the Talibanâs takeover. The BBCâs Secunder Kermani visited the village on the front line not long after the Taliban assumed power last year. At the time, residents were eager to show him the signs of a war that until a few weeks ago had overshadowed their lives in the village. Almost a year later, residents still expressed gratitude for the improvements to security. But sharp rises to the cost of everyday products and the lack of work have become common complaints. ""People can't afford flour, let alone meat or fruit,"" said Mohammad. Other village residents say they are grateful for better security. Tile-maker Samiullah, for instance, said that ""it's true there was more money back then [before the Taliban took over], but we faced a lot of oppression,"" referring to the presence of Afghan government troops in the village who he accuses of harassing people. Many others, however, feel the country they helped build is disappearing in front of their eyes, and they're deeply concerned about what it's being replaced with. Read morehere. Frank GardnerSecurity Correspondent We asked Frank about the recent killing of the al-Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, by a US drone. Didnât the Taliban pledge not to give safe haven to terrorists? Why, then, would al-Zawahiri be living in the heart of the capital? Itâs true that the Taliban gave a solemn pledge not to provide a safe haven for international terrorist groups like al-Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State group. The fact that the AQ leader was found to be living in some comfort in an upmarket villa in Kabul, close to Taliban leaders, would certainly imply the Taliban broke that pledge. The Taliban is divided when it comes to al-Qaeda. Some of its more outward-looking officials, especially those who took part in peace talks with the US in Doha in 2020, want a complete break with AQ. But others from the so-called Haqqani network have close historical and even marital ties with AQ and apparently have no intention of severing their ties. Hence the US seems to have taken matters into its own hands and killed the AQ leader when it saw an opportunity. The White House has just released highlights of an intelligence assessment which concludes that although a small number of AQ leaders remain in Afghanistan, the group has not been able to rebuild its presence and lacks the ability to carry out international attacks. Ayman al-Zawahiri (right) is pictured here with Osama Bin Laden, the former al-Qaeda leader who was killed by US forces in 2011 Barbara Plett UsherUS State Department Correspondent There were desperate scenes at Kabul airport in the final days of US troops' withdrawal In the United States the anniversary of the Taliban takeover of Kabul is mired in competing political narratives. A Republican-led congressional report criticises what it says was a lack of planning for the military withdrawal. It also purports to show how the administration overrode the advice of US commanders and disregarded the Talibanâs violations of the 2020 pull-out deal. It says President Joe Bidenâs decision to remove all US troops has endangered the US. The White House has hit back with a detailed takedown of each point. It places much of the blame on the âflawedâ deal that former president Donald Trump struck with the Taliban. And it trumpets the successful strike against al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul last month as evidence the US can fight terrorists without boots on the ground. But for those Americans who fought and worked in Afghanistan this is not an academic debate. There is a heavy sense of personal failure: failure to rescue American partners during the chaotic evacuation, and to deliver on promises of building lasting, democratic and inclusive institutions. There is also soul-searching among military analysts about the 20-year US mission. Some say it should have focused on counter terrorism against al-Qaeda and not made the Taliban the enemy. Secunder KermaniReporting from Kandahar Khashayar Datoo asks whether there are manyunderground schools for women or are they too afraid to attend? And are people still rejecting the Taliban or have some come to accept their presence as a compromise? There are âsecret schoolsâ that have been created, particularly in the capital Kabul. I visited one earlier this year and you canread a bit more about it here. There are also tuition centres that are operating fairly openly and teaching girls and young women. There is fear, but there are also women determined to try to build futures for themselves. Thatâs why weâve also seen frequent, if small, protests by women in Kabul, despite the threat of arrest. Itâs also important to note that girlsâ primary schools are still continuing, and women who were already in university have been allowed to continue their studies - but the continued closure of most girlsâ secondary schools has led to an outpouring of national grief. There are some small bands of guerrilla fighters who have been clashing with the Taliban in some northern parts of the country, but overall thereâs a recognition that thereâs no realistic alternative to the Taliban at the moment. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Payvand Seyedali wasan education consultant working for foreign NGOs in Kabul last year, when the city fell to
the Taliban. She had lived and worked there for 10 years, and decided to stay. Today she is still in Kabul and still working in the education sector. Whereas last year, it wasn't clear what would happen under the new government, she says now ""everyone is trying to make ends meet, to not starve, to hold on to shreds
of hope for their children. People want jobs, they want education, they want
rights - these needs are not political"". She says with people in urban areas, desperation is visible ""at a level of intensity Iâve never seen before"".
More children are working than ever, and only a few women can be seen outside the home, she adds. And those who are, whether they are afraid or defiant - [are] always hyperaware of what theyâre wearing, who they are with, how theyâre perceived. Being a woman outside the home is extremely uncomfortable, and forces many into self-censoring. This is not new, but itâs much worse than before."" Payvand Seyedali, Education consultant When it comes to girls' education, hopes have been dashed too. On 23 March this year, when girls in secondary education were due to go back, ""over a million girls woke up, ate their breakfasts, put on clothes theyâd set out the night before. That morning was filled with hope. The Taliban had a chance, that day, to turn sentiment in their favour. ""Instead, every school girl in the country above grade five was ordered away by a sudden decree... Secret schools are popping up, local governors and even individual public schools are taking autonomous decisions to reopen. Teachers are organising."" But a year of closures means more girls will have got
married early, become pregnant or died in childbirth, she observes. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

We asked Frank whether the return of the Taliban has meant international terrorist groups are able to re-establish themselves in the country.No, and yes, is the awkward answer. Part of the Doha Agreement negotiated in February 2020 between the US and the Taliban was that if US forces withdrew from the country then the Taliban would not allow their old allies al-Qaida to re-establish their presence in the country. This was, of course, the whole reason why the US and its allies went into Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 - to close down al-Qaidaâs bases and overthrow the Taliban government that had given them sanctuary. This week the White House has released a partly redacted US intelligence assessment that concludes that al-Qaida has not so far reconstituted its presence in Afghanistan and less than a dozen of its leaders are hiding there. This is despite the CIA locating the fugitive al-Qaida leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, hiding out in a safe house in a part of Kabul close to Taliban leaders, and killing him with a drone strike in early August. Ironically, after 20 years of being the insurgents, it is now the Taliban government that faces its own insurgency from its rival, the Islamic State group. Members of this ultra hardline and pathologically violent group have carried out a number of terrorist attacks aimed at undermining Taliban rule. This gives Western counter-terrorism officials an opportunity to make common cause with the Taliban to help them confront this threat. Afghans have been in ""survival mode"" for the past year, the UN secretary general's deputy special representative for Afghanistan says. Ramiz Alakbarov tells the BBC around 19 million Afghans are experiencing malnutrition and half of the countryâs population is in constant need of support for nutritional or basic essential needs. Alakbarov says womenâs rights are ânon-negotiableâ and âessential to the resolution of the crisis in Afghanistanâ. He says: ""Letâs face it, today the aid sector of Afghanistan could have benefited from much stronger support from the international community. It is not having the same level of support."" We've just had an update on the explosion which occurred earlier in Kabul. One person is now known to have been killed and ten people were injured, according to Emergency, an international healthcare organisation operating in the area. Explosives were reportedly planted in a wheelbarrow in front of a hotel in District 3, to the west of the city centre. Security forces have started an investigation into the incident. Secunder KermaniReporting from Kandahar Nick Gliddon, 51, in Staffordshire in the UK asks what the Taliban say and think about the exodus of so many talented Afghans from the country. The Taliban have been trying to encourage business figures, and even those linked to the previous government, to return. They see their takeover as a chance to rebuild Afghanistan. Most educated Afghans you meet who are still in the country, however, are looking for a way out. Visas are hard to come by, but the closure of most girlsâ secondary schools, along with the economic crisis mean many families no longer see a future for themselves in Afghanistan. Some are determined to stay and try to help improve the situation, but few are optimistic. Let's hear more voices from Afghanistan as people share their experiences of life under the Taliban with the BBC's Afghan service. Faroughfrom Mazar-i-Sharif says: ""The Taliban brought poverty, fear, and threat to our country. ""Over the past year,
we have become destitute. We lost our freedom of speech and education. It's the
darkest part of our history so far... People are very disappointed and hopeless
about their future. All hopes we had from the international community have now
turned into disappointment."" Walifrom Kabul says that Afghans have had ""a terrible year. All I remember from the past couple of months are bad
memories. ""I am a disabled person, and I used to receive money from the
government, which has been stopped. I am now poor and begging in the streets.
Afghanistan used to have a vibrant economy with ongoing businesses. They are
all gone. We are left wounded by our neighbours and also by the
international community."" ""Before lots of people, especially farmers, got wounded and killed, lots of shopkeepers were shot,"" said Gul Mohammad, a tailor in the village of Padkhwab in Logar Province, south east of Kabul one year on from the Talibanâs takeover. The BBCâs Secunder Kermani visited the village on the front line not long after the Taliban assumed power last year. At the time, residents were eager to show him the signs of a war that until a few weeks ago had overshadowed their lives in the village. Almost a year later, residents still expressed gratitude for the improvements to security. But sharp rises to the cost of everyday products and the lack of work have become common complaints. ""People can't afford flour, let alone meat or fruit,"" said Mohammad. Other village residents say they are grateful for better security. Tile-maker Samiullah, for instance, said that ""it's true there was more money back then [before the Taliban took over], but we faced a lot of oppression,"" referring to the presence of Afghan government troops in the village who he accuses of harassing people. Many others, however, feel the country they helped build is disappearing in front of their eyes, and they're deeply concerned about what it's being replaced with. Read morehere. Frank GardnerSecurity Correspondent We asked Frank about the recent killing of the al-Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, by a US drone. Didnât the Taliban pledge not to give safe haven to terrorists? Why, then, would al-Zawahiri be living in the heart of the capital? Itâs true that the Taliban gave a solemn pledge not to provide a safe haven for international terrorist groups like al-Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State group. The fact that the AQ leader was found to be living in some comfort in an upmarket villa in Kabul, close to Taliban leaders, would certainly imply the Taliban broke that pledge. The Taliban is divided when it comes to al-Qaeda. Some of its more outward-looking officials, especially those who took part in peace talks with the US in Doha in 2020, want a complete break with AQ. But others from the so-called Haqqani network have close historical and even marital ties with AQ and apparently have no intention of severing their ties. Hence the US seems to have taken matters into its own hands and killed the AQ leader when it saw an opportunity. The White House has just released highlights of an intelligence assessment which concludes that although a small number of AQ leaders remain in Afghanistan, the group has not been able to rebuild its presence and lacks the ability to carry out international attacks. Ayman al-Zawahiri (right) is pictured here with Osama Bin Laden, the former al-Qaeda leader who was killed by US forces in 2011 Barbara Plett UsherUS State Department Correspondent There were desperate scenes at Kabul airport in the final days of US troops' withdrawal In the United States the anniversary of the Taliban takeover of Kabul is mired in competing political narratives. A Republican-led congressional report criticises what it says was a lack of planning for the military withdrawal. It also purports to show how the administration overrode the advice of US commanders and disregarded the Talibanâs violations of the 2020 pull-out deal. It says President Joe Bidenâs decision to remove all US troops has endangered the US. The White House has hit back with a detailed takedown of each point. It places much of the blame on the âflawedâ deal that former president Donald Trump struck with the Taliban. And it trumpets the successful strike against al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul last month as evidence the US can fight terrorists without boots on the ground. But for those Americans who fought and worked in Afghanistan this is not an academic debate. There is a heavy sense of personal failure: failure to rescue American partners during the chaotic evacuation, and to deliver on promises of building lasting, democratic and inclusive institutions. There is also soul-searching among military analysts about the 20-year US mission. Some say it should have focused on counter terrorism against al-Qaeda and not made the Taliban the enemy. Secunder KermaniReporting from Kandahar Khashayar Datoo asks whether there are manyunderground schools for women or are they too afraid to attend? And are people still rejecting the Taliban or have some come to accept their presence as a compromise? There are âsecret schoolsâ that have been created, particularly in the capital Kabul. I visited one earlier this year and you canread a bit more about it here. There are also tuition centres that are operating fairly openly and teaching girls and young women. There is fear, but there are also women determined to try to build futures for themselves. Thatâs why weâve also seen frequent, if small, protests by women in Kabul, despite the threat of arrest. Itâs also important to note that girlsâ primary schools are still continuing, and women who were already in university have been allowed to continue their studies - but the continued closure of most girlsâ secondary schools has led to an outpouring of national grief. There are some small bands of guerrilla fighters who have been clashing with the Taliban in some northern parts of the country, but overall thereâs a recognition that thereâs no realistic alternative to the Taliban at the moment. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Payvand Seyedali wasan education consultant working for foreign NGOs in Kabul last year, when the city fell to
the Taliban. She had lived and worked there for 10 years, and decided to stay. Today she is still in Kabul and still working in the education sector. Whereas last year, it wasn't clear what would happen under the new government, she says now ""everyone is trying to make ends meet, to not starve, to hold on to shreds
of hope for their children. People want jobs, they want education, they want
rights - these needs are not political"". She says with people in urban areas, desperation is visible ""at a level of intensity Iâve never seen before"".
More children are working than ever, and only a few women can be seen outside the home, she adds. And those who are, whether they are afraid or defiant - [are] always hyperaware of what theyâre wearing, who they are with, how theyâre perceived. Being a woman outside the home is extremely uncomfortable, and forces many into self-censoring. This is not new, but itâs much worse than before."" Payvand Seyedali, Education consultant When it comes to girls' education, hopes have been dashed too. On 23 March this year, when girls in secondary education were due to go back, ""over a million girls woke up, ate their breakfasts, put on clothes theyâd set out the night before. That morning was filled with hope. The Taliban had a chance, that day, to turn sentiment in their favour. ""Instead, every school girl in the country above grade five was ordered away by a sudden decree... Secret schools are popping up, local governors and even individual public schools are taking autonomous decisions to reopen. Teachers are organising."" But a year of closures means more girls will have got
married early, become pregnant or died in childbirth, she observes. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

The prime minister - who was criticised for taking a holiday earlier this month amid growing economic turmoil - is now on another break. It comes as removal vans were spotted in Downing Street earlier on Monday. The PM's spokesman confirmed Mr Johnson would return from holiday at the weekend, when he will have two weeks to move out of his No 10 flat. The prime minister, who was forced to announce his departure in July after a cabinet mutiny, will officially stand down on 6 September.

Labour vows to freeze fuel bills with windfall tax What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? It was reported over the weekend that Mr Johnson is spending a week in Greece, with locals spotting him shopping alongside wife Carrie in a supermarket in Nea Makri, a town to the east of Athens. Asked if his holiday could have waited a few weeks, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""I can't get into the decision around timings but he is on leave this week. He will be back this weekend."" The spokesman told reporters Mr Johnson had paid for his own holiday and would be kept informed of any pressing government business while away. He added: ""If there were urgent decisions that required the PM's input he will, of course, be involved in that. ""But the deputy prime minister [Dominic Raab] is able to be deputised for meetings should they come up but as far as I'm aware there are no such meetings currently scheduled.

A spokesperson said: ""On the evidence of the last few months it seems to make little difference if the prime minister is in the office or on holiday as he has continually failed to meet the challenge of the Tory cost-of-living crisis. ""It's all just one big party for Boris Johnson while the country struggles to pay their bills."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer recently got back from his own summer holiday, in Mallorca, amid criticism he has also been missing in action during the cost of living crisis. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I've got a very important job as leader of the Labour Party, leader of the Opposition, but I've also got another job that's really important and that is I'm a dad and I'm not going to apologise for going on holiday with my wife and kids.

"NI Secretary ""would meet Noah Donohoe family""","The teenager was found dead in a north Belfast storm drain in June 2020 Northern Ireland Secretary Shailesh Vara has said he is prepared to meet the family of Noah Donohoe over concerns about information relating to the teenager's death. Last week, a law firm representing the family said it had ""grave concerns"" over an application to withhold information in police files. The 14-year-old was found dead in astorm drain in north Belfast in 2020. A Public Interest Immunity (PII) certificate was signed by Mr Vara. The use of a PII certificate is opposed by Fiona Donohoe, Noah's mother, who believes it is an attempt to cover up the circumstances of her son's death. The PSNI has ruled out foul play. Private hearing set before Noah Donohoe inquest Thousands at Belfast Noah Donohoe protest Speaking on Monday, Mr Vara said the whole community's thoughts were with Noah Donohoe's family. ""I did it after very careful consideration, I looked at the files in detail - I can give an assurance - not withstanding redactionsâ¦ that there is nothing that would impact on the substance of the case concerning the sad passing of Noah. ""I'm more than happy to meet his family to try and explain to Noah's mother where I'm coming from."" This video can not be played Mr Vara said he was prepared to meet Noah Donahoe's family Mr Vara also said he did not want to have to cut the salaries of MLAs as a result of the executive at Stormont not being in place. The secretary of state is obliged to call another election if power-sharing is not restored by 28 October, however he could put in place legislation to delay a fresh poll as has happened during previous periods of stalemate. Stormont has been without a power-sharing executive since February, after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) pulled its first minister out of government in protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? An election was held in May andthe DUP was returned as the second-largest party, but it is refusing to return to government until post-Brexit trading arrangements are changed. Stormont ministers are allowed to stay in post for six months after an election to give time for any stand-offs to be resolved, before another poll is called. ""The fact is I'm hoping that it doesn't come to this stage that there is the need to cut salaries, I want the assembly up and running,"" said Mr Vara. ""I know the people of Northern Ireland won't want another election.. what is right is for politicians to do what they're supposed to do and serve the people,"" he added. ""I'm not thinking about what I may or may not do at the end of October."" Sinn Fein's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill told the Financial Times she has no confidence that Mr Vara intends to call fresh assembly elections if the power-sharing institutions are not restored by the end of October. ""These are people who continually find ways to go around the law,"" she said. Mr Vara responded to her comments by saying he was ""sorry that Michelle takes that view of me"". ""I have spoken to her on a couple of occasions and I certainly haven't indicated to her anything about what I would or would not do at the end of October,"" he said. ""Be in no doubt, the law is clear, right now as the law stands I will have to call an election at the end of October if we don't get an executive up and running. ""I very much hope that we don't get to that stage because I know the people of Northern Ireland won't want an election just before Christmasâ¦ people just want to get on with their lives,"" Mr Vara added. Mr Vara also urged political parties at Stormont to help people who are struggling to pay energy bills by restoring Stormont's devolved government. ""Right now we have Â£437 million that is just waiting to be spent and we have people in Northern Ireland who are suffering as much as anywhere else in the UK,"" he said. ""There are rising energy costs, there is an issue of the rising cost of living and we still have an assembly that is not sitting.""

Foster costs 'horrific' as allowance delay goes on,"Some foster carers are experiencing ""horrific"" money issues as they continue to wait for extra financial support that was expected in April. More than 3,000 households are thought to be affected by the hold-up. The Department of Health, which is responsible for allowances, said the delay was due to ongoing uncertainty this financial year. An annual review and increase in line with inflation is required by UK national standards. One foster carer told BBC News NI that the costs, which included items such as school uniforms as well as activities and therapies to meet the wellbeing needs of the children, were ""horrific"". There are more than 3,000 foster care families in Northern Ireland, with an increase of about 1,000 children requiring care here in the last 10 years. Carers receive a weekly allowance, which is intended to cover the costs of food, clothes, toiletries and other expenses occurred when looking after a foster child. While the cost of living, driven by inflation, continues to rise, foster carers are already the subject of higher childcare costs. Research commissioned by the Welsh government in 2010,externalsaid there was ""overwhelming evidence"" that it was more expensive to look after foster children compared with birth children, with studies cited in the report indicating the costs to be about 50% greater. That was often down to issues like extra household insurance costs, greater energy bills and additional fuel needed to run a car so the children could go to school or get to medical appointments. Carers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland receive national minimum allowance rates. Looked after children often come with complex needs and additional expenses For a child between five and 10, a foster carer in Northern Irelandreceives a minimum weekly allowance of Â£150.18,external. However, in Wales the same child is allocated Â£183 while in Englandthe rate is Â£156 to Â£181 depending on where the child lives,external. In the Republic of Ireland, the payment isâ¬325 (Â£275) for a child under the age of 12,external. A spokesperson for the Foster Care Workers Union said that allowances have been ""consistently lower"" in Northern Ireland than other parts of the UK and Ireland for over a decade. ""Foster carers have consistently articulated those allowances do not meet the full costs of caring for children,"" they said. ""We expected 2022-23 allowances to be ready for the end of June, then they slipped to mid-July. ""We are now four months into the financial year without an announcement on what the new foster care allowance rates will be."" BBC News NI spoke to two foster carers, who wished to retain their anonymity to protect the identities of the children they care for. One carer from Newtownabbey, County Antrim, described the costs as horrific. She said some of her children have trauma and flashbacks, requiring regular counselling and therapy - those issues can create unexpected extra costs. ""One of my boys can't use public transport, for example, it's too overwhelming so I drive him everywhere,"" she explained, adding that he needs to socialise in order to ""build up self-esteem"". That need involves extra expenditure to take part in sports and other activities not fully covered by foster care allowances. School uniforms and the pressure for designer labels have seen clothing costs soar Clothing can also be challenging, with soaring uniform costs and the pressure to keep up with designer brands popular with teenagers. ""You can't send the kids out looking any different to any other child, they already feel different, you have no choice but to buy the big brands,"" she added. For this carer, those expenses, driven by a cost-of-living crisis, are causing even more anxiety as her foster children approach adulthood. ""None of my young people will be returning home so where do they go when their time is up here? I intend on keeping them. ""I never expected to have to put a young person through university but that's the position I am in now, if things go to plan. ""The trust will pay their fees but I will have to find the money for everything else. ""Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining. I want my young people to do the best they can and I choose to support them."" Another carer currently looking after teenagers and a baby agreed that additional help is needed. ""It's not about they money - I care very passionately about every child that comes through my door,"" she said. ""I have children that sleep with the lights onâ¦ constant electric, internet and heating."" The Department for Health said it recognised that financial support for foster carers is critical in enabling them to carry out the essential role they perform and that it was ""committed to ensuring that carers receive notification of the rates payable to them as soon as possible"". The department highlighted ""budgetary challenges and uncertainty this financial year"" that have presented ""additional difficulties and delays"", which have affected some usual annual processes, including foster care allowances. NI finance minister's warning over lack of budget Swann warns delay 'sabotages health service' Political crisis halts plans for three-year budget ""The process for reviewing and updating foster care allowance rates for 2022-23 is now nearing completion, and revised rates will be issued as soon as these are agreed,"" said the department in a statement. ""It is expected that revised rates will be confirmed in the coming weeks and that the Health and Social Care trusts will then implement the increased rates which will be backdated to 1 April 2022.""

Labour vows to freeze fuel bills with windfall tax,"This video can not be played Watch: I'm not going to apologise for holiday with my wife and kids - Starmer Sir Keir Starmer has said families would ""not pay a penny more"" on their energy bills this winter under Labour's plans to tackle rising living costs. The Labour leader claimed his proposals would save the average household Â£1,000. The package would be paid for, in part, by a big increase in tax on oil and gas company profits. But economists said the plan would cost as much as the Covid furlough scheme, if it was extended beyond this winter. The government has already announcedwhat is says is Â£37bnof support for hard-pressed families, but it is under pressure to do more, with bills set to rocket over the winter. Outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide extra support, when they take office on 5 September. How high will my energy bill go? How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? How will I get the cost-of-living payments? The Treasury are working up ideas for how the new prime minister could provide more help with living costs. But the two contenders for the job, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have indicated they are not keen on extending the windfall tax on oil and gas companies - or freezing the price cap - meaning its unlikely to happen unless they have a change of heart. Labour's intervention serves as a challenge to both leadership hopefuls to say what further support they may offer, and how they would pay for it. The party says its plan would be paid for in three ways: Backdating the windfall tax to January and accounting for higher oil and gas prices to raiseÂ£8bn Dropping the Â£400 energy rebate and other pledges made by Tory leadership candidates to raiseÂ£14bn By reducing inflation with lower energy bills, leading to a cut in government debt interest payments ofÂ£7bn The Labour leader said freezing the energy price cap at the current level of Â£1,971 a year for the typical household would bring inflation down by four percentage points. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 9.4% in June, the highest level for more than 40 years. The Bank of England has warned it could peak at more than 13% later this year. Labour estimate their plans would cost about Â£15bn more than the government's scheme to give households Â£400 this October (and Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak's proposals). Labour estimate that about Â£3.5bn of their extra spending would come from changes to the government's windfall tax on oil and gas companies - including making it apply to profits from January rather than May and getting rid of a government tax-relief scheme to encourage investment from these firms. The party also expects to get Â£4.7bn extra in existing taxes because oil and gas prices are now likely to be much higher than they were when the last official forecasts were made. And Labour say that freezing energy prices would stop inflation rising as high as it would have done otherwise. They estimate this would reduce government borrowing costs by Â£7.2bn this year. But economists warn it's delaying borrowing costs rather than saving them - they say that stopping the subsidy would push up inflation and borrowing costs. The main reason for high inflation is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, although households have also been hit by higher petrol, diesel and food costs. Sir Keir said he would have to ""assess"" the situation in April, but Labour's plans were about helping people through the winter. He added further measures to reduce inflation may be needed next year, and argued in the medium to long term Labour was calling for further measures to bring costs down such as insulating millions of homes. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson and Sir Keir have both been criticised for going on holiday as economic turmoil - driven by rising energy bills - deepens. The Labour leader rejected claims he has been missing in action, saying he had been working on his plan for weeks and would not ""apologise for going on holiday with his wife and kids"". ""It's the first time we've had a holiday for about three years,"" he said. Former Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis rejected suggestions that Mr Johnson had ""thrown in the towel"". He told LBC radio: ""Even when you are not in the office in Downing Street you are working."" It comes as the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the government would need to find Â£12bn simply to achieve what it was aiming to do with the Â£24bn package announced in May, due to soaring energy prices. The think tank said that in May energy prices were expected to rise by 95% in 2022/23 but are now expected to rise by 141%. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC Labour's plan was ""a very big and very expensive plan"" that would be on the same scale of support for the public as the furlough scheme during the pandemic, if it was extended beyond the initial six months planned. ""Of course, what it does achieve is to protect everyone entirely from the increases in energy prices so if that is what you want to achieve that is what you need to do but you do need to realise that is a very expensive thing to do,"" he added. The idea of freezing the price cap is backed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP. A Treasury spokeswoman said the government had ""continually taken action to help households by phasing in Â£37bn worth of support throughout the year"". This includes Â£400 off energy bills for all UK households and an additional Â£650 for eight million low-income households.

New system to simplify access to cheaper broadbandThe government says new system will give those receiving benefits better access to cheaper broadband.Technology,"The government is launching a new system to simplify access to cheaper broadband. From 22 August, people receiving certain benefits can ask broadband firms to check their eligibility for social tariffs. This means customers will not have to take full responsibility for proving they qualify for low-cost options. Campaign group Digital Poverty Alliance described it as a positive first step but warned it did not go far enough. Elizabeth Anderson, chief operating officer for the Alliance, argues that, as more sectors moved essential resources and services online ,""it's not right that a growing number of people face being cut off from the online world"". Which? analysis of recent Ofcom data revealednearly six million households are struggling to pay for essential telecoms,external. Steve Leighton, chair of the Internet Service Providers Association, said the association welcomed the government's launch of an application programme interface (API) for members - following calls by the sector for a system to help verify eligibility. ""While we still need to see the technical details, the API should help our members identify eligible customers more easily and offer them targeted support,"" Mr Leighton said. But he reiterated concerns over whether the measures went far enough, adding the government could ease the cost of living crisis' impact on the industry by reducing VAT on broadband bills. Reduced social tariffs allow UK households receiving government benefits such as Universal Credit, Pension Credit, Jobseeker's Allowance and Income Support to pay less for internet and telecoms access. Current providers include BT, Community Fibre, NOW, Sky, Virgin Media and VOXI. Tariffs,externalrange from Â£10 to Â£25 per month depending on preferred bandwidth, supplier and who qualifies for the low-cost alternative. Nadine Dorries, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said social tariffs were ""vital for families struggling with bills"". Ms Dorries said the government had secured commitments from the UK's internet service providers to help customers struggling with bill payments and costly contracts to stay connected. ""I urge anyone concerned about falling behind on payments to contact their supplier to see what support is available,"" she added. What can I do if I can't afford my energy bill? Ofcom urged to help end broadband loyalty penalty  The government's new system, which allows customers to more easily prove eligibility for cheaper broadband, aims to raise awareness and take up of broadband social tariffs among the general public. Ofcom reported earlier this year that only 1.2% of more than four million households receiving Universal Credit had successfully applied for broadband social tariffs. Ms Anderson said the low-cost optionsneeded more promotion by the governmentand the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), which will run the new eligibility system. She said the DWP should ""actively make everyone who's eligible aware of social tariffs"" to prevent those struggling from being plunged into digital poverty - essentially unable to afford to go online. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey said the new system, which launches next week, would make social tariffs easier to access at a time when it was ""more important than ever that people get the financial support available to them"".

"Sprinter pulled over for second time by policeSprinter Ricardo Dos Santos says he was ""worried"" when armed police pulled him over early on Sunday.","The Portuguese sprinter said some unseen footage is with his lawyer A sprinter who was allegedly racially profiled during a stop and search has said he was ""worried"" at being pulled over for a second time by armed police. Ricardo Dos Santospublished a series of video tweets,externalof him being pulled over and questioned by police in Paddington at 04:00 BST on Sunday. The Met said officers were concerned the driver may have been using a phone. The force has now referred itself to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). This video can not be played Ricardo Dos Santos published videos of him being pulled over and questioned by police The 27-year-old told the BBC his phone was between his thighs, and accused the Met of ""over-policing"". Five officersface a gross misconduct hearingover a stop-and-search in 2020 involving the Portuguese sprinter and his partner. Speaking to Radio 5 Live about the incident, Mr Dos Santos explained that he felt unsafe to stop on the A40 Westway and ""went around"" the police car to avoid driving into the back of it. He then continued driving for a further five minutes. In a statement, the Met said: ""The officers clearly indicated for the car to pull over but it failed to do so and they called for further assistance."" Mr Dos Santos said: ""I missed the turn to come out and I felt there wasn't anywhere else that was safe enough to stop because the flyover is pretty dark so I took the next exit... and stopped at the next available street and I parked up and waited for them to come to me."" ""It is a long time on a regular street but this was a flyover. For my safety, and based on my previous incidents with them [police], I thought that the best place to stop was somewhere lit up and with the possibility of witnesses."" Mr Dos Santos said he counted seven armed police officers and that one took his baton out of his pocket ""out of frustration ready to smash the glass"" after not knowing how to open the car door. He added ""nothing had changed"" two years after he was pulled over with his partner, Bianca Williams, and their daughter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, Scotland Yard said it had ""recorded this matter as a public complaint"" and referred itself to the police watchdog, ""recognising the public interest"". An IOPC spokesperson said: ""We will be assessing the available information in order to make an informed decision on the level of our involvement."" In July 2020, footage of Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos being searched and handcuffed was widely shared on social media, with Ms Williams later accusing the police of racially profiling them. After the search, details of the couple's three-month-old baby were also stored on a police database called Merlin, used to record information on children who become known to the authorities. In April, the IOPC said an acting police sergeant and four police constables will all face a gross misconduct disciplinary hearing over the incident. Ricardo Dos Santos has represented Portugal in the 400m sprint Mr Dos Santos revealed this was the third time he had been stopped by police whilst driving in two years.  On Sunday he said he warned the officers that his Tesla car had cameras which film the exterior of the vehicle. He said: ""I was worried for my safety, so much so that I called Bianca and I told her to log onto the car's cameras and look at them just in case anything happened once I'd pulled over. ""I stay as calm as possible because for me this isn't a surprising situation, it's happened many times so it's my norm. ""I believe it was over-policing for a phone."" In an earlier statement, the Met Police said: ""Armed officers were on routine patrol in a marked police vehicle. ""They saw a car travelling eastbound on the A40 Westway and were concerned the driver may be using a mobile phone at the wheel. ""The driver stopped about five minutes later in Orsett Terrace W2, and the officers spoke to him about why they wanted to stop the vehicle. ""Following the conversation the vehicle was allowed on its way. We have since contacted the driver via Twitter to invite him to contact us if he would like to discuss this matter further.""

"No 10 defends PM's holiday as removal vans arriveBoris Johnson will be kept informed of ""urgent issues"" while he is away, Downing Street says.UK Politics","Boris Johnson will be kept informed of any ""urgent issues"" while on holiday this week, Downing Street has said. The prime minister - who was criticised for taking a holiday earlier this month amid growing economic turmoil - is now on another break. It comes as removal vans were spotted in Downing Street earlier on Monday. The PM's spokesman confirmed Mr Johnson would return from holiday at the weekend, when he will have two weeks to move out of his No 10 flat. The prime minister, who was forced to announce his departure in July after a cabinet mutiny, will officially stand down on 6 September. It is not known if he will return to the Downing Street flat before it is handed over to Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak, who are competing to take over as Conservative leader and prime minister. Labour vows to freeze fuel bills with windfall tax What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? It was reported over the weekend that Mr Johnson is spending a week in Greece, with locals spotting him shopping alongside wife Carrie in a supermarket in Nea Makri, a town to the east of Athens. Asked if his holiday could have waited a few weeks, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""I can't get into the decision around timings but he is on leave this week. He will be back this weekend."" The spokesman told reporters Mr Johnson had paid for his own holiday and would be kept informed of any pressing government business while away. He added: ""If there were urgent decisions that required the PM's input he will, of course, be involved in that. ""But the deputy prime minister [Dominic Raab] is able to be deputised for meetings should they come up but as far as I'm aware there are no such meetings currently scheduled. ""Over recent weeks we've made a number of significant announcements and will continue to do so in the coming days."" Mr Johnson's spokesman said that the prime minister would remain ""contactable"". This video can not be played Watch: I'm not going to apologise for holiday with my wife and kids - Starmer But Labour accused Mr Johnson of treating recent months as ""one big party"". A spokesperson said: ""On the evidence of the last few months it seems to make little difference if the prime minister is in the office or on holiday as he has continually failed to meet the challenge of the Tory cost-of-living crisis. ""It's all just one big party for Boris Johnson while the country struggles to pay their bills."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer recently got back from his own summer holiday, in Mallorca, amid criticism he has also been missing in action during the cost of living crisis. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I've got a very important job as leader of the Labour Party, leader of the Opposition, but I've also got another job that's really important and that is I'm a dad and I'm not going to apologise for going on holiday with my wife and kids. ""It's the first time we've had a real holiday for about three years."" Mr Johnson shares his official flat in 11 Downing Street - which is owned by the government - with his wife Carrie, whomhe married in spring last year. An expensive refurbishmentcarried out in 2020 attracted controversyafter it emerged a Tory peer had initially covered part of the cost, on top of the annual Â£30,000 public grant Mr Johnson receives to pay for redecorations. An inquiry by the UK's elections watchdoglater revealedthe prime minister had spent Â£112,000 repaying the peer for the cost of the works. The PM's spokesman said that upon leaving office, Mr Johnson would be able to remove any furniture that had been paid for privately, whilst items funded by the taxpayer would remain.

"Giggs threatened ex's sister after assault - courtRyan Giggs headbutted his ex-girlfriend and threatened to do the same to her sister, a court hears.","Ryan Giggs arriving at Manchester Crown Court on Monday Former Manchester United star Ryan Giggs headbutted his ex-girlfriend and threatened to do the same to her sister, a court has heard. The ex-Wales manager, 48, is on trial accused of controlling behaviour, as well as assaulting Kate Greville, 38, and her younger sister Emma, 26. Emma Greville told jurors he said ""I'll headbutt you next"" after assaulting her sister in an argument at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester. Mr Giggs denies all charges. Giving evidence from behind a screen at Manchester Crown Court, Emma Greville said she saw Mr Giggs place his hands on her sister's shoulders ""and with lots of force use his head to headbutt her on her lip"". She said Kate Greville screamed and fell to the floor and Mr Giggs told Emma Greville that it was ""her fault"" he had done it, then threatened to do the same to her. She said she ""felt fear"" and that when Kate Greville told her to call the police, Mr Giggs told her not to, telling her to ""think of his daughter and his career"". Earlier in her evidence, Emma Greville had described how her sister and Mr Giggs had returned to the house separately on 1 November 2020 after going out for a meal at the Stock Exchange hotel where they had planned to stay that night. But Kate Greville had messaged her sister, who was pet-sitting at the house, to ask her to pack her things as she was leaving that night. She said her sister arrived first and was ""upset"". Giggs' ex screamed in pain on 999 call, court told Covid lockdown with Giggs was hell, ex tells court Mr Giggs arrived about 15 minutes later and was ""annoyed"" and ""not happy"". She said Kate Greville had been drinking and Mr Giggs was ""very drunk"". Emma Greville told the jury how the couple argued in the hallway and that she had come from the kitchen to see Mr Giggs lying on top of her sister grabbing for her phone. Kate Greville asked her sister to ""get him off me"", she said. Emma Greville described how she put her arms around his waist and pulled as her sister pushed with her legs and said, that as she did so, he ""turned to the right and his elbow touched my jaw"". ""As a result, I let go,"" she said. The trial has started its second week at Manchester Crown Court She said he did not mention what had happened, ""even though I was visibly upset"" but he did say he was ""disappointed"" in her, she said. Emma Greville said the argument between the couple continued and moved into the kitchen, where the alleged headbutt then took place. The court also heard Emma Greville had been critical of a photograph her older sister arranged to be taken a couple of days after the alleged assault on 1 November that appeared to show her injuries. Kate Greville previously told the court the photo was taken in an attempt to get the paparazzi off her back. Asked about a series of messages between Kate Greville and her friend Courtney which showed the younger sister disagreed with the arrangement, Emma Greville confirmed to the court she thought it was immoral to set up a fake picture made to look genuine. She was also asked about messages between the two sisters on 16 November, when the article was published. In one, Emma Greville asked her sister how she felt about the article. Kate Greville said in response, she thought she looked terrible, but that was probably a good thing as it ""looks less staged"". Emma Greville responded: ""I think they are good photos as it looks real"". Asked if the bruises were not real, Emma Greville told the court: ""They were real."" Emma Greville was asked if she had told the police her sister had staged fake photos. She said she hadn't, but that her sister had. The court also heard from Mr Giggs' neighbour who said he was banging on her door on the night of the alleged assault. Linda Cheung, who had known the defendant for more than 20 years, said he was ""distressed"" and asked her to help him. ""He said words to affect that Kate had been accusing him of seeing other women and he wanted me to and sort her out,"" she said. Regarding the accusation of him seeing other girls, she said her reaction was: ""Oh Ryan, not that again."" He told her Ms Greville was refusing to leave. Mrs Cheung said she refused to go over as she did not want to get involved when she did not understand the situation. He later left. Later, in the early hours. after she saw the police come and go, she said she saw a small white car arrive with two women and another male. She described them ""as screaming, shouting and laughing"" and ""running up and down the drive"" Kate Greville had the dog Mack in her arms and was talking to him. She described the mood as ""high jinks"". The court was also told a firm which employed Kate Greville had blocked Mr Giggs' emails due to the quantity he was sending her. Elsa Roodt said the email volume was ""intense"" and ""Kate could not do her work"". Ms Roodt, who has a public relations firm in the United Arab Emirates, was giving her evidence via a video link from Dubai. She told the court Ms Greville had gone to help her and colleague Katie Harvey to set up a new office in Abu Dhabi in 2016. She said Ms Greville was ""happy and confident and bubbly"" and had socialised when she first arrived. Ryan Giggs' football career ended with him as the most decorated player in the Premier League era, with 34 trophies But, over the two years she worked there, she said there was a ""noticeable difference"" and they did not spend as much time with her. She appeared ""nervous"" and she was ""obsessed"" with her phone and being available at all times, said Ms Roodt. She was asked about an alleged incident at a hotel in Dubai, when Mr Giggs was visiting and when she had seen Ms Greville the following day, she told her they had had some sort of ""argument"". ""She was very upset,"" she said. I was slave to Giggs' demands, ex tells court Giggs threw ex out of hotel room naked, court told Ms Roodt added she had seen bruises on Ms Greville's wrist and had asked her where they were from. She said Ms Greville told her they had had ""rough sex"" after the argument. Ms Roodt was also asked about seeing Ms Greville in February 2020 when she visited Ms Harvey's home while on holiday in Dubai with Mr Giggs. Ms Roodt said Ms Greville described how ""she had been crying all night and seemed very upset"". She said she had bruises on her arm and had said Mr Giggs had been ""physical with her"" in the hotel room. Mr Giggs had phoned and messaged Ms Harvey during the two hours Ms Roodt was visiting. Some of his messages were ""loving"", she said, but some were ""rude"". ""It was like they were coming from two different people,"" she said. Under cross examination, Ms Roodt said she had met Mr Giggs about three times. She said she had not been present during any of the couple's arguments, and having been at a wedding with the couple in Spain, she agreed he had appeared kind, friendly and sociable at that event. The court heard Ms Greville was currently a managing partner in the UK branch of Ms Roodt's business. The trial continues.

Drama as Kenya election announcement delayed,"This video can not be played Watch: Tussles break out in Kenya over allegations of election vote rigging Deputy President William Ruto has been declared the winner of Kenya's presidential election amid dramatic scenes. He narrowly beat his rival, Raila Odinga, taking 50.5% of the vote, according to the official results. The announcement was delayed amid scuffles and allegations of vote-rigging by Mr Odinga's campaign. Four of the seven members of the electoral commission refused to endorse the result, saying it was ""opaque"". ""We cannot take ownership of the result that is going to be announced because of the opaque nature of this last phase of the general election,"" said Juliana Cherera, the vice-chairperson of Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). ""We are going to give a comprehensive statement... and again we urge Kenyans to keep calm,"" she added. Live updates from around Kenya Full results of the presidential and parliamentary races How Ruto defied the odds Ruto's rise from chicken seller to Kenya's president-elect Mr Odinga's party agent earlier alleged that there were ""irregularities"" and ""mismanagement"" in the election. This was the first time Mr Ruto, 55, had run for president. He has served as deputy president for 10 years, but fell out with President Uhuru Kenyatta, who backed Mr Odinga to succeed him. The 77-year-old former prime minister, who got 48.8% of the vote, was running for president for the fifth time. Mr Ruto (r) called Mr Chebukati, the head of the electoral commission, a ""hero"" Electoral commission chairman Wafula Chebukati said he had done his duty despite receiving threats. ""We have walked the journey of ensuring that Kenyans get a free, fair and credible election. It has not been an easy journey - right now two of my commissioners and the CEO are injured,"" he said. In his speech, President-elect Ruto thanked the electoral commission for overseeing the election. ""It is a wonderful eveningâ¦ all sovereign power belongs to the people of Kenya,"" Mr Ruto said, calling Mr Chebukati a ""hero"" and dismissing the other commissioners' dissent of his win as ""a side show"". Mr Ruto said he wanted to be a president of all, and for the country to focus on the future. ""To those who have done many things against us, I want to tell them there's nothing to fear. There will be no vengeance. We do not have the luxury to look back,"" he added. Celebrations have broken out in several parts of the country, including in Mr Ruto's strongholds of the Rift Valley, and that of his deputy Rigathi Gachagua, in the Central region. Supporters of Mr Odinga have staged protests in the western city of Kisumu and some parts of Nairobi. But generally there's a sense of relief that the result has finally been declared because the country had ground into a halt since election day on 9 August, economic activities had stalled and schools remain closed. Kenya's history of disputed elections in the past have led to violence or the whole process election being cancelled. Following the 2007 vote, at least 1,200 people were killed and 600,000 fled their homes following claims of a stolen election. In a country fond of political metaphors, Mr Ruto's stunning victory is akin to his party's modest symbol, the wheelbarrow, running a seven-tonne tractor off the road. Mr Odinga had the backing of the state machinery. Several opinion polls, which Mr Ruto had dismissed as fake, predicted his rival would win. As the deputy president for the last 10 years he was, by default, an establishment candidate but he ran as an outsider, framing the election as between ""hustlers"" - poor Kenyans - and ""dynasties"" - influential families like the Kenyattas and Odingas who have been big players in the country's politics since independence. ""I may be the son of a nobody but I promise to make Kenya the country of everybody,"" he said in his pitch to voters. His political stock rose when he opposed an unpopular and costly year-long push by Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga to change the constitution at a time many Kenyans were suffering, including losing jobs, following the protracted impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Supreme Court eventually ruled the move unconstitutional, buoying Mr Ruto's campaign. He also framed the election as a time for generational change, selling his message using pithy and relatable slogans, which lent him credibility and appeal across several communities. Mr Ruto's win is rightly the focus of Kenya's 2022 election, but equal attention should be given to the electoral commission which came into this poll with a terrible track record, but its decision to post results from the more than 46,000 polling stations on its website - accessible to anyone who wanted to do their own tally - allowed the media and the public to be part of the process. The leaders of Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Somalia have congratulated Mr Ruto. Analysts believe that Mr Odinga is likely to challenge the result. The Kenyan Supreme Court annulled the last election - it might have to make another big decision in a few weeks.

Confusion surrounds Kenya election announcement,"This video can not be played Watch: Tussles break out in Kenya over allegations of election vote rigging Deputy President William Ruto has been declared the winner of Kenya's presidential election amid dramatic scenes. He narrowly beat his rival, Raila Odinga, taking 50.5% of the vote, according to the official results. The announcement was delayed amid scuffles and allegations of vote-rigging by Mr Odinga's campaign. Four of the seven members of the electoral commission refused to endorse the result, saying it was ""opaque"". ""We cannot take ownership of the result that is going to be announced because of the opaque nature of this last phase of the general election,"" said Juliana Cherera, the vice-chairperson of Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). ""We are going to give a comprehensive statement... and again we urge Kenyans to keep calm,"" she added. Live updates from around Kenya Full results of the presidential and parliamentary races How Ruto defied the odds Ruto's rise from chicken seller to Kenya's president-elect Mr Odinga's party agent earlier alleged that there were ""irregularities"" and ""mismanagement"" in the election. This was the first time Mr Ruto, 55, had run for president. He has served as deputy president for 10 years, but fell out with President Uhuru Kenyatta, who backed Mr Odinga to succeed him. The 77-year-old former prime minister, who got 48.8% of the vote, was running for president for the fifth time. Mr Ruto (r) called Mr Chebukati, the head of the electoral commission, a ""hero"" Electoral commission chairman Wafula Chebukati said he had done his duty despite receiving threats. ""We have walked the journey of ensuring that Kenyans get a free, fair and credible election. It has not been an easy journey - right now two of my commissioners and the CEO are injured,"" he said. In his speech, President-elect Ruto thanked the electoral commission for overseeing the election. ""It is a wonderful eveningâ¦ all sovereign power belongs to the people of Kenya,"" Mr Ruto said, calling Mr Chebukati a ""hero"" and dismissing the other commissioners' dissent of his win as ""a side show"". Mr Ruto said he wanted to be a president of all, and for the country to focus on the future. ""To those who have done many things against us, I want to tell them there's nothing to fear. There will be no vengeance. We do not have the luxury to look back,"" he added. Celebrations have broken out in several parts of the country, including in Mr Ruto's strongholds of the Rift Valley, and that of his deputy Rigathi Gachagua, in the Central region. Supporters of Mr Odinga have staged protests in the western city of Kisumu and some parts of Nairobi. But generally there's a sense of relief that the result has finally been declared because the country had ground into a halt since election day on 9 August, economic activities had stalled and schools remain closed. Kenya's history of disputed elections in the past have led to violence or the whole process election being cancelled. Following the 2007 vote, at least 1,200 people were killed and 600,000 fled their homes following claims of a stolen election. In a country fond of political metaphors, Mr Ruto's stunning victory is akin to his party's modest symbol, the wheelbarrow, running a seven-tonne tractor off the road. Mr Odinga had the backing of the state machinery. Several opinion polls, which Mr Ruto had dismissed as fake, predicted his rival would win. As the deputy president for the last 10 years he was, by default, an establishment candidate but he ran as an outsider, framing the election as between ""hustlers"" - poor Kenyans - and ""dynasties"" - influential families like the Kenyattas and Odingas who have been big players in the country's politics since independence. ""I may be the son of a nobody but I promise to make Kenya the country of everybody,"" he said in his pitch to voters. His political stock rose when he opposed an unpopular and costly year-long push by Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga to change the constitution at a time many Kenyans were suffering, including losing jobs, following the protracted impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Supreme Court eventually ruled the move unconstitutional, buoying Mr Ruto's campaign. He also framed the election as a time for generational change, selling his message using pithy and relatable slogans, which lent him credibility and appeal across several communities. Mr Ruto's win is rightly the focus of Kenya's 2022 election, but equal attention should be given to the electoral commission which came into this poll with a terrible track record, but its decision to post results from the more than 46,000 polling stations on its website - accessible to anyone who wanted to do their own tally - allowed the media and the public to be part of the process. The leaders of Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Somalia have congratulated Mr Ruto. Analysts believe that Mr Odinga is likely to challenge the result. The Kenyan Supreme Court annulled the last election - it might have to make another big decision in a few weeks.

Ukraine hits Russian Wagner mercenary HQ in east,"The since deleted image was posted to Russian journalist Sergei Sreda's Telegram account Ukrainian artillery has struck a headquarters of Russia's shadowy Wagner paramilitary group of mercenaries in eastern Ukraine, reports say. The extent of damage to the military base of the group - which has been linked to war crimes - is not clear. Luhansk's governor claims its secret location was revealed after a Russian journalist shared its address. Last week, pro-Kremlin correspondent Sergei Sreda posted a photo on Telegram of the base with its apparent address. The image, shared on the social media site but since deleted, shows five people in military uniform with a street sign in Popasna, Luhansk visible in the top left corner. While the BBC has not been able to confirm the connection between the photo and the strike,Governor Serhiy Hayday wrote on Telegram,externalthat Ukrainian forces ""hit an enemy HQ whose whereabouts were established thanks to a Russian journalist"". ""This time, the successful strike destroyed the Wagner PMC HQ in Popasna yesterday,"" he said. He added that ""the number of dead is being clarified"". The Wagner group was deployed to Crimea and Ukraine's Donbas region in 2014, when Kremlin-backed forces ousted Ukrainian troops from areas they later declared to be part of Russia. Wagner units have also been sent to Syria, Libya, Mali and the Central African Republic. The Kremlin does not acknowledge Wagner's existence, but Western intelligence links the group to Yevgeny Prigozhin - nicknamed ""Putin's chef"" because his catering business has long helped President Vladimir Putin and the armed forces. Mr Prigozhin, like many other Russian officials, is subject to Western sanctions. Wagner is known as a PMC - private military company. But they are state-sponsored mercenaries who act in the Kremlin's interests, Western experts say. They have been accused of repeated war crimes and human rights abuses. What is Russia's Wagner Group of mercenaries? Powerful 'Putin's chef' cooks up murky deals Predicting Russia's next step in Ukraine The Ukrainian dailyUkrainska Pravda reports,externalthat a pro-Kremlin Russian journalist, Sergei Sreda, revealed the Wagner HQ in a Telegram post on 8 August. He posted photos of his visit to the HQ and a sign in one of them identified its address as Mironovskaya 12, Popasna. The post was later removed, but copies are circulating on social media. Popasna lies just south of Severodonetsk in Luhansk region, which Russian forces now entirely control, following months of bitter fighting and huge destruction. Another pro-Kremlin war reporter, called Kotenok,wrote on Telegram,external: ""A strike was carried out on one of the Wagner PMC locations in Popasna. Sources in Donbas confirm that. Probably 'Himars'. Ukrainian sources report the death of Prigozhin - we don't confirm that."" Ukrainian forces now have several of the US Himars (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System), which fire rockets capable of hitting Russian targets far behind the front lines. Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Honcharenko wrote on Facebook: ""There is no more Wagner HQ in Popasna. Thank you, Himars and the Armed Forces of Ukraine!"" Some Ukrainian reports implicate Wagner in the Olenivka prison fire on 29 July which killed dozens of Ukrainian prisoners-of-war. Russia blamed Ukrainian forces, saying they had shelled the prison, about 20km (12.5 miles) from Donetsk. The circumstances of the inferno remain unclear.

Sprinter pulled over for second time by police,"The Portuguese sprinter said some unseen footage is with his lawyer A sprinter who was allegedly racially profiled during a stop and search has said he was ""worried"" at being pulled over for a second time by armed police. Ricardo Dos Santospublished a series of video tweets,externalof him being pulled over and questioned by police in Paddington at 04:00 BST on Sunday. The Met said officers were concerned the driver may have been using a phone. The force has now referred itself to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). This video can not be played Ricardo Dos Santos published videos of him being pulled over and questioned by police The 27-year-old told the BBC his phone was between his thighs, and accused the Met of ""over-policing"". Five officersface a gross misconduct hearingover a stop-and-search in 2020 involving the Portuguese sprinter and his partner. Speaking to Radio 5 Live about the incident, Mr Dos Santos explained that he felt unsafe to stop on the A40 Westway and ""went around"" the police car to avoid driving into the back of it. He then continued driving for a further five minutes. In a statement, the Met said: ""The officers clearly indicated for the car to pull over but it failed to do so and they called for further assistance."" Mr Dos Santos said: ""I missed the turn to come out and I felt there wasn't anywhere else that was safe enough to stop because the flyover is pretty dark so I took the next exit... and stopped at the next available street and I parked up and waited for them to come to me."" ""It is a long time on a regular street but this was a flyover. For my safety, and based on my previous incidents with them [police], I thought that the best place to stop was somewhere lit up and with the possibility of witnesses."" Mr Dos Santos said he counted seven armed police officers and that one took his baton out of his pocket ""out of frustration ready to smash the glass"" after not knowing how to open the car door. He added ""nothing had changed"" two years after he was pulled over with his partner, Bianca Williams, and their daughter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, Scotland Yard said it had ""recorded this matter as a public complaint"" and referred itself to the police watchdog, ""recognising the public interest"". An IOPC spokesperson said: ""We will be assessing the available information in order to make an informed decision on the level of our involvement."" In July 2020, footage of Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos being searched and handcuffed was widely shared on social media, with Ms Williams later accusing the police of racially profiling them. After the search, details of the couple's three-month-old baby were also stored on a police database called Merlin, used to record information on children who become known to the authorities. In April, the IOPC said an acting police sergeant and four police constables will all face a gross misconduct disciplinary hearing over the incident. Ricardo Dos Santos has represented Portugal in the 400m sprint Mr Dos Santos revealed this was the third time he had been stopped by police whilst driving in two years.  On Sunday he said he warned the officers that his Tesla car had cameras which film the exterior of the vehicle. He said: ""I was worried for my safety, so much so that I called Bianca and I told her to log onto the car's cameras and look at them just in case anything happened once I'd pulled over. ""I stay as calm as possible because for me this isn't a surprising situation, it's happened many times so it's my norm. ""I believe it was over-policing for a phone."" In an earlier statement, the Met Police said: ""Armed officers were on routine patrol in a marked police vehicle. ""They saw a car travelling eastbound on the A40 Westway and were concerned the driver may be using a mobile phone at the wheel. ""The driver stopped about five minutes later in Orsett Terrace W2, and the officers spoke to him about why they wanted to stop the vehicle. ""Following the conversation the vehicle was allowed on its way. We have since contacted the driver via Twitter to invite him to contact us if he would like to discuss this matter further.""

Scotland's free period products law is world first,"Public buildings such as schools, councils and colleges, have to supply free period products by law Scotland has made public health history by making it the law for public settings to provide period products. It is the first country in the world to protect the right to free sanitary products with new legislation that has come into force on Monday. ThePeriod Products Act,externalmeans councils and education providers have to make the free items available to those who need them. Since 2017, around Â£27m has been spent to provide access in public settings. Labour MSP Monica Lennon campaigned for the legislation which was unanimously backed in the Scottish Parliament in 2020. Ms Lennon said: ""Local authorities and partner organisations have worked hard to make the legal right to access free period products a reality. Scotland first in world to make period products free Period products for NHS staff 'a basic necessity' Patients 'denied free sanitary products' ""This is another big milestone for period dignity campaigners and grassroots movements which shows the difference that progressive and bold political choices can make. ""As the cost-of-living crisis takes hold, the Period Products Act is a beacon of hope which shows what can be achieved when politicians come together for the good of the people we serve."" Hey Girls, a social enterprise working to tackle period poverty in the UK, said period products should be as accessible as toilet roll in public bathrooms. Georgie Nicholson from Hey Girls said Scotland providing free period products was a ""really huge"" milestone Georgie Nicholson toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandthat the organisation had run a study before the pandemic which indicated that one in four women in Scotland had faced period poverty at some point. ""There's a very simple way to describe period poverty: you go to the supermarket and you have to actually choose whether you can buy a bag of pasta or a box of tampons. It's that basic,"" she said. ""We hear of a lot of mothers going without their period protection just so they can feed their children and using things such as newspaper stuffed into socks or bread... because they're cheaper than period products."" Ms Nicholson added that Scotland becoming the first country in the world to provide free period products was a ""really huge"" milestone. Scotland's social justice secretary Shona Robison said providing access to free period products was ""fundamental to equality and dignity"". She added: ""We are proud to be the first national government in the world to take such action. ""This is more important than ever at a time when people are making difficult choices due to the cost of living crisis. ""We never want anyone to be in a position where they cannot access period products."" Shauna Gauntlett struggled with period poverty after her first son was born. She told BBC Scotland sanitary products became a financial burden after she developed health problems after giving birth. ""No one quite tells you what happens when you give birth, what's normal, what to expect,"" she said. ""I had to rely on friends and family to get those products for me. ""I didn't know what I was experiencing at the time wasn't normal so in my case, I'd had stitches first, and obviously I needed medical intervention but until I got that medical intervention, I needed all those products.""

"Lyse Doucet: From Kabul and beyond, a year of Taliban rule","When you arrive at Kabul International Airport, the first thing you notice is the women, clothed in brown scarves and black cloaks, stamping passports. An airfield, which one year ago was the scene of a panicked tide of people desperate to escape, is now much quieter and cleaner. Rows of white Taliban flags flutter in a summer's breeze - billboards of the old famous faces have been painted over. What lies beyond this gateway to a country which was turned upside down by a swift Taliban takeover? The messages are startling, to say the least. ""They want me to give my job to my brother,"" writes one woman on a messaging platform. ""We earned our positions with our experience and educationâ¦ if we accept this it means we have betrayed ourselves,"" declares another. I'm sitting down with a few former senior civil servants from the finance ministry who share their messages. They're part of a group of more than 60 women, many from the Afghanistan Revenue Directorate, who banded together after being ordered to go home last August. Female civil servants were told by the Taliban to send CVs of their male relatives who could apply for their jobs They say Taliban officials then told them: Send CVs of your male relatives who can apply for your jobs. ""This is my job,"" insists one woman who, like all women in this group, anxiously asks for her identity to be hidden. ""I worked with so much difficulty for more than 17 years to get this job and finish my master's degree. Now we are back to zero."" On a telephone call from outside Afghanistan, we're joined by Amina Ahmady, former director general of the Directorate. She's managed to leave, but that's not a way out either. ""We are losing our identity,"" she laments. ""The only place we can keep it is in our own country."" Their group's grand title - ""Women Leaders of Afghanistan"" - gives them strength; what they want is their jobs. Who are the Taliban? Live: Taliban mark first year in power while crisis deepens Do you have questions about Afghanistan? Lyse Doucet and other BBC correspondents will be answering them in theLive pagefrom 13:00 BST today. Get in touch via the form at the end of this article. They're the women who seized new spaces for education and job opportunities during two decades of international engagement which ended with Taliban rule. Taliban officials say women are still working. Those who do are mainly medical staff, educators and security workers including at the airport - spaces where women frequent. The Taliban also emphasise that women, who once held about a quarter of the government's jobs, are still being paid - albeit a small fraction of their salary. A former civil servant tells me how she was stopped on the street by a Talib guard who criticised her Islamic head cover, or hijab, although she was fully covered. ""You've got more important problems to solve than hijab,"" she shot back - another moment of women's determination to fight for their rights, within Islam. The scene seems idyllic. Sheaves of golden wheat shimmer in a summer's sun in the remote central highlands of Afghanistan. You can hear a gentle lowing of cows. Eighteen-year-old Noor Mohammad and 25-year-old Ahmad keep swinging their sickles to clear a remaining patch of grain. As jobs dry up, young people take up work like harvesting which pays the equivalent of $2 (Â£1.65) a day. ""There's much less wheat this year because of drought,"" Noor remarks, sweat and dirt streaking his young face. ""But it's the only job I could find."" A harvested field stretches into the distance behind us. It's been 10 days of backbreaking work by two men in the prime of their life for the equivalent of $2 (Â£1.65) a day. ""I was studying electrical engineering but had to drop out to support my family,"" he explains. His regret is palpable. Ahmad's story is just as painful. ""I sold my motorbike to go to Iran but I couldn't find work,"" he explains. Seasonal work in neighbouring Iran used to be an answer for those in one of Afghanistan's poorest provinces. But work has dried up in Iran too. ""We welcome our Taliban brothers,"" Noor says. ""But we need a government which gives us opportunities."" Earlier that day, we sat around a shiny pine table with Ghor's provincial cabinet of turbaned men seated alongside Taliban Governor Ahmad Shah Din Dost. A former-shadow deputy governor during the war, he gruffly shares all his woes. ""All these problems make me sad,"" he says, listing poverty, bad roads, lack of access to hospitals and schools not operating properly. The end of the war means more aid agencies are now working here, including in districts out-of-bounds before. Earlier this year, famine conditions were detected in two of Ghor's most distant districts. But the war isn't over for Governor Din Dost. He says he was imprisoned and tortured by US forces. ""Don't give us more pain,"" he asserts. ""We don't need help from the West."" ""Why is the West always interfering?"" he demands. ""We don't question how you treat your women or men."" Taliban Governor Ahmad Shah Din Dost In the days that follow, we visit a school and a malnutrition clinic, accompanied by members of his team. ""Afghanistan needs attention,"" says the Taliban's young university-educated Health Director Abdul Satar Mafaq who seems to sound a more pragmatic note. ""We have to save people's lives and it doesn't need to involve politics."" I remember what Noor Mohammad told me in the wheat field. ""Poverty and famine is also a fight and it's bigger than the gunfights."" Eighteen-year-old Sohaila is fizzing with excitement. I follow her down a darkened stairwell into the basement floor of the women-only market in Herat, the ancient western city long known for its more open culture, its science and creativity. It's the first day this bazaar is open - the Taliban shuttered it last year, Covid-19 the year before. We peer through the glass frontage of her family's dress shop which isn't ready yet. A row of sewing machines sits in the corner, red heart balloons hang from the ceiling. A women-only market in Herat ""Ten years ago, my sister started this shop when she was 18 years old,"" Sohaila tells me, sharing a capsule history of her mother and grandmother's stitching of brightly-patterned traditional Kuchi dresses. Her sister had also opened an internet club and a restaurant too. There's a quiet hum of activity in this women's only space. Some are stocking their shelves, others gossiping as they linger over jewellery and embroidered garb. The premises are poorly lit, but in this gloom, there's a shaft of light for women who've spent all too much time just sitting at home. Sohaila has another story to share. ""The Taliban have closed the high schools,"" she remarks, matter-of-fact, about something that has enormous consequences for young ambitious teenagers like her. Most secondary schools are shut, on orders of the Taliban's top ultra-conservative clerics, even though many Afghans, including Taliban members, have called for them to re-open. ""I'm in grade 12 - if I don't graduate I can't go to university."" I ask her whether she can be the Sohaila she wants to be in Afghanistan. ""Of course"", she declares confidently. ""It's my country and I don't want to go to another country."" But a year without school must have been hard. ""It's not just me, it's all the girls of Afghanistan"" she remarks stoically. ""It's a sad memory..."" The Taliban closed schools for girls in Afghanistan casting an uncertain future for many women like Sohaila Her voice trails off as she breaks down in tears. ""I was the top student.""

"Labour vows to freeze fuel bills with windfall taxWith bills set to soar this winter, the party says its plan would save typical households Â£1,000.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Watch: I'm not going to apologise for holiday with my wife and kids - Starmer Sir Keir Starmer has said families would ""not pay a penny more"" on their energy bills this winter under Labour's plans to tackle rising living costs. The Labour leader claimed his proposals would save the average household Â£1,000. The package would be paid for, in part, by a big increase in tax on oil and gas company profits. But economists said the plan would cost as much as the Covid furlough scheme, if it was extended beyond this winter. The government has already announcedwhat is says is Â£37bnof support for hard-pressed families, but it is under pressure to do more, with bills set to rocket over the winter. Outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide extra support, when they take office on 5 September. How high will my energy bill go? How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? How will I get the cost-of-living payments? The Treasury are working up ideas for how the new prime minister could provide more help with living costs. But the two contenders for the job, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have indicated they are not keen on extending the windfall tax on oil and gas companies - or freezing the price cap - meaning its unlikely to happen unless they have a change of heart. Labour's intervention serves as a challenge to both leadership hopefuls to say what further support they may offer, and how they would pay for it. The party says its plan would be paid for in three ways: Backdating the windfall tax to January and accounting for higher oil and gas prices to raiseÂ£8bn Dropping the Â£400 energy rebate and other pledges made by Tory leadership candidates to raiseÂ£14bn By reducing inflation with lower energy bills, leading to a cut in government debt interest payments ofÂ£7bn The Labour leader said freezing the energy price cap at the current level of Â£1,971 a year for the typical household would bring inflation down by four percentage points. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 9.4% in June, the highest level for more than 40 years. The Bank of England has warned it could peak at more than 13% later this year. Labour estimate their plans would cost about Â£15bn more than the government's scheme to give households Â£400 this October (and Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak's proposals). Labour estimate that about Â£3.5bn of their extra spending would come from changes to the government's windfall tax on oil and gas companies - including making it apply to profits from January rather than May and getting rid of a government tax-relief scheme to encourage investment from these firms. The party also expects to get Â£4.7bn extra in existing taxes because oil and gas prices are now likely to be much higher than they were when the last official forecasts were made. And Labour say that freezing energy prices would stop inflation rising as high as it would have done otherwise. They estimate this would reduce government borrowing costs by Â£7.2bn this year. But economists warn it's delaying borrowing costs rather than saving them - they say that stopping the subsidy would push up inflation and borrowing costs. The main reason for high inflation is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, although households have also been hit by higher petrol, diesel and food costs. Sir Keir said he would have to ""assess"" the situation in April, but Labour's plans were about helping people through the winter. He added further measures to reduce inflation may be needed next year, and argued in the medium to long term Labour was calling for further measures to bring costs down such as insulating millions of homes. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson and Sir Keir have both been criticised for going on holiday as economic turmoil - driven by rising energy bills - deepens. The Labour leader rejected claims he has been missing in action, saying he had been working on his plan for weeks and would not ""apologise for going on holiday with his wife and kids"". ""It's the first time we've had a holiday for about three years,"" he said. Former Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis rejected suggestions that Mr Johnson had ""thrown in the towel"". He told LBC radio: ""Even when you are not in the office in Downing Street you are working."" It comes as the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the government would need to find Â£12bn simply to achieve what it was aiming to do with the Â£24bn package announced in May, due to soaring energy prices. The think tank said that in May energy prices were expected to rise by 95% in 2022/23 but are now expected to rise by 141%. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC Labour's plan was ""a very big and very expensive plan"" that would be on the same scale of support for the public as the furlough scheme during the pandemic, if it was extended beyond the initial six months planned. ""Of course, what it does achieve is to protect everyone entirely from the increases in energy prices so if that is what you want to achieve that is what you need to do but you do need to realise that is a very expensive thing to do,"" he added. The idea of freezing the price cap is backed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP. A Treasury spokeswoman said the government had ""continually taken action to help households by phasing in Â£37bn worth of support throughout the year"". This includes Â£400 off energy bills for all UK households and an additional Â£650 for eight million low-income households. Additional reporting: Becky Morton Starmer to call for energy price cap freeze Lib Dems call to scrap energy price cap rise Energy bills could go up before October price rise Energy bills forecast to hit over Â£4,200 a year How much are energy bills going up?

Sprinter pulled over for second time by policeSprinter Ricardo Dos Santos published a series of video tweets of him being questioned by police.,"The Portuguese sprinter said some unseen footage is with his lawyer A sprinter who was allegedly racially profiled during a stop and search has said he was ""worried"" at being pulled over for a second time by armed police. Ricardo Dos Santospublished a series of video tweets,externalof him being pulled over and questioned by police in Paddington at 04:00 BST on Sunday. The Met said officers were concerned the driver may have been using a phone. The force has now referred itself to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). This video can not be played Ricardo Dos Santos published videos of him being pulled over and questioned by police The 27-year-old told the BBC his phone was between his thighs, and accused the Met of ""over-policing"". Five officersface a gross misconduct hearingover a stop-and-search in 2020 involving the Portuguese sprinter and his partner. Speaking to Radio 5 Live about the incident, Mr Dos Santos explained that he felt unsafe to stop on the A40 Westway and ""went around"" the police car to avoid driving into the back of it. He then continued driving for a further five minutes. In a statement, the Met said: ""The officers clearly indicated for the car to pull over but it failed to do so and they called for further assistance."" Mr Dos Santos said: ""I missed the turn to come out and I felt there wasn't anywhere else that was safe enough to stop because the flyover is pretty dark so I took the next exit... and stopped at the next available street and I parked up and waited for them to come to me."" ""It is a long time on a regular street but this was a flyover. For my safety, and based on my previous incidents with them [police], I thought that the best place to stop was somewhere lit up and with the possibility of witnesses."" Mr Dos Santos said he counted seven armed police officers and that one took his baton out of his pocket ""out of frustration ready to smash the glass"" after not knowing how to open the car door. He added ""nothing had changed"" two years after he was pulled over with his partner, Bianca Williams, and their daughter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, Scotland Yard said it had ""recorded this matter as a public complaint"" and referred itself to the police watchdog, ""recognising the public interest"". An IOPC spokesperson said: ""We will be assessing the available information in order to make an informed decision on the level of our involvement."" In July 2020, footage of Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos being searched and handcuffed was widely shared on social media, with Ms Williams later accusing the police of racially profiling them. After the search, details of the couple's three-month-old baby were also stored on a police database called Merlin, used to record information on children who become known to the authorities. In April, the IOPC said an acting police sergeant and four police constables will all face a gross misconduct disciplinary hearing over the incident. Ricardo Dos Santos has represented Portugal in the 400m sprint Mr Dos Santos revealed this was the third time he had been stopped by police whilst driving in two years.  On Sunday he said he warned the officers that his Tesla car had cameras which film the exterior of the vehicle. He said: ""I was worried for my safety, so much so that I called Bianca and I told her to log onto the car's cameras and look at them just in case anything happened once I'd pulled over. ""I stay as calm as possible because for me this isn't a surprising situation, it's happened many times so it's my norm. ""I believe it was over-policing for a phone."" In an earlier statement, the Met Police said: ""Armed officers were on routine patrol in a marked police vehicle. ""They saw a car travelling eastbound on the A40 Westway and were concerned the driver may be using a mobile phone at the wheel. ""The driver stopped about five minutes later in Orsett Terrace W2, and the officers spoke to him about why they wanted to stop the vehicle. ""Following the conversation the vehicle was allowed on its way. We have since contacted the driver via Twitter to invite him to contact us if he would like to discuss this matter further."" Mr Dos Santos said he would not have direct contact with the Met but would leave it to his lawyer to deal with. Follow BBC London onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Giggs emails blocked over volume sent to ex - court,"Ryan Giggs arriving at Manchester Crown Court on Monday Former Manchester United star Ryan Giggs headbutted his ex-girlfriend and threatened to do the same to her sister, a court has heard. The ex-Wales manager, 48, is on trial accused of controlling behaviour, as well as assaulting Kate Greville, 38, and her younger sister Emma, 26. Emma Greville told jurors he said ""I'll headbutt you next"" after assaulting her sister in an argument at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester. Mr Giggs denies all charges. Giving evidence from behind a screen at Manchester Crown Court, Emma Greville said she saw Mr Giggs place his hands on her sister's shoulders ""and with lots of force use his head to headbutt her on her lip"". She said Kate Greville screamed and fell to the floor and Mr Giggs told Emma Greville that it was ""her fault"" he had done it, then threatened to do the same to her. She said she ""felt fear"" and that when Kate Greville told her to call the police, Mr Giggs told her not to, telling her to ""think of his daughter and his career"". Earlier in her evidence, Emma Greville had described how her sister and Mr Giggs had returned to the house separately on 1 November 2020 after going out for a meal at the Stock Exchange hotel where they had planned to stay that night. But Kate Greville had messaged her sister, who was pet-sitting at the house, to ask her to pack her things as she was leaving that night. She said her sister arrived first and was ""upset"". Giggs' ex screamed in pain on 999 call, court told Covid lockdown with Giggs was hell, ex tells court Mr Giggs arrived about 15 minutes later and was ""annoyed"" and ""not happy"". She said Kate Greville had been drinking and Mr Giggs was ""very drunk"". Emma Greville told the jury how the couple argued in the hallway and that she had come from the kitchen to see Mr Giggs lying on top of her sister grabbing for her phone. Kate Greville asked her sister to ""get him off me"", she said. Emma Greville described how she put her arms around his waist and pulled as her sister pushed with her legs and said, that as she did so, he ""turned to the right and his elbow touched my jaw"". ""As a result, I let go,"" she said. The trial has started its second week at Manchester Crown Court She said he did not mention what had happened, ""even though I was visibly upset"" but he did say he was ""disappointed"" in her, she said. Emma Greville said the argument between the couple continued and moved into the kitchen, where the alleged headbutt then took place. The court also heard Emma Greville had been critical of a photograph her older sister arranged to be taken a couple of days after the alleged assault on 1 November that appeared to show her injuries. Kate Greville previously told the court the photo was taken in an attempt to get the paparazzi off her back. Asked about a series of messages between Kate Greville and her friend Courtney which showed the younger sister disagreed with the arrangement, Emma Greville confirmed to the court she thought it was immoral to set up a fake picture made to look genuine. She was also asked about messages between the two sisters on 16 November, when the article was published. In one, Emma Greville asked her sister how she felt about the article. Kate Greville said in response, she thought she looked terrible, but that was probably a good thing as it ""looks less staged"". Emma Greville responded: ""I think they are good photos as it looks real"". Asked if the bruises were not real, Emma Greville told the court: ""They were real."" Emma Greville was asked if she had told the police her sister had staged fake photos. She said she hadn't, but that her sister had. The court also heard from Mr Giggs' neighbour who said he was banging on her door on the night of the alleged assault. Linda Cheung, who had known the defendant for more than 20 years, said he was ""distressed"" and asked her to help him. ""He said words to affect that Kate had been accusing him of seeing other women and he wanted me to and sort her out,"" she said. Regarding the accusation of him seeing other girls, she said her reaction was: ""Oh Ryan, not that again."" He told her Ms Greville was refusing to leave. Mrs Cheung said she refused to go over as she did not want to get involved when she did not understand the situation. He later left. Later, in the early hours. after she saw the police come and go, she said she saw a small white car arrive with two women and another male. She described them ""as screaming, shouting and laughing"" and ""running up and down the drive"" Kate Greville had the dog Mack in her arms and was talking to him. She described the mood as ""high jinks"". The court was also told a firm which employed Kate Greville had blocked Mr Giggs' emails due to the quantity he was sending her. Elsa Roodt said the email volume was ""intense"" and ""Kate could not do her work"". Ms Roodt, who has a public relations firm in the United Arab Emirates, was giving her evidence via a video link from Dubai. She told the court Ms Greville had gone to help her and colleague Katie Harvey to set up a new office in Abu Dhabi in 2016. She said Ms Greville was ""happy and confident and bubbly"" and had socialised when she first arrived. Ryan Giggs' football career ended with him as the most decorated player in the Premier League era, with 34 trophies But, over the two years she worked there, she said there was a ""noticeable difference"" and they did not spend as much time with her. She appeared ""nervous"" and she was ""obsessed"" with her phone and being available at all times, said Ms Roodt. She was asked about an alleged incident at a hotel in Dubai, when Mr Giggs was visiting and when she had seen Ms Greville the following day, she told her they had had some sort of ""argument"". ""She was very upset,"" she said. I was slave to Giggs' demands, ex tells court Giggs threw ex out of hotel room naked, court told Ms Roodt added she had seen bruises on Ms Greville's wrist and had asked her where they were from. She said Ms Greville told her they had had ""rough sex"" after the argument. Ms Roodt was also asked about seeing Ms Greville in February 2020 when she visited Ms Harvey's home while on holiday in Dubai with Mr Giggs. Ms Roodt said Ms Greville described how ""she had been crying all night and seemed very upset"". She said she had bruises on her arm and had said Mr Giggs had been ""physical with her"" in the hotel room. Mr Giggs had phoned and messaged Ms Harvey during the two hours Ms Roodt was visiting. Some of his messages were ""loving"", she said, but some were ""rude"". ""It was like they were coming from two different people,"" she said. Under cross examination, Ms Roodt said she had met Mr Giggs about three times. She said she had not been present during any of the couple's arguments, and having been at a wedding with the couple in Spain, she agreed he had appeared kind, friendly and sociable at that event. The court heard Ms Greville was currently a managing partner in the UK branch of Ms Roodt's business. The trial continues.

"Giggs emails blocked over volume sent to ex - courtA firm which had employed Ryan Giggs' ex-girlfriend blocked his emails due to the ""intense"" volume.Wales","Ryan Giggs arriving at Manchester Crown Court on Monday Former Manchester United star Ryan Giggs headbutted his ex-girlfriend and threatened to do the same to her sister, a court has heard. The ex-Wales manager, 48, is on trial accused of controlling behaviour, as well as assaulting Kate Greville, 38, and her younger sister Emma, 26. Emma Greville told jurors he said ""I'll headbutt you next"" after assaulting her sister in an argument at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester. Mr Giggs denies all charges. Giving evidence from behind a screen at Manchester Crown Court, Emma Greville said she saw Mr Giggs place his hands on her sister's shoulders ""and with lots of force use his head to headbutt her on her lip"". She said Kate Greville screamed and fell to the floor and Mr Giggs told Emma Greville that it was ""her fault"" he had done it, then threatened to do the same to her. She said she ""felt fear"" and that when Kate Greville told her to call the police, Mr Giggs told her not to, telling her to ""think of his daughter and his career"". Earlier in her evidence, Emma Greville had described how her sister and Mr Giggs had returned to the house separately on 1 November 2020 after going out for a meal at the Stock Exchange hotel where they had planned to stay that night. But Kate Greville had messaged her sister, who was pet-sitting at the house, to ask her to pack her things as she was leaving that night. She said her sister arrived first and was ""upset"". Giggs' ex screamed in pain on 999 call, court told Covid lockdown with Giggs was hell, ex tells court Mr Giggs arrived about 15 minutes later and was ""annoyed"" and ""not happy"". She said Kate Greville had been drinking and Mr Giggs was ""very drunk"". Emma Greville told the jury how the couple argued in the hallway and that she had come from the kitchen to see Mr Giggs lying on top of her sister grabbing for her phone. Kate Greville asked her sister to ""get him off me"", she said. Emma Greville described how she put her arms around his waist and pulled as her sister pushed with her legs and said, that as she did so, he ""turned to the right and his elbow touched my jaw"". ""As a result, I let go,"" she said. The trial has started its second week at Manchester Crown Court She said he did not mention what had happened, ""even though I was visibly upset"" but he did say he was ""disappointed"" in her, she said. Emma Greville said the argument between the couple continued and moved into the kitchen, where the alleged headbutt then took place. The court also heard Emma Greville had been critical of a photograph her older sister arranged to be taken a couple of days after the alleged assault on 1 November that appeared to show her injuries. Kate Greville previously told the court the photo was taken in an attempt to get the paparazzi off her back. Asked about a series of messages between Kate Greville and her friend Courtney which showed the younger sister disagreed with the arrangement, Emma Greville confirmed to the court she thought it was immoral to set up a fake picture made to look genuine. She was also asked about messages between the two sisters on 16 November, when the article was published. In one, Emma Greville asked her sister how she felt about the article. Kate Greville said in response, she thought she looked terrible, but that was probably a good thing as it ""looks less staged"". Emma Greville responded: ""I think they are good photos as it looks real"". Asked if the bruises were not real, Emma Greville told the court: ""They were real."" Emma Greville was asked if she had told the police her sister had staged fake photos. She said she hadn't, but that her sister had. The court also heard from Mr Giggs' neighbour who said he was banging on her door on the night of the alleged assault. Linda Cheung, who had known the defendant for more than 20 years, said he was ""distressed"" and asked her to help him. ""He said words to affect that Kate had been accusing him of seeing other women and he wanted me to and sort her out,"" she said. Regarding the accusation of him seeing other girls, she said her reaction was: ""Oh Ryan, not that again."" He told her Ms Greville was refusing to leave. Mrs Cheung said she refused to go over as she did not want to get involved when she did not understand the situation. He later left. Later, in the early hours. after she saw the police come and go, she said she saw a small white car arrive with two women and another male. She described them ""as screaming, shouting and laughing"" and ""running up and down the drive"" Kate Greville had the dog Mack in her arms and was talking to him. She described the mood as ""high jinks"". The court was also told a firm which employed Kate Greville had blocked Mr Giggs' emails due to the quantity he was sending her. Elsa Roodt said the email volume was ""intense"" and ""Kate could not do her work"". Ms Roodt, who has a public relations firm in the United Arab Emirates, was giving her evidence via a video link from Dubai. She told the court Ms Greville had gone to help her and colleague Katie Harvey to set up a new office in Abu Dhabi in 2016. She said Ms Greville was ""happy and confident and bubbly"" and had socialised when she first arrived. Ryan Giggs' football career ended with him as the most decorated player in the Premier League era, with 34 trophies But, over the two years she worked there, she said there was a ""noticeable difference"" and they did not spend as much time with her.

Thunderstorms begin in the UK after heatwaveWarnings of travel disruption and flooding - but drought restrictions remain in place in many areas.UK,"This video can not be played Watch: Lightning strikes light up Scottish skies Thunderstorms are hitting the UK and weather warnings are in place as a spell of hot weather draws to a close. There is a risk of torrential downpours, causing travel disruption and some flooding, the Met Office says. Three days ofalerts,externalhave been issued for most areas, ending on Wednesday. Some parts of Devon and Cornwall have experienced flooding, after stormy conditions brought heavy rain showers and hail to parts of the South West. Temperatures topped 34C in parts of the UK at the weekend and experts have said a lengthy period of rain is needed to end the drought declared in parts of England on Friday. These areas include Devon and Cornwall, Kent and south London, East Anglia and the East Midlands. Heavy rain is unlikely to ease the drought because rainwater struggles to permeate dry ground, meaning it will run off the dehydrated surface and lead to flash flooding in some areas, the Met Office said as it issued a number of weather warnings. Lighting in a photo taken from Bo'ness, Falkirk, on Sunday Much of Scotland was hit by heavy rain late on Sunday and into Monday. A Tesco supermarket and Vue cinema in Inverness have been closed after their roofs collapsed following an intense downpour at Inshes Retail Park. A lightning strike hasblown a hole in the roof of a home in the Isle of Man, where emergency services confirmed four homes were hit during a thunderstorm overnight. The Met Office also forecast rain to move across the country from the west throughout Monday, with much of Wales and England - other than the south-east of England - expected to see thundery downpours.

An amber warning for thunderstorms, meaning flooding and travel disruption is likely, came into force for south-west England at 14:00 BST on Monday and will remain until 20:00. Heavy showers caused flooding in areas of Devon and Cornwall on Monday afternoon, includinga flash flood on a roundabout near the river in Truro. A roundabout in Cornwall was flooded but the water quickly drained away Staff had to clear out floodwater inside The Milky Way Adventure Park in north Devon Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said there have been ""very difficult"" driving conditions and some hail and lightning accompanying the rainfall. He said the stormy conditions could lead to some power cuts as well as flash flooding, particularly in towns and more urban areas. Yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms are in place across much of the rest of the UK, excluding the north of Scotland. A couple on Saltburn pier look out over the sand as a thick sea fret shrouds the beach While parts of the country have been hit by rain, the south-east is experiencing another day of warm temperatures, with highs of 29C (84.2F) forecast for Cambridgeshire. But the mercury is set to sink back to more seasonal averages by the middle of the week. The Met Office's Grahame Madge warned heavy rain could lead to flash flooding as the ground was ""like concrete"" and water will run off before it can be absorbed and drain away. He added it could take months to determine if the UK has recovered from the ""very dry summer"". Stuart Singleton-White, from the Angling Trust, stressed the expected rainfall ""will not mean the end of the drought"". He said the damage the dry weather has done to rivers and wildlife was ""so severe"" that the country needs ""a wet autumn and winter"" to move out of drought conditions. Visitors to the National Waterways Museum in Ellesmere Port during a shower on Monday Prof Hannah Cloke from the University of Reading said ""really heavy rain can overwhelm"" water drainage systems in urban areas as it often ""cannot run away quick enough"". The hydrology expert also highlighted the Tube system in London - which was affected by flooding last year - as being at risk, alongside underground car parks. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has told residents of the capital to prepare for flash flooding - urging people tocontact Floodline,externaland to check their local authority's website for ways to reduce the chances and ""minimise the consequences"" of being flooded. While the UK waits for rain to replenish dwindling water levels in reservoirs, some hosepipe bans and other water restrictions have been imposed. South West Water are the latest water boards to introduce a ban, coming into effect in Cornwall and parts of Devon on 23 August. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? How the heatwave is changing landscapes The extreme heat has led to a string of wildfireserupting across tinder-dry swathes of Ashdown Forest in East Sussexand on theStudland peninsula in Purbeck, Dorset,over the weekend. Firefighters in Derbyshire have recorded theirbusiest week since their current incident recording system began13 years ago, attending 187 fires between Monday and Sunday. On Monday, two men were charged with arson after it was claimed a disposable barbecue was thrown into Norfolk woodland. Aleksejs Sokolovs, and Darius Lazausaks, both 45 and from Boston, Lincolnshire, have been accused of arson with intent to damage property over the fire at Bawsey Country Park, near King's Lynn, on Sunday.

Parents left without childcare as nurseries shut,"The number of childcare providers in England has been dropping steadily since 2015 Parents are being left without childcare as nurseries shut at short notice due to financial pressures and staff shortages. The Pregnant Then Screwed campaign group said it had been ""inundated"" with messages from parents whose local nursery had closed suddenly. Nurseries are facing increased energy, food and staffing costs, as well as struggling to recruit. The government said it was increasing funding paid to childcare providers. But the Early Years Alliance, which represents around 14,000 providers in England and also has its own nurseries, said the sector was facing its worst crisis in recruitment and cost increases in 20 years. 'It shouldn't be a choice between baby and career' Summer childcare costs so high 'I'd be paying to work' Gabrielle Drake said she was left in a ""mad scramble"" to find a new nursery for her 13-month-old son when his current provider closed for good overnight. Parents received an email on 5 August saying the nursery would be permanently closing at the end of the day as the company was ""undergoing a restructure"". Gabrielle and her partner both work full time and they were unable to find a new nursery at such short notice, so now have to rely on her parents to look after their son for a month. The 35-year-old from Leeds has managed to find a new nursery for September. She contacted 20 local nurseries but only four replied to say they had spaces, two of which are brand new so do not have Ofsted inspection reports yet. As her son was not attending nursery the day it closed they were unable to collect his belongings, including clothes and nappies. She said the closure was also disruptive for her son who had settled in well at the nursery and made friends. Welcome Nurseries, which owns the branch, went into administration earlier this month - six of its 32 sites were closed as part of a sale. Linda Mills, head of childcare at Welcome Nurseries, said the company took the ""difficult decision"" to close the sites as they had very low occupancy and together with rising costs ""this meant they were not sustainable"". Where possible, she said children had been able to access the company's other nurseries and in the areas most affected families were being helped by local authorities. Gabrielle's local nursery offered no alternative provision after it closed suddenly Harriet Butterworth, managing director at Cottontails nursery in Warrington, said she was worried she would be forced to close because of increased costs. The nursery is running at a loss and has already raised fees twice this year to cover increased staffing costs. Ms Butterworth said she had increased salaries for her lowest paid workers by 12.5% to help attract and retain staff. ""We're competing with the likes of Hermes, Amazon, just basic retail jobs, who are paying these really high hourly amounts, with much more flexible hours,"" Ms Butterworth added. She said the nursery was also facing increased food and energy costs, with her gas and electricity bill more than doubling to hit Â£9,000 for the last quarter. The nursery has been forced to turn off its boiler and cut down its use of the gas oven to save energy. Harriet Butterworth says she is only able to recruit staff by increasing pay Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said in his 20 years working in the sector he had ""never witnessed such a crisis in terms of recruitment and retention and cost pressures"". He blamed underinvestment in the sector by the government, as well as increased costs for things like energy, food and staff. Parents of three and four year olds in England are entitled to15 free hours per week of childcare. Working families may also be eligible for an additional 15 hours per week of funded early education. But Mr Leitch said this allocation was not adequately funded by the government, leaving providers to make up the shortfall. He said many providers were forced to increase fees for other parents to offset the cost as a result. A survey of 2,000 early years providers in March,externalfound 30% were currently operating at a loss, while 34% said they expected to be in 12 months' time. Three years ago the alliance operated 132 pre-school settings but it now only has 65, with more than half closing for financial reasons. The number of childcare providers in England has been falling steadily since 2015, with the number of nurseries and pre-schools dropping by 196 between August 2021 and March this year,according to inspector Ofsted,external. However, Jonathan Broadbery, from the National Day Nurseries Association, said anecdotally the situation had got worse since March, with nurseries under increasing financial pressure. In April, there was an increase in the minimum wage and National Insurance contributions paid by employers, while temporary business rates relief introduced during the pandemic ended in England. Mr Leitch said nurseries were also struggling to recruit, as people are leaving the sector ""in their droves"" for better paid jobs because they felt ""exhausted and undervalued"". Many businesses have increased salaries as a result but this was not financially sustainable, he added. Others have been forced to reduce hours or close suddenly because of a lack of staff. Pregnant Then Screwed said it had received more than 60 messages in recent weeks from mothers whose child's nursery had closed at short notice. The group's campaigns manager, Lauren Fabianski, said many were worried about how they would be able to work without childcare. She added that some nurseries were booked-up until November next year, so it was difficult to find somewhere with spaces. A government spokeswoman said it had spent more than Â£4bn in each of the past five years to support families with the cost of childcare and it had not seen a substantial number of parents unable to secure a childcare place. She added that the government had also announced additional funding for local authorities to increase the hourly rates paid to childcare providers and it was increasing funding to support employers with their costs.

"Labour vows to freeze fuel bills with windfall taxWith bills set to soar this winter, the party says its plan would save typical households Â£1,000.UK Politics","This video can not be played Watch: I'm not going to apologise for holiday with my wife and kids - Starmer Sir Keir Starmer has said families would ""not pay a penny more"" on their energy bills this winter under Labour's plans to tackle rising living costs. The Labour leader claimed his proposals would save the average household Â£1,000. The package would be paid for, in part, by a big increase in tax on oil and gas company profits. But economists said the plan would cost as much as the Covid furlough scheme, if it was extended beyond this winter. The government has already announcedwhat is says is Â£37bnof support for hard-pressed families, but it is under pressure to do more, with bills set to rocket over the winter. Outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide extra support, when they take office on 5 September. How high will my energy bill go? How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? How will I get the cost-of-living payments? The Treasury are working up ideas for how the new prime minister could provide more help with living costs. But the two contenders for the job, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have indicated they are not keen on extending the windfall tax on oil and gas companies - or freezing the price cap - meaning its unlikely to happen unless they have a change of heart. Labour's intervention serves as a challenge to both leadership hopefuls to say what further support they may offer, and how they would pay for it. The party says its plan would be paid for in three ways: Backdating the windfall tax to January and accounting for higher oil and gas prices to raiseÂ£8bn Dropping the Â£400 energy rebate and other pledges made by Tory leadership candidates to raiseÂ£14bn By reducing inflation with lower energy bills, leading to a cut in government debt interest payments ofÂ£7bn The Labour leader said freezing the energy price cap at the current level of Â£1,971 a year for the typical household would bring inflation down by four percentage points. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 9.4% in June, the highest level for more than 40 years. The Bank of England has warned it could peak at more than 13% later this year. Labour estimate their plans would cost about Â£15bn more than the government's scheme to give households Â£400 this October (and Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak's proposals). Labour estimate that about Â£3.5bn of their extra spending would come from changes to the government's windfall tax on oil and gas companies - including making it apply to profits from January rather than May and getting rid of a government tax-relief scheme to encourage investment from these firms. The party also expects to get Â£4.7bn extra in existing taxes because oil and gas prices are now likely to be much higher than they were when the last official forecasts were made. And Labour say that freezing energy prices would stop inflation rising as high as it would have done otherwise. They estimate this would reduce government borrowing costs by Â£7.2bn this year. But economists warn it's delaying borrowing costs rather than saving them - they say that stopping the subsidy would push up inflation and borrowing costs. The main reason for high inflation is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, although households have also been hit by higher petrol, diesel and food costs. Sir Keir said he would have to ""assess"" the situation in April, but Labour's plans were about helping people through the winter. He added further measures to reduce inflation may be needed next year, and argued in the medium to long term Labour was calling for further measures to bring costs down such as insulating millions of homes. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson and Sir Keir have both been criticised for going on holiday as economic turmoil - driven by rising energy bills - deepens. The Labour leader rejected claims he has been missing in action, saying he had been working on his plan for weeks and would not ""apologise for going on holiday with his wife and kids"". ""It's the first time we've had a holiday for about three years,"" he said. Former Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis rejected suggestions that Mr Johnson had ""thrown in the towel"". He told LBC radio: ""Even when you are not in the office in Downing Street you are working."" It comes as the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the government would need to find Â£12bn simply to achieve what it was aiming to do with the Â£24bn package announced in May, due to soaring energy prices. The think tank said that in May energy prices were expected to rise by 95% in 2022/23 but are now expected to rise by 141%. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC Labour's plan was ""a very big and very expensive plan"" that would be on the same scale of support for the public as the furlough scheme during the pandemic, if it was extended beyond the initial six months planned. ""Of course, what it does achieve is to protect everyone entirely from the increases in energy prices so if that is what you want to achieve that is what you need to do but you do need to realise that is a very expensive thing to do,"" he added. The idea of freezing the price cap is backed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP. A Treasury spokeswoman said the government had ""continually taken action to help households by phasing in Â£37bn worth of support throughout the year"". This includes Â£400 off energy bills for all UK households and an additional Â£650 for eight million low-income households.

"Labour vows to freeze fuel bills with windfall taxWith bills set to soar this winter, the party says its plan would save typical households Â£1,000.","This video can not be played Watch: I'm not going to apologise for holiday with my wife and kids - Starmer Sir Keir Starmer has said families would ""not pay a penny more"" on their energy bills this winter under Labour's plans to tackle rising living costs. The Labour leader claimed his proposals would save the average household Â£1,000. The package would be paid for, in part, by a big increase in tax on oil and gas company profits. But economists said the plan would cost as much as the Covid furlough scheme, if it was extended beyond this winter. The government has already announcedwhat is says is Â£37bnof support for hard-pressed families, but it is under pressure to do more, with bills set to rocket over the winter. Outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide extra support, when they take office on 5 September. How high will my energy bill go? How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? How will I get the cost-of-living payments? The Treasury are working up ideas for how the new prime minister could provide more help with living costs. But the two contenders for the job, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have indicated they are not keen on extending the windfall tax on oil and gas companies - or freezing the price cap - meaning its unlikely to happen unless they have a change of heart. Labour's intervention serves as a challenge to both leadership hopefuls to say what further support they may offer, and how they would pay for it. The party says its plan would be paid for in three ways: Backdating the windfall tax to January and accounting for higher oil and gas prices to raiseÂ£8bn Dropping the Â£400 energy rebate and other pledges made by Tory leadership candidates to raiseÂ£14bn By reducing inflation with lower energy bills, leading to a cut in government debt interest payments ofÂ£7bn The Labour leader said freezing the energy price cap at the current level of Â£1,971 a year for the typical household would bring inflation down by four percentage points. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 9.4% in June, the highest level for more than 40 years. The Bank of England has warned it could peak at more than 13% later this year. Labour estimate their plans would cost about Â£15bn more than the government's scheme to give households Â£400 this October (and Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak's proposals). Labour estimate that about Â£3.5bn of their extra spending would come from changes to the government's windfall tax on oil and gas companies - including making it apply to profits from January rather than May and getting rid of a government tax-relief scheme to encourage investment from these firms. The party also expects to get Â£4.7bn extra in existing taxes because oil and gas prices are now likely to be much higher than they were when the last official forecasts were made. And Labour say that freezing energy prices would stop inflation rising as high as it would have done otherwise. They estimate this would reduce government borrowing costs by Â£7.2bn this year. But economists warn it's delaying borrowing costs rather than saving them - they say that stopping the subsidy would push up inflation and borrowing costs. The main reason for high inflation is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, although households have also been hit by higher petrol, diesel and food costs. Sir Keir said he would have to ""assess"" the situation in April, but Labour's plans were about helping people through the winter. He added further measures to reduce inflation may be needed next year, and argued in the medium to long term Labour was calling for further measures to bring costs down such as insulating millions of homes. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson and Sir Keir have both been criticised for going on holiday as economic turmoil - driven by rising energy bills - deepens. The Labour leader rejected claims he has been missing in action, saying he had been working on his plan for weeks and would not ""apologise for going on holiday with his wife and kids"". ""It's the first time we've had a holiday for about three years,"" he said. Former Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis rejected suggestions that Mr Johnson had ""thrown in the towel"". He told LBC radio: ""Even when you are not in the office in Downing Street you are working."" It comes as the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the government would need to find Â£12bn simply to achieve what it was aiming to do with the Â£24bn package announced in May, due to soaring energy prices. The think tank said that in May energy prices were expected to rise by 95% in 2022/23 but are now expected to rise by 141%. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC Labour's plan was ""a very big and very expensive plan"" that would be on the same scale of support for the public as the furlough scheme during the pandemic, if it was extended beyond the initial six months planned. ""Of course, what it does achieve is to protect everyone entirely from the increases in energy prices so if that is what you want to achieve that is what you need to do but you do need to realise that is a very expensive thing to do,"" he added. The idea of freezing the price cap is backed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP. A Treasury spokeswoman said the government had ""continually taken action to help households by phasing in Â£37bn worth of support throughout the year"". This includes Â£400 off energy bills for all UK households and an additional Â£650 for eight million low-income households.

'Just weird': Ex-Australian PM held 'secret roles',"Scott Morrison's government lost a general election in May Australian PM Anthony Albanese says he will investigate reports that his predecessor, Scott Morrison, secretly assumed three roles in the ministry. Mr Morrison became joint minister for the health, finance and resources portfolios in the two years before he lost power in May, local media report. Mr Albanese said he would seek legal advice about the decisions, calling them ""unacceptable"" and ""just weird"". The former prime minister has declined to comment. On Monday, Governor-General David Hurley - the Queen's representative in Australia - confirmed he had signed an ""administrative instrument"" that had allowed Mr Morrison to secretly take on the portfolios. It was ""consistent with section 64 of the constitution"", a spokesperson said. But Mr Albanese, law experts and Mr Morrison's former colleagues have criticised the secrecy surrounding it. Even some ministers were reportedly not aware they were sharing portfolios with the former prime minister. ""This is the sort of 'tin pot' activity that we would ridicule if it was in a non-democratic country,"" Mr Albanese told reporters on Monday. How Morrison ran out of miracles 2022 election: 'A shock to the system' Local media reported that former Health Minister Greg Hunt agreed in 2020 to share his portfolio in the event he became incapacitated from Covid. But then-Finance Minister Mathias Cormann - nowhead of the OECD- only learned last week that his role had been jointly held, said a report by local outlet News.com.au. Mr Morrison was sworn in as a second resources minister - joining Keith Pitt - last year. Mr Morrison used his powers to block a gas exploration licence in New South Wales - a decision opposed by Mr Pitt. Mr Albanese said he would not speculate on forthcoming legal advice but accused his predecessor of having governed ""in the shadows"". When asked to respond to Mr Albanese's comments, Mr Morrison said he wasn't aware of them. ""Since leaving the job I haven't engaged in any day-to-day politics,"" he told Sky News Australia. Mr Morrison's deputy from June 2021, Barnaby Joyce, said he did not have prior knowledge of the appointments. ""I found out about it, and I disagree with it. I believe in a cabinet system of government where ministers are responsible for their own portfolio. We don't have a presidential form of government,"" Mr Joyce told Channel 7. The centre-right coalition suffered a convincing defeat in May's general election. It lost many seats in cities - where climate action and political integrity were seen as key issues. In July, Mr Morrison drew controversy by telling churchgoers ""don't trust in governments"" and ""don't trust in the United Nations"" during a speech in Perth. This is ""weird"". That's what Mr Albanese (and a number of constitutional experts) have said about the reports. There are so many questions and you'd be forgiven for being confused. No-one is sure who knew what, when. It would be normal for a leader to make sure that someone can step up and do the job if a minister is incapacitated, especially at the height of the pandemic. But there are many ways of doing this. Why did it have to be him? And more crucially, why the secrecy? As it stands, nothing about this gels. But here's why this could potentially be a big deal. For a leader of any country, let alone a democracy, to take over several portfolios without the public's knowledge or the knowledge of his own colleagues, raises serious questions. If confirmed, this also means that the then-prime minister was potentially aiming to centralise power so that the decision-making would ultimately come down to him. Remember, this was happening at a time when Australia was in and out of lockdowns and when the Morrison government faced a lot of criticism for the way they handled the vaccination programme. Confidence in the Morrison government was waning - but as the current prime minister put it, it seems that even Scott Morrison had no confidence in the Morrison government.

The Taliban have marked the first
anniversary of their takeover of Afghanistan by parading in the streets of Kabul and declaring a national holiday. But the UN has warned that millions face malnutrition and urged the world not to forget the plight of the country's women and girls. We'd like to thank our correspondents who have answered dozens of questions from our readers on issues  ranging from girlsâ education, to
armed resistance to the Taliban, to the recent killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in
Kabul. And thanks too to our readers for all your thoughtful and interesting questions. The BBC has much more coverage from Afghanistan, including: And we will of course continue to cover developments in Afghanistan on our news pages. We're wrapping up our live coverage shortly, thank you for joining us as we have marked one year since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.

Syed AnwarBBC Afghan Service I was in the BBC bureau earlier than usual that morning, and in some ways it felt like a normal news day - assigning stories, chatting with colleagues. But by mid-morning, the atmosphere began to change as it became clear the government was indeed about to fall. I received a call from my son, who worked in the finance ministry, and he told me his colleagues were fleeing the office - there were rumours the Taliban had reached the gates of Kabul. When I left the BBC building a short time later - a place I had worked for so many years - I had a sense I might never return. By the time I got home, dozens of scenarios were playing through my mind about how my familyâs life might be about to change. Two days later, at midnight, we were offered places on an evacuation flight and asked to provide a list of dependents under 18 who could join us. The deadline was tight but the decision felt enormous - leave our homeland and be forced into exile, or stay, and not know what might happen. When I used to travel abroad, it was always a happy moment, but this time, everyone was in pieces. The family elders were the most upset, saying it could be our last meeting. But saying goodbye was the only option. Reaching the airport was tremendously difficult, and getting through the desperate crowds of thousands felt extremely dangerous. My elder son could not join us, being over 18, which has not been easy. But I am so glad my younger daughters have been able to continue their education in the UK. Starting from scratch in a new society and country is not easy, but knowing that they have a better future gives us hope. George WrightBBC News Zahra Fayazi managed to escape Kabul as the city was falling to the Taliban. An interpreter for the UK government and a coach of the national womenâs volleyball team, Fayazi was in more danger than most. Last time I spoke with Fayazishe was living in a hotel in London, but she now has her own house in Rugby in England. There are nearly 10,000 Afghans still in hotels across the UK. Fayazi recalls watching her homeland disappear from view from the plane a year ago. âI was sure that I would miss it a lot but it was a situation that everyone had to cope with,â she says. Fayazi says she has settled into life in Rugby and soon started playing volleyball again with a local team. âI feel happy to be able to play again in a peaceful area with no fear, restrictions or limitations,â she says. Itâs in stark contrast to the lives of the majority of Afghan female volleyball players who are still in Afghanistan. âFor one year they have not been allowed to do any sport,â she says. âOur players told me that some gymnasiums where they used to play were investigated by the Taliban, asking for the girlsâ contact numbers, their addresses.â Looking to the future, Fayazi says she wants to âserve my new communityâ in the UK, adding that returning to her homeland any time soon seems âimpossibleâ. âBut I hope Afghanistan sees peace again and Afghan women have freedom and rights to education, sports and work,â she says. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Naren Patel says itâs good to see people opening their hearts and homes to Ukrainian refugees but asks: was the same offered to refugees from Afghanistan? No scheme similar to the Homes for Ukraine programme - where people in the UK could welcome Ukrainian refugees into their own homes - was set up in the UK for Afghans. The UK government has been heavily criticised for the slow speed and clumsiness with which it has attempted to process the thousands of deserving Afghan applicants for asylum. Around 15,000 were evacuated in August 2021 under Operation Pitting (compared to over 113,000 by the US) and the UK government has budgeted for 20,000 Afghan refugees to come to Britain over five years. Many though, are taking matters into their own hands with over 1,000 arriving illegally in boats across the Channel in the first quarter of 2022, the highest proportion of any nationality. You can read more about the schemes for Ukrainianshereand for Afghanshere. Secunder KermaniReporting from Kandahar The Hazara community is Afghanistan's third largest ethnic group. Alongside other adherents of Shia Islam, they have faced persecution from the Taliban. Matthew Whitton in Japan says he isconcerned about the Hazaras' current status and condition. Is the Taliban undertaking a more'circumspect'route this time to again inflict torment and murder upon the Hazaras? Afghanistanâs Hazara ethnic minority follows the Shia sect of Islam. Hazaras have long been discriminated against in Afghanistan both on the basis of their ethnicity and their religion. The Taliban, which is dominated by the Pashtun ethnicity, has been accused of forcibly expelling some Hazara communities from villages in a number of provinces â in favour of local communities who have been pro-Taliban. Hazaras have generally also been much more in favour of girls' education and women working outside the home, so theyâve been affected by new Taliban rules in those fields too. However, the violence the Hazaras are currently facing predominantly comes from the Islamic State (IS) group, which has for years targeted the community in deadly suicide bombings. The Taliban are fighting against IS, though like the previous Afghan government they at times face criticism for failing to prevent attacks. Frank GardnerSecurity Correspondent Barbara Adolph, in London, asks:Should the UK recognise the Taliban government and try to work with the more moderate elements within it? Would this make things worse or better for Afghan women? You correctly point out, Barbara, that the Taliban is not monolithic, ie there are both moderate and hardline elements within its ranks. A lot of people were hoping that 'Taliban 2.0', this second period of Taliban rule, would be a lot less harsh and a lot more pragmatic than the first one from 1996-2001. The Taliban negotiators who spent months living in Qatar during the peace talks with the US before the fall of Kabul had a chance to see a totally different world to the rugged land of the insurgency they were fighting in back home. They took their wives shopping in air-conditioned malls and enjoyed a high standard of living. It was hoped they would have a moderating influence on the rest of the Taliban. But one year on, it's clear that hardline clerics are resisting letting girls return to secondary school or performing any sizeable role in public life, despite the pledges made last year by their spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Quietly, behind the scenes, there are some contacts going on between the West and some Taliban officials, especially on counter-terrorism since the Taliban are now facing their own insurgency problem from the islamic State group. George WrightBBC News There has been no official female sport under Taliban rule One year ago, I spoke to members of the Afghan women's cricket teamwho were in hiding from the Taliban. ""We are all hopeless,"" one of the team, Asel, told me from Kabul. Asel isn't her real name. She was using a pseudonym then and wants to continue as she still has family in Afghanistan. But life has improved a lot for Asel. She managed to escape to Pakistan in October and flew to Australia two weeks later, where the entire squad now lives. ""The border was very tough. We passed the Taliban checkpoints one by one, covering our faces so they couldnât recognise us,"" she says. While some of the team have found life in Australia easier than others, Asel is adapting well. She has also been relishing the chance to freely play the sport she loves again. The team have been training together once a week and playing indoor matches due to it being winter. ""To play cricket here is a lot easier. Itâs very easy for girls because back in our country you are not allowed to play,"" Asel says. However, the Afghanistan Cricket Board has not allowed them to represent the country officially. ""Everyone wants a team under the name Afghanistan but thatâs not possible under the current situation. We are trying to build our careers individually, if itâs possible for us. ""But Iâm so good here. The people are very kind."" Yogita LimayeReporting from Kabul Adam Nemeth, in Hungary, says:I heard that women can't leave their home without a male relative and generally they can't go to work. But could they work and study remotely? Some women and girls are pursuing online education. But this is limited to a small number who can afford gadgets like mobile phones and tablets, and a steady internet connection. The vast majority of Afghans don't fall into this category. The UN has said there could be near universal poverty in Afghanistan by next year because of the economic crisis triggered by the stopping of foreign funds which were being given to the Afghan government. So spending money on online education is a luxury that is simply out of reach for most people. Hameed ShujaBBC Afghan Service The Taliban constantly play down the existence of any armed opposition to them but over the past year there have been multiple independent reports of clashes in parts of central and northern Afghanistan between them and groups opposed to their rule. The current resistance against the Taliban operate in small pockets. The âNational Resistance Frontâ (NRF) and the âAfghanistan Freedom Front"" have accepted responsibility for many recent attacks targeting Taliban forces. Ahmad Massoud, son of the late guerilla commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, whose forces resisted the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s, leads the NRF. He is said to be based in Tajikistan but recently told the BBC he has around 3,000 armed fighters inside Afghanistan. That claim is difficult to verify and the Taliban brush off questions about their existence. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Former Taliban fighters - seen here with their weapons - now face an insurgency from the Islamic State group Over the past few hours, our correspondents have been answering your questions about the situation in Afghanistan. We asked Frank whether the return of the Taliban has meant international terrorist groups are able to re-establish themselves in the country.No, and yes, is the awkward answer. Part of the Doha Agreement negotiated in February 2020 between the US and the Taliban was that if US forces withdrew from the country then the Taliban would not allow their old allies al-Qaida to re-establish their presence in the country. This was, of course, the whole reason why the US and its allies went into Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 - to close down al-Qaidaâs bases and overthrow the Taliban government that had given them sanctuary. This week the White House has released a partly redacted US intelligence assessment that concludes that al-Qaida has not so far reconstituted its presence in Afghanistan and less than a dozen of its leaders are hiding there. This is despite the CIA locating the fugitive al-Qaida leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, hiding out in a safe house in a part of Kabul close to Taliban leaders, and killing him with a drone strike in early August. Ironically, after 20 years of being the insurgents, it is now the Taliban government that faces its own insurgency from its rival, the Islamic State group. Members of this ultra hardline and pathologically violent group have carried out a number of terrorist attacks aimed at undermining Taliban rule. This gives Western counter-terrorism officials an opportunity to make common cause with the Taliban to help them confront this threat. Afghans have been in ""survival mode"" for the past year, the UN secretary general's deputy special representative for Afghanistan says. Ramiz Alakbarov tells the BBC around 19 million Afghans are experiencing malnutrition and half of the countryâs population is in constant need of support for nutritional or basic essential needs. Alakbarov says womenâs rights are ânon-negotiableâ and âessential to the resolution of the crisis in Afghanistanâ. He says: ""Letâs face it, today the aid sector of Afghanistan could have benefited from much stronger support from the international community. It is not having the same level of support."" We've just had an update on the explosion which occurred earlier in Kabul. One person is now known to have been killed and ten people were injured, according to Emergency, an international healthcare organisation operating in the area. Explosives were reportedly planted in a wheelbarrow in front of a hotel in District 3, to the west of the city centre. Security forces have started an investigation into the incident. Secunder KermaniReporting from Kandahar Nick Gliddon, 51, in Staffordshire in the UK asks what the Taliban say and think about the exodus of so many talented Afghans from the country. The Taliban have been trying to encourage business figures, and even those linked to the previous government, to return. They see their takeover as a chance to rebuild Afghanistan. Most educated Afghans you meet who are still in the country, however, are looking for a way out. Visas are hard to come by, but the closure of most girlsâ secondary schools, along with the economic crisis mean many families no longer see a future for themselves in Afghanistan. Some are determined to stay and try to help improve the situation, but few are optimistic. Let's hear more voices from Afghanistan as people share their experiences of life under the Taliban with the BBC's Afghan service. Faroughfrom Mazar-i-Sharif says: ""The Taliban brought poverty, fear, and threat to our country. ""Over the past year,
we have become destitute. We lost our freedom of speech and education. It's the
darkest part of our history so far... People are very disappointed and hopeless
about their future. All hopes we had from the international community have now
turned into disappointment."" Walifrom Kabul says that Afghans have had ""a terrible year. All I remember from the past couple of months are bad
memories. ""I am a disabled person, and I used to receive money from the
government, which has been stopped. I am now poor and begging in the streets.
Afghanistan used to have a vibrant economy with ongoing businesses. They are
all gone. We are left wounded by our neighbours and also by the
international community."" ""Before lots of people, especially farmers, got wounded and killed, lots of shopkeepers were shot,"" said Gul Mohammad, a tailor in the village of Padkhwab in Logar Province, south east of Kabul one year on from the Talibanâs takeover. The BBCâs Secunder Kermani visited the village on the front line not long after the Taliban assumed power last year. At the time, residents were eager to show him the signs of a war that until a few weeks ago had overshadowed their lives in the village. Almost a year later, residents still expressed gratitude for the improvements to security. But sharp rises to the cost of everyday products and the lack of work have become common complaints. ""People can't afford flour, let alone meat or fruit,"" said Mohammad. Other village residents say they are grateful for better security. Tile-maker Samiullah, for instance, said that ""it's true there was more money back then [before the Taliban took over], but we faced a lot of oppression,"" referring to the presence of Afghan government troops in the village who he accuses of harassing people. Many others, however, feel the country they helped build is disappearing in front of their eyes, and they're deeply concerned about what it's being replaced with. Read morehere. Frank GardnerSecurity Correspondent We asked Frank about the recent killing of the al-Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, by a US drone. Didnât the Taliban pledge not to give safe haven to terrorists? Why, then, would al-Zawahiri be living in the heart of the capital? Itâs true that the Taliban gave a solemn pledge not to provide a safe haven for international terrorist groups like al-Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State group. The fact that the AQ leader was found to be living in some comfort in an upmarket villa in Kabul, close to Taliban leaders, would certainly imply the Taliban broke that pledge. The Taliban is divided when it comes to al-Qaeda. Some of its more outward-looking officials, especially those who took part in peace talks with the US in Doha in 2020, want a complete break with AQ. But others from the so-called Haqqani network have close historical and even marital ties with AQ and apparently have no intention of severing their ties. Hence the US seems to have taken matters into its own hands and killed the AQ leader when it saw an opportunity. The White House has just released highlights of an intelligence assessment which concludes that although a small number of AQ leaders remain in Afghanistan, the group has not been able to rebuild its presence and lacks the ability to carry out international attacks. Ayman al-Zawahiri (right) is pictured here with Osama Bin Laden, the former al-Qaeda leader who was killed by US forces in 2011 Barbara Plett UsherUS State Department Correspondent There were desperate scenes at Kabul airport in the final days of US troops' withdrawal In the United States the anniversary of the Taliban takeover of Kabul is mired in competing political narratives. A Republican-led congressional report criticises what it says was a lack of planning for the military withdrawal. It also purports to show how the administration overrode the advice of US commanders and disregarded the Talibanâs violations of the 2020 pull-out deal. It says President Joe Bidenâs decision to remove all US troops has endangered the US. The White House has hit back with a detailed takedown of each point. It places much of the blame on the âflawedâ deal that former president Donald Trump struck with the Taliban. And it trumpets the successful strike against al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul last month as evidence the US can fight terrorists without boots on the ground. But for those Americans who fought and worked in Afghanistan this is not an academic debate. There is a heavy sense of personal failure: failure to rescue American partners during the chaotic evacuation, and to deliver on promises of building lasting, democratic and inclusive institutions. There is also soul-searching among military analysts about the 20-year US mission. Some say it should have focused on counter terrorism against al-Qaeda and not made the Taliban the enemy. Secunder KermaniReporting from Kandahar Khashayar Datoo asks whether there are manyunderground schools for women or are they too afraid to attend? And are people still rejecting the Taliban or have some come to accept their presence as a compromise? There are âsecret schoolsâ that have been created, particularly in the capital Kabul. I visited one earlier this year and you canread a bit more about it here. There are also tuition centres that are operating fairly openly and teaching girls and young women. There is fear, but there are also women determined to try to build futures for themselves. Thatâs why weâve also seen frequent, if small, protests by women in Kabul, despite the threat of arrest. Itâs also important to note that girlsâ primary schools are still continuing, and women who were already in university have been allowed to continue their studies - but the continued closure of most girlsâ secondary schools has led to an outpouring of national grief. There are some small bands of guerrilla fighters who have been clashing with the Taliban in some northern parts of the country, but overall thereâs a recognition that thereâs no realistic alternative to the Taliban at the moment. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Payvand Seyedali wasan education consultant working for foreign NGOs in Kabul last year, when the city fell to
the Taliban. She had lived and worked there for 10 years, and decided to stay. Today she is still in Kabul and still working in the education sector. Whereas last year, it wasn't clear what would happen under the new government, she says now ""everyone is trying to make ends meet, to not starve, to hold on to shreds
of hope for their children. People want jobs, they want education, they want
rights - these needs are not political"". She says with people in urban areas, desperation is visible ""at a level of intensity Iâve never seen before"".
More children are working than ever, and only a few women can be seen outside the home, she adds. And those who are, whether they are afraid or defiant - [are] always hyperaware of what theyâre wearing, who they are with, how theyâre perceived. Being a woman outside the home is extremely uncomfortable, and forces many into self-censoring. This is not new, but itâs much worse than before."" Payvand Seyedali, Education consultant When it comes to girls' education, hopes have been dashed too. On 23 March this year, when girls in secondary education were due to go back, ""over a million girls woke up, ate their breakfasts, put on clothes theyâd set out the night before. That morning was filled with hope. The Taliban had a chance, that day, to turn sentiment in their favour. ""Instead, every school girl in the country above grade five was ordered away by a sudden decree... Secret schools are popping up, local governors and even individual public schools are taking autonomous decisions to reopen. Teachers are organising."" But a year of closures means more girls will have got
married early, become pregnant or died in childbirth, she observes. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Parents left without childcare as nurseries shutA campaign group says it has been ""inundated"" with messages about nurseries going out of business.Business","The number of childcare providers in England has been dropping steadily since 2015 Parents are being left without childcare as nurseries shut at short notice due to financial pressures and staff shortages. The Pregnant Then Screwed campaign group said it had been ""inundated"" with messages from parents whose local nursery had closed suddenly. Nurseries are facing increased energy, food and staffing costs, as well as struggling to recruit. The government said it was increasing funding paid to childcare providers. But the Early Years Alliance, which represents around 14,000 providers in England and also has its own nurseries, said the sector was facing its worst crisis in recruitment and cost increases in 20 years. 'It shouldn't be a choice between baby and career' Summer childcare costs so high 'I'd be paying to work' Gabrielle Drake said she was left in a ""mad scramble"" to find a new nursery for her 13-month-old son when his current provider closed for good overnight. Parents received an email on 5 August saying the nursery would be permanently closing at the end of the day as the company was ""undergoing a restructure"". Gabrielle and her partner both work full time and they were unable to find a new nursery at such short notice, so now have to rely on her parents to look after their son for a month. The 35-year-old from Leeds has managed to find a new nursery for September. She contacted 20 local nurseries but only four replied to say they had spaces, two of which are brand new so do not have Ofsted inspection reports yet. As her son was not attending nursery the day it closed they were unable to collect his belongings, including clothes and nappies. She said the closure was also disruptive for her son who had settled in well at the nursery and made friends. Welcome Nurseries, which owns the branch, went into administration earlier this month - six of its 32 sites were closed as part of a sale. Linda Mills, head of childcare at Welcome Nurseries, said the company took the ""difficult decision"" to close the sites as they had very low occupancy and together with rising costs ""this meant they were not sustainable"". Where possible, she said children had been able to access the company's other nurseries and in the areas most affected families were being helped by local authorities. Gabrielle's local nursery offered no alternative provision after it closed suddenly Harriet Butterworth, managing director at Cottontails nursery in Warrington, said she was worried she would be forced to close because of increased costs. The nursery is running at a loss and has already raised fees twice this year to cover increased staffing costs. Ms Butterworth said she had increased salaries for her lowest paid workers by 12.5% to help attract and retain staff. ""We're competing with the likes of Hermes, Amazon, just basic retail jobs, who are paying these really high hourly amounts, with much more flexible hours,"" Ms Butterworth added. She said the nursery was also facing increased food and energy costs, with her gas and electricity bill more than doubling to hit Â£9,000 for the last quarter. The nursery has been forced to turn off its boiler and cut down its use of the gas oven to save energy. Harriet Butterworth says she is only able to recruit staff by increasing pay Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said in his 20 years working in the sector he had ""never witnessed such a crisis in terms of recruitment and retention and cost pressures"". He blamed underinvestment in the sector by the government, as well as increased costs for things like energy, food and staff. Parents of three and four year olds in England are entitled to15 free hours per week of childcare. Working families may also be eligible for an additional 15 hours per week of funded early education. But Mr Leitch said this allocation was not adequately funded by the government, leaving providers to make up the shortfall. He said many providers were forced to increase fees for other parents to offset the cost as a result. A survey of 2,000 early years providers in March,externalfound 30% were currently operating at a loss, while 34% said they expected to be in 12 months' time. Three years ago the alliance operated 132 pre-school settings but it now only has 65, with more than half closing for financial reasons. The number of childcare providers in England has been falling steadily since 2015, with the number of nurseries and pre-schools dropping by 196 between August 2021 and March this year,according to inspector Ofsted,external. However, Jonathan Broadbery, from the National Day Nurseries Association, said anecdotally the situation had got worse since March, with nurseries under increasing financial pressure. In April, there was an increase in the minimum wage and National Insurance contributions paid by employers, while temporary business rates relief introduced during the pandemic ended in England. Mr Leitch said nurseries were also struggling to recruit, as people are leaving the sector ""in their droves"" for better paid jobs because they felt ""exhausted and undervalued"". Many businesses have increased salaries as a result but this was not financially sustainable, he added. Others have been forced to reduce hours or close suddenly because of a lack of staff. Pregnant Then Screwed said it had received more than 60 messages in recent weeks from mothers whose child's nursery had closed at short notice. The group's campaigns manager, Lauren Fabianski, said many were worried about how they would be able to work without childcare. She added that some nurseries were booked-up until November next year, so it was difficult to find somewhere with spaces. A government spokeswoman said it had spent more than Â£4bn in each of the past five years to support families with the cost of childcare and it had not seen a substantial number of parents unable to secure a childcare place. She added that the government had also announced additional funding for local authorities to increase the hourly rates paid to childcare providers and it was increasing funding to support employers with their costs.

Sprinter pulled over for second time by policeSprinter Ricardo Dos Santos published a series of video tweets of him being questioned by police.London,"The Portuguese sprinter said some unseen footage is with his lawyer A sprinter who was allegedly racially profiled during a stop and search has said he was ""worried"" at being pulled over for a second time by armed police. Ricardo Dos Santospublished a series of video tweets,externalof him being pulled over and questioned by police in Paddington at 04:00 BST on Sunday. The Met said officers were concerned the driver may have been using a phone. The force has now referred itself to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). This video can not be played Ricardo Dos Santos published videos of him being pulled over and questioned by police The 27-year-old told the BBC his phone was between his thighs, and accused the Met of ""over-policing"". Five officersface a gross misconduct hearingover a stop-and-search in 2020 involving the Portuguese sprinter and his partner. Speaking to Radio 5 Live about the incident, Mr Dos Santos explained that he felt unsafe to stop on the A40 Westway and ""went around"" the police car to avoid driving into the back of it. He then continued driving for a further five minutes. In a statement, the Met said: ""The officers clearly indicated for the car to pull over but it failed to do so and they called for further assistance."" Mr Dos Santos said: ""I missed the turn to come out and I felt there wasn't anywhere else that was safe enough to stop because the flyover is pretty dark so I took the next exit... and stopped at the next available street and I parked up and waited for them to come to me."" ""It is a long time on a regular street but this was a flyover. For my safety, and based on my previous incidents with them [police], I thought that the best place to stop was somewhere lit up and with the possibility of witnesses."" Mr Dos Santos said he counted seven armed police officers and that one took his baton out of his pocket ""out of frustration ready to smash the glass"" after not knowing how to open the car door. He added ""nothing had changed"" two years after he was pulled over with his partner, Bianca Williams, and their daughter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, Scotland Yard said it had ""recorded this matter as a public complaint"" and referred itself to the police watchdog, ""recognising the public interest"". An IOPC spokesperson said: ""We will be assessing the available information in order to make an informed decision on the level of our involvement."" In July 2020, footage of Ms Williams and Mr Dos Santos being searched and handcuffed was widely shared on social media, with Ms Williams later accusing the police of racially profiling them. After the search, details of the couple's three-month-old baby were also stored on a police database called Merlin, used to record information on children who become known to the authorities. In April, the IOPC said an acting police sergeant and four police constables will all face a gross misconduct disciplinary hearing over the incident. Ricardo Dos Santos has represented Portugal in the 400m sprint Mr Dos Santos revealed this was the third time he had been stopped by police whilst driving in two years.  On Sunday he said he warned the officers that his Tesla car had cameras which film the exterior of the vehicle. He said: ""I was worried for my safety, so much so that I called Bianca and I told her to log onto the car's cameras and look at them just in case anything happened once I'd pulled over. ""I stay as calm as possible because for me this isn't a surprising situation, it's happened many times so it's my norm. ""I believe it was over-policing for a phone."" In an earlier statement, the Met Police said: ""Armed officers were on routine patrol in a marked police vehicle. ""They saw a car travelling eastbound on the A40 Westway and were concerned the driver may be using a mobile phone at the wheel. ""The driver stopped about five minutes later in Orsett Terrace W2, and the officers spoke to him about why they wanted to stop the vehicle. ""Following the conversation the vehicle was allowed on its way. We have since contacted the driver via Twitter to invite him to contact us if he would like to discuss this matter further.""

LiveLiveTaliban mark first year in power while Afghan crisis deepens4 minutes ago,"It's a year to the day since the Taliban entered Kabul unchallenged and took control of Afghanistan, transforming the lives of millions of people Taliban fighters have been parading the streets as they mark the anniversary, and a national holiday has been declared The UN says Afghans have been in ""survival mode"" for the past year, with millions facing malnutrition It warns the world must not forget the plight of the country's women and girls Most girls' secondary schools closed and the Taliban tightly restrict which jobs women can do The fall of Kabul on 15 August 2021 followed the US decision to pull troops out of the country by September that year Our correspondents on the ground - including Lyse Doucet, Secunder Kermani and Yogita Limaye - are answering your questions Edited by Heather Sharp We're now bringing this page to a close. The Taliban have marked the first
anniversary of their takeover of Afghanistan by parading in the streets of Kabul and declaring a national holiday. But the UN has warned that millions face malnutrition and urged the world not to forget the plight of the country's women and girls. We'd like to thank our correspondents who have answered dozens of questions from our readers on issues  ranging from girlsâ education, to
armed resistance to the Taliban, to the recent killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in
Kabul. And thanks too to our readers for all your thoughtful and interesting questions. The BBC has much more coverage from Afghanistan, including: And we will of course continue to cover developments in Afghanistan on our news pages. We're wrapping up our live coverage shortly, thank you for joining us as we have marked one year since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. Our coverage today has been brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan, Chris Giles, Dulcie Lee, Heather Sharp, Marita Maloney, Emily McGarvey, Aoife Walsh, Laura Gozzi, Catherine Evans and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman. Syed AnwarBBC Afghan Service I was in the BBC bureau earlier than usual that morning, and in some ways it felt like a normal news day - assigning stories, chatting with colleagues. But by mid-morning, the atmosphere began to change as it became clear the government was indeed about to fall. I received a call from my son, who worked in the finance ministry, and he told me his colleagues were fleeing the office - there were rumours the Taliban had reached the gates of Kabul. When I left the BBC building a short time later - a place I had worked for so many years - I had a sense I might never return. By the time I got home, dozens of scenarios were playing through my mind about how my familyâs life might be about to change. Two days later, at midnight, we were offered places on an evacuation flight and asked to provide a list of dependents under 18 who could join us. The deadline was tight but the decision felt enormous - leave our homeland and be forced into exile, or stay, and not know what might happen. When I used to travel abroad, it was always a happy moment, but this time, everyone was in pieces. The family elders were the most upset, saying it could be our last meeting. But saying goodbye was the only option. Reaching the airport was tremendously difficult, and getting through the desperate crowds of thousands felt extremely dangerous. My elder son could not join us, being over 18, which has not been easy. But I am so glad my younger daughters have been able to continue their education in the UK. Starting from scratch in a new society and country is not easy, but knowing that they have a better future gives us hope. George WrightBBC News Zahra Fayazi managed to escape Kabul as the city was falling to the Taliban. An interpreter for the UK government and a coach of the national womenâs volleyball team, Fayazi was in more danger than most. Last time I spoke with Fayazishe was living in a hotel in London, but she now has her own house in Rugby in England. There are nearly 10,000 Afghans still in hotels across the UK. Fayazi recalls watching her homeland disappear from view from the plane a year ago. âI was sure that I would miss it a lot but it was a situation that everyone had to cope with,â she says. Fayazi says she has settled into life in Rugby and soon started playing volleyball again with a local team. âI feel happy to be able to play again in a peaceful area with no fear, restrictions or limitations,â she says. Itâs in stark contrast to the lives of the majority of Afghan female volleyball players who are still in Afghanistan. âFor one year they have not been allowed to do any sport,â she says. âOur players told me that some gymnasiums where they used to play were investigated by the Taliban, asking for the girlsâ contact numbers, their addresses.â Looking to the future, Fayazi says she wants to âserve my new communityâ in the UK, adding that returning to her homeland any time soon seems âimpossibleâ. âBut I hope Afghanistan sees peace again and Afghan women have freedom and rights to education, sports and work,â she says. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Naren Patel says itâs good to see people opening their hearts and homes to Ukrainian refugees but asks: was the same offered to refugees from Afghanistan? No scheme similar to the Homes for Ukraine programme - where people in the UK could welcome Ukrainian refugees into their own homes - was set up in the UK for Afghans. The UK government has been heavily criticised for the slow speed and clumsiness with which it has attempted to process the thousands of deserving Afghan applicants for asylum. Around 15,000 were evacuated in August 2021 under Operation Pitting (compared to over 113,000 by the US) and the UK government has budgeted for 20,000 Afghan refugees to come to Britain over five years. Many though, are taking matters into their own hands with over 1,000 arriving illegally in boats across the Channel in the first quarter of 2022, the highest proportion of any nationality. You can read more about the schemes for Ukrainianshereand for Afghanshere. Secunder KermaniReporting from Kandahar The Hazara community is Afghanistan's third largest ethnic group. Alongside other adherents of Shia Islam, they have faced persecution from the Taliban. Matthew Whitton in Japan says he isconcerned about the Hazaras' current status and condition. Is the Taliban undertaking a more'circumspect'route this time to again inflict torment and murder upon the Hazaras? Afghanistanâs Hazara ethnic minority follows the Shia sect of Islam. Hazaras have long been discriminated against in Afghanistan both on the basis of their ethnicity and their religion. The Taliban, which is dominated by the Pashtun ethnicity, has been accused of forcibly expelling some Hazara communities from villages in a number of provinces â in favour of local communities who have been pro-Taliban. Hazaras have generally also been much more in favour of girls' education and women working outside the home, so theyâve been affected by new Taliban rules in those fields too. However, the violence the Hazaras are currently facing predominantly comes from the Islamic State (IS) group, which has for years targeted the community in deadly suicide bombings. The Taliban are fighting against IS, though like the previous Afghan government they at times face criticism for failing to prevent attacks. Frank GardnerSecurity Correspondent Barbara Adolph, in London, asks:Should the UK recognise the Taliban government and try to work with the more moderate elements within it? Would this make things worse or better for Afghan women? You correctly point out, Barbara, that the Taliban is not monolithic, ie there are both moderate and hardline elements within its ranks. A lot of people were hoping that 'Taliban 2.0', this second period of Taliban rule, would be a lot less harsh and a lot more pragmatic than the first one from 1996-2001. The Taliban negotiators who spent months living in Qatar during the peace talks with the US before the fall of Kabul had a chance to see a totally different world to the rugged land of the insurgency they were fighting in back home. They took their wives shopping in air-conditioned malls and enjoyed a high standard of living. It was hoped they would have a moderating influence on the rest of the Taliban. But one year on, it's clear that hardline clerics are resisting letting girls return to secondary school or performing any sizeable role in public life, despite the pledges made last year by their spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Quietly, behind the scenes, there are some contacts going on between the West and some Taliban officials, especially on counter-terrorism since the Taliban are now facing their own insurgency problem from the islamic State group. George WrightBBC News There has been no official female sport under Taliban rule One year ago, I spoke to members of the Afghan women's cricket teamwho were in hiding from the Taliban. ""We are all hopeless,"" one of the team, Asel, told me from Kabul. Asel isn't her real name. She was using a pseudonym then and wants to continue as she still has family in Afghanistan. But life has improved a lot for Asel. She managed to escape to Pakistan in October and flew to Australia two weeks later, where the entire squad now lives. ""The border was very tough. We passed the Taliban checkpoints one by one, covering our faces so they couldnât recognise us,"" she says. While some of the team have found life in Australia easier than others, Asel is adapting well. She has also been relishing the chance to freely play the sport she loves again. The team have been training together once a week and playing indoor matches due to it being winter. ""To play cricket here is a lot easier. Itâs very easy for girls because back in our country you are not allowed to play,"" Asel says. However, the Afghanistan Cricket Board has not allowed them to represent the country officially. ""Everyone wants a team under the name Afghanistan but thatâs not possible under the current situation. We are trying to build our careers individually, if itâs possible for us. ""But Iâm so good here. The people are very kind."" Yogita LimayeReporting from Kabul Adam Nemeth, in Hungary, says:I heard that women can't leave their home without a male relative and generally they can't go to work. But could they work and study remotely? Some women and girls are pursuing online education. But this is limited to a small number who can afford gadgets like mobile phones and tablets, and a steady internet connection. The vast majority of Afghans don't fall into this category. The UN has said there could be near universal poverty in Afghanistan by next year because of the economic crisis triggered by the stopping of foreign funds which were being given to the Afghan government. So spending money on online education is a luxury that is simply out of reach for most people. Hameed ShujaBBC Afghan Service The Taliban constantly play down the existence of any armed opposition to them but over the past year there have been multiple independent reports of clashes in parts of central and northern Afghanistan between them and groups opposed to their rule. The current resistance against the Taliban operate in small pockets. The âNational Resistance Frontâ (NRF) and the âAfghanistan Freedom Front"" have accepted responsibility for many recent attacks targeting Taliban forces. Ahmad Massoud, son of the late guerilla commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, whose forces resisted the Soviets in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s, leads the NRF. He is said to be based in Tajikistan but recently told the BBC he has around 3,000 armed fighters inside Afghanistan. That claim is difficult to verify and the Taliban brush off questions about their existence. Frank GardnerBBC News, Security Correspondent Former Taliban fighters - seen here with their weapons - now face an insurgency from the Islamic State group Over the past few hours, our correspondents have been answering your questions about the situation in Afghanistan. We asked Frank whether the return of the Taliban has meant international terrorist groups are able to re-establish themselves in the country.No, and yes, is the awkward answer. Part of the Doha Agreement negotiated in February 2020 between the US and the Taliban was that if US forces withdrew from the country then the Taliban would not allow their old allies al-Qaida to re-establish their presence in the country. This was, of course, the whole reason why the US and its allies went into Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 - to close down al-Qaidaâs bases and overthrow the Taliban government that had given them sanctuary. This week the White House has released a partly redacted US intelligence assessment that concludes that al-Qaida has not so far reconstituted its presence in Afghanistan and less than a dozen of its leaders are hiding there. This is despite the CIA locating the fugitive al-Qaida leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, hiding out in a safe house in a part of Kabul close to Taliban leaders, and killing him with a drone strike in early August. Ironically, after 20 years of being the insurgents, it is now the Taliban government that faces its own insurgency from its rival, the Islamic State group. Members of this ultra hardline and pathologically violent group have carried out a number of terrorist attacks aimed at undermining Taliban rule. This gives Western counter-terrorism officials an opportunity to make common cause with the Taliban to help them confront this threat. Afghans have been in ""survival mode"" for the past year, the UN secretary general's deputy special representative for Afghanistan says. Ramiz Alakbarov tells the BBC around 19 million Afghans are experiencing malnutrition and half of the countryâs population is in constant need of support for nutritional or basic essential needs. Alakbarov says womenâs rights are ânon-negotiableâ and âessential to the resolution of the crisis in Afghanistanâ. He says: ""Letâs face it, today the aid sector of Afghanistan could have benefited from much stronger support from the international community. It is not having the same level of support."" We've just had an update on the explosion which occurred earlier in Kabul. One person is now known to have been killed and ten people were injured, according to Emergency, an international healthcare organisation operating in the area. Explosives were reportedly planted in a wheelbarrow in front of a hotel in District 3, to the west of the city centre. Security forces have started an investigation into the incident. Secunder KermaniReporting from Kandahar Nick Gliddon, 51, in Staffordshire in the UK asks what the Taliban say and think about the exodus of so many talented Afghans from the country. The Taliban have been trying to encourage business figures, and even those linked to the previous government, to return. They see their takeover as a chance to rebuild Afghanistan. Most educated Afghans you meet who are still in the country, however, are looking for a way out. Visas are hard to come by, but the closure of most girlsâ secondary schools, along with the economic crisis mean many families no longer see a future for themselves in Afghanistan. Some are determined to stay and try to help improve the situation, but few are optimistic. Let's hear more voices from Afghanistan as people share their experiences of life under the Taliban with the BBC's Afghan service. Faroughfrom Mazar-i-Sharif says: ""The Taliban brought poverty, fear, and threat to our country. ""Over the past year,
we have become destitute. We lost our freedom of speech and education. It's the
darkest part of our history so far... People are very disappointed and hopeless
about their future. All hopes we had from the international community have now
turned into disappointment."" Walifrom Kabul says that Afghans have had ""a terrible year. All I remember from the past couple of months are bad
memories. ""I am a disabled person, and I used to receive money from the
government, which has been stopped. I am now poor and begging in the streets.
Afghanistan used to have a vibrant economy with ongoing businesses. They are
all gone. We are left wounded by our neighbours and also by the
international community."" ""Before lots of people, especially farmers, got wounded and killed, lots of shopkeepers were shot,"" said Gul Mohammad, a tailor in the village of Padkhwab in Logar Province, south east of Kabul one year on from the Talibanâs takeover. The BBCâs Secunder Kermani visited the village on the front line not long after the Taliban assumed power last year. At the time, residents were eager to show him the signs of a war that until a few weeks ago had overshadowed their lives in the village. Almost a year later, residents still expressed gratitude for the improvements to security. But sharp rises to the cost of everyday products and the lack of work have become common complaints. ""People can't afford flour, let alone meat or fruit,"" said Mohammad. Other village residents say they are grateful for better security. Tile-maker Samiullah, for instance, said that ""it's true there was more money back then [before the Taliban took over], but we faced a lot of oppression,"" referring to the presence of Afghan government troops in the village who he accuses of harassing people. Many others, however, feel the country they helped build is disappearing in front of their eyes, and they're deeply concerned about what it's being replaced with. Read morehere. Frank GardnerSecurity Correspondent We asked Frank about the recent killing of the al-Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, by a US drone. Didnât the Taliban pledge not to give safe haven to terrorists? Why, then, would al-Zawahiri be living in the heart of the capital? Itâs true that the Taliban gave a solemn pledge not to provide a safe haven for international terrorist groups like al-Qaeda (AQ) and the Islamic State group. The fact that the AQ leader was found to be living in some comfort in an upmarket villa in Kabul, close to Taliban leaders, would certainly imply the Taliban broke that pledge. The Taliban is divided when it comes to al-Qaeda. Some of its more outward-looking officials, especially those who took part in peace talks with the US in Doha in 2020, want a complete break with AQ. But others from the so-called Haqqani network have close historical and even marital ties with AQ and apparently have no intention of severing their ties. Hence the US seems to have taken matters into its own hands and killed the AQ leader when it saw an opportunity. The White House has just released highlights of an intelligence assessment which concludes that although a small number of AQ leaders remain in Afghanistan, the group has not been able to rebuild its presence and lacks the ability to carry out international attacks. Ayman al-Zawahiri (right) is pictured here with Osama Bin Laden, the former al-Qaeda leader who was killed by US forces in 2011 Barbara Plett UsherUS State Department Correspondent There were desperate scenes at Kabul airport in the final days of US troops' withdrawal In the United States the anniversary of the Taliban takeover of Kabul is mired in competing political narratives. A Republican-led congressional report criticises what it says was a lack of planning for the military withdrawal. It also purports to show how the administration overrode the advice of US commanders and disregarded the Talibanâs violations of the 2020 pull-out deal. It says President Joe Bidenâs decision to remove all US troops has endangered the US. The White House has hit back with a detailed takedown of each point. It places much of the blame on the âflawedâ deal that former president Donald Trump struck with the Taliban. And it trumpets the successful strike against al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul last month as evidence the US can fight terrorists without boots on the ground. But for those Americans who fought and worked in Afghanistan this is not an academic debate. There is a heavy sense of personal failure: failure to rescue American partners during the chaotic evacuation, and to deliver on promises of building lasting, democratic and inclusive institutions. There is also soul-searching among military analysts about the 20-year US mission. Some say it should have focused on counter terrorism against al-Qaeda and not made the Taliban the enemy. Secunder KermaniReporting from Kandahar Khashayar Datoo asks whether there are manyunderground schools for women or are they too afraid to attend? And are people still rejecting the Taliban or have some come to accept their presence as a compromise? There are âsecret schoolsâ that have been created, particularly in the capital Kabul. I visited one earlier this year and you canread a bit more about it here. There are also tuition centres that are operating fairly openly and teaching girls and young women. There is fear, but there are also women determined to try to build futures for themselves. Thatâs why weâve also seen frequent, if small, protests by women in Kabul, despite the threat of arrest. Itâs also important to note that girlsâ primary schools are still continuing, and women who were already in university have been allowed to continue their studies - but the continued closure of most girlsâ secondary schools has led to an outpouring of national grief. There are some small bands of guerrilla fighters who have been clashing with the Taliban in some northern parts of the country, but overall thereâs a recognition that thereâs no realistic alternative to the Taliban at the moment. Alexandra FouchÃ©BBC News Live reporter Payvand Seyedali wasan education consultant working for foreign NGOs in Kabul last year, when the city fell to
the Taliban. She had lived and worked there for 10 years, and decided to stay. Today she is still in Kabul and still working in the education sector. Whereas last year, it wasn't clear what would happen under the new government, she says now ""everyone is trying to make ends meet, to not starve, to hold on to shreds
of hope for their children. People want jobs, they want education, they want
rights - these needs are not political"". She says with people in urban areas, desperation is visible ""at a level of intensity Iâve never seen before"".
More children are working than ever, and only a few women can be seen outside the home, she adds. And those who are, whether they are afraid or defiant - [are] always hyperaware of what theyâre wearing, who they are with, how theyâre perceived. Being a woman outside the home is extremely uncomfortable, and forces many into self-censoring. This is not new, but itâs much worse than before."" Payvand Seyedali, Education consultant When it comes to girls' education, hopes have been dashed too. On 23 March this year, when girls in secondary education were due to go back, ""over a million girls woke up, ate their breakfasts, put on clothes theyâd set out the night before. That morning was filled with hope. The Taliban had a chance, that day, to turn sentiment in their favour. ""Instead, every school girl in the country above grade five was ordered away by a sudden decree... Secret schools are popping up, local governors and even individual public schools are taking autonomous decisions to reopen. Teachers are organising."" But a year of closures means more girls will have got
married early, become pregnant or died in childbirth, she observes. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Chancellor to hold more talks on energy discount,"Nadhim Zahawi will meet Stormont ministers and the Utility Regulator virtually on Monday The Treasury is setting up a joint taskforce to explore how best households in Northern Ireland can receive a Â£400 discount on energy bills this autumn. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi met Stormont ministers on Monday about the issue. Households in Great Britainwill start receiving it from October. Stormont politicians have called for the same timetable in Northern Ireland, but there are complications due to the lack of a fully functioning executive. Northern Ireland is also in a different energy market to the rest of the UK. Following a virtual meeting on Monday, the Treasury said the new taskforce would be made up of officials from the UK government and Stormont ministers. ""We need to keep the momentum up to get equivalent energy support to people in Northern Ireland and that's why today I've launched a joint taskforce to present practical delivery options back to ministers,"" the chancellor said. ""No option is off the table. We've got our noses to the grindstone, we're making progress, and we have a shared objective with minsters in Northern Ireland to get this off the ground as soon as possible."" A series of ""regular meetings"" is expected to take place until the issue is resolved. But speaking after her talks with Mr Zahawi, Stormont's Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said an urgent response was needed. ""I'm concerned that a workable solution has not yet been agreed by the Department for the Economy and the British Treasury, which would get the Â£400 energy payment out the door to every household in the north,"" she said. ""We are approaching an autumn and winter which will be extremely difficult for workers and families as the price of heating and lighting homes continues to soar."" Ms Hargey called on the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to ""put the interests of ordinary people first"" by ending its boycott of the executive. The DUP Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said he was disappointed that the Treasury had not made more progress on a plan to distribute the discount by making the payments to energy companies, who will then take the discount directly off customers' bills. ""I don't want people in Northern Ireland to have to wait any longer than this than they need to, certainly no longer than those in the rest of the UK,"" he said. ""We presented a solution that I believe can work. The Utility Regulator had very detailed plans about how this could be operationalised in Northern Ireland, and now it's time to move ahead with that."" Household energy bills have increased substantially over the past year and further rises are predicted That plan was mentioned by Mr Zahawi during a visit to Belfast last week,when he met Ms Hargey, Mr Lyons and Northern Ireland's Utility Regulator. Mr Lyons said at the time that would be the ""quickest way"" to ensure households in Northern Ireland benefitted from the scheme. But Ms Hargey said there were still ""legal issues"" to resolve. It is understood the requirement for a 90-day public consultation by Northern Ireland's Utility Regulator will not be needed if the Treasury delivers the scheme. Stormont's Department of Finance has said that if the Treasury ultimately provides the Â£400 energy bill discount to households directly, it anticipates a ""Barnett consequential of Â£164.8m"" announced in February will be reversed. The Barnett formula is used to calculate additional funding when there are changes to UK government spending that affects devolved services. But without a functioning executive at Stormont, money allocated from Westminster that way cannot be spent. Stormont's Department of Finance has said that the pot of funding unable to be spent totals more than Â£435m.

"From Kabul and beyond, a year of Taliban rule","When you arrive at Kabul International Airport, the first thing you notice is the women, clothed in brown scarves and black cloaks, stamping passports. An airfield, which one year ago was the scene of a panicked tide of people desperate to escape, is now much quieter and cleaner. Rows of white Taliban flags flutter in a summer's breeze - billboards of the old famous faces have been painted over. What lies beyond this gateway to a country which was turned upside down by a swift Taliban takeover? The messages are startling, to say the least. ""They want me to give my job to my brother,"" writes one woman on a messaging platform. ""We earned our positions with our experience and educationâ¦ if we accept this it means we have betrayed ourselves,"" declares another. I'm sitting down with a few former senior civil servants from the finance ministry who share their messages. They're part of a group of more than 60 women, many from the Afghanistan Revenue Directorate, who banded together after being ordered to go home last August. Female civil servants were told by the Taliban to send CVs of their male relatives who could apply for their jobs They say Taliban officials then told them: Send CVs of your male relatives who can apply for your jobs. ""This is my job,"" insists one woman who, like all women in this group, anxiously asks for her identity to be hidden. ""I worked with so much difficulty for more than 17 years to get this job and finish my master's degree. Now we are back to zero."" On a telephone call from outside Afghanistan, we're joined by Amina Ahmady, former director general of the Directorate. She's managed to leave, but that's not a way out either. ""We are losing our identity,"" she laments. ""The only place we can keep it is in our own country."" Their group's grand title - ""Women Leaders of Afghanistan"" - gives them strength; what they want is their jobs. Who are the Taliban? Live: Taliban mark first year in power while crisis deepens Do you have questions about Afghanistan? Lyse Doucet and other BBC correspondents will be answering them in theLive pagefrom 13:00 BST today. Get in touch via the form at the end of this article. They're the women who seized new spaces for education and job opportunities during two decades of international engagement which ended with Taliban rule. Taliban officials say women are still working. Those who do are mainly medical staff, educators and security workers including at the airport - spaces where women frequent. The Taliban also emphasise that women, who once held about a quarter of the government's jobs, are still being paid - albeit a small fraction of their salary. A former civil servant tells me how she was stopped on the street by a Talib guard who criticised her Islamic head cover, or hijab, although she was fully covered. ""You've got more important problems to solve than hijab,"" she shot back - another moment of women's determination to fight for their rights, within Islam. The scene seems idyllic. Sheaves of golden wheat shimmer in a summer's sun in the remote central highlands of Afghanistan. You can hear a gentle lowing of cows. Eighteen-year-old Noor Mohammad and 25-year-old Ahmad keep swinging their sickles to clear a remaining patch of grain. As jobs dry up, young people take up work like harvesting which pays the equivalent of $2 (Â£1.65) a day. ""There's much less wheat this year because of drought,"" Noor remarks, sweat and dirt streaking his young face. ""But it's the only job I could find."" A harvested field stretches into the distance behind us. It's been 10 days of backbreaking work by two men in the prime of their life for the equivalent of $2 (Â£1.65) a day. ""I was studying electrical engineering but had to drop out to support my family,"" he explains. His regret is palpable. Ahmad's story is just as painful. ""I sold my motorbike to go to Iran but I couldn't find work,"" he explains. Seasonal work in neighbouring Iran used to be an answer for those in one of Afghanistan's poorest provinces. But work has dried up in Iran too. ""We welcome our Taliban brothers,"" Noor says. ""But we need a government which gives us opportunities."" Earlier that day, we sat around a shiny pine table with Ghor's provincial cabinet of turbaned men seated alongside Taliban Governor Ahmad Shah Din Dost. A former-shadow deputy governor during the war, he gruffly shares all his woes. ""All these problems make me sad,"" he says, listing poverty, bad roads, lack of access to hospitals and schools not operating properly. The end of the war means more aid agencies are now working here, including in districts out-of-bounds before. Earlier this year, famine conditions were detected in two of Ghor's most distant districts. But the war isn't over for Governor Din Dost. He says he was imprisoned and tortured by US forces. ""Don't give us more pain,"" he asserts. ""We don't need help from the West."" ""Why is the West always interfering?"" he demands. ""We don't question how you treat your women or men."" Taliban Governor Ahmad Shah Din Dost In the days that follow, we visit a school and a malnutrition clinic, accompanied by members of his team. ""Afghanistan needs attention,"" says the Taliban's young university-educated Health Director Abdul Satar Mafaq who seems to sound a more pragmatic note. ""We have to save people's lives and it doesn't need to involve politics."" I remember what Noor Mohammad told me in the wheat field. ""Poverty and famine is also a fight and it's bigger than the gunfights."" Eighteen-year-old Sohaila is fizzing with excitement. I follow her down a darkened stairwell into the basement floor of the women-only market in Herat, the ancient western city long known for its more open culture, its science and creativity. It's the first day this bazaar is open - the Taliban shuttered it last year, Covid-19 the year before. We peer through the glass frontage of her family's dress shop which isn't ready yet. A row of sewing machines sits in the corner, red heart balloons hang from the ceiling. A women-only market in Herat ""Ten years ago, my sister started this shop when she was 18 years old,"" Sohaila tells me, sharing a capsule history of her mother and grandmother's stitching of brightly-patterned traditional Kuchi dresses. Her sister had also opened an internet club and a restaurant too. There's a quiet hum of activity in this women's only space. Some are stocking their shelves, others gossiping as they linger over jewellery and embroidered garb. The premises are poorly lit, but in this gloom, there's a shaft of light for women who've spent all too much time just sitting at home. Sohaila has another story to share. ""The Taliban have closed the high schools,"" she remarks, matter-of-fact, about something that has enormous consequences for young ambitious teenagers like her. Most secondary schools are shut, on orders of the Taliban's top ultra-conservative clerics, even though many Afghans, including Taliban members, have called for them to re-open. ""I'm in grade 12 - if I don't graduate I can't go to university."" I ask her whether she can be the Sohaila she wants to be in Afghanistan. ""Of course"", she declares confidently. ""It's my country and I don't want to go to another country."" But a year without school must have been hard. ""It's not just me, it's all the girls of Afghanistan"" she remarks stoically. ""It's a sad memory..."" The Taliban closed schools for girls in Afghanistan casting an uncertain future for many women like Sohaila Her voice trails off as she breaks down in tears. ""I was the top student.""

Labour calls for extra tax on oil and gas giants,"This video can not be played Watch: I'm not going to apologise for holiday with my wife and kids - Starmer Sir Keir Starmer has said families would ""not pay a penny more"" on their energy bills this winter under Labour's plans to tackle rising living costs. The Labour leader claimed his proposals would save the average household Â£1,000. The package would be paid for, in part, by a big increase in tax on oil and gas company profits. But economists said the plan would cost as much as the Covid furlough scheme, if it was extended beyond this winter. The government has already announcedwhat is says is Â£37bnof support for hard-pressed families, but it is under pressure to do more, with bills set to rocket over the winter. Outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""making sure there is extra cash"" for his successor to provide extra support, when they take office on 5 September. How high will my energy bill go? How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? How will I get the cost-of-living payments? The Treasury are working up ideas for how the new prime minister could provide more help with living costs. But the two contenders for the job, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have indicated they are not keen on extending the windfall tax on oil and gas companies - or freezing the price cap - meaning its unlikely to happen unless they have a change of heart. Labour's intervention serves as a challenge to both leadership hopefuls to say what further support they may offer, and how they would pay for it. The party says its plan would be paid for in three ways: Backdating the windfall tax to January and accounting for higher oil and gas prices to raiseÂ£8bn Dropping the Â£400 energy rebate and other pledges made by Tory leadership candidates to raiseÂ£14bn By reducing inflation with lower energy bills, leading to a cut in government debt interest payments ofÂ£7bn The Labour leader said freezing the energy price cap at the current level of Â£1,971 a year for the typical household would bring inflation down by four percentage points. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit 9.4% in June, the highest level for more than 40 years. The Bank of England has warned it could peak at more than 13% later this year. Labour estimate their plans would cost about Â£15bn more than the government's scheme to give households Â£400 this October (and Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak's proposals). Labour estimate that about Â£3.5bn of their extra spending would come from changes to the government's windfall tax on oil and gas companies - including making it apply to profits from January rather than May and getting rid of a government tax-relief scheme to encourage investment from these firms. The party also expects to get Â£4.7bn extra in existing taxes because oil and gas prices are now likely to be much higher than they were when the last official forecasts were made. And Labour say that freezing energy prices would stop inflation rising as high as it would have done otherwise. They estimate this would reduce government borrowing costs by Â£7.2bn this year. But economists warn it's delaying borrowing costs rather than saving them - they say that stopping the subsidy would push up inflation and borrowing costs. The main reason for high inflation is soaring energy bills, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, although households have also been hit by higher petrol, diesel and food costs. Sir Keir said he would have to ""assess"" the situation in April, but Labour's plans were about helping people through the winter. He added further measures to reduce inflation may be needed next year, and argued in the medium to long term Labour was calling for further measures to bring costs down such as insulating millions of homes. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson and Sir Keir have both been criticised for going on holiday as economic turmoil - driven by rising energy bills - deepens. The Labour leader rejected claims he has been missing in action, saying he had been working on his plan for weeks and would not ""apologise for going on holiday with his wife and kids"". ""It's the first time we've had a holiday for about three years,"" he said. Former Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis rejected suggestions that Mr Johnson had ""thrown in the towel"". He told LBC radio: ""Even when you are not in the office in Downing Street you are working."" It comes as the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the government would need to find Â£12bn simply to achieve what it was aiming to do with the Â£24bn package announced in May, due to soaring energy prices. The think tank said that in May energy prices were expected to rise by 95% in 2022/23 but are now expected to rise by 141%. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC Labour's plan was ""a very big and very expensive plan"" that would be on the same scale of support for the public as the furlough scheme during the pandemic, if it was extended beyond the initial six months planned. ""Of course, what it does achieve is to protect everyone entirely from the increases in energy prices so if that is what you want to achieve that is what you need to do but you do need to realise that is a very expensive thing to do,"" he added. The idea of freezing the price cap is backed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP. A Treasury spokeswoman said the government had ""continually taken action to help households by phasing in Â£37bn worth of support throughout the year"". This includes Â£400 off energy bills for all UK households and an additional Â£650 for eight million low-income households.

Drought across much of England,"An official drought has been declared as low-water levels and tinder-dry conditions continue across the UK. Eight parts of England, including Devon, Kent, East Anglia and Lincolnshire are affected. The move is expected to trigger stricter controls on water use and five water companies have already announced restrictions, including hosepipe bans. Millions are expected to be impacted but the Environment Agency said essential water supplies were safe. John Curtin, director of operations, said the drought would go on for ""a long time"" and warned of possible restrictions on crop growing and further hosepipe bans. It comes as the prolonged dry weather - combined with the current heatwave and July's record-breaking temperatures - have depleted rivers, reservoirs and aquifers. Large swathes of England are bone-dry, with scenes of parched earth and grass turned yellow. The conditions have prompted the Environment Agency to move eight of its 14 areas into drought status: Devon and Cornwall Solent and South Downs Kent and South London Hertfordshire and North London East Anglia Thames Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire East Midlands Yorkshire and the West Midlands are also expected to move into a drought later in August. The decision to declare a drought was taken after a meeting of the National Drought Group - made up of government and agency officials, water firms and groups including the National Farmers' Union. Announcing a drought means government and water companies will put into action their plans to deal with it, with measures including hosepipe bans and taking more water than usual from rivers. Members of the public and businesses in drought-affected areas are also being urged to use water wisely followingthe driest first seven months of the year since 1976. Elsewhere, Wales Drought Liaison group is also looking at the effect of the dry weather. LIVE UPDATES: Drought to be declared Will there be a hosepipe ban in my area? Flames faster than you can run - firefighters on wildfires The science of drought explained in pictures Five water companies - Welsh Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, South East Water and, most recently Yorkshire Water - have all announced hosepipe bans, whileYorkshire Water said on Friday that a banwould start on 26 August. The latter firm, which has more than five million customers, says parts of the region have seen the lowest rainfall since records began more than 130 years ago. It also said rivers and reservoirs in the region were running at 20% lower than expected for the time of year. South East Water, whose ban came into force on Friday, is now asking people to observe restrictions on using hosepipes to water plants, wash the car and fill paddling pools - with rule-breakers facing fines of up to Â£1,000. What are water companies doing to tackle leaks? How the heatwave is changing landscapes The driest start to a year since 1976 Dominic Gardener, a farmer in West Sussex, said the dry weather was posing huge challenges for farmers. ""Everything is starting to struggle a bit - our grass is not growing at all - and livestock, we're having to feed them extra food,"" he said, adding crop yields had also been reduced by the dryness. Farmers in parts of Fife are beingtemporarily banned from using waterfrom the River Eden on their fields. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency says the measure will come into effect from midnight on Saturday to tackle critical water shortages. Afour-day amber warning for extreme heatfrom the Met Office is in place for many parts of England and Wales until Sunday. Temperatures are forecast to be lower early next week, however, and the Met Office has issued yellow warnings for thunderstorms on Monday, covering most of England, Wales and Scotland. And its fire severity index - which assesses how severe a blaze could become - is currently ""very high"" for most of England and Wales. The situation facing firefighters across the UK has been described as ""unprecedented"",with increasing numbers of wildfires. Fires have broken out across the nation, including in Leytonstone, east London, Studland Bay, Dorset,Creswell, in Derbyshire,The Dower House in Bristol, and Overton, near Basingstoke in Hampshire. Police have evacuated about 50 homes in Creswell after a major incident was declared due to a field fire. Fire crews are also tackling a large blaze whichbroke out at a Leicestershire recycling centre. Meanwhile, homeless peoplestruggling with the extreme heat in Bristolsaid it was ""making us sick,"" and even sitting in the shade was ""tiring and sweaty and uncomfortable"". Bristol Street Outreach Team, operated by charity St Mungo's, has been carrying out additional shifts and giving out water, advice and sun protection to those in need. This video can not be played Watch latest UK weather forecast: Amber heat warning in force UK temperatures have been rising day-on-day through the week. According to the Met Office, on Friday the highest temperatures were recorded in: Wiggonholt, West Sussex, at 34.5C Northolt, west London, and Hermonceux West End, East Sussex, at 34.2C Heathrow, west London, at 33.9C Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, at 33.8C Chivenor, Devon, at 33.7C. Over the weekend temperatures could peak at 36C. Met Office chief meteorologist Andy Page said there would be ""increasingly warm nights"" with temperatures not expected to drop below the low 20s in some places in the south. Sir Keir Starmer has accused the government of failing to fully prepare the UK for drought, and also out at the response of water companies. Water firms have been criticised over leaks, with about three billion litres of water lost each day in the UK - between 20% and 24% of the total water supply. The Labour leader said the drought was ""predictable"" but ""as usual we had no plan from the government"". Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was ""no reason for people to be alarmed"". He told BBC News that the UK's water supply ""remains resilient"" and that ""we're in a stronger position than ever"" to withstand droughts, with progress made on leaks and infrastructure to move water between reservoirs. Heatwaves are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. Research institute UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) said it would require ""exceptional"" rainfall over the next one to three months to bring river, reservoir and groundwater levels back up to normal. It said analysis showed exceptionally low levels would probably continue until October in southern England and Wales. But scientists have warned bouts of heavy rain after a prolonged period of hot weather can cause flash flooding. Robert Thompson, a professor of Meteorology at the University of Reading, said ""the ground has effectively become like urban concrete"" and will not absorb water quickly enough to cope with longer showers. The situation in the UK is being mirrored across Europe. Much of the continent is baking in record heat, exposing riverbeds and triggering restrictions on water use in many areas. A drought has also hitGermany's Rhine River, where the water is already too low to allow some larger vessels through. Restrictions on usage during hosepipe bans can vary between water providers but generally people are not allowed to use hosepipes or anything that connects to a hosepipe or an outside tap.During a ban, people cannot use a hosepipe to: water a garden or plants fill a paddling or swimming pool clean a car fill a pond clean walls or windows But you can use other water sources, like using your mains water supply but with buckets or watering cans instead of hosepipes, or using stored rainwater from a water butt and there are some exceptions when a hosepipe can be used. Anyone breaking the rules could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Read morehere. Have you been affected by the hot weather and restrictions?

How does the windfall tax on energy firms work?,"The windfall tax on oil and gas companies will increase in November, and will remain in place until March 2030. The levy was introduced as a response to soaring energy company profits, and was designed to help fund a scheme to limit household gas and electricity bills. However, firms in the sector have warned that the increase will hit jobs and investment. A windfall tax is a levy imposed on companies that have benefited from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Global oil and gas prices started to rise in late 2020 as demand increased with the lifting of Covid restrictions, but they soared in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The increase in prices led to bumper profits for energy companies, leading to calls for a windfall tax. The Energy Profits Levy - the formal name for the windfall tax -was introduced in May 2022 by the then Chancellor, Rishi Sunak,external. The government said the money raised would fund support for households facing rising energy bills. The levy applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. It was initially set at 25% and was due to expire at the end of 2025. In January 2023 the then Chancellor Jeremy Hunt increased the levy to 35%. In the spring 2024 Budget,Hunt announced it would remain in place until March 2029because the continuing war in Ukraine was extending energy firms' windfall profits. The new Labour government saidit would increase the levy to 38% on 1 November,external. The tax will remain in place until 31 March 2030, unless - as originallyset out by the previous government- oil and gas prices drop below a certain level for six months. A separate levy was also brought in on ""extraordinary returns"" from low-carbon electricity generating firms in the UK. Larger operators started payingthe Electricity Generator Levy,externalon 1 January 2023. It was hoped this would raise about Â£14bn over six years. Among the UK energy giants, BP reported a record profit of $27.7bn in 2022. While this fell to$13.8bn in 2023, it was still the firm's second highest annual profit in a decade. Shell's profits of $39.9bn in 2022 were the highest in its 115-year history. Its 2023profits were $28.2bn. BP says its UK businesses account for less than 10% of global profits, while Shell makes about 5% of its revenue in the UK. Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea were already taxed differently before the levy was introduced In the financial year 2022-2023, the first year of its operation,the levy raised Â£2.6bn,external. In the following 12-month periodit raised Â£3.6bn,external. BP said its North Sea business paid $2.2bn in UK tax for its North Sea operations in 2022, of which $700m was due to the levy. In 2023 it paid $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn), including $720m under the levy. Shell said it paid Â£178m in UK windfall tax for 2022. In 2023, it paid Â£1.1bn in overall tax in the UK, Â£240m of which was a result of the levy. Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea are taxed differently to other companies. They pay 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that. In contrast, other firms with profits over Â£250,000 a year pay 25% corporation tax. When the windfall tax is added, it means the overall tax rate faced by oil and gas companies operating in the UK is 75%, rising to 78% in November. However, oil and gas firms have been able to reduce the amount of UK tax they pay by factoring in losses or spending on things like decommissioning North Sea oil platforms. BP,externalandShell,externalboth received more money back from the UK government than they paid in tax every year from 2015 to 2020 (except Shell in 2017). Energy firms have also been able to reduce the amount of windfall tax they pay through certain investment allowances. However, the government has said it will remove some of these allowances from 1 November. Further details on the changes to the windfall levy will be set out in the Budget on 30 October. What might be in the Budget? The industry body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said the proposed changes to the windfall taxwill sharply reduce investment in the sector, putting thousands of jobs at risk. OEUK says the expected tax paid by oil and gas producers would ""increase in the very short term"" by Â£2bn, and would later result in a Â£12bn loss. In August, 42 companies wrote to the government toexpress their ""grave concern"" over the changes. The Treasury said the government was committed to a ""constructive dialogue"" with the oil and gas industry about the levy. But it also said it wanted North Sea oil and gas producers ""to contribute their fair share towards our energy transition"" away from fossil fuels. Where does the UK get its energy from?

Parents left without childcare as providers shut,"The number of childcare providers in England has been dropping steadily since 2015 Parents are being left without childcare as nurseries shut at short notice due to financial pressures and staff shortages. The Pregnant Then Screwed campaign group said it had been ""inundated"" with messages from parents whose local nursery had closed suddenly. Nurseries are facing increased energy, food and staffing costs, as well as struggling to recruit. The government said it was increasing funding paid to childcare providers. But the Early Years Alliance, which represents around 14,000 providers in England and also has its own nurseries, said the sector was facing its worst crisis in recruitment and cost increases in 20 years. 'It shouldn't be a choice between baby and career' Summer childcare costs so high 'I'd be paying to work' Gabrielle Drake said she was left in a ""mad scramble"" to find a new nursery for her 13-month-old son when his current provider closed for good overnight. Parents received an email on 5 August saying the nursery would be permanently closing at the end of the day as the company was ""undergoing a restructure"". Gabrielle and her partner both work full time and they were unable to find a new nursery at such short notice, so now have to rely on her parents to look after their son for a month. The 35-year-old from Leeds has managed to find a new nursery for September. She contacted 20 local nurseries but only four replied to say they had spaces, two of which are brand new so do not have Ofsted inspection reports yet. As her son was not attending nursery the day it closed they were unable to collect his belongings, including clothes and nappies. She said the closure was also disruptive for her son who had settled in well at the nursery and made friends. Welcome Nurseries, which owns the branch, went into administration earlier this month - six of its 32 sites were closed as part of a sale. Linda Mills, head of childcare at Welcome Nurseries, said the company took the ""difficult decision"" to close the sites as they had very low occupancy and together with rising costs ""this meant they were not sustainable"". Where possible, she said children had been able to access the company's other nurseries and in the areas most affected families were being helped by local authorities. Gabrielle's local nursery offered no alternative provision after it closed suddenly Harriet Butterworth, managing director at Cottontails nursery in Warrington, said she was worried she would be forced to close because of increased costs. The nursery is running at a loss and has already raised fees twice this year to cover increased staffing costs. Ms Butterworth said she had increased salaries for her lowest paid workers by 12.5% to help attract and retain staff. ""We're competing with the likes of Hermes, Amazon, just basic retail jobs, who are paying these really high hourly amounts, with much more flexible hours,"" Ms Butterworth added. She said the nursery was also facing increased food and energy costs, with her gas and electricity bill more than doubling to hit Â£9,000 for the last quarter. The nursery has been forced to turn off its boiler and cut down its use of the gas oven to save energy. Harriet Butterworth says she is only able to recruit staff by increasing pay Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said in his 20 years working in the sector he had ""never witnessed such a crisis in terms of recruitment and retention and cost pressures"". He blamed underinvestment in the sector by the government, as well as increased costs for things like energy, food and staff. Parents of three and four year olds in England are entitled to15 free hours per week of childcare. Working families may also be eligible for an additional 15 hours per week of funded early education. But Mr Leitch said this allocation was not adequately funded by the government, leaving providers to make up the shortfall. He said many providers were forced to increase fees for other parents to offset the cost as a result. A survey of 2,000 early years providers in March,externalfound 30% were currently operating at a loss, while 34% said they expected to be in 12 months' time. Three years ago the alliance operated 132 pre-school settings but it now only has 65, with more than half closing for financial reasons. The number of childcare providers in England has been falling steadily since 2015, with the number of nurseries and pre-schools dropping by 196 between August 2021 and March this year,according to inspector Ofsted,external. However, Jonathan Broadbery, from the National Day Nurseries Association, said anecdotally the situation had got worse since March, with nurseries under increasing financial pressure. In April, there was an increase in the minimum wage and National Insurance contributions paid by employers, while temporary business rates relief introduced during the pandemic ended in England. Mr Leitch said nurseries were also struggling to recruit, as people are leaving the sector ""in their droves"" for better paid jobs because they felt ""exhausted and undervalued"". Many businesses have increased salaries as a result but this was not financially sustainable, he added. Others have been forced to reduce hours or close suddenly because of a lack of staff. Pregnant Then Screwed said it had received more than 60 messages in recent weeks from mothers whose child's nursery had closed at short notice. The group's campaigns manager, Lauren Fabianski, said many were worried about how they would be able to work without childcare. She added that some nurseries were booked-up until November next year, so it was difficult to find somewhere with spaces. A government spokeswoman said it had spent more than Â£4bn in each of the past five years to support families with the cost of childcare and it had not seen a substantial number of parents unable to secure a childcare place. She added that the government had also announced additional funding for local authorities to increase the hourly rates paid to childcare providers and it was increasing funding to support employers with their costs.

How will I get the cost-of-living payments?,"Eight million people are receiving the final instalment of cost of living payments totalling Â£900. Those on means-tested benefits including universal credit will be paid directly, without the need to make a claim, by 22 February. However, the payments have not tackled the extent of the financial problems many people face, a group of MPs says. It is available to households who receive these benefits,external: universal credit income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance income support working tax credit child tax credit pension credit The final instalment of Â£299 follows two others last year, of Â£301 and Â£300. To qualify, people need to have claimed a benefits payment between 13 November 2023 and 12 December 2023. Those who received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates are also eligible. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated. An estimated 850,000 pensioner householdsdo not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments. People are not eligible if they receive new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit. Anyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, orreport it here,external. The payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their National Insurance number, followed by DWP COL. The 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits have the reference HMRC COLS. Cost of living payments do not affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive. Households thatreceive the winter fuel payment,external- which is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra payment of between Â£150 and Â£300 during the winter. Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits. A Â£150 payment was also made to up to six million people receiving disability benefits, between 20 June and 4 July. All cost of living payments go straight into recipients' bank accounts.

It said payments were not enough for those with extra costs associated with their disabilities. Disability charity Scope says some people cannot afford to power vital equipment. There was particular concern for some larger families. The report said the payments have had an important impact, but the system was relatively unsophisticated, meaning some of those in need slipped through the net. It said that in future, the government should consider increasing benefits rather than giving ad-hoc payments.
